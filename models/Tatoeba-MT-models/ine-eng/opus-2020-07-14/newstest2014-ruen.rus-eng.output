In China and in the area of two men killed themselves
In the past, one of those involved had already attempted suicide.
On 30 October, about 1-00, in the village of Lugowi, the man of birth committed suicide by an increase in his place of residence in 1947.
It's known he's been trying suicide before.
What led the man to such a move is not known.
On 31 October, from 11 to 50, he died in the place of residence by raising a 41-year-old man, a resident of Kineshma.
No evidence of violent death has been found, reports the press service of the IMO "Kineshemski".
Do you have a black box in your car?
While U.S. road designers are trying to find money for the repair of the exhaust system, many start to see a solution in a small black box that is exactly on your car's gearbox.
These devices, which track every passenger miles and transmit this information to officials, are at the centre of a controversial attempt to modernize the old American highway financing system undertaken by Washington and the state planning authorities.
Usually, the busy roadside planning arena has suddenly produced intense debates and colouring alliances.
The Liberians have joined environmental groups in lobbying the Government to grant the right to use small boxes to track the number of miles you travel and perhaps even where you travel them, and then use this information in the preparation of tax accounts.
A chaplain's move in shock.
The American Union of Civil Liberties is also deeply concerned and raises a number of issues relating to private life.
Although the congress cannot yet agree, whether to continue or not, a number of states are not being gathered.
They are thinking about how they can move to a system where drivers pay for every mile of the road they travel.
Thousands of motorists have already taken these black boxes for testing, some of which have a satellite tracking function.
This is really necessary for our country.
“This is not the question that we may have the right to choose from,” said Hassan Ihrat, Executive Director of the Association of Governments of Southern California, who is preparing plans for the start of monitoring by the authorities of the state of miles passed by each California car by 2025.
There will be a change in how we pay these taxes.
There's technology for that.
The need for this is compounded by the lack of funds from the Government Fund for the Construction of Roads, financed by taxes paid by Americans on motor vehicles.
Americans don't buy as much gas as they used to.
The cars are more than a mile away in one gallon.
The federal tax itself, 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased by 20 years.
Politicians do not want to increase the tax by even one cent at high prices on petrol.
“The fuel charge simply cannot be kept,” said Li Mannic, an expert on transport policy at the University of Minnesota.
It has recently installed 500 tracking devices to test the wrong pay system.
“This will be the best alternative in the long term,” he said.
It's called the wrong user payment.
It is not surprising that this idea attracts urban liberals, as tax will help to change the nature of travel to reduce road load and greenhouse gas emissions, for example.
The planned bodies in California are considering this system in the development of strategies to achieve the targets set by the ambitious laws of that state in the fight against global warming.
However, a member of the House of Representatives Bill Schuster (Republic, Pennsylvania), Chairman of the Chamber of Transport Committee, said that he also considered the system as the most viable long-term alternative.
The Free Market Bonds in the Reason Fund are also in the rush of making drivers pay for every mile.
“It’s not just a tax that’s going to go into the black hole,” said Adrian Moore, Vice President of Political Affairs Reason.
People pay directly for what they get.
This movement is also supported by the two former U.S. transport ministers, who in 2011 called on Congress to move towards a wrong pay.
Last year, the US Senate approved a $90 million pilot project involving some 10,000 cars.
However, the leaders of the House of Representatives rejected this proposal because of the fears of rural legislators representing voters who often have to travel a lot of miles in their daily lives to get to work or to the city.
Several states and cities, however, go on their own.
The biggest enthusiasm is shown in the state of Oregon, where 5,000 drivers are attracted to participate in the largest experiment in the country.
These drivers will soon pay the state for a mile away instead of a gas tax.
The pilot project has already been completed in Nevada.
It is being considered in New York.
Illinois will try it on a limited basis with the participation of trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes transport departments of 17 Eastern Coast States (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), examines how they can make these changes.
This concept was not universally recognized.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteers had recently been equipped with these devices, drivers were concerned that the Government could follow each step.
“The concern about the “great brother” and such things is a major problem,” said Alaudin Khan, who is responsible for the strategy and management of the state transport department of Nevada.
It wasn't what people wanted.
When tests went full, the United States Civil Liberties Office in Nevada warned on its website: “It will be very difficult to turn these devices into full-scale tracking devices”.
There is no need to create a huge, massive technological infrastructure that will inevitably be expanded to keep records of the daily movements of individual citizens.
Nevada is one of several states where difficult research is being carried out on low-cost technology, which would allow the state authorities to take care of the traffic miles, but without information about the location and time.
If you can do that, Han said, society will feel calmer.
The search for this technology has led some state agencies to a small young company in California called True Mileage.
Originally, the company was not involved in the collection of state taxes.
She was trying to go to a developing car insurance market where drivers paid on the basis of the run.
But the devices it tests attract road designers because they do not use GPS and provide a limited amount of information periodically loaded using a modem.
"People will be more inclined to do this if you don't track their speed and position," said Ryan Morrison, Executive Director True Mileage.
There were several major errors in some of these state pilot programmes.
There are far less expensive and less demanding ways to do so.
In Oregon, projectors experiment with the provision of different options to drivers.
They can choose the device with or without GPS.
Or they can totally refuse the device by choosing to pay a fixed fee based on the average number of miles that all residents of the state pass.
In other places, they hope to sell the idea of a cautious public by making devices do more, not less.
In New York, transport officials are trying to develop a tax-paying device that will also be charged on parking counters, provide insurance payments, and collect a pool of real-time speed data from other drivers that drivers could use to avoid leaks.
“ Automobiles will be attracted to the benefits they are offered,” says the city design paper.
Some transport system designers, however, wonder whether all the wrong pay talks are simply a huge deterrence factor.
In the city transport commission on the San Francisco Bay, officials said that the congress could simply overcome the bankruptcy of the Trust Fund for the Construction of Roads by raising taxes on petrol.
An additional one-time or annual tax could be taken from drivers of hybrid cars and other persons whose vehicles do not use much petrol to pay their fair share.
"There is no need for radical surgical intervention, when all you have to do is take aspirin," said Randy Rentschler, director of the Legislative and Public Relations Commission.
If we do so, hundreds of millions of drivers will worry about their private lives and many other things.
EU prepares support for Ukraine in the event of economic pressure from Russia
The European Union has a contingency plan for providing Ukraine with gas, as well as for reaching an external credit agreement with IMF, if Russia will take any action in response to the possible signing of an association agreement between the EU and Ukraine at the Vilnius Summit.
The IMF is negotiating standby loans, and another EU official directly participating in the negotiations added that their objective was to conclude an agreement in the near future.
In addition to the potential loan from the IMF, Ukraine can receive 610 million euros from the EU itself.
The analysts interviewed by Reuters are suspected that Ukraine and IMF are able to overcome the long-standing differences in funding conditions.
He did not believe in the possibility of reforming the aid required, and the international S&P rating agency, which reduced Ukraine's sovereign rating to one degree on Friday, to "B" from "B".
However, EU representatives say that IMF can show flexibility in credit terms, taking into account Ukraine's circumstances.
In addition to the EU's financial support plan, the country has a spare option to provide Ukraine with gas, which is a major part of its supply from Russia.
Maybe it's going to be a gas from the North Stream or a reverse from Slovakia.
The latter, according to officials, is the most possible and acceptable way in the event that Russia “is insulated” Ukraine.
Analysts believe that this type of reverse delivery to Ukraine can only be used for a few weeks and will likely lead to a reduction in supplies in other regions.
"There are negotiations between EU countries and Ukraine on how to create favourable conditions for Ukraine to import gas from other sources rather than from Russia, or from the same source, but on other routes," added the Reuters source.
Russia outside the fight against urban car pollution
Attempts to address major urban transport problems have been seen in most megapols of the world since the second half of the 20th century.
Usually, it was either about reintroduction and expansion of the highways or the attempts to reduce the demand for car travel, the number of cars and the time they were used.
Singapore is a widely known example of a sharp rate of increase in the number of private cars and the right to purchase them is purchased in auctions.
His price can be twice the price of the car itself.
European cities, including London, have introduced a fee for entering the city centre.
In Germany, for example, in Hamburg and Stuttgart, so-called green zones are introduced, where only high-quality cars (including biofuels or electric cars) are allowed to enter.
The Beijing Environmental Protection Agency, for example, adopted in 2012 a "five-year clean air plan" of around 250 billion Yuani (about $40 billion).
According to the Director of the Department of Transport Pollution Control, Beijing Li Kunscheng, the main goal of five years - reducing leading air pollutants by 20 to 35 per cent by 2017, increasing the number of private cars to up to 6 million (now 5.2 million) and increasing the fuel use by one vehicle by no more than 5%.
According to the agency, traffic in Beijing is now responsible for 22.5 per cent of total air pollution.
Among the main measures of the programme are the limitation of the use of road transport and the introduction of additional taxes on road owners.
In addition, the "green five-year-old" measures include an accelerated transition from the rest of the country to European fuel standards, the introduction of a local eco-standard system and the marking of cars and fuel, the restriction on the entry of cars into the central part of the city, the prohibition on the use of obsolete vehicles (including the establishment of incentive financial programmes for the replacement of old cars into hybrids or electric cars), the development of electricity (including public and public transport), the development of public transport (including high-speed).
Beijing ' s car innovations also include a ban on all private cars to move within the fifth transport ring (all of which in the PRC capital) one day a week (the corresponding information in the vehicle number) and the issue of registration marks for cars on the basis of the lottery (e.g. in 2011, for example, the first year of the lottery, the total number of private car registration permits in Beijing was only three in 2010).
According to the current 2012-2020 environmental protection programme, the number of cities with high and very high air pollution should be reduced to 128 (in 2012 it was 138).
According to the Ministry, in 2011, 41 per cent of all emissions of pollutants in the city's atmosphere were on “transit sources”.
In Moscow, for example, emissions from cars are ten times higher than industry, and in St. Petersburg at nine times.
In the RF, there is only a beginning to think about the possibility of limiting the regulation of cars on the streets of the city.
The Director of the Institute for Transport and Transport Policy of the United States of America, Michael Blinkin, believes that administrative and fiscal measures aimed at repressing the demand for car travel are, of course, unpopular and can only be taken by society on the basis of their more complete universality.
In the case of Moscow, there is a unique problem with the structure of its car, where there are two classes of people who are less sensitive to any regulatory impact - both official and personal cars, as well as those of "privileged" users with a total number of at least 200 thousand (about 5% of the total number of Moscow cars).
During the days of the ECOM city centre in St. Petersburg, a study was prepared to analyse the balance of urban areas between housing, road cover and road transport.
The main findings of the researchers: the city centre provides roads twice as much as required, and most of the motorists living in the centre do not use cars every day, leaving them on the parks for a long time or just on the streets.
As a result, it is proposed not to build parks, not to expand the car storage facilities, but to reduce the part of the road (to make the streets more friendly for pedestrians) and to limit the use and location of personal transport within the territory of the security zone of the historic centre (a total area of approximately 3212 ha, covering a number of central areas of the city).
Unauthorized street trade in Volde will increase once
According to the city authorities, the increase in fines would help to order Vold and free the streets from natural tents and bars.
Most street traders do not pay taxes, and the products they produce often do not undergo adequate sanitary controls.
This means that the health is threatened.
Thus, the lower fine for citizens for unauthorized trade from November will increase by six times, from 500 rubles to 3000 rubles, reports the government's press service.
Goldman Sachs warned about risks to the Russian economy
Goldman Sachs warned of the growing risks to Russia's main driver of fragile economic growth - consumption.
This is primarily a non-payment crisis for unsecured consumer loans and mass reductions of workers.
Our main concern now is not that growth has slowed down, but rather that it is the structure of growth.
He has recently been completely driven by consumption, which is almost free of traffic," said the chief economist Goldman Sachs on Russia Clemens Grafe, presenting a quarterly report yesterday on the Russian economy.
The nominal wage growth in Russia is now about 10%.
When inflation is 6 per cent, it will be able to provide future consumer demand at around the current level, waiting for Goldman Sachs.
But the profitability of Russian companies is falling, so it is likely that they will focus on optimizing staff costs.
Today, we see a significant increase in GDP: if wages grow by 10%, GDP is only by 2%, Mr. Graffe explained.
The companies faced a reduction in profitability.
If it does not grow, it can lead to unemployment and unemployment.
The Russian business cannot raise salaries, says the chief economist Barclays Capital for Russia and the CIS Vladimir Pantushin.
Unemployment close to historical minimums, competition for high workers.
Employers have to raise salaries in order to change or retain current staff.
Russia's demand for support is being sustained by a very rapid increase in consumer credit.
Mr. Grafe said that because of the very high rates of consumer loans, this type of credit did not have a multiplier effect on the country's economy.
"The benefits for the economy from growing consumer credit have not been seen, money is not spent on the economy, and money is returned to the same banks as interest payments," said the economist.
But the other problem is that Goldman Sachs is expected to grow over unsecured loans.
They are largely taken by poor people to provide for them.
Interest on such loans is high.
As a result, they do not return more often," said Mr. Graffe.
Therefore, the second threat to growth in Russia is a possible non-payment crisis for unsecured loans.
The Director of the Banking Institute of the U.S.E. Vasilio Solodkov has already seen signs of the emerging banking crisis.
Small credit organizations, without access to the financial resources available to gosbanks, were forced to attract the population by high percentages.
In response, the gosbanks went to the battlefield and became less credit rates, and the economist continued.
Small credit institutions cannot issue loans under the same percentages, otherwise they will have a negative margin of interest.
If the gosbanks do not give up, Russia is in danger of a complete banking crisis, Vasili Solodkov believes.
The withdrawal of a number of banks in the last few weeks is considered by the president of the mass collapse.
"The banks themselves will not cope with this situation: the system of investment insurance has not initially been addressed to the systemic crisis," warns the head of the institution.
But consumption growth will slow even without a pay crisis, and will depend on the investment, due to the refusal to index salaries of the employees and the military in the current version of the draft budget.
Part of the impact on consumption will be mitigated by the freezing of the tariffs of natural monopolies (and as a result, inflation reduction).
But only in part: if investments do not grow (and there is no requirement for this to be seen in the paper), consumption growth will still be slow, confident in Goldman Sachs.
Vladimir Pantušin of Barclays Capital has not yet seen a prerequisite for the implementation of pessimistic scenarios.
"The main risk is still a drop in oil prices," he says.
According to him, Russia's economy would start to decline at a price of less than $90/barr.
Goldman Sachs also noted that the CB has not yet been able to reduce interest rates in the economy.
A paradoxical picture is observed: inflation has fallen and banks have started to raise rates.
This may mean that they did not believe the CB that announced the transition to inflation target," Clemens Grafe said.
The Bank ' s interest policy does not affect market rates, only affects interbank credit rates.
"For the CB, it's a breach of all hope," said Clemens Graffe.
Banks not used to credit the economy, but to manage their liquidity
As the rate declines, the exchange rate changes immediately, it means that the funds are trying to go into speculation against the rubble.
"In the early days or later, the CB will realize that this strategy is not working," said Mr. Graffe and recalled that the State is planning to leave the rubble in "free navigation" by the end of 2015.
But either earlier or raise the key rate of CB (5.5%), he believes.
According to him, the fluctuation rate is now artificially 10% higher.
There's only one way I'm going, a weak one, and it's the expert's conclusion.
But if the CB is in the financiers, even the shadow of doubt that the elimination of the currency corridor is not a part of the policy of weakening the rubble, it can break the rubble much stronger.
A second assembly of the peoples of the South Ural took place in Chelsea.
The Forum is dedicated to the Day of People's Unity, the 400th anniversary of the restoration of the Russian State and the 20th anniversary of the adoption of the Constitution of Russia.
Delegations from all cities and areas, representatives of national and cultural associations, religious denominations, legislative and executive bodies participated.
The course of the forum is aimed at strengthening international agreement.
We can set an example here not only for other regions but also for other countries.
We don't have any differences or differences.
We live in full mutual understanding," says Feofan, a micropolit Chelabine and Zlatoustowski.
A number of issues, including the formation of patriotism, have been addressed during the meeting.
As a result, the Assembly adopted a resolution.
The informal part of the forum continued in the opera and ballet theatre.
The exhibition of national-cultural associations in the Chelabean region was opened here.
Snowden is ready to "co-operate" with Germany on the issue of US intelligence
Edward Snowden, a U.S. intelligence revealer, said he was willing to go to Berlin to give a testimony to the German Parliament if the US National Security Agency and its Director, Kit Alexander could not answer questions about their activities.
The German MP Hans-Christian Strwinhele met with Mr. Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he was given asylum to discuss his testimony in Germany.
The letter from Mr. Snowden, who introduced the media in Berlin on Friday, said: “The outcome of my efforts was clearly positive, my Government continues to be inconsistency as a change and seeks to criminalize political statements by criminal charges that do not provide any protection”.
But speaking the truth is not a crime.
In his letter, Mr. Snouden said that he believed that the support of the international community could convince the Government of the United States to renounce criminal charges against him.
The charges filed by the U.S. Ministry of Justice include espionage and theft of public property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, German Minister of the Interior, told Time Online: “If Mr. Snowden is ready to speak to German officials, we will find ways to do so.”
The relationship between the United States and Germany was strained after allegations that the ANB had been listening to the phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Thomas Opperman, a member who led the parliamentary group in charge of research, said that if there was an opportunity to hear Mr. Snouden as a witness, “without risking him or destroying his relationship with the U.S.”, it should be used.
Mr. Strwindale, a parliamentary member of the Green Party of Germany, published his photo with Mr. Snowden on his Twitter.
During his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr. Strwindale said that, according to the lawyer of the former ANB contractor, Mr. Snowden could not return to Russia if he had left.
If Mr. Snowden had given a testimony in Germany, he would need assurances that he would be there “in security”, the MP said.
Mr. Snouden said in his letter that he had met with a “hard and constant” campaign of persecution that forced him to leave his home.
However, he said that he was thrilled by the world's response to “his political statements”.
Citizens around the world, as well as high-ranking officials, including in the United States, have considered the disclosure of a system of uncontrollably comprehensive evidence useful to society.
The letter contains a proposal to cooperate with the German authorities “when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation will be resolved”.
Frontier Airlines will take payment for the hand-held
Frontier Airlines plans to take from passengers up to $100 for carrying a handhold on their voyage.
Frontier Airlines plans to start taking up to $100 for a hand deposit and $2 for a coffee or a gas station, although their announcement on Wednesday stated that passengers would be able to leave the whole bank.
The new hand-held fee is distributed to the bags in the top luggage compartments, so the small bags placed under the seat will remain free of charge.
Frontier said it would take $25, if the collection was paid in advance, and $100, if the travelers would pay only when they went to the landing.
The Frontier Kate O'Malley said that the $100 salary should make passengers pay early.
"We don't want to pay for it," she said.
The airlines began to pay for the first and second baggage bags in 2008.
Passengers who try to avoid these charges are beating as much as they can, in a handcuff that is placed in the upper luggage compartments, which is why these sections often do not have enough seats.
Collections are one way to make passengers carry less on board.
O'Malley said that this new collection really wasn't for making money.
The case is that Frontier's most loyal clients say that finding a place in the top luggage sections is becoming increasingly difficult.
Passengers who buy tickets on the airline site will not be required to pay.
This means that one passenger in turn on the Frontier trip can be able to carry the bag for free, while the next passenger in turn can pay $100 for the same bag.
O'Malley said that the modification of the procedures on the website and the Frontier registration staff was intended to ensure that passengers would know about the collection before they entered the landing.
The new Frontier collection for hand bets will not start before summer, although the date has not yet been set.
Passengers often complain about baggage and other charges, but airlines love them.
They claim that the handling of luggage is worth money, and the passengers who need this service must pay for it.
Many in Wall Street consider adding luggage to the sign that airlines take enough money to cover the costs of aircraft after several years of losses.
Most of them, however, were not involved in the collection of handcuffs.
Spirit Airlines Inc. introduced the first collection three years ago, and another discounter Allegiant Air followed her example.
The only other airline with such a collection is Hungarian Wizz Air, said the airline consultant, J. Sorensen, who is closely monitoring the additional collection.
According to its assessment in the December 2011 report, the manual budget is estimated to be $50 million per year.
Sorensen, former top manager Midwest Airlines, recently flew the Spirit flight, and he was curious that he would find out when passengers would meet the extraordinary Spirit collection by hand.
"The landing process was the most smooth of what I saw in my airline career," he said.
I was expecting to see a toothbrush and a dragon coming out of the landing.
The plane was flying, he said, "and the landing was fast."
Frontier should also be Spirit for $2 for coffee, tea, gas or juice.
Frontier stated that passengers who receive gas or juice can leave the whole bank and that the cash flow will be provided free of charge.
It will continue to be free of charge.
U.S. Airways had recently tried to pay for a drink in 2008, but had refused it seven months later, after the passengers began complaining and no other major airline followed her example.
Frontier's initiative to pay for a hand bet when passengers don't buy tickets directly from the airline is her last step to attract customers to their website.
The airlines pay online ticket vendors, such as Orbitz, from $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.
This gave all airlines the incentive to encourage passengers to buy tickets directly from them rather than to go to a tourist online agency.
However, Frontier went further in this area.
In September, it began to give twice as many bonus miles as a frequent passenger to customers who bought tickets through an online tourist agency.
On Wednesday, it cut the premium number of miles to 25 per cent of the mile of the trip.
Yes, a 1,000-mile trip from Frontier, purchased from an online tourism agency, would make it 250-mile.
In addition, passengers can choose a place in advance only if they buy tickets directly on the Frontier site.
Frontier has a loyal client base in her home town of Denver, but her business is getting worse and worse.
The discount was reduced by 9 per cent and the summer opportunities were reduced by almost 13 per cent in the first quarter, according to the financial results published by the parent company Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
The Republic is trying to correct Frontier's finances as part of the airline's sale.
AnB blames “internal error” rather than hackers for stopping the site
The Secretary-General of the National Security Agency stated on Friday evening that the termination of their site caused a few hours of technical failure, not hackers, as stated in the network.
“NSA.gov was not available for several hours tonight due to an internal error that occurred during the planning update,” the intelligence agency reported in an official e-mail.
The problem will be solved tonight.
Claims that a breakdown in work was caused by a distributed “remission” attack [DDoS] are not true.
Earlier this evening, the online server monitoring system registered that the ANB site was not working for at least six hours, and the site is still unavailable for some users.
ABC News reported earlier that the agency ' s internal secret network had been broken.
No confidential information was in danger, the representative said.
At least one online group of activists stated that it was responsible for finding out from the NGO site by DDoS attack.
DDoS attacks have been developed in such a way that the target site is affected by traffic until the servers are overloaded and the site is out of construction.
The hacker tactics are relatively simple, and attacks are not intended to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
The former super-secretary NGO, once known as the Non-Agency, has been at the centre of public attention in recent months and has been severely criticized after a series of disclosures about its extensive foreign and domestic programmes, all of which have been a response to the secret files of the NGO stolen from the agency and published by former member of the ANB Edward Snowden.
The growing controversy around the agency has led to so much that today's incident has been the result of targeted hackers.
The profit of Bombardier decreases with the drop in supplies and the number of orders on aircraft
Bombardier, a Canadian aircraft manufacturer, reported on Thursday a 15 per cent reduction in net income due to the reduced number of orders and delivery of aircraft in the third quarter and the problems with contracts in its railway division.
Bombardier, also located in Montreal, did not publish any data on its new CSeries flight pilots and did not provide any new information on whether ambitious plans for the entry of the aircraft into commercial operation would be implemented by next September.
After the first flight of an experienced aircraft, held about half a month ago, it only flew three more times, which raises questions as to whether the test phase is on schedule.
The results did not justify the projections and resulted in a decline of more than 8 per cent in the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerxen, analyst at the National Bank Financial, reduced his assessment on Thursday from “higher” to “medium” because of the belief that the increase in shares is limited in the next quarter or two.
“The desired reduction in airship supplies was generally predictable, we are certainly disappointed by the transport department’s incomes,” Doerxen said in a review of the fund market.
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders on CSeries as the flight test program continues.
However, if new orders are not announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more sceptical about the programme.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries family will allow it to take place in the lower price segment of the market where Boeing and Airbus are now dominated.
The first experienced aircraft was presented in March and the first flight took place in September after a few months of delay.
However, the firm orders for CSeries are not too much, 177, since potential buyers are waiting for the results of the summer tests to verify the company's allegations of fuel efficiency and the potential economy of the new liner.
There are now 403 orders and arrangements with 15 clients and operators.
The Chief Executive Director, Pierre Boduan, was confident that Bombardier would achieve its goal in 300 firm orders at the time the first aircraft was launched in commercial operation.
On Thursday, the leaders also assured analysts and media that the programme was moving forward.
“The aircraft test did not remain on the ground longer than expected,” Boduan said during the telephone conference, adding that ground tests and software updates were planned during the simple flight.
All manufacturers plan different tests.
We decided to take the first flight and stop updating, so we did.
This will take place throughout the summer test programme.
The second of the five test samples must be carried out in the next few weeks, and the rest of them will follow, as reported by the company.
However, the analysts are skeptical about the statement that the first client will be able to start operating the CSeries aircraft 12 months after its first flight.
Bombardier stated that it would assess the duration of the operation and provide new information within the next few months.
“This slow rate of summer tests – although apparently in line with Bombardier’s internal schedule – reinforces our view that entry into operation will be transferred to the first quarter of 2015,” Doerksen said.
In the third quarter, ending 30 September, the net income of Bombardier fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, of $172 million, or 9 cents per share, last year.
The adjusted share profit remained at 9 cents earlier.
The gross income has decreased slightly from $4.2 to $4.1 billion.
Analysts expected 10 cents' share and gross income $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The fourth world aircraft manufacturer reported that he had placed 45 aircraft over the quarter, which was less than the previous year — 57.
The total number of orders fell from 83 to 26 aircraft.
The air traffic commission portfolio amounted to $32.9 billion on 30 September, with no change since 31 December.
“The results in the aviation sector were consistent with our objectives, but a small number of orders are coming and the overall market conditions have become an unpleasant factor,” Boduan said.
The gross aerospace income fell by 13 per cent to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world's largest train manufacturer, reported that gross income in this sector increased by almost 11 per cent to $2.1 billion.
The portfolio of orders in the transport unit amounted to $32.6 billion on 30 September, a little higher than 31 December.
The income of the transport unit has been negatively affected by the performance of several major contracts.
The Guide stated that a new development plan would be presented in the fourth quarter.
The shares of Bombardier, which also announced that the principal financial director of Google Patrick Pichett will be in the Board of Directors, fell by 8.5 per cent to C$4.83 in the middle of the quarter.
The Brazilian company Embraer SA, the third in the world of commercial aircraft manufacturers and the closest competitor Bombardier, reported a 10 per cent reduction on Thursday.
Sony expects a lower annual profit
The Japanese electronics producer, Sony, having completed the last quarter with a net loss of 19.3 billion yen, or $197 million, has reduced the forecast for the current financial year.
Sony's results for the period from July to September 2013 were more disturbing than was expected to be related to the decline in demand for television, video cameras and personal computers of the Japanese corporation.
Sony's television business, a company in the 2nd quarter of the first three years of operating profit of 5.2 billion yen, has again fallen to 9.3 billion yen of operating losses during the reporting period.
Japan's consumer electronics market is experiencing severe times, especially due to lower TV demand.
And while competitors are trying to find a way out of a difficult situation, Sony continues to focus on the consumer segment.
For example, one of Sony's main competitors, Panasonic Corporation, has recently shifted emphasis on industrial components: companies' sales are growing at high rates, especially through car systems and clean technologies.
As a result of the end of the financial year, which will end in March 2014, Sony expects to receive 179 billion yen of operating income against the expected 230 billion yen.
However, according to Thomson Reuters, analysts assumed that this figure would be much higher and would amount to 221 billion yen.
He's trying to get out of the crisis, Sony's expanding the product line.
In the middle of this month, the sale of smart hours from the Japanese corporation has been announced, given a number of fashion functions, which will allow you to get rid of the need to deliver smartphones 100 times a day.
After Sony reduced the annual income and income forecast, the company's shares in opening stores in Tokyo lost more than 11 per cent in the morning, reducing to 1668 yen by one share.
Gene spoke as a stimulant of synapses education
Scientists from John Hopkins University and Mount Sinai Medical School discovered a protein that has enabled Foxp2 to perform its function by stimulating the formation of new neurons.
The study is published in Science, and its short content can be read on the magazine website.
Gen Foxp2 is the first known gene whose function is directly related to speech.
Its role was established in 2001 by the discovery of a family of a number of people who could not properly speak and sometimes not even understand each other.
Scientists found that members of the family had violated the work of the Foxp2 gene, but how it performed its function remained unknown.
In a new study, biologists have shown that at least part of their Foxp2 functions as an incentive for the education of new brain synapses related to speech formation.
He does this through another gene, SRPX2.
The latter was found as a result of the search for factors that stimulate synaptic education.
SRPX2 has been one of 10 such genes found by the authors, and only Foxp2 is responsible for its activity.
The fact that SRPX2 really affects vocalization has been confirmed by scientists in the mouse experiment.
When the animal activity of the gene was artificially reduced, they cried less in separation with the mother.
If gene activity has been restored, the frequency of sounds has also been restored.
Earlier on the mice, there was also a connection to the vocalization of Foxp2 itself.
Animals that were introduced to a human copy of the gene were more active and less frequent than normal mice.
Until now, however, scientists do not know whether the work of Foxp2 and, accordingly, their SRPX2 is linked to purely "mechanical" sound education or more delicate processes.
Lawyer with cocaine addiction, who warned the head of the criminal police investigation team, was imprisoned
42-year-old Basharat Diett transmitted information to the criminal authority of Nile Scarboro
The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug addiction would be exposed.
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Liverpool Royal Court.
A prestigious lawyer who told the drug baron about a major police investigation because he was afraid of disclosing his secret drug addiction was imprisoned for three years.
The 42-year-old Basharat Diett provided a secret information to the criminal authority of Nile Scarboro on the investigation of his drug trafficking activities after being threatened by his cocaine addiction.
A lawyer named Bas and convicted of a "big lawyer" was arrested at home in 2011, after a police operation on the Scarboro case, which he had previously filed in a drug-related court.
Officials noticed that 32-year-old Scarboro left three cocaine packets at a lawyer's home in the town of Blackburn County of Lancashire while it was at the dinner of a legal association with colleagues.
The result was that the Ditta “ regularly used” Class A drugs, after tests showed the traces of cocaine in his hair, on his paper and on credit cards.
During the eight months from January to August 2011, he attempted unlawfully to obtain information about the arrests of two persons under the command of Scarboro and one of his associates.
All four suspects were currently under police surveillance as part of a large investigation into the activities of the criminal organization for the sale of heroin and cocaine in Lancashire, Cambridge, Merciside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
They and 32 others were later in prison after the police had taken out a series of heroin and cocaine raids of £1.5 million as well as more than £200 thousand in cash.
The 42-year-old Dietta has provided information to criminals because of the fear that their cocaine addiction will be exposed.
Today, in the Liverpool Royal Court of Justice, Ditta, who works in the legal company Forbes Requestors, located in Blackburn, has been visited by the Crown following his confession of his guilt in two cases of intentional suspension of justice by a three-week court in the Liverpool Court of Justice.
He admitted to holding cocaine at one of the previous court meetings.
The disbanding of the lawyer took place after the police investigating the work of Scarboro found that he had regularly spoken to the Child on the phone since February 2011.
Two detectives followed the suspect and found out how he came to the home of the Dite in Blackburn and put 60 per cent of the drugs in a black cap for golf under the juicy box.
Soon after the transfer of the Scarboro, he was repeatedly summoned to the Dite, who was at the football stadium in Iwood Park, Blackburn Rovers.
The lawyer went home after the drugs, and nine conversations were held.
The court found that Dietta had regularly used cocaine after the tests had found traces of Class A drug in his hair, shirt and credit cards.
The child was later arrested, but he refused to use cocaine, said he was talking to the suspect dealer because he was his client, and insisted that their communication was a “advocative secret”.
At the time of his arrest, the Child took his wallet and tried to draw several credit cards, but they were all confiscated, and he also had a hair sample.
He said he had a home office in addition to his workplace, and his clients came to his house on legal matters.
However, it became known to the court that after important arrests, it had called on the largest parties to illicit drug trafficking, some of which he had previously represented in the court to tell them what the detectives knew about them.
In the indictment, Ann White said, "If anyone knows that the law should not be violated, then he is a criminal lawyer."
Mr. Dietta was accused of abuse of his position as a criminal lawyer, since he had become too close to certain clients.
The contact we're talking about is not just a drug dealer but a drug dealer who supplies his own lawyer.
Some of his talks would certainly prove to be fair, since he was their lawyer.
However, this has significantly exceeded the limits of the usual relationship between the lawyer and the client.
He had obstructed police investigations as strongly as possible to enable these individuals to continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Diett didn't read his profession, but he broke it.
He was too close to certain customers, in particular Scarboro, and allowed to doubt his non-interest.
The child did not admit his guilt and said, "If I were a corrupt lawyer that I am not, and I would like to share Mr. Scarboro's information, I would not wait 15 hours, I would do it immediately."
But after the meeting, Chief Officer Li Holstead of the Lankasira Police said: “Mr. Ditta has become a criminal criminal lawyer as soon as he has started to acquire drugs from organized crime representatives.”
His addiction to cocaine made it hopelessly complicated and vulnerable for the main participants of the criminal groups, who had commissioned him to obtain valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers should follow the highest standards of professional ethics and impress the public confidence and confidence.
Mr. Ditta betrayed that trust and tried to hide his profession.
Mr. Diett's case investigation has led the Lancasira Specially Dangerous Organized Crime Unit, which has already been sentenced to three cases of cocaine storage, and is now still preventing the exercise of justice, demonstrating our desire to achieve a fair punishment for criminals.
Let this matter serve as a warning to the criminals that no one is beyond the reach of the law.
We will find you and bring you to justice.
Sam Scarboro was sentenced to 14 years after he had admitted his guilt in a conversation to deliver heroin, cocaine and marijuana.
A further 35 persons involved in drug abuse were sentenced to 153 years for drug-related crimes.
On his site, Dietta arranged a discussion in the form of questions and answers in which he said that the work of his dream was a lawyer representing clients with a death sentence in America, the ideal companion for him after dinner — Mohammed Ali, and the motivation to work is inequality.
The stadium in Yaroslavle was not ready for the reception of 22,000 spectators, and police officers who were present at the RFSC meeting today.
They believe that the billing programme is over, about twice.
During the 1/16 match, the Russian Cup with Spartacus was operated by only a thousand stewards under a rule of nine thousand.
Spartacus patients had 2200 seats, i.e. 10 per cent of the capacity of the stadium, but according to the Moscow club, they were sold 5,000 tickets.
These data were published by the head of the KDK Arthur Grigorjánz.
The Americans listened to Japanese high-ranking officials
On Friday, 1 November, one of the representatives of American special services, who preferred not to reveal their names, said that the States had been listening to telephone calls from senior officials in Japan.
The person confirmed that there were several points in the rising sun in the country for hearing.
He noted, however, that the United States, Britain, Australia, Canada, New Zealand did not conduct intelligence against each other.
He said that this was the case during World War II when these countries were allies.
And here is Japan, as well as Germany, despite the union relations with Americans in the post-war period, as the NHK telechannel reported.
Officially none of the parties have yet commented on this information.
I recall news of the U.S. special service for the FWG Chancellor appeared last week.
According to the German journalists, the ANB has been able to listen to Merkel's phone for the last ten years.
The chancellor himself, according to some data, took notice of his interrogation very painfully.
She stated that the allies, whom she believed, were FWG and the United States for decades, such monitoring of the Government ' s head was unacceptable.
However, Edward Snowden stated that he was willing to share details of the phone interview with the German prosecutors.
Germany has specifically been in Moscow to meet with a former CIA staff member.
Basheria can exhibit grain on the market not before the beginning of 2014
In the course of public procurement interventions, Bavaria may exhibit grain on the market not before the beginning of 2014, the Minister of Agriculture of the Republic of Nikolai Kovalenko.
To date, market prices are such that they do not stimulate sales to the intervention fund.
As long as the price in the market is above and there is a demand.
"Possible grain will be placed on the market after the New Year," he said at yesterday's press conference.
The Minister recalled that in the current year, agricultural crops under the 2013 harvest had grown to 3.1 million ha, including seed crops to 1.7 million ha, which accounted for 3.3 per cent more than last year.
Under the 2014 harvest, there were 550 thousand ha (over 105 thousand ha) in the year 2012.
Increased areas under the humid wheat and triangular, the rose remained at the previous level.
There are no "British Circle" groupings in the MDGs to which Lepsa has been assigned in the United States
In the database of the Russian forces of the Bratsky Circle group, to which Washington attributed the singer Gregory Leps, it does not matter.
As “Interfax” was noted in RF law enforcement agencies, following media reports from the US Finance Ministry of Fines to the suspect lists belonging to the Eurasian Criminal Syndicate, all databases were checked, but no such grouping was found.
The dissemination of this information contributes to the maintenance of the myth of the so-called “Russian Mafia”, which is probably operating abroad, is considered in force.
"Even in the very name of the 'Bratian Circle', there is some element of secrecy, there is a hint of a secret bed.
"It all looks like a pirate action," said the agency's interviewer.
The U.S. Ministry of Finance announced on 31 October that it had entered its lists of suspects belonging to the Eurasian criminal syndicate "Bratski kruk" by Arthur Badaljan, Gregory Lepsveride, Wadima Ljalin, Sergei Moskalenko, Jacob Ribaliski and Igori Słakova.
The persons included in this list are suspected of being in contact with some of the Vladislav Leontiev and Gafour Rahimov, who are considered to be members of criminal groups and are in the U.S. sanctions lists since February 2012.
According to the American authorities, Gregory Leps "serves a courier for the delivery of money on behalf of Vladimir Leontiev".
At Grigory Lepsa's manufacturing center, they refused to comment on the charges of the United States to the singer, calling them "the board".
In 2011, the president of the United States, Barack Obama, referred to the "Bratian circle" as "essential transnational organized criminal groups" and commissioned the mine "to encourage and warn their global criminal operations".
The introduction of human resources into the blacklists of the American Mining is a ban on the blocking of its assets in the United States and the prohibition of business contacts with those living in the United States.
The scandal video went to the police
The head of Toronto Rob Ford, known for its scandalous and unreasonably unreasonable outputs, fell on the smoke of the creek.
The Canadian City Police stated that there was a video recording available and ready to start an investigation against the mayor.
He said he would not leave his post, reports CNN.
Information that the authorities have evidence of drug use by Rob Ford has appeared on the Toronto police site.
Bill Blair, head of local law enforcement agencies, held a press conference on this subject.
The sheriff said that he was not authorized to share with the public the staff, but that he was responsible for their existence.
According to Blair, the compromised Roba Forda video was discovered during an anti-narcotic raid held in the summer of 2013.
The Canadian press had already written about the existence of this video, but there was no confirmation until recently.
No comment was made by the mayor himself.
He's just saying that there's nothing to blame or to retire.
The video found by the police is one of the evidence in the case of a 35-year-old friend, Ford Alexander Lissie, accused of drug trafficking, extortion, illegal income, and a criminal dispute.
Sometimes Lisa performed the leadership of Robb Ford.
The city's inhabitants have long demanded retirement from their mayor.
He fought with journalists, appeared to be drunk, allowed himself to speak racist and sexist.
Assmann Beraten + Planen, Germany's Rostovaeuroinvest, has recognised Assmann Beraten + Planen as the winner of the tender for the selection of the projector.
The amount of the contract in Rostovaeuroinvest is not disclosed.
According to the OAS press, nine Russian and foreign companies participated in the competition, under the terms of the tender, the project should be prepared and sent to the expert in spring 2014.
The winner has to design a new passenger terminal at the airport, as well as infrastructure facilities, internal roads and elements for the well-being of the airport complex.
At the first stage of the construction, the interior area of the terminal will be 50 thousand sq m, and it will be further expanded as possible.
According to Rostovaeuroinvest information, the project documentation will take into account the prospects for the development of the airport complex: by 2025, the terminal will be able to serve about 5 million passengers and by 2035, 6 million passengers.
At the time of the tendering, the architectural concept of the Southern Air Force complex was established, developed by British company Twelve Architects.
The project of the main terminal building is the idea of an air bridge between Rostov-na-Donu and other cities of the world.
Assmann Beraten + Planen has experience in major projects, the company has designed terminals C and E International Airport Sheremetevo and a new airport complex at Kneviči International Airport in Vladivostok.
The International South Airport complex will be built in the East Asian Region and will replace the current growth of the airport, which will be closed and in the future integrated into the urban structure.
The start of the construction of the aircraft complex is planned for 2014, the introduction of all facilities for 2017.
Politicians in Turkey announced a hunger strike against the border wall with Syria
In mid-October, the authorities began building a separation wall in the Nusaib area of south-east Turkey.
Locals and representatives of the PMD procured party strongly opposed the construction.
The mayor of the border with Syria of the Turkish city of Nusaibin Iche Gekhan announced the famine, protesting against the construction of a separation wall on the Turkish-Syrian border, told RIA News in the press service of the Party of Peace and Democracy (PMD) on Friday.
The police have repeatedly launched protests.
Turkey's Mid-Mid Head Muammer Guller initially rejected the fact of the construction and then stated that the wall was being built to ensure border security.
"Mer Nusaibina Ayshe Hekhan, a member of the PMD, announced the famine, thus turning his protest against the construction of the wall into a death row," said the party's press service.
The mayor of the city believes that the construction of the wall is intended to isolate the Kurdish population from each other, and the Kurds crossed the border freely during the half-life.
"This is an inhuman situation with which Kurds never agree," is quoted as saying the party's representatives.
According to the press, on 7 November, a meeting against the construction of the separation wall is planned in Nusaibina.
Venezuela will set a currency course for tourists
Venezuela will introduce a special exchange rate for its national currency - the dollar for tourists.
This was reported by Bloomberg on 1 November with reference to the Government Decree.
Foreign travellers will be allowed to exchange the amounts equivalent to tens of thousands of US dollars per year.
Venezuela will also allow tourists to sell up to 25 per cent of the goods purchased in the country at the time of departure.
A specific rate for the dollar will be set at a later date.
In February, Karakas was forced to devalue the local currency to $6.3.
However, in the black market, one dollar is estimated at 57 Bolivarians.
Since the beginning of the year, the disease has lost almost 70 per cent of its value.
In September, inflation in Venezuela accounted for almost 50 per cent.
The Minister of Oil and the Vice-President of the Economy, Rafael Ramirez, said on 18 October that Venezuela had no plans to devaluate the disease.
According to the informal information brought by the agency, Karakas could nevertheless decide to reduce the national currency rate after the municipal elections in December.
The policy of withholding prices for products and goods of widespread consumption, as well as the high level of regulation of the Venezuelan economy, has led to a shortage of goods and the functioning of the black currency market.
In spring this year, the media wrote that Venezuela had a lack of toilet paper.
Andrey Belmach, director of the South, said that it was difficult to say how long it would take to find a new master coach.
This post became a vacancy after Sergei Schepelev resigned.
The resignation took place only a few hours ago, so to say how long it will take to find a new coach, I'm not ready, says ITAR-TASS.
Maybe a day.
Maybe a month.
We're studying all possible options.
The priority will be given to a Russian specialist.
I don't want to just find a coach, but a person who works at our club for a few years and gets some results.
The Kenyan press is distressed by the media provocative law
“This is a terrible place, and there are reasons for the question: what can not allow Parliament to destroy the independence of the judiciary in the future?”, the newspaper reported, calling the law unconstitutional.
“This law is very severe and punishable, and we reject it,” said Cyrus Kamau, director of Capital Group, CapitalFM's mother company, which includes one of Kenya's most respected independent radio stations and news sites.
He said that the new media judicial body “will always be biased, as it is a continuation of the Government” and that restrictions on content and advertising would harm the situation of Kenya in the global economy.
"I hope the President will listen to us, and we ask him to reject this bill and return it to his deputies," he said.
According to The Star, the new law would in fact allow the Government to “take the media with a dead hold”, and The Standard reported that democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya “have been hit seriously”, and criticised the bill as “draconovian”.
The adoption of the bill is part of the measures taken to strengthen national security after the September attack by Muslim terrorists at the Westgate Trade Centre.
Kenyan media have provoked the anger of the authorities by broadcasting surveillance cameras, where troops who have been sent to the scene of the attack are allegedly stealing a expensive mall.
In response to police chief David Kimayo, two journalists and a media officer were challenged, although the challenge was lifted following media mass protests.
Under the new edition law, up to 20 million Kenyan Shillings may be fined, and individual journalists, up to one million at an additional risk of being “exempted from the lists”, that is to say, to receive a ban on official journalism accreditation.
The court shall also have the right to confiscate the property of the offender if the fine is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, “even one fine is sufficient to paralyze the work of most FM radio stations”.
She also reported that these measures could have a devastating effect on the so-called “reliving blogosphere” of Kenya.
Politicians understand that by making the media shut up, they will be able to do everything they think they can without punishment.
“No one will ever know,” wrote National Mutuma Matthew, describing Kenya’s media as a key source of deterrence and balance in public life.
“The policies that have been put in place will tear the country apart and bring us back to our will and assembly,” he wrote.
Kenya's legislators were the target of public anger and in the past.
In May, they voted in favour of the abolition of the reductions appointed by the National Pays Commission and the restoration of their huge salary of some 532 thousand shillings per month, one of the highest in the world.
A new line of expenditure will be made available in the municipal payments - capital refurbishment of the house.
The nearest estimate for the standard two-room apartment from the new year will have to be paid from 100 to 400 rubles per month.
The Government of the region will determine the precise rules.
So when you get on the train, you put in a row of ladder cells or even replace the elevator, you'll decide.
This law was approved by the members of the regional court.
Vladimir Kluchnikov, President of the Voronez Region, said: "In this case, too, it is necessary to order: establish the order of the carremont house, accumulate funds from non-governmental companies - which we often register in Moscow, or in Orenburg, or elsewhere, it will be a State control over the expenditure of funds collected by residents for the repair of multi-quarter houses."
Under the control of the State, the construction is now on the left.
The law that protects the liars is a lie in the final reading.
The document was not born in an empty place.
In our region, four thousand people were injured by dishonest devices.
Most of the problems have been solved.
In fact, the new law sets out rights and responsibilities for all participants in the construction.
Vladimir Kluchnikov, President of the Voronez Regional Word, said: “It is not a secret that abuses have also begun in this area, as the same ones have fallen in the 98th year, and in the 2000s.
People started working on it to cover the lasaika, including the two laws.
Under Voronez, it was decided to build a temporary residence centre for foreign nationals to be deported.
The Regional Parliament adopted such a law not only under the auspices of the federation.
Even if you have problems with illegal migrants in the region.
So over the past year, over 100,000 foreigners were heard on migration.
But only every fifth made an official permit for work.
Where the others work and pay taxes is a big question.
Vladimir Kluchnikov, President of the Voronez Regional Word, said: "They have violated the law, but they are not criminals."
The court doesn't have to deport them, but they have to contain them somewhere.
Such a decision was taken by the Federation that, through regional funds, such sites would be equipped.
In the area of Voronez, it is the Old Olshank of the Semiluc region.
Well, the regional Parliament has recently granted new benefits to multi-child parents.
First, families with 5 and more children are completely exempt from transport tax.
In this case, the budget is lost 3.5 million - but as many as a multi-child parent.
Secondly, and this is the main, those who adopt the 3rd and smaller, will issue housing grants from the new year.
For each member of the family, the new law provides for 18 square metres, at a cost of 30,000 metres per hour.
The family, for example, of the six persons, the father, the mother, the child, and the three adopted.
For them, according to the regulations, the State acquires an area of 108 square metres, of 3 million 300 thousand rubles.
For the left bank or the South-West microregion, a completely acceptable option.
Well, you can buy a whole catheter at the high school.
Baumgertner appointed to the Uralkalia Board of Directors
The current Board of Directors of OAS Uralkali proposed a candidate for a new composition of the Council arrested in Minsk by the Director-General Vladislav Baumgertner, a Russian company.
Bamungertner listed 11 persons appointed to the new Board of Directors.
This list was prepared for the extraordinary meeting of shareholders on 29 November, which will determine a new composition of the Board of Directors by voting.
Baumgertner is currently under house arrest in Minsk.
In August this year, he was charged with abuse of office.
Later, however, the President of Belarus, Alexander Lucashenko, said at the press conference that Baumgertner's accusations were reclassified as "a theft".
Mat Dalton's Nephthemi Gater refused to comment on the care of Vladimir Crikunov as a teacher of the underprivileged.
Golkiper believes that the master coach Dmitri Balmin is a major player and is responsible for his duties.

I can only say that Dmitry Balmin will meet his obligations - I have no doubt about that.
The team enjoys great authority, and this young specialist is certainly looking forward to a great future.

The President of the Krasnoyar court was arrested and struck with a head
Unknown attacks on the President of the Red Cross Court, Vladimir Twoeconco, arrested him with a certificate.

U.S. Secretary-General: Several times "excessed" data collection services
The U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry acknowledged that, when collecting data and polls, American services sometimes “were too far away”, the politician noted that the media reported that the polling of 70 million people did not fit in.
I assure you that innocent people did not suffer during this process, but the attempt to collect information was.
Yes, in some cases this was too far away and was wrong.
I recognize that, as the President also acknowledges... and we will follow that this does not happen in the future," quoted the Secretary of State of the AFP.
Italian interns take the road to young people
Italy's unemployment is a record.
The data published on the environment showed that 12.5 per cent of the country ' s population is now unemployed.
Such bad things did not last for the time of World War II.
Among young people, this figure has been raised several times.
40.4% of the population aged 15 to 24 are unemployed.
In the view of the Italian authorities, one of the solutions to this problem is the early retirement of older workers.
This experiment is already being carried out by the country ' s largest energy company, and the laws adopted allow regional authorities to provide part of the early retirement for trainees.
Italy, on the other hand, expects the common problem of the elderly for Europe.
And economists are not sure that a delay in the early rotation of staff is justified.
What will lead to the construction of TPU in Moscow
Every year, customs authorities promise to build ever-increasing transport and transit bridges.
By 2020, it is planned to introduce 255 TPUs.
As the project is being discussed, our correspondent understood it.
A few months ago, the Arbatsko-Pakrovi metro station was built.
The signature stated that the transport-residual unit was being installed.
All of this was very strange, because near Smolen, no land transport is stopped and can therefore be moved on.
In order to reach the nearest trolleybus stop in the garden ring, it is necessary to surpass some 130 metres, including the ground passage through the Carmanic Peninsula.
It's almost all over now.
Disappeared a flower lare, a demounted paper stand, and the asphalt was replaced by a brush before the entrance.
That's all the transport.
Transport-passengering bridges are flat and capitalized, as explained in the press service of the capital transport department.
Capital TPUs are not yet available.
The flats include the construction of parks, the conclusion of commercial facilities that prevent passengers from moving, the creation of small architectural forms and well-being.
In fact, flat-duty TPUs are not even occupied by transporters, but professionals from the capital repair department of Moscow.
The transport industry is not necessarily a complex structure, explains the Director of the Institute of Transport and Transport Policy of the Higher Economic School of Michael Blinkin.
Sometimes enough covers over the head and the table to warn of the time of arrival of the transport.
For example, at the Yasenevo subway, they recently opened a full-fledged flat resuspension plant.
Let's leave without a hint, but with a pick-up park and a table indicating when the bus arrives.
But in pursuit of the number of officers, they record everything we do.
In 2011, Mary planned to build for all 151, 59 of them with capital construction.
Now there are up to 255 TPUs in plans by 2020.
Most of them promise to surrender this year.
While there is no quality criteria for the development of TPUs in the city, Alexander Morozov, co-chair of the State and Transport Organization, notes.
The number of objects is reported, but the quality of transplants on each of them is often deteriorating.
The criteria, in the opinion of the expert, must be two: firstly, reduction of the transfer time, secondly, convenience.
First of all, it is possible to change the type of transport without going under the rain.
In Moscow, however, the TPU is being installed at the same time.
A bright example of the VDNH subway.
Earlier, beautiful buses from the Jaroslav Shos had arrived in the camp before the main entrance to the HVC.
Their stops were now transferred to the opposite side of Jaroslavka on the street of the Cosmonauts.
Far from the subway, far away from the monoreel, so close to the homes.
Given that the people did not want the car under the windows and complained at all possible instances.
The capital TPUs in Moscow have not been given up at once.
The first of them started building five years ago at the Planner Metro.
The project was designed to be exemplary.
And indeed, a sample of how the replanting of the purchase of investors is turned into a banal shopping mall.
No, there's a platform for buses, a bridge to not walk from the subway to the rain, and three floors to the parking lot.
True, the chemical trolleybus No.202 and No.203 in the Moscow TPU did not provide seats in principle.
The way I turned them away from the subway.
That's why there's still more places to trade.
There are only 32 shops, and there are almost everything from zoos to autosalon.
Well, in fact, who else on the bus would need to buy a new car on the way?
We've got when we're building a capital mine, why is there always a trading center?
The situation recently reached its logical conclusion when some of the drivers decided to put it under the market.
Now, on the third floor of the "Planner" TPU, there is a combat trade in the field of parked areas.
Fruits, spices, Chinese jeans, neurus words and guards who look ill at our photographer.
The replanter finally turned into a banker.
The thing is, there was a market at the Planner Metro before, but it was taken away.
And in the prefecture, the traders were sorry and left for the overcrowding park.
Still because of high prices there's always empty.
The funny thing is, the market was put in place to build on its site... a new flat-duty TPU.
That's the rocking.
In the "Kalujski" metro station, the distance from the metro bus to the bus was 50 meters, says Alexander Morozov.
After the construction of the shopping centre, the TPU was likely to be up to 170 metres.
To get on the bus, we have to go through the whole mall.
After 22 hours, when it closes, it goes to the open sky.
On the other hand, the constructions at Planner and Kalujska will soon be shown by the flowers.
In mid-September, the mayor ' s land-building commission adopted planning decisions for the first eight capital IDPs.
Four of them would be 25-year-old, without two or three underground jars.
The main sample will grow at the Tushino Metro, which will be 418.7 thousand square meters of the square.
Representatives of the Railways Department of the RJD, responsible for the construction of the subway, told reporters: in future multi-storey shops, hotels and apartments will be available.
In this way, officials are convinced that multi-jar parks should borrow from the third to the middle of the square.
Let's take the "national" garages for example.
For example, the 258-metre garage, recently built on the International Street, has an area of 8015 square metres.
So for a parking lot of 2.6 thousand cars at Petrosko-Razumiski, there's going to be about 80 thousand square.
It's less than a third of the truck they're going to build.
Let one or two floors go to every platform for buses.
It remains at least 150 thousand square metres of commercial property.
And for a minute, it's almost two Gums.
If the capital ITUs in stations and railways are built by railways, the remaining areas will be conquered by the metropolitans.
They also promised that there would be many " functional objects", including hotels, offices and even sports.
In fact, the city property department of Moscow has recently informed journalists that they are developing a draft decree that investors will be able to apply for a TPU site to officials directly.
No competitions.
Therefore, he prayed that transport issues for the city were a priority.
The ideal TPU is, for example, Garvard Station in Boston or "Spadina" in Toronto, confident Alexander Morozov.
There trolleybuses and trams descend underground at metro level and the distance from the subway to tram train is only 50 metres without going out on the street.
No more trade around.
But the Moscow officials are breaking in.
Either we're not going to build anything or we're going to waste 25 floors with offices and apartments.
Esser proposes to compare extremism with insulting patriotic feelings
In order to protect the patriotic feelings of citizens against the provocations and insults of Russia, the Fair Russia proposes to equalize the insults of patriotic feelings to extremist activities and punish them for five years in prison.
As reported in the report, such amendments to the legislation prepared by the mental committee on energy by Oleg Miheev have already been sent to the Supreme Court and the Government.
Under the patriotic feelings of citizens, the author of the amendment proposes to understand the emotional relationship of a person with a country whose citizen he is, in his love for that country, responsible for its fate, respect for its history and culture.
According to Miheev, domestic law provides sanctions for abuse of the formal signs of the State's flag and herb.
However, in the opinion of the MP, the protection of Russians whose feelings may be affected and insulting public symbols and other manifestations of disrespect for our country has not been sufficiently worked out in Russian law.
As an example, it provides an annual panel discussion on the Day of Victory, where some media individuals allow themselves to question the heroic performance of the people of the USSR in the fight against fascists.
In the wake of the main public holiday - the Day of Victory on 9 May - the current vacuum is being developed annually.
In the atrocious and "alternative view" of history, some publicists argue that, unfortunately, cultural Germans did not win the Soviet Union!
I consider it absolutely unacceptable in a country where pride for history remains the main "spiritual strength" of the nation," Oleg Micheev regrets.
In addition, according to Micah, patriotic people in Russia are much more than religious, but the law penalizes the feelings of believers, and it is possible to insult patriotic feelings without punishment.
In the opinion of the national electorate, it was necessary to compare the insults of patriotic feelings to extremist activities and to prescribe appropriate punishment in article 282 of the Penal Code.
The bill provides for a punishment for insulting patriotic feelings: from a 100-year sentence to a 5-year sentence.
The earthquake of 6.6 occurred on Thursday, 31 October, in the Kokimbo district of central Chile, by the Reuters agency.
The earthquake was located in the ocean at a depth of 10,7 kilometres and at a distance of 54 kilometres south-west of the city, which is specified by the U.S. Geological Service (USGS).
The scores were recorded at 20:03 on local time (3:03 1 November in Moscow).
Victims or caused by underground destruction are not reported yet.
Remember, Chile is in one of the most seismic regions of the earth, so there is no rare earthquake.
One of the most serious events occurred in 2010.
At that time, the earthquake of 8.8 magnitude and the tsunami caused more than 550 deaths in Chile and the destruction of 220 thousand buildings.
In addition, the most powerful earthquake in recent history has occurred in Chile: 9.5.
More than five thousand people were killed as a result of that natural disaster.
Dmitry Medvedev: Greenpeace will be considered fairly
Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev reported on Friday that the case of Greenpeace activists would be dealt with in strict accordance with Russian law.
France may have no doubt that the case will be dealt with in compliance with legislation, and we hear all the concerns.
"We can guarantee compliance with laws," said Dmitry Medvedev at a meeting with French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ero.
Among the detained activists, Greenpeace is a French citizen.
Pierre Pizanu, as well as the rest of the activists, has been accused of hooliganism.
"I asked if we could expect a humanitarian gesture against a detainee," quote Mr. Ero, RIA News.
"Our country cannot support activities that can harm the environment, no one is entitled to violate the laws," said Dmitri Medvedev in turn.
According to him, the activities of any structure that is trying to influence technologically complex and dangerous processes, including energy generation, are dangerous.
He stressed that these objects were “like a powder box”, and he recalled what happened in the Gulf of Mexico, conveying “RIA News”.
UN announces new poverty eradication goals
The United Nations must immediately begin its work on a new set of challenges for the replacement of the Millennium Development Goals, which were formulated 12 years ago to address poverty worldwide.
Australia ' s diplomats played a key role in the promotion of sustainable development goals for the MDGs, which expires in 2015, before the UN Summit on Sustainable Development, which began in Rio de Janeiro in the evening.
They were included in the outcome of the document, which would be signed by world leaders, including Ms. Hillard, during the summit.
UN Secretary-General Pan Ki-moon told the summit early in the evening that it was now time to “ become more of a national interest”.
“I am glad that the UN member countries have agreed to launch and monitor the process of setting universal goals for sustainable development,” he said.
They will build on our progress in achieving the Millennium Development Goals, and they will become an integral part of the post-2015 concept of development.
I will make every effort to use the powers given to me by my Member States to capture our vision of sustainable development goals that are based on the successful implementation of the MDGs.
Security concerns in Mozambique have increased as a result of the conflict of influential people
Under the view of them at the bottom of the statue of Samora Mashel, the President-in-Office of Mozambique, thousands of people gathered at the center of Maputo to scandalize the slogans of the world on one of the rare demonstrations here.
"We want the world back; we want stability," said Vanessa de Suss, executive director of the investment company.
Fearing the future of her country, she changed her business suit to a football suit decorated with the title “We Need Security” in Portuguese, and joined the crowd on Thursday at the Table of Independence.
Within two weeks, nearly daily reports of clashes between the government forces and Renama were received — one of the worst encounters ever since the end of the revolution more than 20 years ago.
Renom was once a well-known rebel movement that was supported by the white authorities of Rhodesia and then by the Government of South Africa apartheid in its efforts to destabilize the independent Government of the country.
After the 1992 revolution, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe that the country will soon be back to full-scale conflict, but recent developments have forced foreign investors and locals to be energized.
High rates for the fast-growing economy, as the opening of huge shale stocks of gas and coal sites in the north-west may attract more than $50 billion as investments in the next few years of companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the United States.
The ruling Frelimo party, leading political forces since 1975, and the Renamo party, blame each other for the tension that has been created.
The Renom Party claims that the Government has become the founder of the last clashes, attacking its members in the province of Sofala, the traditional area of Renom, on 17 October.
The attacks on the former rebels then intensified when government forces attacked the Renamo bases and tried to kill Afonso Dlakamu, a group leader, reported Financial Times Fernando Mazanga, a representative of Renamo.
The Government blames Renajam in initiating clashes, accusing the party of assaulting a soldier.
President Armand Gebuz tried to raise concerns about instability.
Gebusa stated to the French information agency that on Wednesday, Mr. Dlakama had felt “a failure”, wishing to use “all that remained of his strength to try to prove that he could impose his own decisions on the Government”.
Both Frelimo and Renamo insist that they want to avoid war.
However, the fears increased following the report that Mazanga had declared the rejection of the 1992 Peace Agreement by Renom.
He informed the Financial Times that he had been in breach of the Frelimo party agreement.
"Our goal is to return to the negotiations, but seriously," Mazanga said.
The previous negotiations between the parties had little to do with weakening the tensions that had intensified the series of clashes this year.
“These are the two influential people (Gebuza and Dlakama), who have met with their lips,” said Joseph Hanlon, lecturer of the Open University and expert on Mozambique.
None of them are a good negotiator and none of them are ready to go to the necessary appointments.
The Renamo Party, which is trying to achieve electoral reforms, has already stated that it will boycott the municipal elections scheduled for November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators interpreted this pressure as an attempt by the weakest movement to obtain government concessions and financial bonuses.
The proportion of the votes for Renanam has decreased since 1992, while the new Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM), which is based on the former member of Renanam, is expected to improve its indicators in these elections.
Mr. Mazanga said that Mr. Gebuz, who had to leave the post next year, wanted to destroy democracy in the country.
"He doesn't want multiparty democracy, he doesn't want transparent elections, he doesn't want peace because he doesn't want to leave the president," Mazanga said.
It is not clear what opportunities Renajam has, but it has already carried out destructive and intense attacks on police stations and cars on the key highway from the north to the south.
Most of the contacts took place in the province of Sofala, which is several hundred kilometers north of Maputo, but includes Beirut, a port that mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, use to export coal.
In June Rio stopped the use of railways for about a week after Renamo was threatened by an attack on the railway.
Mazanga was turned away when he was asked if Renamo would repeat that threat.
The Renamo party wanted to "warn the international community that things in Mozambique are not going very well," Mazanga said.
Insecurity has increased the dissatisfaction of the Government, and many people are also concerned with corruption, slow development and recent kidnappings, says Fernando Lima, head of the independent media company Mediacoop.
“People think that the government and the president are responsible for the future of the country, which should also find a solution to these problems,” he said.
Omar Sultuan, a part of the demonstration, said that people just want stability.
"No one cares about Renamo or Frelimo, they just want to restore the world, they want free access to the roads," he said.
The series of premiere films "Art Mainstream" will take place in Moscow
A series of Art Mainstream shows, where viewers will be able to see one Russian and four foreign films a few days before they are released, will take place in the Rolan theater from 1 to 5 November, reports the RIA News with reference to project organizers.
Opens the Art Master's program by the French director and actress Reim Kerichi, Paris at any price.
This is a story about a working in the French capital of the Maye model (Sama Kerichi), which is being deported to Morocco due to the problems with the visa.
In addition to Kerichi's film, viewers will also show a new picture of the famous South Korean director Kim Ki Duka "Mebius", a melodramatic bajopic by Oliver Hirshbigel "Diana: History of Love" (Diana) with Naomi Watts in the main role and the main film of the Cannadian Film Festival "Livn Adel" Abdelatif Keshish.
The only Russian actor, Art-Mainstream, will be the winner of the film by Alexander Veledin's Geographer Globus Propil at the "Kinotaur" Festival, on the basis of a single novel by Alexie Ivanov.
The main role - the promising failed teacher Victor Słjkin - was played in the film by Constantine Habensky, whose work was also noted by the award "Kinotavara".
Children should study myths and legends as “life patterns”, says the author.
The statements about Thor could show that “the great power cannot defeat the cunning,” and the legends of King Arthur show how important it is to have a dream.
Saying that many myths would appear to be “too wild, too scandalous, and in some cases too rude to teach in schools”, Crossley-Holland advocates the “adjustable selection” of older texts.
“I think it’s wonderful that myths and folklore are already part of education in America,” he said.
I voted for their introduction to the 20-year training programme.
He added that “excessive moralization” by authors and teachers “rejected interest” in children and the main ideas “sublimated” in entertaining stories.
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowolf from English-Saxon, and wrote the Norwegian Miffin Collection for Penguin and the British People's Stories, said: "You may have intentions, but you better keep them with you."
Perhaps a major difference between the adult author for adults and the adult author for children is the need to feel some hope.
Not that everything should be simplified or lead to a happy ending, but that there must be a clear understanding of good and evil.
And it must be sublimed; it's revealed through history, not clearly formulated.
Old principle: to show, not to tell.
A football fan that broke the window into the waiting room was detained in the Iranian area
At nine o'clock in the evening, on 29 October, the Georgian-Vornegian transport police withdrew from the passenger train of two football fans, natives of Moscow.
When they went to the favorite team, the guys on the way set up a drunk deboss on the train.
Young people were delivered to the police station at the police station on the day-to-day basis to prepare a protocol on administrative crime.
There the fanatics rebelled against their anti-social behavior.
The police formed administrative material on them and released them.
Young people bought tickets for the next train and were waiting for him to arrive at the station.
In the middle of the first night, the fans left the railway station, but one of them, a 22-year-old boy, suddenly returned and broke the window of the front door into the waiting room.
A transport police officer and CZP guard were knocked on the broken glass bell.
They were able to detain a criminal who tried to hide from the scene.
South-East LLU staff in Russia are being audited.
The issue of the initiation of a criminal case was resolved by the senior reference to the information and public communications of the South-East ICU of Russia on the transport of Sergei Olhovic.
Vitaly Mutko: Watermelons?
I think we're back 15 years.
The Minister of Sports Vitaly Mutko expressed his opinion on the riots in the courts during the Battle of the Russian Kubka Shinnik - Spartak.
I am in favour of all this being the responsibility of the organizers of sports events: clubs, leagues, RFS.
But we see that they took a position.
They're waiting for someone to come by and order.
It's a very good position, but it's not exactly right.
Hospitals need to be organized, clubs should invite their stewards, not let things go on their own.
We have now drawn up a special Government decision on the rules of conduct at the stadiums.
Once it is adopted, we will deal with this problem in full.
But I will still have to invite all the organizers of the football process.
I read Leonid Fedun's interview.
State, please, give the law a hurry.
It's such a feeling that they're Bavarian patients in Yaroslav, and they've set it up.
And we're the side observers.
And it's terrible to see the tribe be driven out of the brandpost.
And it's in the country that's preparing for the World Championship.
"I feel like we've been back 10-15 years," Mutko said.
Snouden can be questioned in Russia
The former U.S. Specialist Edward Snowden will probably not go beyond the border of Russia to give evidence of the hearing of the German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
As Interfax stated on Friday, the American can answer questions from the German GMO in writing or clearly in Russia.
The entry of Edward Snowden beyond Russia is virtually excluded.
"In this case, he loses refugee status and may be issued to Washington by US allies," said the associate of the agency.
"However, in principle, the GDR's Office could send its representatives to the RF or forward written questions to Snowden," added the source, adding that the issue should be addressed at the inter-State level.
Former German Bundestag member Hans-Christian Strebelle reported that Edward Snowden was willing to give evidence of the case of the US special services negotiated by the Chancellor of Germany.
Snouden is willing to give testimony to the German law enforcement authorities either in Moscow or in Germany.
An ex-collaborator told the CIA that he knew very much.
Despite the fact that the U.S.A. had blocked all his movements, Snowden was willing to come to Germany.
However, this requires a clear definition of all the conditions of his arrival," Strebel told Euronews.
Advocate Snouden Anatoly Kucheren, commenting on the statement from the "Interfax" source, said that his client could cooperate with German investigators, but when and how he would decide.
U.S. citizen Edward Snowden, a member of the U.S. National Security Agency (UNB) and CIA, fled to Hong Kong in May 2013 and then announced information on the secret operations of the U.S. online collection services.
Snowden flew through Moscow transit, but could not leave the airport because his passport had been cancelled by the US authorities, who had brought him serious charges, and remained in the Sheremetevo transit area by the beginning of August.
On August 1, Snouden received a document granting him temporary asylum in the territory of Russia for a year and on the same day left Sheremitjevo.
Yesterday, American lawyer Anatoly Kucheren said his client was set up for work in a "crazy Russian company".
Last week, German media reported the ANB report to Angela Merkel.
According to journalists, the American Chancellor's phone calls began to be heard in 2002.
The tracking station was allegedly in the US Embassy in Berlin.
The German authorities, following the publication of this information, claimed that the Merkel case violates the laws and sovereignty of Germany.
Commemorate left "Just Russia"
The Member of the State Duma from the Fair Russia party, a member of her office in Novosibirsk, Ilya Ponomrev, made a statement about the departure from the political organization.
As the MP said, he made a statement to the new Siberian regional office of the party.
According to her statute, it automatically means that Ponomrev left a number of "sovereign".
We're sitting down, drinking tea...
"Why do many want to see the picture "Elya Ponomrev puts on the table," but there's nothing like that," the MP commented.
He noted that he maintained good relations with the Eserov regional office.
However, Mr. Ilia Ponomrev ' s mandate was not intended to be denied.
He explained that, despite leaving the party, he remained a member of the group and could not leave it under the law.
The announcements on the intention of Ili Ponomreva to leave the Fair Russia party appeared on 30 October.
It was announced that Dmitry Goodkov and Valerie Zubov would leave with him, but the last time they objected to this information.
Japan will discuss with Russia the conclusion of a peace treaty
The head of the Japanese MIDI Fumio Kisid met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov to discuss issues related to the conclusion of a peace treaty between the two countries.
“I would like to exchange views on the further development of political dialogue, discuss issues related to the conclusion of a peace treaty,” Kisida said.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of Japan recalled that after Japan's Prime Minister Sindzo Abe visited Russia, relations between countries became warmer and bilateral.
The Russian Minister, in turn, noted that the FF would attend Japan's complex political issues, writes RIA News.
The conclusion of a peace treaty between Japan and Russia implies a solution to the issue of the disputed Northern Territories.
In that regard, the protests in Tokyo today are calling for the country to return lost after the Second World War of the Earth.
The Japanese capital is being driven by cars, from which the loudspeaker says, "Return the northern territories!"
The police don't stop the protests, they're watching to keep the noise from getting out of the way.
Ben Greenman: Tenth anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: New Yorker
It can be said that New York is the birthplace of a stand-up comedy in America: almost a hundred years ago an experienced artist, Frank Fay, working at the Palace Theatre in Broadway, began to tell jokes directly to the audience in the conversation.
In time, Fay's innovation was welcomed by others, recently the New York Comedy Festival.
The created and curated Caroline Hursh, founder of Caroline's stand-up club, celebrates its tenth anniversary this year, with more than sixty shows in small clubs and large theaters.
“Most of these hedlines started in Carolines, and then they got more success, they reached a level when they were already too famous to be at the club,” Hürsh said.
We created this festival as a way to continue working with them.
This year, the event includes the talks by Vanda Sykes, Katie Griffin and Bill Mara, as well as the "Stendap for Heroes", an annual musical and comedy charity concert for military veterans in Madison Square Garden, where they appear among the other Bruce Springstin, John Stuart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
The expansion of the festival has also expanded the world of comedy.
Several comics participating in the festival this year have gained popularity in a non-traditional way, such as by showing on small television channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Croll got acquainted with the role in the comedy series on a small cable channel (especially the fXX-sport League on the subject of fantasy football), and now he's running his own comedy Central sketch show.
Jenny Slatt went into the actress's composition both in the "Saturday Night in the Direct Ere", as well as in the "Parks and Respiratory Zone", although she was best known for the series of viral roles "Marsel-Rakuška in Botinka".
Both Croll and Slate, as well as other young self-styled comedians (surrealist pessimistic Anthony Jesselnik, a lucid focus on Kamau Bell's racial theme), are the result of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the brightest moments of the festival will be David Steinberg's interview with Larry David.
Steinberg started as a standup comic, but then became a successful director on television and film as well as an informal historical comedy.
From 2005 to 2007, he was a leading show on TV Land called Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg.
The meeting will be held in Town Hall, Manhattan.
“This city, of course, is the central element of Larry’s entire work,” said Steinberg.
He told me that when he comes here, he sometimes plays around a street between the two houses and he says, "If I don't have the money, maybe I'll live here."
Pakistani authorities began negotiations with local Taliban
The Pakistani authorities began negotiations with the Taliban movement.
This was reported by the Embassy of that country in Britain, where Pakistan's Prime Minister Navas Sharif is visiting.
The head of the Government of Pakistan made a statement on negotiations with Islamic extremists during a meeting with British Deputy Prime Minister Niko Klegg, with which he discussed Pakistan and India, the world energy market and economic reform in Pakistan.
"The Prime Minister reported that dialogue with the Taliban movement had begun, as stated in a statement by the Embassy of Pakistan in London.
- He said he hoped and prayed for dialogue to work in accordance with the Constitution of Pakistan," added the diplomats.
Pakistan ' s Taliban (Tekrik and Taliban) are allies of a united Afghan movement, but operate independently in the north-west regions of the country bordering Afghanistan.
Pakistan ' s Taliban are seeking to establish an Islamic State.
The Government of Islamabad had previously tried to start negotiations with local Taliban, but the movement had been refused dialogue.
It stated that negotiations would take place only if the authorities took the permanent deployment of troops located in areas where the Taliban were active and released from the prison of the arrested Islamists.
Navaz Sharif arrived in London at the World Islamic Economic Forum.
On Tuesday, 29 October, British Prime Minister David Cameron, head of the Pakistani Government and Afghan President Hamid Karzai, held a trilateral meeting in London, which discussed the prospects of the peace process in Afghanistan.
The oil dropped to $96 for the barrel.
The oil price continued to fall on Friday, when the concerns about the education of large stocks became cloudy, indicating that China's energy-intensive manufacturing sector was gaining power.
The U.S. oil standard in December was supplied by 14 cents and its price was $96.24 for a barrel at a late morning European time in electronic stores at the New York Stock Exchange.
On Thursday, the contract provided 39 cents, which amounted to a drop of 5.8 per cent in October.
Rich oil stocks have influenced its value over the past few weeks.
The Ministry of Energy on the Wednesday stated that US stockpiles increased by 4.1 million barrels in the last week.
In five weeks, more than 25 million barrels were filled.
But on Friday, there was a reference to a possible increase in demand, judging by two reports of the Chinese industry demonstrating the explosion of its activity.
This indicates that the recovery of China's economy can continue to take effect after the growth rate in the third quarter rose to 7.8 per cent after the 20-year minimum in the previous quarter.
The oil Brent, also used by U.S. oil-processing companies, provided 26 cents to $108.58 for a barrel at the London Intercontinental Stock Exchange.
Corporal Coach Patrick Rue, explaining the decision to release the belliper Semen Varlamov from the first minute in the Friday match with Dallas, expressed confidence that the last night after the summit did not break his confidence in the Russians, he passed from Dallas to Natalia Schmelev.
And what we're waiting for," Rua said after the morning break, "Lavin."
Of course, all of us are concerned, but we are confident of him and feel that it will be helpful for him to get out of the ice today.
We want him to get to the ice and show his usual level.
So you're absolutely sure the situation hasn't been said about the door conditions?
I'll see you today.
No doubt our games will support Varley by helping him to keep the door, as it was in previous season's fighters.
The main thing is that no one in the team is going to make any conclusions until the court finds out.
In Siberia there is no need to be a vagina: warm tomato does not replace the stomach
Why did the vegetarians fail to live in Siberia, RIA News correspondent explained.
People who have completely abandoned products of animal origin must not live in Siberia.
They do not carry winters without loss of health, and no hot tomatoes compensate for them, they consider the New Siberian Dietologists and Doctors on the eve of Veghan.
Five liters of oil
The strict vegetarianism, when not only of meat and fish, but also of milk, honey, eggs, becomes a fashionable way of life.
However, dietologists are convinced that in Novosibirsk and other cities in Siberia, strict food standards are not beneficial for health at all.
The complete rejection of animal products is harmful.
Animal proteins contain irreplaceable amino acids that are very difficult to compensate for by plants.
It is necessary to include in the treatment at least milk or eggs," says dietologist Marina Godi.
It contains, for example, fish containing the essential fatty acid of Omega-3.
The richest of them is the purest of green olives.
"In order to need it in the quantity needed for man, we need to drink the liters!" says the dietologist.
Doctors are convinced that the Siberians need to pay particular attention to the treatment of winter.
In this season, vegetarianism is particularly suspicious.
Under our circumstances, there are high requirements for food.
In order not to freeze, high calorie levels are needed.
"If a person restricts himself to animal products, then he does not accept that calorie," says the expert.
This is in agreement with the dietologist Olga Poznak.
She adds that vegetables and fruit are not an exit.
People are better fed mainly by products grown in the region or where they were born.
The genetic code is designed to improve the adoption and transformation of these products.
And the people of the winter don't want to bite, but the hot tub or something else," explains the doctor.
According to her, there may be waves, there are currently various malts, crusts, bees, local plants, apples left in the winter, frozen strawberries.
But that is certainly not enough for full nutrition.
Arifulin, a gastroenterologist in Claudia, found that vitamins were sufficient in the sympathies in the organisms from mid-August to mid-September.
The full transition to vegetarianism in our harsh natural conditions, when the temperature can change by 30 degrees in the morning and in May is not feasible.
The organism needs energy for life, and that is, above all, fat," says the doctor.
Doctors point out that vengeful behavior is particularly harmful to children and pregnant people.
Children are growing, they need building materials, including amino acids.
And by holding to the vegetarians, we give them incomplete.
The pregnant women also need to have a higher level of protein, vitamins and micro-elements in the menu.
"The Wagons don't like them," he says, "surely God.
Arifulina says that an adult is willing to choose anything he likes to "play in the games he wants."
He's already got the body, the skeleton, the organs.
Still, children need to be fully fed.
If parents miss him some micro-elements or amino acids, choosing for him what he will be, it's just a violation of the rights of the child.
"The lack of any substance to develop the brain, the view, the bones will no longer recover tomorrow," she says.
All the medical professionals surveyed are in the opinion of the low quality of winters grown in carpets and fruit and vegetables.
What is brought to us and grown up in carpets contains less of the micro-elements we need than (produced) in open ground.
"The quality of the products is not that," he says to God.
Arifulin also notes that fertilized and warm plants and fruits are far from ideal standards.
Sometimes the desire of producers to harvest more crops is detrimental to quality.
"The apples don't become brown on the cut, the ants quickly gnaw and dance, the tomatoes tasteless and untasteful," says medical examples, adding that they are probably consumed by an excessive amount of spices.
And they become suppliers, not vitamins, but cells.
This was not agreed upon by the Siberian Institute of Physics and Technology of Agricultural Problems, a candidate for rural science Vera Petruk.
She said that, with the right approach and compliance with all the rules and requirements in the carpets, full plants could be grown.
If they try to get bigger than a square metre, then, of course, they'll be more frequent, and they'll feed the plants with mineral fertilizers.
For example, when too many nitrogen fertilisers are growing rapidly, they are large, but they are hydrogenic and insatiable," she explains, adding that the quality issue, first of all, depends on the manufacturer's conscience.
The Court suspended the application of a decision on “stop and search” in the New York Department of Police
On Thursday, the Court of Appeal of the Federal District suspended the enforcement of a court order requiring changes in the “stop and search” program of the New York Department of Police, and removed the court from the case.
The Court of Appeal of the Second District of the United States stated that the execution of Judge Shira Shaindlin would be suspended until the results of the appeal by the city were obtained.
In August, the judge decided that the city had violated the Constitution by implementing the street arrest and interrogation programme.
The city appealed to its decision and decision on corrective measures, including the requirement to appoint a controller to assist the police office in changing the practice of work and its related training programme.
On Thursday, the Court of Appeal heard a debate by the parties on a request for suspension.
The Court of Appeal stated the need for a judge to be removed because it violated the U.S. Code of Conduct and did not consider the need to avoid demonstration of bias, partly due to a series of media interviews and official statements containing a public response to the court ' s criticism.
The judge decided that police officers had violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people, without justification, addressing black and Latin American programme “stop and search”.
It has appointed an external controller to monitor large changes that include policy, training and control reforms, and has decided to launch a pilot programme to test video cameras on TV in police stations where most of the detentions occur.
In August, New York decided to cease the practice of storing names and addresses of persons whose cases were terminated after the police check.
The debate on the appeal of the city should take place after 14 March 2014.
The “stop and search” tactic was criticised by a number of civil rights lawyers.
The search facility has been in practice for several decades in some form, but the number of documented detentions has increased dramatically with the administration of the independent mayor Michael Bloomberg, reaching an absolute record of 684,330 in 2011, most of whom are black and Latin American.
In 2004, four people, all representatives of national minorities, made a collective appeal.
Participants in the New York Police Department said that these changes would put an end to unfavourable practice, create a more reliable and effective police service and could influence how other police departments were implementing this practice.
The opponents claim that the changes will reduce the military spirit of the police, not the level of crime, lead to unnecessary money loss and will not solve a more global problem of complex police conditions due to the reduction of officers for a few thousand years.
The judge noted that it did not stop the practice of “stop and search” which was consistent with the constitution, but changed the way the New York Police stopped people.
A pedestrian zone was opened in the area of the Third Party Gallery
A new pedestrian zone appeared in Moscow.
It is located in the area of the Third Party Gallery and is located two kilometres from the Novokusneckai Metro Station to the Bolot Square.
All along, street trucks, flowers, stones, urns and toilets have been set, and there is a clean ban and illegal advertising.
In addition to the Klimentov and Lavrushin Peninsula, which had already been pedestrians, five streets were closed for cars - the Ordin Oupik, the Big and the Little Tolmaczev Peninsula, the Kadashev Coast and the Bolot Square.
The transport movement on the streets of Morocco and Petrovka is not limited.
On the Fifth Street site, from the Newkusneck station to the Klimentov Pralque, the conditions for pedestrians were created without removing the movement and cutting off the passageway, reports newsmsk.com.
Inside the pedestrian zone were the Third Year’s Gallery, the temple of the priest of the Clement of Rome, the museum, libraries, monuments, and other monuments.
In the past, the Twerk Pass, Stoleshnniks in the suburbs and Kuznecki Bridge were completely pedestrians.
A large Dmitrovka, where the pedestrian zone was opened in early September, was determined to close the exit and the holiday cars.
Coulson ran into the phone to check the confidential communication
The former editor of the News of the World Andy Coulson reportedly used the “phone, connection and resistance” in an attempt to confirm the false information about Charles Clarke, who was then the Minister of the Interior.
The prosecutor, King's lawyer Andrew Edys, told the court of Old Bailey that in May 2005, news of the World had received an uncertain news report that Clark met with his “beautiful special adviser” Hannah Polby.
The newspaper ordered a private detective named Glenn Mulkeyr to break the polling post of Polby and warn her at home to take an interview, but Coulson also called her and left the polls, hearing the court.
“The accusation is that Mr. Coulson, who is now editor of NotW, is not a person who will be standing next to someone’s home, hoping to save someone’s livelihood, a person who likes to offer history to people to see what they say,” said Mr. Edys.
He said the newspaper News of the World used three ways to investigate stories: phone break, connection, and resistance.
The editor is personally involved in the third.
Apparently, he knows about the second, about the collection, he just has to.
What about the first one?
Does he know about the phone crash?
He says no; We say, “Yes.”
For the first time, Clark's hearings drew attention to the editorial News of the World, when a source of sexual interest to Mrs. Polby said, "Don't waste your time, she and Charles."
Caset with a voice message received from her phone at least three times was removed from Mulkeir's house in August 2006.
The investigators also found records on the computer of a private detective in which Ms. Polby and her sister were listed as “Projects”.
During the period under review, Ms. Polby's grandmother and grandmother received anonymous calls requesting information about her, Mr. Edys said.
At the time, former chief reporter Neville Türlbek and former reporter James Wezerap monitored a survey of Ms. Polby's movements.
After leaving her vote on 18 June 2005, Coulson said, “I have a story that we plan to publish tomorrow and which I would like to discuss very much with Charles.”
Mr. Edys said that Coulson's involvement in this story was in the same scenario as with other influential people, such as the former Minister of Internal Affairs, David Blancett.
The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson had entered a conversation with Mr. Blancett about a romantic relationship with a married woman when he met with the corresponding Rebecca Brooks, who was married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks denied contact with other people for the purpose of telephone interception between 3 October 2000 and 9 August 2006.
Mulkair, Turbeck, and Weserap were admitted to the phone crash.
Snouden states that it is prepared to contact the authorities of the GFG on the matter of interrogation
The former CIA staff member, Edward Snowden, is willing to come to Germany as soon as he has the legal opportunity to do so, and to meet with representatives of the FRG authorities, reports the RIA News.
A letter from the former CIA staff member to the FWG authorities at a meeting with journalists in Berlin was presented on Friday by a member of the Bundestag Hans-Christian Strebel, through which Snouden conveyed the message to the German authorities.
Smurf recently met Snowden in Moscow.
Four people were injured as a result of a fire on the Tver Street
As a result, four people were injured in a collaborator in the center of Moscow, on Tverska Street.
As Interfax reports with reference to a source in emergency services, one of the victims has been hospitalized.
According to this source, there were passersby who were in the fire during the indiscriminate underground passage.
As RIA News writes with reference to the head of the capital of the Fuel and Energy Department of Paul Livinski, electricity has now been completely restored in all homes on the Tver Street.
A fire in the heat collector outside the house 15 on the Tver Street occurred on the evening of 31 October.
There was a strong smoke from the river canals, and in the underground passage at the Armenia store, there was a crackdown.
As a result of the fire, 11 houses on the Tver Street were destroyed.
At 21:45 in Moscow time, fire was eliminated.
The United States of America will be providing food to the poor.
Food allowance for the family of four is reduced by $36 per month
From Friday to Friday in the United States, the financial provision of food talent known as " footsteps" is being reduced, as the relevant public programme is ending.
A family of four will now be allocated 36 dollars a month less than before, official persons say.
That's going to affect 47 million of the poorest Americans.
According to Reuters, in the financial year 2012, a single-person benefit amounted to an average of 133 dollars per month.
Food aid costs in the United States increased to $80 billion a year as a result of rising unemployment and food prices.
About 14 per cent of Americans rely on free food aid issued by Fudstamp, which has been named since the time they were in the form of paper coupons.
When the current economic crisis began, the programme was expanded to stimulate economic growth and help the poorest Americans.
However, the Republicans of Congress require further reductions in the resources allocated to the programme, stating that it should be aimed at helping those who need more.
Food store owners throughout America are concerned that reductions will reduce consumer costs.
U.S. Congressmen continue to argue as much as possible to reduce the funding of the Government.
Blizzard released a 19-year-old platform for free
The Blizzard Studio released its Blackthhorn platform to PC free of charge in 1994.
That's what WW Insider says.
According to him, the game became available at Battle.net in the classic Blizzard game section.
However, some gamers note that it can only be missed by users whose accounts are related to the American part of the service.
The game is still not available for Russian users.
As media reports, the version that Blizzard has now released to PC does not differ externally from the original version of the game.
The soundtrack to Blackthorne has also remained unchanged.
The Blackthhorn platform, which Blizzard released 19 years ago, originally went to SNES consoles.
Its events were being unfolded on the planet of Tuul, whose inhabitants were divided into dark and light kingdoms.
One day, dark ruler Sarlak decided to kill the bright King Vlaros and become the only ruler of the planet.
The main hero of the game is the son of Vlaros Kyle, who was rescued from death by sending him to Earth.
Twenty years later, he returned to Tuvalu to fight with the rebels of Sarlak and to protect the inhabitants of the planet.
The original Blackthhorn became the first game that the studio released after it was renamed Blizzard Entertainment.
Before that, she was called Silicon & Synapse.
Blackthhorne was an interplay company.
New cars will appear in the Moscow metropolis.
But selling tickets to passengers will not be for money, but for meetings.
One trip of 30 rubles will be made by a potential passenger at 30 sessions.
The number of meetings would be calculated by means of modern technology, ITAR-TASS reported with reference to the Russian Olympic Committee ' s press service.
The first apparatus will be installed at the Eastern Station on 8 November 2013.
In the presentation of new ticket sports, the President of the Olympic Committee of Russia, Alexander Zukov, and the Olympic Championship Championships, Alexie Nem and Elena Zamoldčikov, will be welcomed.
The Agency ' s recognition of national security has strengthened the paramilitary corporations with regard to public procurement
On a warm day at the end of August, the German police flew low over the U.S. consulate in Frankfurt, Germany's financial capital.
According to the Federal Constitutional Protection Service (BfV), the German Internal Intelligence Service, it was intended to photograph the roof of the United States representation building, which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
German media say that BfV was hoping to find antennas for listening devices, and these actions led to negotiations between the United States and the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Berlin.
James Clapper, director of the U.S. National Intelligence, again in September, assured that the U.S. did not use the opportunity of external intelligence “for the theft of commercial secrets of foreign companies for American companies to increase their international competitiveness or increase their profits”.
However, since Edward Snowden, a contract servant who became a negotiator, began to publish his secretary of U.S. intelligence, the European governments and company managers are no longer convinced whether the director can be trusted by the word.
Statements that the U.S. National Security Agency has been monitoring Brazil's oil company Petrobras and has been given access to data stored by U.S. cloud service providers, including Google and Yahoo, have raised a paramilitary corporation called the State branch to new heights.
The last chapel was reported to have been listening to the phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel for perhaps about ten years.
If Europe's most influential person can be a target, of course, business leaders are also a potential target.
Snowden has made clear intensive cooperation between US intelligence services and companies.
I think it's likely that these data are used with mutual benefit.
“Germany must wake up,” says Oliver Green, president of the BITMI Association, which represents Germany's small and medium-sized IT companies.
German companies are convinced that the United States is now at almost the same risk as China in the area of industrial espionage and data theft, according to a study published by the EY Consulting Agency in July.
In all the documents discovered by Mr. Snowden, however, there has still been no evidence that the United States has transferred the commercial secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians expressed concern that the EU did not have certain opportunities for information technology and the Internet and expressed the view that it should try to reduce its dependence on the United States.
Businessmen are skeptical about this.
Someone in the German Parliament says we have to create a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again...
“This is no option,” says Gusso Plattner, president of the German software supplier for the SAP business.
If there was a need for a powerful European IT industry, it was not necessary to allow it to die more than 20 years ago.
All are subsidized in Germany: from coal to cars and farmers.
Everything except the IT industry.
However, the scope and technical development of US spy agencies, known as Snowden's revelations, have been a shock to some companies who previously thought that China's greatest risk of collecting.
A great deal of progress is being made in cloud technology, where European company managers are better aware that data stored in the United States are in the same jurisdiction and are therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a study conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, about 10 per cent of its non-American participants refused to use the services provided in the United States after the U.S. programme for intellectual analysis of Prism data was released.
Jim Snoweb, one of the executive directors of the SAP, said: “We see consumers asking a new question that did not arise a year ago, namely, where my data is stored and if you can guarantee that they will remain physically in this jurisdiction.”
Many German leaders claim that the latest reports are merely a confirmation of what they already knew: the powerful States want to steal their most valuable secrets, and therefore these data should be protected at any price.
What is happening is not surprising.
He always had a place.
“This has been the subject of discussion for many years and has not changed significantly in the current debate,” says Kurt Bock, CEO of the chemical company BASF.
The Americans are spying on us at the commercial and industrial level, and we are also spying on them, because it is in our national interests to protect our businesses.
Corporate leaders usually do not like to be caught up in the response measures that they have taken, as this can give the enemy an advantage.
In large companies, it has long been assumed that taking a free flashlight on a show or leaving a notebook without a view of the hotel’s number is, at least, unbeknownst.
Ulrich Hakenberg, a member of the Board of Directors of the Audi car construction company, says that it has been a standard practice for many years to collect mobile phones before management meetings so that they can not be used as listening devices.
The Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution of Germany recommends that company managers consider using simple prepaid mobile phones while travelling abroad due to the vulnerability of smartphones.
The prepaid mobile phones are subsequently deleted.
However, there is fear that small and medium-sized companies will remain vulnerable to collapses and mergers.
In Germany, many such companies are leaders in the world market in their specific niche.
“Small and medium-sized companies often lack experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect corporate secrets from unauthorised access,” warns the BfV report.
The United States of America, which is a member of the United States of America, is also responsible for the implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Protection of Human Rights and the Protection of Human Rights.
In February, the U.S. National Intelligence Unit placed France, together with Russia and Israel, in a second number of offenders who were hacking for economic intelligence, after China, approved The Washington Post.
A member of the board of directors of the prestigious German company confirmed that when it comes to economic espionage, “French is worse than all”.
Bernard Scarsini, former head of the French Internal Intelligence Agency DCRI, reportedly said in an interview this month: “The services are well aware that all countries, even when they cooperate in combating terrorism, are spying on their allies.”
Parents from Georgia, who died in a “unpredictable accident, ” believe that their son was killed
Parents from Georgia, whose body had been found inside a turned sports mat in his high school sports hall, believe that their son was killed, said a family lawyer on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, from the city of Valdosta, Georgia, was found on 11 January in a vertical mother, who was assigned to the courts in the sports hall of his high school.
The Loundes County Sheriff's investigators concluded that Johnson died of a tragic accident, but the 17-year-old family objected.
“They are absolutely confident that their son was killed,” said FoxNews.com Benjamin Kramp, lawyer representing Kenneth and Jaklin Johnson.
They never believed he died as the sheriff said.
“They believe that this is contrary to logic, to laws of physics, and to sound sense,” Kramp said.
They think it is a cover to protect people or people responsible for the death of their son.
"They sent their son to school with a school bag, and brought him back to the body bag," he said.
American lawyer Michael Moore stated on Thursday that he was conducting a formal investigation into Johnson's death, noting that several key issues remained unanswered.
What caused death?
Was his death the result of the crime?
The Wall made a statement at the press conferences on Thursday.
I'm going to study all the facts where they're taking us.
My goal is to learn the truth.
“I believe that there are sufficient grounds” he said for an official investigation.
The Wall told reporters that the initial disclosure showed that Johnson died as a result of “positional asphyxiation”.
However, the second discovery, according to Mura, showed another cause of death.
“There are several issues to be resolved or clarified,” he said.
The Wall added that if he found enough evidence to require a criminal or civilian investigation into Johnson's death, he would ask the FBI to carry it out.
The manager of the Loundes district sheriff was not available for comment when he was approached on Thursday.
On Wednesday, the Judge of South Georgia ordered the authorities to publish all the video footage of the surveillance chamber that the investigators had observed.
Adolescent parents have said that they hope that the video records contain the key to how he died.
"Spartak": For information on the persons who put out a fascist symbol
A statement by the Moscow Club on the appearance of a Fascist flag at Jaroslavle was made on the official website of Spartaca.
"Shinnik" - Spartak on October 30th, unknown provocators at the Yaroslavle stadium demonstrated a fascist symbol.
We address all those who have reliable information on persons who have committed this criminal offence, with the request to provide it
"Remuneration is guaranteed," says the statement.
A search for fanatics who put out a fascist flag in Jaroslavle

A Fascist symbol has also been shown in the Spartan patient sector.
In the form of "Spartak" punishment, there may be about three match-ups without spectators.
There will be a meeting of the Committee on Friday.
If you have any information about who took this symbol, please contact us.
Disease Control and Prevention Centres have issued recommendations for schools on child allergy
In the middle of the disease control and prevention centres, a list of recommendations for the control of food allergies in children in schools was published.
This is the first list of such recommendations issued by the Government of the United States, while the number of children in school suffering from food allergy is growing.
One of the 20 children in the United States now have food allergies.
The disease control and prevention centres found that the prevalence of food allergy among children increased by 18 per cent from 1997 to 2007.
The guide contains information for schools on how to raise awareness of teachers and staff on food allergy for children and how to assist in the event of an allergic reaction.
It also recommends that schools keep adrenaline stocks — most commonly used for injections by the EpiPen automatic medical syringe — to help with potentially fatal anaphylaxis.
State legislative bodies have recently amended the regulation to allow schools to make adrenaline stocks less difficult.
The notification also contains a list of typical symptoms described by children with an allergic reaction.
Children can say, “I feel like something in my language”, “I feel like I have hair in my tongue” or “the tongue of a turtle”.
Inter-sexual children's parents can choose “undefined gender”
Germany became the first European country to recognize the third half of children born with foreign sexual organs of an intermediate type.
The newborn will no longer be required to assign a male or female sex.
The new law does not require parents to name any gender of such children, allowing parents to indicate gender as “undefined” or “unspecified” in their birth certificates.
The purpose of the law was to remove pressure from parents who could make prompt decisions on the abortion of newborns and to combat discrimination against intersexuals.
One intersexual person, according to the BBC, said many years later: “I am not a man or a woman”.
I'm going to be a doctor-in-law with blues and scarves.
About one in two thousand children born each year are neither boys nor girls.
They have intersexuality, one of some 60 pathological conditions that fall under the diagnosis of “sexual development” — a collection term for people with atypical chromosomes, gonads (yellows or seedlings) or unusually developed outside sex organs.
Wallis Simpson may have been an intersexual.
The gender identification has not yet been sufficiently studied, but most experts in the United States say that, if the gender cannot be determined, it is better to use all available information and assign it than to expect and track the psychological and physical development of the child before the operation, if at all.
The New York psychiatrist, Dr. Jack Dreser, who specializes in gender identification, said that the new German law would “be a good idea”.
Intersexual children create ethical dilemma.
“Some people have life-threatening violations that require operational intervention, but most children do not have them,” he said.
You can assign the sex without surgery and then see how the personality develops.
The science of how a child develops a gender identity is not too accurate.
No one can answer questions as to why this is happening.
It's like a mystery why people are homosexual.
The report sent to the European Commission in 2011 describes intersexuals as different from transsexuals or transgenders, because their status is not related to gender, but to their biological structure, which does not correspond exclusively to male or female sex, and is typical of both, or not, for either.
These characteristics can be found in secondary sex signs such as muscle mass, distribution of hair cover, breast and body; primary sexual signs such as reproductive organs and genitals, or in the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
The report also provides a general picture of discrimination faced by intersexual and transgender persons in the field of employment, as well as the level of harassment, cruelty and prejudice crimes.
There's a special camp now for boys with gender differences.
Australia and Nepal are already allowing adults to place a male, female or “third sex” in their official documents.
In June, 52-year-old Australian Norri May-Walby became the first person in the world to be recognized as a “unemployed” person, held the right to remain “unspecified” sexual status for life.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, the German passports will use the third symbol in addition to M and F - X, i.e. intersexual.
In neighbouring France, gender issues still raise contradictions, according to France's news release 24.
In 2011, dozens of legislators from France, this prominent Catholic country, signed a petition for the removal of gender theory from school textbooks.
The American Catholic Online website also expressed disagreement with the German law, writing that “when the world is drawn into a new state where sex is the subject of choice, and sexual activity is not, we are turning two other pillars of civilization into something else”.
A mother of a newborn child from Maryland also reported to the Baby Zone website that she would prefer to have children set up sex at birth.
“It’s hard enough to raise a child without any additional restrictions, especially if you don’t know your child’s sex,” she said to her parents’ website.
Children need stability and confidence.
Historically, children born with male and female sexual organs were called hermaphrodites — in the name of a beautiful Greek god who had the signs of both sexes.
And another ten years ago, the medical community adopted a gender as a letter on which everything can be written and then rewritten.
But many now challenge the ethical grounds for surgery, knowing that gender identity is complex, and that the doctor sometimes makes a false choice, not knowing how a child will perceive his gender when he grows up.
"In the middle of the 20th century, it was called "an emergency psychiatric case," Dresser said.
When such children were born, you did not call a psychiatrist — you called a surgeon.
The dominant theory of how to treat children with intermittent genitals was proposed by Dr. John Mani from John Hopkins University, who believed that the gender was easily altered.
He introduced the term “general identity” and claimed that the signals of the environment, including social, as parents grow the child, interact with the genes and hormones of the child, determining whether a person would be considered a man or a woman.
But in one case in 1966, known as John/John, his theories were questioned.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been damaged during a nearby cutting, to cast the child completely, also to remove his eggs, and to raise him as a girl.
“Mani presented the case as a successful example of a transition, but that was not the case,” Dresser said.
When a boy was about 15 years old, he again became a boy and married a woman.
But at 38 years of age, he committed suicide.
Dresser said that some doctors are still “applying this model”.
But in the 1990s, with the arrival of the Internet, the survivors of these sex-exchange operations declared themselves “sufferable”.
This was the case with Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with male chromosomes XY, but genitals of an intermediate type.
The doctor was unable to determine exactly whether he had a large clique or a small penis, and were convinced that he would never be able to live a “full life” of men.
Soon after his birth in 1976, therefore, the outside sex organ and Bruce’s eggs were surgically removed, and he was raised as a girl.
He was given female hormones when he was 12 years old.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," he told ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was very difficult to ask questions.
At 18 years of age, he was appointed a vaginal patch.
But when he was depressed and realized that something was wrong, he needed medical documentation.
What he knew was terrible.
I was sterilized at birth, and no one ever told me about it.
Bruce was born in violation of sexual development, which did not allow his body to produce enough testosterone for normal genital development.
When he learned the truth, he again became a man, getting rounds of testosterone and removing his chest.
The operation made it pointless.
Today, he advocates the protection of others in an organization called the Interface Project, trying to bring into line the perception of people with intersexuality.
But Ann Temar-Mattis, executive director of the California Legal Association Lawyers for Informed Choice, is concerned that the German law “encourages the improvement of the eyelids and stigma”.
“Many activists are concerned that the German law will encourage parents to make an urgent decision and give the child an “unspecified gender”, she said.
We're afraid he'll be promoting intervention.
We think it's better to assign a male or female sex and then wait.
But we have not yet seen this law manifest itself, so all we can do is build assumptions.
Temar Mattis said that her organization supported the Australian law, since “it allows adults to make a choice in favour of the third sex”.
“ Adults should be able to make their own decisions on formal sexuality,” she said.
The German law implies its birth at birth.
This is a fight that small children should not enter this stage.
When they grow up, they can make decisions about their own body.
But Dr. Arlin Barac, a Pittsburgh mammologist who has a daughter with a sexual development disorder and who helps hundreds of others in the support group, said that the German law “supports” both parents and children.
The daughter of Barac, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but she had a sexual development disorder called “androgensal insensitivity syndrome”.
Since her androgen receptors are not working properly, Katie developed female signs.
She's got an intruder, but she's got no mothers and eggs.
Now, at 29 years of age, Katie is getting married and is going through a child psych ward at the University of Pennsylvania.
Despite being barren, she hopes to be a parent through adoption or gestational surrogate motherhood.
“The law gives parents time to avoid making hasty decisions on their own,” said Barac.
It gives them time to do some analysis and to deal with the situation, as well as the time before they write “man” or “female”.
In that case, you will grow up, love the child.
You have a wonderful child, and you have joy.
We don't have to do an operation that doesn't happen.
“This allows children to take part in the decision and eliminate the tension that drives parents because they do not feel what they are doing right,” she said.
At the end of the day, the child will decide which sex he or she is comfortable with — and that is remarkable.
This allows children to make decisions on their own.
The "Chicago" knight Nikolay Habibulin stressed: he understands that he should play better.
According to a 40-year-old Russian, he will continue to work hard at training.
At the last two "Jastrebov" meetings, Habibulin first missed six shifts from Tampa Bay and then four from Ottawa, and in the second game he was replaced after the fourth missed shift.
We have to play well, and in the last two games I haven't been able to do this, says CSNChicago Habibulin.
- I need to find confidence in training, I think it's time to approach them as a game, and try to get the best out of it.
You must study your past games and deal with the shortcomings that have been.
There are a few small components that I need to improve, but I feel pretty good about training.
But why, after a few heads, everything turns into some snowcommer.
Maybe I need to relax a little.
The doorkeepers, I don't think I'm that one, they're always trying to play the perfect game.
If I miss four, five, six, I'm not in the woods.
It doesn't matter what happens in front of my doors.
I'm still working on myself so I don't miss so much soap.
Well, I'm sure my peers support it, but in principle, it's just, I need to play better.
Two games is not the whole season, but I wanted to spend them a lot better.
But it happened.
I have to put this on the side.
I'm just gonna try and play the next match better.

Bears expect SSJ-100 aircraft to be delivered to Europe
Russia expects Superjet 100 aircraft to be delivered to Europe as soon as it is established on the markets of Latin America and Asia.
"We expect that, in general, we will receive more than 170 copies of such aircraft," says Prime Minister Dmitria Medvedev of Russia at press conferences with French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Eiro.
The head of the Russian Government noted that there was serious cooperation with French colleagues, as this was a joint project.
We have discussed some financial issues related to insurance today, but we hope that once this aircraft is strengthened in the markets of Latin America and in the Asia-Pacific region, it will also be provided to our partners in Europe.
"I hope he will ever be sent to France," stressed the Russian Prime Minister.
SSJ-100 is an aircraft built by the City of Suhogo in partnership with Alenia Aermacchi.
Liner has been developed on the basis of modern technologies and offers high quality and comfort standards in 100 passenger seats.
Dneproperty energy began a unique rescue program...
In an old age, to bring to the court of the aristocratic, the village on the high pillar set up a wheel from the telegas, and a heavy nest well held on it.
Such special resistances have long been abandoned, so the aisles have beautified the columns of the electric liners - the cross-sectional sails are based on the passage, which makes the aisle a secure house.
Anja’s grandmother, near her home in the village of Ivanovka in the Petikov region of her 20 - year - old family, began to notice the nest sitting in spite of all the efforts of its inhabitants.
Birds are putting new vets on top, and the lower layer has already passed through the tracks, and there's a move.
Of course, it is sad to see the family of atheists, who have been nested in the yard every year, turned off and fed for the summer of three or four birds, but they do not want to be left without light.
As soon as the birds flew to the warmer end, Grandma Anya called at the Royal REC that had the resistance.
I didn't even expect them to react so quickly.
When our specialists arrived in Ivanovka, they were surprised that the nest was still holding, as the technical director of the DTEK "Dneprooblenergo" Sergei Berezovski told them.
In fact, there has already been a corrosion in the tracks of the nest, which is about 150 to 200 pounds [150 - 200 kg].
At any point, the birds could have been killed by an electrical system.
Yes, locals were at risk of losing their light because of damage to the roads.
Therefore, linear monteres have begun a nest rescue operation, not the first time in our practice.
Helped scientific ornithologists from the National University of Dnepropetrova who developed a nest transport scheme.
They have been training for regional network staff.
A well-known landowner, Alexander Ponomerenko, advised energy engineers at all stages of nest reconstruction.
To begin with, it was estimated that there were more than 50 real "circumstances" in the emergency area.
For their reconstruction, special metal platforms were in conflict, reminding the iron.
The foundation was laid with oak vines, and then the old nest was moved there.
According to the legends, it is enough to lay the old calves as a foundation for the birds to know the nest and return to it.
Then the aisles will build their own home.
A month ago, the first nest was rebuilt in the village of Peschanka in the Novosko region.
They set up a new railway pillar and placed on it a platform with an old nest already inhabited.
The entire operation was spent on the energy of nine thousand griffins.
And in the days of the same new village, Ivanovka of the Petikov district, in the village of Ani’s grandmother.
This is where the platform was locked in the former place, only to be put on the floor.
Ornithologists are convinced that careful, conservative birds will not even notice in the spring that their "quarter" has been refurbished.
By the end of the year, the same reconstruction would be expected by four more nests in the Pokrov and the Carican areas of Dnepropertovrica.
It seems that while some save rare birds, others kill them in vain.
During the days, the entire area was flooded with the sad news - in the village of Oust-Kammenk of the Apostol region, on the day of the opening of the hunting for the pheasants, the marriagemen shot the lion family, who lived on the local street for entertainment.
The blessed birds were not afraid of the people; the locals were fed and did not hurt them.
When the peasants heard the shots, they fled to the mud, four beautiful bees were already lying on the water.
Now the officers of the Apostal Parade of the militia are finding out who shot the birds in the Red Book.
"Russian March" becomes more popular
On 4 November, on the Day of People's Unity, Moscow will be united with the Russian March Mary.
According to the Levada-Centre survey, support for the Russian March is growing, with 40 per cent of the population at different levels approving the idea of their implementation.
According to the Left-Central data, 40 per cent of the population variously approved the Russian March: 11 per cent of these actions are definitely positive and 29 per cent are less positive.
The popularity of the Russian March idea is growing gradually - in 2006 only 14% of Russians welcomed these actions, and in December 2010 such activities were supported by two more citizens (28%).
"Determinedly negative" to "Russian March" is only 7% of Russians, "most negative" - 19%.
A further 35 per cent had not been able to formulate their attitude towards this action.
This year, the Moscow Mary agreed to hold a "Russian March" of up to 15,000 people in Ljublino, the head of the security department of the capital of Alexei Majorov reported on this.
This action of nationalists is taking place every year on the Day of People's Unity since 2005.
On the question of sociologists, "Did you hear that on 4 November, Russian marches were held under slogans to protect Russian rights in Russia?" three quarters (75%) of the citizens responded negatively.
Only every fifth Russian (20 per cent) is aware of this action.
It is noteworthy that in December 2010 almost three thirds of citizens were heard about the Russian March (31%).
Let us recall that three years ago, on 11 December, the Nationalists' natural meeting in the Manageza Square was held, which went into mass disorder.
The Levada Centre also asked the Russians about the holiday on 4 November.
In two years, the number of people who know the right answer (Day of People ' s Unity) increased from 41 per cent to 49 per cent.
On the other hand, only 15 per cent of the population are gathered to celebrate the holiday.
About the same number (17 per cent) is intended to mark October 7th.
Most of the citizens (62%) are not going to observe any of these holidays.
How the Moscow Mary agreed "Russian March" in Ljublino
On 28 October, the capital authorities agreed to hold the Russian March in Ljubljana on 4 November.
This was reported by the leader of the Russian Association, the organizer of the Dmitry Demuchkin.
In addition to the sixth in Ljublino on the Day of People's Unity, the meeting and the rock concert of the Colorado group will also be held in agreement with the authorities.
As in Russia March 2012
In the Day of People's Unity, in 2012, nationalists passed the sixth from the Jaiman Coast to the Central House of the artist, where the meeting took place.
The organizers assessed the number of participants in 20,000, and the IMF called the number 6,000.
Communication: Obama's pre-election headquarters considered the exception of Baiden to Hillary Clinton
According to The New York Times, the closest advisers of President Barack Obama secretly considered the possibility of replacing Vice-President Joe Baiden with Hillary Clinton in the 2012 election list.
The opening is the brightest sensation of all the expected books by Mark Galperin and John Haylemann on the 2012 “Beautiful Posts: The Game Has Changed 2012”.
The Times received a copy of the book, and announced on Thursday evening that the next president's assistants had conducted “large-scale research in focus groups and public opinion polls at the end of 2011” in order to assess whether Baiden's exception could help to raise the overwhelming hopes of re-election of Obama.
According to political observer The Times Jonathan Martina, the book provides a detailed description of the attempts made by high-ranking officials of the pre-election headquarters and the White House, the former head of the White House Administration Bill Daily, to assess the impact of the vote on the appointment of former Secretary-General Clinton as Vice-President.
A possible replacement was a secret, carefully protected in the Chicago pre-election headquarters and in the Oval Office.
Only six of the President’s closest advisers — including Dale, the former head of the polling station, Obama Jim Messin, and former senior white-house advisers David Axelrod and David Pluff — knew that the replacement was being considered.
The book "Stations Double" claims that Daily was the initiator of an attempt to replace Baiden, despite their "close personal relationships", but eventually rejected this step when their data showed that the addition of Clinton to the election list would not “improve Obama’s chances substantially”.
In an interview with Martin Daily, he confirmed that the administration had indeed considered the possibility of replacing Baiden Clinton.
“I was actively discussing a lot of things, and that was one of them,” Daily said.
You should remember that the president was in a terrible shape at the time, so we thought, "Oh, God, what are we to do?"
Although Daily described the study as a “necessary check”, Martin told CNN Anderson Cooper that the pre-election headquarters had made enough contributions to examine whether this step would bring dividends to the vote.
“The pre-election headquarters do not spend such money on surveys and focus groups unless they consider something serious,” Martin said in AK 360.
It is not clear, however, whether Obama knew that his team had been studying the possibility of replacement.
Martin told CNN that he asked Daley if he knew his current boss about a possible overcrowding.
Although Dale said that he did not think that the President had been in the course of a possible replacement, the former head of the administration admitted that Obama knew that he was “possible”.
Martin added that the "Double stand" did not give a clear answer to the question whether the results of political sensitization had come to Obama's table.
Cooper asked Martin whether he seriously believed that Obama did not know about the study of the possibility of removing Baiden from the electoral list.
"Possible," answered Martin.
Do you want the bright in the cold darkness?
The British businessman created the first in the world that shines in the dark frozen by means of the Medusa.
Charlie Francis used the fluorescent properties of a marine animal to develop a shiny food.
He came up with this idea by reading a scientific article on meds, and he convinced scientists in China to make a chemical reinvigorating white.
The frozen person reacts with the language of the person who has it, increasing the pH in the white and causing it to shine.
Chris says that since the frozen begins to light when it reacts to the warm mouth, that means the more you lie, the more it becomes.
Charlie, the founder of the frozen production company, "Excuse me, I'm delicious," says, "This is an incredible thing, but still at the very beginning, if you talk about production, you'll get about 2 g of the substance for £200."
White, which we use in the freezer, will react with your language in a neutral pH.
So when your mouth warms up the white, it will increase the pH and the frozen start to shine.
We tested it in the last few months, and it seemed that it would be ideal to present it in Halloween, because it creates such a remarkable glowing effect.
It's probably the most expensive frozen of what I've done, because the medus' luminescence is four times the gold road.
So every spoon is worth me about £140.
That's why it's nice to taste.
Charlie's experimental company, located in Bristol, is famous for its extraordinary tastes, including beer, raw, beef and the taste of social gold.
But his next creation must be even more ambitious.
He said, “I want to develop the invisible frozen.”
It's impossible to determine because of the fracture caused by the ice crystals, which consists of frozen, but I think we'll find a way to do that.
The frozen uses fluorescent properties of the medusa, synthesised by Chinese scientists
Avangarda Coach Vladimir Cebaturkin, speaking of his team's preparation for a regular CHL championship match against Salavat, noted that the omis had conducted a thorough analysis of the damage from the Magnetogian Metallurgy.
The specialist stressed that Avangardu needs to pay greater attention to the game in defence.
We've seen a video match against the Magnetogorian Metallurgy, a official website called "Avantgarda" by Chebaturkin.
- They missed a lot of soap, not a very good time.
They missed due to their mistakes, due to a lack of play.
We knew the opponent had executives.
According to the statistics, there were five attacks from the walk, three of us were killed.
It's a very good performance.
Were these errors taken into account when preparing for today's game?
We're with the boys every match, we're talking after the game, we're getting ready for a new rival.
The main thing is for the installation to be done.
Everyone saw the first match against Metallurgy.
A toy job was done, and the account was 2:0.
They missed the goal of the division, and in the third period they made a mistake.
Considering how difficult the game was, he did not see any point in the involvement of the defenders.
Defend the whole team.
Now, Avangarda has a long home series, and the match goes through the day, and the team's tired?
All teams are in the same conditions.
The main focus is on the implementation of its moments and the implementation of the task.
Hockey is an emotional game, if you're doing the installation, it's not that difficult.
As a result of the new rules introduced by the Russian Customs, hundreds of furs are standing on the border with Russia for almost a week.
Today, Danish officials have promised to provide drinking water for drivers and to establish bio-towels
Hundreds of furs were dug at border crossings in Russia.
Such a situation arose as a result of the change in customs rules for the manufacture of goods.
Ukrainian border officials and customs officials affirm that the Russian side is being created, which has not previously warned about innovations.
With effect from 28 October, the Russian customs authorities have applied additional measures to guarantee the delivery of goods, as reported by the Deputy Chief of the East Customs Office, Vladimir Denisov.
The new model document is applied in countries that have acceded to the Convention on International Transport.
The dropout points work in a stronger way.
The correspondent, FACTOV, was on the border with the hostages in the situation.
The prices in the travel coffee shop at the "Novozazovsk" drop point are growing every day, as well as from the fur.
The miners are located in several rows, growing about two kilometers.
The Customs Terminal Novozazovsk - Veselo-Vosnesk provides one of the most important transport routes south of Ukraine on the international highway.
From there the goods are sent to the Stavropolice coast of Russia, Kazakhstan, Georgia, Armenia.
On Sunday before midnight, they were released, and then these rules were introduced, and Alexei Golovenov (on the photo) was complained about, who was carrying the transit through Russia of cargo from Turkey to Kazakhstan and had been in his car for almost a week.
Under the new rules, to cross the border, I need an additional package of documents and payment of the cargo insurance.
The amount depends on the value of the goods and the distance they carry.
Minimum insurance is 4.5 to 5,000 rubles (about 1100 to 1300 wings).
Those who eat near (i.e. Georgia, Armenia) with a cargo worth up to $50,000 pay some 15,000 rubles (3800 griffins) and pass.
And the rest of them, they have no greater share in wealth.
Imagine if a driver carries a cargo of $4,000, but even in Moscow, he has to pay 90,000 rubles (almost 23,000 griffins) for the transit!
The conditions for survival on the border are nothing, they are set aside by the side of their cars.
In border shops and cafes and so on, but prices like here, we haven't met anywhere!
The sellers were oriented and quickly moved: 15 silver barrels, seven silver jars, 25 silver jars of soup.
And the coffee shop one.
And there's no toilet.
We're going to sleep, and we're going to the bathroom.
Don't forget, don't worry...
I can't get out of the car for a week, my wife's on the road.
For a week, Victor Scotarenko's other co-founder.
Will he just come to my car next week?
Why do you have half a litre of water? - We're interested in the only border store.
There's 11 and 15 wings.
What, the crystal bottle or the water is attached to the silver?
We have coffee, not a store.
Take as long as there's anything else, a salesman stops.
After the situation began to be highlighted in the media, Ukrainian leaders drew the attention of the region ' s authorities to the disaster situation.
The management of the Amvrosian and Novozazov Paradise Administrations has been entrusted with the task of ensuring that all those who live on the Ukrainian-Russian border, drinking water, are given the responsibility of President Sergei Dergunov of the Donezka Home Office.
Emergency emergency crews are now being deployed at the exit points.
Bio-thouals will also be set up for the convenience of people.
According to the official, the issue of order will be resolved in the coming days.
As reported by the Donets Administration, 32 and 68 vehicles have been used in the international “Spinka” and “Novozazovsk” locations as at 31 October respectively.
The “FACTS” will monitor the development of the situation.
Vilnius suspects Moscow in an attempt to curse the Lithuanian President
Russia intends to implement information provocations against the high-ranking Lithuanian and Eastern Partnership countries, such a statement made to the BNS in the Republic's Security Department (PGI).
Information on this is published on the DELFI portal.
According to the report, in particular, Moscow is planning to “speak” by the President of Lithuania Dalu Gribauskaite and to publish falsified documents, which are probably found in Russian Gosarhive, which relate to the facts of the Lithuanian leader's biography.
According to the special services, the Department of Public Administration of the Russian President on interregional and cultural links with foreign countries has been conducting an analysis of public administration processes.
The structure is headed by Evgeny Umerenkov, who visited Lithuania and took part in the Lithuanian People ' s Party.
A member of the operation is also alleged to be a member of the department of B. Smyrnov.
According to the special service, Smyrnov, under cover of scientific work by the end of 2012, regularly arrived in Lithuania and contacted local politicians, politicians and media representatives.
Smyrnavo now prohibits entry into the territory of the country.
The President of Lithuania Gribauskait recently stated that he knew about the information being prepared for her.
In its view, Lithuania ' s successful presidency of the Euro Union Council and the country ' s commitment to energy independence' is the main reason.
The Lithuanian leader had not previously unanimously criticised the actions of the Russian authorities.
So she said that in Kremlin, Lithuania is "sufficiently respectable".
In addition, Gribauskait accused RF Vladimir Putin of moving to Lithuania “one requirement”.
It is recalled that in September, Rosustwor stopped the import of Lithuanian milk into Russia.
It was reported that the quality of the product did not comply with the health and epidemiological standards.
The Lithuanian leader then stated that if Russia did not withdraw the ban, the Government of the country would have to prepare for WTO.
In the United States, the school principal shot adolescents.
The director of a U.S. high school literally led to despair.
The man, he said, had to take the guns and start shooting.
The incident occurred in the state of Tennessee.
According to New York Post, minor hooligans threw out a man's toilet paper.
As a result, the school director opened a shooting at the adolescents, resulting in several injuries to the leg and arm of a 15-year-old boy.
Since the hooligans were not in the territory of the Director ' s property, he was accused of assaulting under aggravating circumstances.
The man was released from prison for $125 a thousand.
It is noted that the shooting of civilians in the United States has become a horrific rule of law.
A man literally launched a shooting at the city centre of Rijkrest, California, right on the street.
After that, the criminal seized the hostages of two accidental passersby, hid them in the trunk of a car, and tried to hide.
Earlier in Newtown's primary school, Connecticut, there was an open fire.
At school, Adam's mom worked, she was an educator.
Shooting at American school: injured 14-year-old girl
A major shooting incident occurred on 31 January at the American school, this time in Anlante, Georgia.
Two people were injured: a 14-year-old student and a teacher.

Halloween 2013 in numbers
When I was little, Halloween was magical.
Our sister and I were allowed to have confetti, not to sleep late, but to set up a mascorad for our area.
Now I look more like a scratch.
I haven't been calling for confessions in the last two years in my apartment, and I'm probably not gonna be here this year.
But statistics show that I'm a white crow to Halloween.
According to the National Federation of Diversification, the majority of Americans — that is, 158 million — will celebrate Halloween this year and spend a total of $6.9 billion in confettes, costumes and decorations.
The only thing I'm waiting for every Halloween is trends.
The National Federation of Divergent Trade predicts that $1.2 billion of the lost $6.9 billion will be spent on costumes.
This year, there are sexual unscrupulous items on the stage of fashion.
Women are no longer required to be representatives of sexual professions; they can also be sex food, such as pizzas, hamburgers or carrots.
As for men, I think we'll see a lot of zombies thanks to the Walking Dead, and I'm sure that the Daf Punk group-style spacecraft will fall into our Instagram tapes this year.
According to Google, costumes that most often look for are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
Please, there's nothing wrong with the traditional approach.
We ordered our dogs last year and, to my surprise, we were not the only ones.
Moreover, according to the National Federation of Diversification, Americans will spend $330 million on pet costumes this year.
That means a lot of funny dog dogs.
When it comes to confiscate, we don't hesitate.
The Americans will spend $1.9 billion this year, according to Nielsen.
It's about 600 million pounds of Hershey chocolate, ice cream, Milk Duds, Twizzlers and Clark Bars.
According to the U.S. Trade Ministry, this is a great news for 41 million demanding confiscators of children who have prepared to obey our areas.
Moreover, we will buy and, if we do not deceive ourselves, eat 90 million pounds of chocolate during Halloween.
The only thing that we don't want to use is confectionery in the form of corn grains; and yet, according to the National Association of Confectioners, almost 35 million pounds are sold under Halloween.
It's about 9 billion individual corn grains.
This is a mystery I still have to tell you.
There's nothing like Halloween, like a house with ghosts.
They have the amazing names, such as the Fear behind the walls (which, by the way, are in this prison), the War and the screams and the Home of Shock.
In addition, according to the American community, there are 1,200 officially recognized homes with an estimated $500 million revenue generation, as well as those exciting photos where you've described almost what your friend has posted on Facebook, and you can't clean up, and then the guy you like sees this photo and leaves a comment like a “classic expression of person”.
And finally, we'll talk about these things.
Charlie Brown introduced us to the Great Tickwa when we were kids, and the cutting off of Jack's lighthouse is like a Christmas tree decoration, what we do from childhood.
Luckily for us, the fashion for the child began only last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up cutting these types, not sitting in them.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, this year the Americans will spend about $106 million on the table.
The lighthouse of Jack, slowly blowing up your wing, probably came from Illinois, which grew 542 million pounds this year.
If you want a more complicated assignment, call Tim and Susan Mattisdon in the city of Napa, California, and try to cut some of their weight by 2032 pounds.
Estonian Minor Defence Site Restored After Ukraine's Hackers Attack
The site of the Ministry of Defence of Estonia has been restored after the morning of cyberattack, reports the press service of the department.
According to the Deputy Minister for Information and Administration of the Ministry of Information and Administration, it was a primitive attack, and the site was simply overloaded by a large number of requests.
Our experts have quickly made up their minds, so far the site has been restored.
"The damage caused to the Ministry is minimal," Petercop told Postimees.
According to Petercop, it is early on that of the attackers.
"We must examine the causes of the incident and make our conclusions, but it is impossible to prevent such incidents," he admitted.
In addition, on 1 November, the Anonymous Ukraine set up a network to support the hacker attack on the Republic of Estonia's Mine Action Site and launched a counter-opportunity against Ukraine and NATO.
We want the NATO leadership to hear our voice, the voice of the Ukrainian people.
We don't have to be NATO servants.
Ukraine does not want to die for the interests of NATO member countries.
Ukraine doesn't need NATO block.
Ukraine does not need the European Union.
Ukraine doesn't need Russia either.
Ukraine must not be a slave.
We are in favour of independent Ukraine.
"The hands of others from Ukraine," says the Anonymous statement.
Formerly, the Ukraine Minobore reported that the mouth of the Marine Pechote of the Feodosian Single Battalion of the Ukrainian Marine Pechote will participate in NATO's command-step learning of the NATO Steadfast Jazz-2013 response force.
A number of schools and hospitals were forced to close because of the violence.
Four schools in the Zimbabwen province of South Matabeleland had to be closed because the students were attacked... by goblins.
As the local elder explained, children panicked, and it was impossible to continue.
The story of goblins may sound like a child's invention for a European, but in Africa it is a very serious argument for closing school.
Adults are also afraid of unclean force.
In the summer, for example, the hospital in Zimbabwe was closed because the hospital was also attacked by goblins.
Advertised Land Rover
Inside there are hooves and six-dimensional safety belts, as well as the internal communication system.
More modernized brakes, a service package that provides access to Bowler Works machines, logistics support and car storage between activities can be obtained.
Dr. Bowler, director of Bowler Motorsport, said: “The participants in the Bowler rally have changed.”
Some of them are not experienced firefighters, but people who are looking for excitement, adventures and access to world-class activities.
We are pleased to propose such a path in partnership with Land Rover and MSA, and we believe that this format offers a new way to try different disciplines of the UK and abroad, as well as to prepare participants to the difficult conditions and realities of the Rally-Rail.
We were delighted to develop the Defender Challenge car — it would be a really interesting championship.
In addition, Defender Challenge provides one day in February for training and testing, as well as an opportunity to participate in activities in the desert in North Africa and the Middle East.
Russian forces don't know anything about the "Bratskir" group - New News
This is written by INTERFAX.RU with reference to an informed source in the law enforcement authorities of the RF.
"After the media reported on the submission by the U.S. Finance Ministry of Leps of the suspect lists belonging to the Eurasian criminal union 'Bratian circle', we reviewed all the databases, but we did not find such a group," said the interviewer of the agency.
In his view, the dissemination of this information contributes to the maintenance of a myth of the so-called Russian mafia, which is likely to operate abroad.
As noted earlier, the U.S. Ministry of Finance published on its website a list of alleged members of the "Bratian Circle " criminal group yesterday.
Among them was the Russian singer Gregory Leps.
He appears in the list as "Shish," put forward.
They match the data of the popular Russian executive.
The exact name is Gregory Lepsevride, the creative pseudonym, the place and date of birth.
Besides, there are five other people mentioned there.
Two Russians, Israeli citizen, Uzbekistan citizen and another exit from the former USSR, whose nationality is not indicated.
In the United States, Gregory Leps, who lives on the island of Phuket, is convinced that he was carrying money for gangs on their orders.
This communication includes a photograph of the singer and all his data that correspond to the facts.
Moreover, Leps actually recently bought a house on Phukete.
The department noted that they intended to impose sanctions on Leps.
Human inclusion in the US Minfin blacklists involves blocking its assets in the United States and prohibiting business contacts with individuals living in the United States.
The assistant of Leps Maya Serikow stated that no notifications had been made to the singer: "It is difficult to answer the question whether it is the Grigori, which everyone is talking about now in connection with the scandal in the United States."
All Leps knows is the media.
He was officially not personally notified, although I do not know whether they were in such cases.
"And, of course, that's all, on the one hand, funny, and on the other -- amazing and unexpected," she said to RIA News.
According to her, Phukete Grigory Leps does not live, but Minfin claims that he has a home on the island of Thailand.
She said that Leps was now on a long journey to the Far East and Siberia, and that news had stopped him during his flight to Blagovesk.
Runaway on the field at the Shinnik match.
Some details have been made known about the identity of the fanatic who escaped in the field during the match 1/16 final of the Russian Cup between the Jaroslav "Shinnik" and the Moscow "Spartak".
According to the head of the CDC, Artur Grigorjánz, referring to the MDDs, the patient is a mosquito.
He's under arrest right now.
"In this way, the Grygorian told us how the fanatic was able to break down in the field: "It was found that this, by the name of his viewer, went to the immediate assistance of the two audiences, referring to the problems with the heart.
He came to our emergency room, and this was confirmed by a doctor.
Then he pushed out two escorts and fled to the field.
He fled from the corner of the East and South Tribunal to the corner of the East and North Tribunal.
He ran all over the field.
That's what the stewards are responsible for.
Prior to the entry into force of the sports law, this area of action of the stewards - the police cannot interfere with what is on the field.
He's got to the court, he's going through the East Court.
At that time, riots began at the Eastern Tribunal and on the runaway roads," said the head of the CDC.
Recall that, by the decision of the CDC, the Moscow Spartak will carry out the upcoming 15th round of the Russian Championship against Locomotiva and Zenita, without spectators, and will pay a fine of 600 thousand rubles.
Fire squads were sent to rescue the lost ham, which stuck 50 feet above ground in a dangerous career.
Koker-Spanish Ruby escaped after falling into a small DTP
Three days later, she got stuck in her career and noticed a man who was a dog.
The firemen went down on the rope on the springlight to save the dog from the imminent death
He was happy to save himself after the fires had been launched to lift him up and deliver him to a safe place, after he somehow stuck at a height of 50 feet on the dangerous entrance of the hanging pit.
The nine-month-old Koker-Spaniel Ruby escaped after she fell into a car accident on Sunday, and spent three days alone before she was rescued from her career on Wednesday.
Her landlord, 25-year-old Scott Alderson, and his 20-year-old friend Becky Holll, were in Fleppitt's career in Denholm, West Yorkshire, to join Ruby, and thanked the West Yorkshire fire department.
They looked for their missing dog and placed treatment on social media sites after she fled for her career after a small accident.
At about 14:15 in the middle of a star dogfight, Ruby noticed a 50-foot delay in the career.
The technical rescue team at the Klekhito fire station rushed to the scene, landed on the ropes to save Ruby, and used the conveyance to lift it up the stairs.
The rescue officer, Andy Clayton, said, “She was in danger.”
It was right in the middle of the spring shelter — 50 feet [50 m] to the top and to the ground.
She didn't move and a muscle during her rescue, she totally stood up.
But now she's fine.
Then she came to the oven.
It was a very unusual challenge.
The fact that the dog has noticed is amazing.
The rescue officer Peter Lau said, "Ruby's been very lucky to have saved her."
It was likely that she could get a very serious injury or worse.
The rubies were brought to the vet for inspection, and it was found to be all right with it, with the exception of decommissioning and decommissioning.
Ms. Holll from Galifaxa, West Yorkshire, said, “Watching the rescue was terrible.”
I couldn't believe she was there at all.
It was amazing when she came back to our hands.
The veterinarian said that if she had become discouraged and lost consciousness, she would probably have fallen.
The fires were magnificent.
It was very brave — what they did.
We are so grateful, and each of them was absolutely awe - inspiring.
Mr. Alderson from the city of Kitley added, "We were afraid that she might fall, but she stayed there."
The fires were amazing.
I just can't believe she was there.
Mick Jagger said he wasn't playing with Katie Perry when she was 18.
During an interview with the Australian radio show this week, a pop-star said she was a bek-vocalist for the 2004 song of Jagger, Old Habits Die Hard.
Perry said she had dinner with the windmill, and she said, "He was playing with me when I was 18 years old."
She said, “It was a long time, and he was very good.”
In a statement on Thursday, a seven-year-old representative of Jagger said that he “categorically denied that he had ever hit Katie Perry.”
The representative added, "It may be she's cheating with someone else."
Perry was among the performers who appeared as guests at the Rolling Stones tour this year.
Her new album Prism debuted in the first place this week.
George Keravan: A break with Europe gives Scottish people a choice
One more day, another threat to independence.
This time we are warned that independent Scotland will have to join the pan-European zone of free movement as a condition of EU membership.
There's a history of passport control in Bervik and a border with a kneeline along Adrian's whale.
True, Strathclyde's newspaper pointed to the potential economic benefits of more free movement across the rest of Europe, although, as foretold, it did not appear in the headlines.
No one also indicated that EU Member States were spending a lot of time on reversing their formal rules as they would like to do.
Since Scotland is not now part of the Schengen area, the continuation of non-compliance will be a cheap replacement for Brussels instead of what it really wanted from the Scottish.
So it's not worth the story.
And so old that she turned into a rock: for the first time, I heard a “outbreak” that “independence means passport control” at least 40 years ago.
And yet there's an interesting moment lost in saying an old story.
Why must the independent Scotland comply with Europe's orders?
Why change London's Yard to Brussels Yard, especially now?
This is the current European news: a major post-war plan to unite Europe has finally stopped.
With a European crisis, the European project is officially dead.
All over the European Union, the anti-EU or euro-denominated parties are gaining power.
Even in Germany, the European Party of Alternatives for Germany — based only this year — emerged from the nude and received nearly five million votes in the September federal elections, thus essentially pushing Free Democrats (like our Liberal Democrats) from Budapest.
There has always been an internal opposition to a federal Europe plan.
Nevertheless, the current economic crisis has become a turning point.
The harsh economic measures introduced by Berlin and the European Central Bank and the environment imposed on national economies by maintaining a single currency have led many people to believe that the European project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments working with excessive budget deficits, which was only fair for Greece.
In fact, the euro system has blocked its members at exchange rates that benefit German exporters, which are German policies and want to preserve.
Without the possibility of devaluing the national currency, southern Europe is facing an unfavourable situation on production opportunities compared with Germany.
The only means of saving is to cut salaries and public expenditures, which is actively supported by Berlin.
The current budgetary and monetary problems are the deeper problem of Europe's productive capacities.
As a result of the "green" energy package introduced by Brussels, the European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times more for gas than for the US.
It's a paralyzing price conditions, as we've seen in Greenmouth.
No global wage freeze will stop the collapse of US cheap salt gas over the European oil industry.
As a result, the rebellion, especially in France, is once the most violent side of the EU.
After the war, the French political elite considered the EU a way to control Germany and put Paris at one level with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a means of obtaining political legitimacy, and has already imposed its own economic policy on Europe, leaving the ruined economy of France in a plight.
The result is the rights against the EU of the Marin Le Pen National Front just won the decisive additional elections by throwing the ruling socialist party to third place.
The Front is now the most popular party in France with 24 per cent of the vote, a timely warning to the British Laborists that there is no reason to assume that the division between the right will automatically benefit the left.
What does Le Pen do with his newfound popularity in the French white working class?
It wants to use EU elections next year to create a bloc in the European Parliament against the EU and against the single currency.
If, and this is very likely, the EU party will receive support in these elections, such a block will be able to take the dominant position in the European Parliament for the first time.
This is my opinion: the rapidly growing attitudes against the EU and against the single currency in Europe are being merged to destroy the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will again become something like the so-called 'European (supervised) nations' that liked General de Goll.
Germany and several economies can preserve the euro, but France and southern Europe will restore their own currencies.
I assume that Britain is distanced from this project, hoping to get closer to the United States.
Nevertheless, Washington ' s growing interest in the Pacific indicates that Britain will remain unfocused in the Atlantic cold.
How does this leave Scotland?
We can choose to be the region (in fact) of Little England.
Or we can protect our own economic interests, which means, besides, sending Berlin and Brussels to hell.
I suspect that Scotland will be able to achieve a more freer European agreement, provided that we retain our currency.
Cooperation with other single countries will be simpler in the non-federal Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should consider repeating Norway's experience and maintaining our economic independence.
The Government of the Scottish National Party in Scotland, however strange, is the most successful political movement in Europe against the harshest economic measures received by the overwhelming majority of votes in 2011, due to objections to the reduction of the costs proposed (and implemented) by the Liberian Chancellor Alister Darling and the subsequent coalition of parties and liberal democracies.
Scotland would now not be good enough to vote for independence only in order to respond to the harsh economy imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early sex creation: early age
African and Latin American girls usually reach sexual maturity earlier than their white vertebrae.
Physical changes do not mean that sex creation is close
No evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe that the obesity epidemic may be one of the early sexual growth mechanisms
The tendency to early sexual maturity is not so pronounced in boys
Former correspondent CNN Pet Eterage is a journalist who specializes in child health and family affairs.
Should the mother be afraid if her daughter begins to develop the start of the milky iron and grows the skull hair at 7 or 8 years of age?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics in Orlando this week, Florida, child endocrinologist Paul Kaplovic explained that these early physical changes were quite common among American girls and constitute a new rule.
“I spend a lot of time calming my parents — this usually doesn’t mean a rapid onset of sexual maturity,” said Caplovitz.
The obvious signs of development, such as growing breasts, lobes, and brain hairs and body smells, appear earlier in girls.
But there was only a small shift in menarche age (first menstrual period) over the past four decades.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years and has decreased from 12.75 in 1970.
“After breast development, it takes at least two or three years to menarche,” said Caplovitz, also author of the book “Rain sex creation in girls: how to deal with this widespread problem.”
Time is the most accurate test of how sex creation will progress.
There is a discussion about what constitutes a real onset of sexual maturity, but it is considered “temporary” when breast enlargement is accompanied by a sharp increase of up to 8 years.
In most cases, the process will slow down or halt — that is, the pediatrician can follow carefully.
More rapid progress could be the basis for analysis of endocrinology in order to eliminate serious problems, such as swellings or cysts.
There are procedures to retain early menstrual periods and to prevent another consequence: premature bone aging, which can eventually slow down growth and low growth in mature age.
The recommendations for drug or hormonal therapy are based on the age of the child, the level of development, the rate of growth and emotional maturity.
Psychiatric aspects are also important.
The caplovitz is careful with medications, but recognizes that “smashing sex can alleviate the behavioral problems and feelings of girls that they are different from those of twins”.
Another major problem is that parents simply do not want their very young daughters to be menstruated.
“They are concerned about the risk of pregnancy or even about how they deal with hygiene issues,” said Kaplovic.
“It was a shock, ” recalls one woman whose daughter began to study at the age of 10.
Although there were signs and we were talking about menstruation, she wasn't emotionally ready.
She came home from school scared and upset that she was the first of her friends.
There are many unclaimed theories about the causes of early sexual creation.
However, there is no consistent evidence that hormones in milk or other foodstuffs, chemicals in the environment or sexual media are responsible.
For boys — as for girls — sexual intercourse occurs earlier.
Capowitz claims that the most important requirement is an epidemic of obesity.
In 2001, he helped to conduct a study of girls aged 6 to 9, which links the number of fats in the body to the periods of sexual growth.
Other data confirm this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.
In this country, African and Latin American girls usually reach sexual maturity earlier than their white vertebrae.
There are different explanations.
In the world, it is apparent that early sexual creation has an impact on everything: from economic conditions and climate to genes.
A further mystery: Although boys have hair on their faces and on their skulls at a younger age, the trend towards early sexual reproduction is not as strong as that of girls.
Other doctors participating in the AAP conference confirmed the complexity of this topic.
The presence of the next and the lobe hair even occurs in infants and children of advanced age.
“We must be careful about how we determine the true appearance of sexual maturity,” said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, child endocrinologist at the Gorieb Children’s Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to receive instructions from a pediatrician about how to talk to their child.
“This may mean earlier than expected, talk,” said Caplovitz.
If you keep calm, your child usually reacts well.
The early flowering girls need to confirm that even when this happens, it is a normal part of life.
The American Boeing who's stuck in China is getting ready to fly out.
The open-air aircraft in the framework of the Treaty of Russia and the unplanned landing of an American aircraft in Chita on Friday, 1 November, at 8:30 p.m., will leave the city at Moscow time.
The airport's management allowed the ship to fly, getting the fuel money.
As reported at the airport, the plane will fly to Ulan Woode.
According to other data, he'll be sent to the United States.
It has been reported that a Ulan-Ude plane landed in the Zabaikaland due to a fog.
He was not released from Chita Airport due to unpaid accounts.
There are 30 people on board, including the crew, who spent two nights at the airport, reports ITAR-TASS.
As reported in IID RF, under the terms of the Open Sky Treaty, people on board the aircraft do not have the right to leave the Chita airport, they can only pass border control at two Russian airports in Cuba and Ulan-Ude.
An open-air treaty was signed in 1992, involving 34 States.
Monitoring flights are carried out over the territories of Russia, the United States, Canada, Europe.
The Treaty ' s main objectives are the development of transparency, the monitoring of arms control agreements, the empowerment of crisis prevention and crisis resolution in the OSCE and other international organizations.
How many late flags - IC in the United States of America IC
The ranking of living celebrities with the highest income in 2013 led Madonna, who earned $125 million.
But it was the late Michael Jackson, whose death income from October 2012 to October 2013 amounted to 160 million.
It is notable that other celebrities who had “worked” a few times less in the past year are absent from it.
The second list of the most "consisting" celebrities produced by Forbes was Elvis Presley, 55 million a year, and the author of the comics by Peanuts Charles Schultz, with 37 million.
In addition, Elizabeth Taylor, a former leader (25 million) last year, and musician Bob Marley (18 million).
The list also included Marilyn Monroe, John Lennon, and Albert Einstein.
In Moscow, Igoria Giaeva's first boutique was discovered
On 23 October, the first flagship was opened in Moscow.
Designer Igory Toyev is widely known for his great luxury mechanized products.
And now they'll be able to appreciate even more fashion fans - in Moscow, his first bottle was finally opened, so the designer and set up a sweet-life party.
I'm sure the most beautiful girls live in Russia.
That's why I'm particularly glad I opened a store in Moscow.
It's not just an office, it's a place where there's really a part of me.
That's what Igori said, he cut the red tape and invited all those who wanted to... to imitate those who looked at the models!
Reactive aircraft manufacturers are hostile to the width of the seat when on the horse large orders
Among the leading aircraft manufacturers, there was a heated dispute about the breadth of the tourist class on long-distance voyages, setting a tone for a severe confrontation at the Dubai Aviation Exhibition this month.
The range of seats provided on the long-distance voyages to the economy-class passengers whose interests are not always at the centre of the aircraft, while the amount of space allocated to them plays a key role in the allegations of the effectiveness of the latest aircraft offered by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
Airbus this week called for an industry standard that would have a width of at least 18 inches (46 cm) in the economy parlors, but its main American competitor Boeing said it should be decided on by the airline.
The slowdown is when aircraft manufacturers compete in the sale of larger versions of their two-engine long-range aircraft, and the events of 17-21 November are expected to include potentially record orders.
The composition of the rear part of the aircraft, especially if 9 or 10 persons are in a row, is central to the declarations on the economic efficiency of new mini-aerobus projects.
Boeing claims that its updated 777X will accommodate 406 people, based on seats in the economic class of more than 17 inches in width of 10 in each row.
Airbus said that the competing version of its A350 would transport 350 people in the economy at 18 inches in length, 9 in a row.
Aerial construction giants are often exchanged with technical issues through professional press advertisements.
And now Airbus is addressing the public directly before the airport in Dubai, where 777X is expected to be a leader with more than 100 orders.
She recently demonstrated what could be the beginning of a new advertising war by showing the financiers a slide depicting three people in a restaurant invited to each other, entitled “Would you agree to this?”
“Boeing offers further master flights in lower seats than in regional turbojets,” said the sales manager Airbus John Lihi.
With a change in diet, people take weight, but aircraft seats have not changed dramatically.
By the early 1970s, when Boeing 747 had set standards for modern travel, and a century abroad, the weight of the average American man from 40 to 49 years of age had increased by 10 per cent, according to the United States Department of Health.
The size of the size of the 21st-century U.S. average man is 39.7 inches, according to the statistics of the United States Health Service.
Airbus claims that its competitor is in line with the concept of the 1950s seats, when the average coverage of those recently called “reactive audiences” has already been.
Airbus said that a study suggested that additional smoke in the seating area would improve the quality of sleep by 53 per cent.
Boeing contests Airbus figures on seat sizes and says that manufacturers are not required to interfere in deciding how airlines find a balance between tariffs and amenities.
According to her, studies show that the comfort of the living room depends not only on the width of the seat.
“All is really about providing airlines with the choice and opportunity to do what they think they should do to achieve success,” said expert Boeing at the Kent Craver salons.
They don't want us to decide for them what's gonna make them pay.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For passengers, the issue is to increase the space on their sides, but for suppliers it is becoming increasingly a factor that can affect profits.
This dispute is worth running for aircraft orders estimated at at least $700 billion at catalogue prices in the next decade — enough to change the ratio of American and European exports.
As Reuters reported for the first time in July, the presence of seats is precisely what warms up competition in the fight between the latest reactive aircraft.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim a 20 per cent increase in the profits of one place in their last two motor remote master models compared to the market leader in this segment, the 365-local Boeing 777-300ER.
The Boeing characteristics are partly based on the comparison of the 10-place rows of 777X with the original 9-place composition of the 777 series of constructive solutions.
Winning in a separate value is reduced compared to the ten-place component currently used.
"The reason Boeing does this is to push more places and make his plane more competitive than ours," said Kevin Kenston, head of the Airbus Comfort Department in Europe.
On the other hand, analysts say that lounges with a full 10-seat range for the existing 777s indicate that many passengers prefer a flat landing that can go hand in hand with lower tariffs.
“The 18-inch seats would be ideal for passengers, but the reality is that the Airbus proposal is, in a commercial sense, a threat from the 777th model,” said a specialist at the Mary Kirby salon, founder and editor of the Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not provide chairs, but offer a list of suppliers from which airlines can choose.
Reactive aircraft vendors travel around the world even drive their roulettes to check competitive planning.
All manufacturers also offer very flat-rate aircraft for budget airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers A350 with 10-place lines, but says she hasn't sold it yet.
Airbus has recently stressed the need for additional salons modifications, offering more space for passage on some of its aircraft.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of major modern aircraft, experts say, its call for a new industry standard would hardly be “flighted” but could draw attention to the wave of sales of model 777X.
A new anticoagulant vaccine may reduce the process of smoking pleasure
Scientists have developed an anti-inflammatory vaccine that could stop smoking a cigarette of pleasure.
One dose of the vaccine has been able to protect the mouse from nicotine dependence on life.
Further tests are needed before tests are started on people, which will take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal from the Medical College of Weil Cornell in New York said the first results were encouraging.
“We very much hope that such a vaccination strategy can finally help millions of chickens who have tried to quit by testing all the methods available on the market today, but have found that their nicotine dependence is strong enough to overcome it with these modern tools,” said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been developed to carry genetic information for the production of antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then begin to produce a stable antibody flow.
Antithela detects any nicotine molecules in the blood, neutralizing them before they reach the brain, preventing the receiving of nicotine.
In the tests, vaccinated mice, which were subsequently given nicotine, continued their normal activities.
And the mice, which did not give the vaccine, “depressed,” and this is a sign that nothing came to their brains, the researchers say.
These experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
The previous tobacco vaccines were unsuccessful because they contained antibodies.
In order to maintain a high level of antibodies, it was necessary to do so often that they were expensive and impractical.
But the value of the new vaccine is likely to be much lower because it converts fuel cells into antibodies.
Professor Kristall said that if the future human vaccine was completely safe, it could be given to children before they would have a desire to try a cigarette, preventing nicotine addiction.
But it's more likely to be used by smokers to quit smoking.
“They will know that if they start smoking again, they will not get the pleasure of it because of the nicotine vaccine, and this can help them get rid of this habit,” he said.
British scientists said that the results were interesting, but warned that further research was needed.
Oilseeds: third villages Sub-Moscow fully additional
Deputy Governor of Sub-Moscow Yuri Olenik stated that almost three thirds of the village settlements in the Moscow area were fully complementary
Total contributions from the region budget are 187 settlements from 288.
In 2013, 187 settlements from 288 receive grants from the regional budget.
The separate amount of grants in the budget of 122 rural settlements exceeds 50 per cent and 83 per cent of the total.
Approximately 25 billion rubles are sent from the area budget," Olenikov said.
The Deputy Governor also noted that only three urban settlements -- Omitich, Odinzovo and Puškyno -- amounted to more than 1 billion rubles in 2013.
The income of rural settlements in many areas is less than 3 million rubles, “this is not enough at all”.
The cost of maintenance of the local administrative unit in 88 settlements in Podmozkovya is over 70 per cent, “but there is a decline in the quality of services”, Olenikov noted.
He had previously instructed the heads of municipal education of Podmovski by the end of November to consider which settlements needed to be demolished, joined in urban districts or changed the administrative system.
These proposals will be drawn up by the end of January.
To date, the Governor of Moscow said that under the administrative reform in Podmoskova, it was planned to reduce the number of additional rural settlements.
Also in Mojaysk, Kasher, Sunnykirsk, Colombia, Lübercz and Kotelnik, there is a demand for a population of municipalities.
This issue will begin in November in cities and regions of the region.
The President of Mozambique, Mr. Igor Brendalov, also said that, in the context of the ongoing reform, there were about 30 rural settlements in 12 areas of Sub-Moscow.
This is related to the fact that fewer thirds of 178 rural settlements in Sub-Moscow have an "acceptable" financial base and 100 are additional.
Diana Arbenina divorced Halloween with her children
Diana Arbenina does not hide the great pleasure she derives from raising her children.
Although Arbenina now spends a lot of time on creativity and public activities, she still has the opportunity to drive with Martha and Art, and not only spends time on their training, but also enjoys as much as possible.
During the last week, Diane was reported to her worshipers twice about her pedagogical talents.
She first posted a photo in Facebook that shows how she teaches children to read.
And yesterday, she had the fans, showing how she had ordered Arthur and Martha to Halloween.
Our first Halloween," Diana called a picture of her children dressed in festive costumes.
Which is unwise, because they, like any other Russian boys and girls, are related to this holiday because they were born in America.
Germany introduces the first "undefined sex" in Europe when registering children
Germany will be the first country in Europe to be allowed to register children born with fermaphrodites instead of male or female to indicate “undefined”.
The parents of the child will have the right of time to leave the "pol" graph in the birth certificate.
Instead of "F" (female gender) or "M" (male gender) parents may write "X" (unspecified).
This decision is intended not to force parents to rush into a gender-enhancing operation.
According to statistics, one of the 2,000 newborns in the world is born with a hermaphrodite.
Tripods deny that they are under the influence of Obaid
The former Minister of Labour of New South Wales Joe Tripodi will be a figure in the investigation of the State ' s anti-corruption supervisory body.
The former Minister of New South Wales, Joe Tripodi, objected to the introduction of changes in the rental of marine objects at the request of his political teacher, Eddie Owayda, secretly owned three properties on the State land.
The Independent Commission against Corruption (ICAC) expanded its investigation on Friday whether Mr. Owayd had awarded several state ministers the extension of the Serkullar Ki lease, where the Owayd family had two restaurants and coffee, without passing the tender after their expiry in August 2005.
She is now investigating allegations that Mr. Tripodi knew of Mr. Obaid's secret participation in real estate facilities, after evidence given by the former Deputy Head of Administration, Mr. Tripodi Linn Espoul, on Thursday.
During several years of discussions that began in 2005, the Government insisted that the rent be held at an open competition.
The tenants objected, as well as wanted longer rental time.
In 2009, the leases of enterprises to Serkyular Ki, who brought the Obeid family about $2.5 million a year, were extended without an open competition.
Mr. Tripodi, who served as Minister of Infrastructure and Transport from February 2006 to November 2009, initially spoke for open competitions.
But he denied that the changes had been made at the request of Mr. Obeida, who, as Mr. Tripodi recognized, urged the Government to make changes in its rental policy.
In August and September 2007, the proposed ICAC encrypted telephone conversations between Mr. Obaid, Mr. Tripodi and Mr. Steve Dan, who came to the Ministry of Ports after working under the leadership of Mr. Obaid in the Fisheries Division.
“Was there a question that had been discussed during these telephone conversations about the development of commercial rental policies?” asked Assistant Commissioner Anthony Willie, Mr. Tripodi.
"No," said Mr. Tripodi.
I can't remember what was discussed, but it certainly wasn't.
It's definitely not between me and Mr. Obaid.
According to the high-ranking official, Israeli military aircraft are attacking targets within Syria
The high-ranking official of the Administration in Fox News' interview confirmed that Israeli military aircraft hit the Syrian port city of Latakia on Thursday evening.
The officer didn't make it clear that it was a goal, but he said it was at least one.
Associated Press reported that the purpose of the Russian production rockets SA-125 was to be achieved.
At least twice this year, Israel carried aircraft on cargo with rockets inside Syria.
Foreign work on sub-class 457 visas may be tested on “defence”
The “defence” test for foreign workers on Class 457 visas is under consideration by the Government, as it intends to expand the repressive measures.
This test, if adopted, will be applied on the criteria for preventing the use of a Class 457 visa to fill unqualified posts or as a latrine for family and friends to move to Australia.
The document submitted by the Government for discussion was published today, while former Lebanese MP Maxine McKu criticized the Government ' s rhetoric about foreign workers, said it could offend the neighbours of Australia.
“A large number of “foreigners – in the end” and “at the beginning of the work of Australians” are a very unpleasant response to the times when trade unions demanded a protected labour market,” she told the Institute “Australia – India” today.
Historically, that meant that white work had to be protected — and I would not be surprised if some in the region saw the response of this historic artifact.
The document presented for discussion contains 12 measures previously considered by former Minister of Immigration Chris Bowen.
The Minister of Immigration Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday, where he met with officials on human trafficking, had already made five of the recommended changes and the others were in the process of consideration.
If the “delegation” criteria are adopted, the visa applicant will be able to examine whether “there is a true candidate under conditions where the applicant is a relative or a close friend or a person having a relationship with the financing of the enterprise”.
Entrepreneurships may also be required to account for the number of visa holders in sub-class 457, since earlier enterprises intended to sponsor a small number of workers were then employed by hundreds.
In the meantime, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan seeking refuge died allegedly from a heart attack after arriving on a boat with refugees on the island of Christmas this week.
The man’s nine - year - old son who was killed was accompanied by him on his way to Australia, and since his father’s death on Wednesday, he has been supported by a twin brother who was also on board the ship.
The Australian authorities rushed the man to the hospital on the island of Christmas, where he died.
Comrade Semen Varlamova claimed that hockey suffers from alcoholism
A friend of the hockey player, Semen Varlamov Evgenia Vavrinuk, said that he was suffering from alcoholism, handed over to the Russian News Service.
"He has no idea how to stop drinking," said a woman in particular.
It is recalled that Vavrinuk has been tried for defeating a Russian football player, Semen Varlamov, also a member of the Colorado Club.
According to her, the hockey player took her by the hair, and also beat her after the attack, her hands, chest, life, and neck were damaged.
Varlamov himself came with a warrant to the Denver Police and confessed to the beating, detailing the incident.
He was arrested, but then released for $5,000.
The court did not restrict athletes in the country ' s movements, but prevented them from approaching Vavrinuk.
He was also threatened with imprisonment for up to 6 years for domestic violence.
The UK Government announced a study aimed at increasing the economic impact for Scotland on the HS2 railway highway project.
The HS2 project involves the opening of high-speed communications with Scotland and northern England, with the beginning of the First Stage in 2026.
The Minister of Transport Baronessa Kramer noted that the draft “United Kingdom”.
The Minister of Transport of Scotland, Kit Brown, said he was “in the rush” from the perspective of work on the plan with the British Government.
The first phase will be to build a new high-speed rail line between London and West Midlands.
When the Second Stage is completed, the lines will be placed in Manchester and Lids.
In June, the Government revised the estimated value of building a high-speed line between London and northern England from £327.7 to £42.6 billion.
The British Government, which negotiates with Transport Scotland, has commissioned HS2 Ltd to consider further improving the transit capacity of the railway and reducing the length of travel to North England and Scotland.
This should include the possibility of overcoming the road from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London in three hours or less.
Baronessa Kramer said, "Our goal of HS2 is to create a more existing national network that will make Britain and its city closer to each other."
We are developing HS2 because the benefits it will bring are huge.
Without it, we will face a crisis of ability in our rail network.
But it is also about urban transport; throughout Britain, 18 cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, will receive a better communication thanks to HS2.
The Scottish Secretary Alister Carmaile added: “Today’s announcement is good news for Scotland.”
On behalf of the Scottish Government, Kit Brown urged Mr. Carmela to support the inclusion of Scotland in the HS2 network.
Mr. Brown said: “The high-speed railway has every chance to bring enormous economic benefits to Scotland, but it also adds the economic weight of Scotland to the general argument for the high-speed railway across the UK.”
We are therefore pleased to work in partnership with the British Government to consider options for the construction of high-speed railways in Scotland, the creation of benefits for all and the continuation of the railway line of Glasgow, Edinburgh, already planned by the Scottish Government.
I look forward to examining the results of the study with the British ministers next year and taking joint action on the following steps.
Thorius is a new hope for nuclear energy?
Governments around the world continue to think about how to provide energy needs.
The burning of hydrocarbons has a negative impact on the climate.
Renewable energy sources require large areas for generation.
Atomic energy is running without it, but it leaves behind the mass of the roads in waste disposal.
Scientists have recently drawn attention to the area - another radioactive element of the Mendelev system.
He is meeting around the world, and according to experts, he does not leave the waste that has to be kept for centuries.
Rules for the use of electronic devices on aircraft in Australia as long as they remain in force
Passengers of Australian airlines will need to continue to exclude their plates and smartphones during take-off and landing, despite US mitigation measures concerning the devices.
The US Federal Aviation Administration has allowed US carriers to change their procedures in such a way that passengers can read electronic books, watch videos or play games on their devices during take-off and landing, provided they remain in the Flight regime.
Passengers can already do this during the main part of the flight, but many are disappointed that they do not have access to their electronic books during the flight and landing.
Australian carriers are considering this decision, which requires American airlines to carry out a huge amount of work to meet new requirements, but have indicated that they do not plan to change their procedures in the near future.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also noted that they considered this statement, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical phases of flight are still in operation in Australia.
“The safety management of civil aviation flights currently does not have special rules governing the use of electronic devices in aircraft,” it said.
The issue is governed by rules that require air carriers to maintain safety at any time and by passengers to comply with the safety rules reported to them by crew members.
Virgin, who had already discussed with the Civil Aviation Safety Office the expansion of her entertainment system on board with Wi-Fi, was not against change, but stated that it would follow the direction of the regulator.
“We would welcome the consideration by the Civil Aviation Safety Office of the issue of allowing electronic devices, because we really think that this will improve the quality of customer service now that it (the wireless wireless system) is on our aircraft”, the press secretary said.
Qantas stated that it would remain in force for the time being.
“Our current policy is that electronic devices cannot be used during landing and landing, and we are not planning to change it soon,” she said.
The FAO regulation applies to American airlines.
Nevertheless, we are always interested in regulatory changes that could benefit passengers, and we will certainly look carefully at the decision of the FAO and the reasons for it.
For U.S. carriers, the impact of the order will vary from the airline to the airline and will depend on the age of their airport.
Carriers will have to prove that their aircraft have the sustainability of mobile radio-missiles, as well as to review the benefits, training materials, the rules for the carriage of hand bearings and instructions for passengers.
“After the airline checks and confirms the flexibility of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use portable, easy-to-use electronic devices such as tablets, e-books and smartphones at any height,” FAU said.
In rare cases, the crew will give instructions to passengers to turn off their devices during landing.
In addition, according to the group's recommendation, heavier devices should be placed under seats or in upper baggage compartments during take-off and landing.
Dagestan's head is heard in Cuba's gym notes of extremism
A football match between Anji and Cuba has emerged into a political conflict between the authorities of the Krasnodar province and Dagestan after the ills had burned the Dagestan flag, and the Cuban Gym sounded different.
The head of Dagestan Ramazan Abdulatipi on Thursday invited the Republican parliamentarians to court because the Krasnodar province's gymnastics are allegedly calling for international diversity, in particular for the war with the "Basurmans".
Take the Krasnodarian Gym, it was approved in 1995 in our time.
It's the same scene, and no one's doing it.
"Mentioning you here, as a mother of a relative, as an enemy, as we go to the Basurmanina, we are going to the battle of death" - for which such words are to be recorded in the gymnastics, to harm some believers to other believers," he expressed his solidarity with the Abdullah President of Parliament, Hizri Shissaidov.
Putin earned impunity for his friend Assad
Now, the news from the ocean, namely Syria, where, as we know today, Israel hit Russian production rockets, which are reportedly meant to be Hezbollah.
Today, Syria has fulfilled an important condition of destroying its production of chemical weapons by 1 November.
This was done within the framework of an agreement reached through Russia and the United States not to carry out a military operation to which they had been involved this summer.
More details on weapons and what all this means to the Syrian President will be told by our chief international correspondent, Richard Angel.
Washington said the Assad regime would be punished for that.
More than 1,400 peacekeepers, including hundreds of children, were killed in August by poisonous gas.
And the punishment has come.
But not in the form of American bombings, but in the form of a deal set up by a friend of Asada - Vladimir Putin.
Syria will withdraw from its chemical weapons until the middle of next year.
And today is an important time.
The Group of International Experts reported that Syria had taken out of the construction of the declared chemical production plant.
A longer and more difficult task is the destruction of tons of chemical weapons and its components.
We understand it's about a thousand tons.
Washington used to say that the days of Assad were considered.
I think Assad has to go.
The question is not whether this happens, but when it happens.
He's no longer a legit, and he has to leave.
But Assad stays.
And he feels even more confident.
His troops continue to use artillery, rockets, and napalm.
His opponents are spread out and badly armed.
His people are forced to leave their homes, many starving.
Some have to feed on leaves and baskets.
Many believe that Bashar Assad escaped the punishment of mass murder.
The Chemical Weapons Agreement is called a success of diplomacy, the Inspectors were sentenced to the Nobel Peace Prize, and Assad himself made a man’s impression ready for cooperation.
Today, the US Ambassador to Syria in Washington had to answer questions that were not simple.
When a child dies of hunger, his mother is hardly easier than he was killed by chemical weapons.
Assad will hold.
And he's turning weapons into power.
President of the RF created a separate Ministry of Construction and CWC
The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, established a new ministry that was responsible for the construction and construction of the ZKH and proposed that his former governor in the Ivanov area of Michael Menu be chaired in the personal meeting.
The President met with Mikhail Mem at a residence in Novo-Ogarevo, and I did not refuse to take the lead in the new department.
The President of Russia's Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov explained that all construction and CCH functions were transferred to the new Ministry from the region.
Michael Men, the son of a well - known Orthodox priest, Alexander Manya, finished the Moscow Institute of Petroleum called Gubkin.
Since 1995, his political career has begun - he has been elected in the Moscow regional word from the Sergiovo-Posada region, has been a Member of the State Duma, the first Deputy Prime Minister of the Government of Moscow, the Deputy Prime Minister of the Government of Moscow.
From 2005 to 16 October 2013, Michael Menh was Governor of Ivanov.
The owners of the camps in Singapore are doing well, while the middle class is experiencing difficulties.
At the Bendemir shopping mall in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga lays a gold bracelet, ring and string to pay for her daughter's school education.
"My husband and I just bought a house, so all my money is put in there," says Mrs. Amirthaling.
Although she earns S$3000 ($2400) per month as an administrator and her husband also works, the monthly income of the family is not enough, she says.
Indeed, the demand in various parts of South-East Asia, where the debt of households is growing, is such that ValueMax, where it is making its deal, has become the third stamp registered at Singapore's stock exchange this week.
The loan for Jewelry products is not just a quick way to get money (S$1300 in the case of Ms. Amirthaling), but as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
In Singapore, slabs usually account for an effective annual interest rate of 17 per cent, more than 15.4 per cent proposed by the United Overseas Bank, a local creditor with a branch in the same shopping centre.
However, breakbars have the advantage that they do not require creditworthiness or pay evidence and can issue credits faster than banks.
Thus, millions of people throughout the region are being crushed because families feel pressured by the increased cost of living and the rapid increase in household and consumer debt.
After five years of sustainable growth followed by the global financial crisis, and the economic loans that have been subject to free monetary policy in developed economies, low and medium-income families are being turned into thresholds to compensate for income reductions as their economies are slowing down.
This week, Standard & Poor's, a rating agency, indicated an increase in the family credit shoulder, mainly due to the increase in the mortgage, as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
It stated that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest ratio of long households to gross domestic product in Asia.
Malaysia led this list from 80 per cent of GDP compared to 60 per cent in 2008.
Economists are also concerned about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which was barely from a technical recession this week.
On Thursday, the data showed a continued decrease in exports and a decrease in consumer demand.
“The view is that with rising prices, people in the middle and lower [income scale] will look for ways to fill their income wherever they can,” says Song Seng Wun, economist CIMB, Malaysian bank.
The record of high gold prices in the last two years has increased the speed with which people spend their personal belongings, as they use the opportunity to get money for their family decorations.
In Singapore, about 70 per cent of the items placed in 200 city-state stamps are gold products.
People say, "The price of gold is good, let's put the gold chain on the granny and get it back in the next month."
In Thailand, the largest operator of EasyMoney Brokers has seen an increase in the number of customers using its offices in the last few months, up to 20 per cent.
Growth in the stock market such as the ValueMax, the office operator in Bendemire and 15 others in Singapore, is planning to expand not only in neighbouring Malaysia, where it has four shops, but also outside Asia, says Yeah Li Ching, Executive Director of ValueMax.
The company will finance an increase of 60 per cent of the S$66 million involved this week as a result of the placement of shares on Singapore's stock exchange.
While some creditors have been criticising fire for high interest rates, Ms. Yeah said that not only does the Brombar offer cheaper tariffs than other creditors, it also does not increase the debt directly.
“ Clients are investing the items they already own, and the montization of personal assets does not increase the debt of households,” she says.
The loan is gaining increasing public recognition as a means of obtaining short-term, secure funding.
However, there are not only categories of people who are in a difficult financial situation.
The wealthy people in Singapore also use the ValueMax offices, building gold tiles or Rolex hours, which can give up to 60 per cent of their purchases in cash.
We see clients from all walks of society.
“They include skilled people who need to make short-term money for commercial projects or investments, or small businesses who need to overcome temporary cash difficulties,” says Ms. Yeah.
Sometimes they just need the money very quickly.
It is important for the population today, not the number and status of existing medical institutions, but the quality of medical care provided.
The implementation of the "Modernization of Health in the Tullian Region 2011-2013" programme, the reorganization of the health facilities in our city will provide an optimal structure for the provision of health care to the population, including gynecological pain, pregnancy and childbirth.
Thus, after joining the cemetery, there was an even greater possibility of attracting narrow specialists from the NHCB GHG to consult with various pathologies, conducting additional hospital-based surveys.
During the modernization programme, the logistic base of the home was significantly improved, and modern equipment conforming to world standards appeared.
In those years, about 8 million rubles were allocated for the capital repair of the premises, and 112 units of equipment were purchased at 42 million rubles.
The most modern equipment is equipped with an intensive post for newborns.
The Sell-Sever machine is used during the operation of the cutting process to collect blood from the surgery wound and, after special treatment, to return it to its cousin while avoiding blood transfusions.
Modern equipment is also equipped with a clinical laboratory diagnostic unit.
The women ' s consultation has an electronic register, and e-cards and patient history are expected to be introduced in the near future.
The development of telemedicine enabled the consultation of gynecological patients, pregnant women, infants and newborns with field specialists.
Chechens killed and robbed 60 prostitutes in Strasbourg
Citizens of Chechnya were arrested by the French police on suspicion of serial assaults on prostitutes.
The investigation has been carried out since March of the current year.
Some 60 women were invited to attend the caucasian event.
The gangs reportedly ordered a prostitute in one of the Strasbourg hotels and then killed and robbed them.
The gang leader was a 27-year-old Judge of Chechnya.
The defender of Bavaria David Alaba became the best sportsman in Austria in 2013, reports the official site of the Bundesligi.
In this dispute, he preceded the winter sports representatives who traditionally became the best in the country.
The second place was taken by the climber Marcel Hirschher, and the third one was lying on the floor with Gregor Schlerenzauer's tramp.
In the past season, a 21-year-old Austrian Filipino-Nigerian had helped his team to win the League of Champions, Championships and Kubque Germany, as well as the UEFA Supercubation.
ex-wife Archavin's breathing with an actor André Chad
An ex-citizen's footballer, Andrey Arshavien Julia Baranovski, is on a vacation with actor Andrey Chad.
Julia breathes in Italy in the company of actress Anastasia Zaire, her female figure Sergei Slavov, and actor Andrei Chadova.
The photos from the co-walks of the couple are published in Instagram Anastasia of the Road.
It's not the first joint photograph of Andre and Julia.
On 5 October, the Railway published a photo on which the couple stood on the bank of the Finnish Gulf in Comarov.
In mid-October, the Hawbek "Zenita" and Andrew Arshavin admitted that they lived separately from their civilian wife, Julia.
It is recalled that Julia Baranovski and Andrei Arshavin have been together since 2003, with three children.
It has recently become known that Archawin meets with former model Alice Kazmin.
The new friend Archavin was married to the top manager of the corporation.
Savings package $325 million for the health of Tasmania
The Federal Government insists that the $325 million relief package for the weakened health system of Tasmania will be complemented by harsh conditions that guarantee that the Government of the State will not spend its resources in vain.
The Federal Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek announced that the Commonwealth is taking “external measures” to prevent the crisis caused by the ageing of the population of that island state, the higher levels of chronic diseases and system constraints.
The funding decision was taken for four years after the Government's consultation with the independent deputy of Tasmania, Andrew Wilke.
“The government has proposed a package of emergency rescue measures, which we believe will address the specific problems facing the state,” Mrs. Plibersek said today.
The $325 million package includes $31 million in the front company for planned operations.
Another 2,600 operations, including orthopedic and cataract removal, will help to overcome delay.
There is also money for clinics that receive unannounced patients, in Hobart and Lonseston, to improve the quality of care after the station, training medical professionals, mental health services and the introduction of personal electronic health cards in local hospitals.
“These investments will be carried out by the leading doctors on how to better assist the health system of Tasmania,” said Ms. Plibersek.
The Minister insisted that the Government of Tasmania should work in strict reporting and accountability.
The State would need to maintain current funding levels to receive the money from the Commonwealth and to report on where it would spend those additional funds on a monthly basis.
A three-person commission will be set up to ensure that the state provides services as efficiently and as effectively as possible.
Mr. Wilke said today that $325 million would not be resolved unless they were followed by a genuine reform that would put the Tasmanian health system on a more sustainable basis.
Nevertheless, he commended the Government for responding to his request for urgent assistance, with which he first addressed the Prime Minister in early May.
“I hope that the federal aid package will significantly contribute to the conclusion of this state’s health system from a critical point of view,” said Mr. Wilke.
According to the Government, these additional sampling procedures compensate significantly for recent reductions.
But the Federal opposition health representative, Peter Datton, believes that today's statement is “a decision similar to that of a lacoplaster”.
"The reason we're here is that the Government of the state has wasted $430 million of the health system," he told ABC TV.
When the State Government spends almost half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth invests 300 million, it cannot be assumed that it is good news.
Mr. Datton asked Ms. Plibersek to ensure that no dollar from the rescue package would be spent on additional bureaucracy.
The screening by Giome Niklu Romana Dani Didro can be accepted with exceptional order and historical details, but it is also more difficult to understand than it should have been.
The film, which took place in France in the 1760s, tells the dark story of Susanna, a young aristocrat who was sent to the monastery of her family.
When she begins to rebel, she suffers extreme cruelty at the hands of the satisfier and becomes the object of erotic fantasies for others.
The film is never abandoned before, and that is the whole problem.
Due to its severe festiveness, the wearer is at risk of being tested for the type of intruder and for the auditor.
Syria has destroyed its chemical weapons, the Monitoring Group says
Syria destroyed the main equipment for the production of chemical weapons and gaseous ammunition, declared the International Monitoring Group on Thursday, while severe collisions were raging in the north of the country, near one of the sites where toxic substances were thought to be stored.
Also on Thursday, the Syrian group of activists stated that more than 120,000 people had been killed since the beginning of the civil war in the country nearly three years ago.
Statement by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons was made within one day
the deadline of 1 November, established by the Hague-based organization for Damascus to destroy or “incapacitate” all chemical weapons and mechanisms to mix chemicals with depleting gas and fill them with ammunition.
The completion of what is at the core of the initial phase of destruction is an important milestone in an ambitious schedule that aims to destroy all the chemical weapons of Damascus by mid-2014.
The destruction of equipment means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
Nevertheless, the destruction of existing weapons and stockpiles still needs to be begun by Damascus.
The country is believed to have about 1,000 metric tons of chemicals and weapons, including bitter gas and nerve paralytic gas.
This statement was made during the severe fights in the city of Sapphira on Thursday, which, in the opinion of the experts, was the subject of chemical weapons production, as well as its storage sites, reported by the Syrian Centre for the Protection of Human Rights based in Britain.
A group of activists, who had been tracking the loss through the network of activists in Syria, said on Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
Of these, 61,067 were civilians, including 6365 children.
On the part of the Government, the group stated that 29,954 persons were members of the armed forces of President Bashar Asada, 18 678 were pro-government fighters and 187 were Lebanese fighters Hezbollah.
Also among the victims, as stated in the statement, were 2202 military survivors and about 5375 opposition fighters, many of whom were aliens.
According to the UN estimate of 25 July, 100,000 died in conflict since March 2011.
Since then, this figure has not been updated.
The conflict forced some 2 million people to flee the country.
Assad's troops fought in Sapphira several weeks with rebels, many of whom were associated with Al-Qaida groups.
The Centre stated that there were victims on both sides on Thursday, but did not bring any specific data.
The paints highlighted the danger faced by chemical weapons inspectors, driven by the time-consuming deadlines of their mission to rid Syria of the toxic arsenal, in the ongoing civil war.
The OPCW statement, which works in close cooperation with the United Nations, said that its team was “now satisfied that it had examined and seen all the critical means of production and equipment for mixing/supply destruction by Syria”.
She added that “no additional inspection activities are currently planned”.
Earlier this week, inspectors stated that they had completed the first round of verification work by visiting 21 of the 23 sites claimed by Damascus.
They were unable to visit two places for security reasons, the inspectors said.
On Thursday, OPCW stated that both seats were, according to the Syrian declaration, “prohibited and... items of the chemical weapons programme contained therein were moved to other declared places that were checked”.
It was not immediately possible to find out if there was an object in Sapphira in one of the two places that OPCW inspectors had not been able to visit.
Syria introduced a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, to be approved by the OPCW Executive Committee next month.
“I welcome the courage and courage that you have all demonstrated in carrying out the most complex mission ever undertaken by this organization,” said Ahmet Uzumji, Director-General of the Monitoring Group, in a comment published by the WHO.
For the third year of the civil war, the rebels, mainly the Sunni Muslims, with the Government of Assad and its security forces, who are members of its Alavites, have responded to Shiite Islam.
With regard to other events, the head of Rami Abdurrahman's centre said that there was a strong explosion on the environment at the PWO site in the coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion is unknown, he said.
I was angry because of the sentence of the terrorist organizers in Bali.
The remaining 202 survivors and relatives of the bombing in Bali in 2002 were furiously responding to the sentence issued by the last of the prosecutors before the court and stated that Umar Patek should be shot.
The Patek, who had been running for almost 10 years, as one of the most wanted people in South-East Asia, was sentenced to 20 years ' imprisonment for his role in the creation of explosive devices used during the attack.
It may be released within 15 years if it is granted conditional release.
The 45-year-old judge was found guilty of mass killings as a result of a two-night attack at a popular tourist area in Kuta, where 202 people, including 88 Australians, were killed and tens were injured.
He was also found guilty of a number of other terrorist-related charges, including the explosions of churches throughout Indonesia in the Canon of Christmas in 2000.
The prosecutors demanded a lifetime, although they could insist that the person who was called the “slipper” for his reputation as an explosive master should be sentenced to death.
This decision has exacerbated the painful memories of the mother of Perth Jun Cortin, who lost her 39-year-old twin and Jenny's twins in the attack by Patek and his associates almost ten years ago.
She could hardly hold back her tears, and she said that Patek had to be sentenced to death.
“I really believe that he should follow the steps of other men.
He has to stand before the firing squad," said Ms. Cortin AAP.
"I have to live every day, knowing that I will have no more grandchildren, and I will not see my daughters."
The Sari Club was destroyed when a massive explosive device was put into the parked outside of the van immediately after 11 a.m. on 12 October 2002.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's bar, where a terrorist bomber blew up a rifle that was launched by an explosion just 20 seconds earlier.
After that, he fell into a coma and died three times a month, being connected to the life insurance system.
Mr. Hughes said that Patek had to share in the three other members of the terrorist cell "Jemaa Islamia", responsible for the bloody battle, "Amroz, Muhlas and Imam Samudra", who had been sentenced four years ago.
In fact, this guy deserves the death penalty most of all.
To keep him alive, well, there's no reason to keep him alive.
Getting 20 years after killing 202 people and hurting hundreds is not so much.
The Patek is the last of the parties to the act in Bali to be brought before the court.
He hid for almost ten years, but was finally detained in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where US troops killed former head of Al-Qaeda Usam Ben Laden less than four months later.
During the trial, the FBI agent showed that the investigation showed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet Ben Laden in an attempt to restore ties between South-East Asia and Al-Qaida terrorist groups.
"He didn't give up," said Mrs. Cortin.
Until recently, he had not regretted how much he had done to others.
A sentence was given in advance of the 10th anniversary of the treaty, to be observed later this year in Bali and Australia.
“There will be a lot of tears this year,” said Ms. Cortin.
The Patek can still challenge his sentence.
FAU: Air passengers can now use boys on aircraft (but not on mobile phone)
Air passengers will be able to use their electronic devices throughout the flight to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music, but not talk on mobile phones, according to the long-term new guidelines published by the Fourth Federal Aviation Administration.
But passengers should not expect changes to happen immediately.
As soon as such a change is made, it will vary depending on the airline, said FAO Administrator Michael Wert at the press conference.
The airlines will have to show FAU how their aircraft complies with the new guidelines and that they update their flight crew training allowances and device regulations in order to comply with the new guidelines.
FAU stated that it had already received plans from some airlines to increase the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue were among the airlines who had already introduced plans.
“ Depending on the state of the plan, we could approve the expansion of the use of electronic devices very soon,” FAU said.
Passengers are currently required to unlock their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the aircraft door is closed.
They shall not be re-started until the aircraft reaches 10,000 feet and the captain will not “good”.
Passengers must turn off their devices again when the aircraft is lowered for landing and not include them until the aircraft appears on the ground.
In accordance with the new guidelines, aircraft whose aircraft are adequately protected from electronic interference may allow passengers to use these devices during take-off, landing and rolling, FAU stated.
Most new aircraft and other aircraft modified so that passengers can use high-speed Wi-Fi are expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Shipowners, welcomed these changes.
“After the new policy has been successfully implemented (and we are going to work in close contact with the carrier to achieve this), it will be a harmless option,” Glading said.
We have made it clear that we feel “at home at school” when it comes to this issue.
But the Internet connection to serfing, electronic mail exchange, text messages or data loading will still be banned at a height of less than 10,000 feet, the agency reported.
Passengers will be invited to switch their smartphones, tablets and other devices into aircraft mode.
Thus, there is still no "Sword with Friends" - an Internet-intellectual game in which actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011, when the case was ours: the actor was removed from the American Airlines airline for refusing to turn off the device at the time the aircraft was on landing.
And more heavy devices, such as laptops, will still have to be placed in a luggage office, as they can trauma to someone if they fly all over the salon.
Mobile phone calls in the field will also continue to be banned.
The regulatory authority on telephone calls belongs to the Federal Communications Commission, not to FAO.
FAO may remove a ban on some electronic devices during take-off and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transport Security Council, a national expert on CBS News transport, said that hundreds of phones were still at risk.
“The telephones are really a problem, not only because they can potentially create navigational interferences, but we know from the FCS that they can create interferences for over a hundred when the aircraft is in the air,” Rosenker said.
The Sectoral Advisory Committee established by FAO to investigate this issue recommended last month that the Government allow for the wider use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, the pressure on FAO has increased to reduce restrictions on their use.
Critics, such as Senator-Democratic of Ms. Claire McCaskil, claim that there are no major security reasons for the bans.
Compliance with restrictions also becomes increasingly difficult, as the use of devices has become widespread.
Some studies show that up to a third of passengers forget or ignore instructions to delete their devices.
FAU began to limit the use of electronic devices by passengers in 1966 in response to communications for navigation and communication equipment when passengers began to carry FM radio receivers, high-tech boys at the time.
New aircraft are much more dependent on electrical systems than on previous generations of aircraft, but they are also developed and approved by FAO as resistant to electronic interference.
The airlines have been offering passengers the use of Wi-Fi at the crossroads for several years.
Airplanes modified for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.
The vast majority of liners are adapted to make the use of electronic devices more widely in accordance with the new guidelines, Warta said.
Today, electronic devices usually emit radio signals much lower than previous generations of devices.
E-book reading devices, for example, only emit minimum signals when browsing pages.
But signals become more powerful when devices load or send data.
Among those who sought to mitigate the restrictions on the use of electronic devices was Amazon.com.
In 2011, the company's representatives loaded the entire aircraft with their electronic books-reading devices Kindle and flew on it to check that there were problems, but they did not find them.
The members of the FAO Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings as to whether the use of devices was a risk.
Douglas Kidd of the National Aviation Association said that the interference from the devices was real, even if the risk was minimal.
Other members of the Committee said that there were only individual pilot communications confirming that devices could create a gap for aviation systems, and most of these communications were very old.
However, the Committee recommended that FAU allow pilots to require passengers to unplug devices during installation under limited visibility.
The group of representatives of the tourism industry welcomed these changes, calling them a health-care step for passengers who are now using a number of technological devices.
“We are pleased that FAU recognizes that the comfort of passengers is not incompatible with safety and protection,” said Roger Dow, Director General of the U.S. Tourism Association.
Schools will be able to conduct examinations for driving rights
Exams on driving rights will be able to accept private companies with their own computerized motorway.
It reads “Commersant” with reference to the draft Government ' s decision on vehicle management.
According to the newspaper, now in Russia, about 30 such vehicles are in place.
Students of such "privileged" car schools are expected to calculate the results of internal testing.
In this way, the Gosavto inspection will monitor the examinations every half year.
If more than 30 per cent of the theoretical exams and more than 20 per cent of the students do not give up for the first time, such a school will be deprived of half-yearly privileges.
The technical requirements for motorways contained in the draft Government order shall enter into force from 5 November 2014.
The project also contains requirements for two-wheel driving.
From 1 January 2015, the owners of motorcycles for the acquisition of category A rights will be required to submit an examination in the context of urban traffic.
Moreover, since 5 May 2014, companies will not be able to hire foreign drivers with foreign rights.
Such workers would be required to receive Russian rights after the examination.
Birds in the air in a safe place from a boulevard in the North Sea are released back into wild nature
The bird, which was poured into the sea after it was found in a depleted state at an oil height in the North Sea, was released back into the wild.
The watertight was placed in a helicopter sent to Aberdin last month and was then released by the Scottish Bureau of the Society for the Prevention of Animal Abuse (SPCA) at the Rescue Centre in Alloa.
The manager of the Colin Seddon Centre said: “This water pier is probably a winter migrant from North Europe who has fallen into a strong wind zone over the North Sea.”
It seems that the bird has weakened and was able to find refuge at an oil height.
He said, “It was not possible for her to fly again, so she came back to us.”
The watering trough was healthy and in good condition until it was released.
Is the elite of Europe ready to take business with England?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with an obligation to bring together business representatives and to determine what changes the well-being and jobs of Britain want to see in relation to the EU.
To this end, we have ordered the largest and most complete inquiry of British business leaders, asking them to express their views on Britain, business and the EU.
YouGov has questioned more than 1,000 business leaders representing large business across the UK on sizes, sectors and regions.
The conclusions of the survey will be unexpected to many.
We have found that the overwhelming majority of businesses are currently looking for export opportunities beyond Europe, paying particular attention to the countries that are modernising and growing, while the EU countries are in a constant state.
They want the Government to give priority to new trade links with countries such as China, India and Brazil, rather than spending time on long and difficult reform of EU institutions.
When asked about their views on specific political issues, from anti-monopoly regulation to product laws, most business leaders believed that the control of these key areas of competence should be returned to Westminster.
There was general dissatisfaction with the single market, with business representatives claiming that the costs of regulation from Brussels now outweigh the benefits of finding a trade area in Europe, with even 40 per cent of the largest enterprises, traditionally the most pro-European of all companies.
The last and most obvious is that our survey of business leaders has found that the clear majority wants Britain to take a course on treaty change and on trade-based relations with the EU rather than politics.
This result, which was seen among enterprises of all sizes and major business groups, shows that the business is pushing for a “significant change” that will return power back to Britain.
The high rate is the achievement of treaty changes and more favourable conditions for Britain will ensure a 16 per cent vote in order to remain in the EU.
The Prime Minister should have no doubt: this survey shows that the British business supports its plan to review the conditions of British membership in the EU.
It also shows that business expects revisions to lead to a significant shift in the current balance of forces back to the United Kingdom.
The better conditions for British business are possible and are becoming increasingly necessary as the euro area enters the path of closer economic and financial union.
Priority should be given to jobs and economic growth in Britain, and as the results of our survey show, this means a stronger focus on trade and fundamental changes in Brussels' regulatory activities.
United States Services Listen to the Pope’s Personal Phone
The activities of the Vatican are under the supervision of American special services.
The new documents from the Edward Snowden collection show that the U.S. intelligence has been conducting all the negotiations of the previous Pope Benedict, and now it is fully covering Pope Francis.
His phone began to listen even before he became the head of the Vatican.
The election process of the new pope was under surveillance.
What was particularly important in the United States?
The special service was connected to hundreds of Cardinals who had gathered in Rome to pick a regular Pope.
The telephones of the residence were also interviewed, where the participants lived.
The U.S. spies listened to all the main contenders on the pope's throne to prevent the appearance of a Washington figure.
Panorama reports that the U.S. Great Ear continued to hold prelate talks until the conclusion of the conference on 12 March.
It is claimed that since 2005, the Argentine Archbishop of Bergolio has been awarded as the future Pope of Rome.
The U.S. intelligence also held negotiations on the election of the new President of the Vatican.
The Italian magazine writes that in the United States Embassy, a secret group of operatives of the CIA and ANB is continuing to work on political and financial flows.
In turn, the Vatican has declared peacefully that it does not care about an American "injury," even if it does.
There are no secrets from the U.S. leadership of holy fathers.
Snowboards for the Olympic Cup Special Photos
The Bank of Russia issued an Wednesday note on the city of Sochi, where the Olympic Games are already taking place in the winter.
The nominal buyers are 100 rubles.
But online bloggers are already actively ironicing about the memory note.
After the presentation of the Olympic Cup on 30 October, they pointed out that the image of a banknote sub-broadcast can be found in photobanks.
In particular, there is a free StockExchange photo store, where this photo is dated in 2005.
The same photograph is used in the Photoshop lesson published on the Russian website Megaobsor on 18 January 2011.
In addition, it has already been used in RugGear smartphones.
The Olympic Banknote is implemented in the blue-blue gamma.
On the one hand, the image of a snowboarder flying over Sochi, on the other, is a type of Olympic stadium and the Ghar-bird.
Author of the Banknote design - Pavel Bushuev, who won a competition among students of the St. Petersburg Academy of Art of Repina.
The presentation noted that several types of sports were considered, such as gorillas, fristils and tramplins, but were eventually selected as a snowboard because it was a relatively young sport.
According to the source of the Reports, close to the CB, the regulator does not have an independent public view of the widespread dissemination of the image of the rebate from the Olympic banknote and is now studying the situation.
And that's not too much to worry about in González about the noise around the Olympics.
Mr. Natalya Nikiforov, press director, said that all the discussions on the plagiarism were ridiculous.
The banknote snowboarder will return right, the photos in the network -- on the left, Nikiforov specified.
The person at the photo session was taken from different points to create the purchase, then a final image was selected, which is a characteristic outside of the snowboard.
She also noted that copyright laws were not applicable to the Olympic Banknote, since the artist had been paid for his work.
In the opinion of the experts, the discussion of images on the Olympic Cup was positive.
The visibility of the image on the computer - plus for its advancement - is considered by the Executive Director of the NP "RusBrend" by Alexie Popovicev.
Proving the percentage of images on the computer and in photobanks is quite difficult, so the search for intellectual property dispute on the image is unlikely.
For the first time, a memory note was issued in 2008 in China for the 2008 Beijing Olympics in June.
Russia has decided to support this tradition.
Legislative prohibitions forced Russians to drink less beer
Russian brewers have a bad mood.
According to their claims, the consumption of beer in the country will remain at the previous level in the future, and that is best.
Although businessmen were originally looking for growth.
The current year has failed them: sales fell by 7 per cent.
Both were led by the head of one of the largest brewing companies in the country, the chairman of the Council of the Union of Russian brewers, Isaac Sheps, at the 3rd annual conference of the Adam Smith Institute of Daily Demand in Russia, which had just ended in Moscow.
It was discussed by the public regulation of the market.
From 2008 to 2012, the Russian beer market has already fallen by 18 per cent, as in recent years the country has seen a significant increase in the regulation of the beer industry in the production and consumption of low-alcohol beer, reported Sheps to listeners.
No country in the world has such a strict restriction of the beer market, an unforeseeable introduction of all new and new illogical prohibitions that are justified by the fight against alcohol abuse.
Beerjor said that many legislative prohibitions to reduce alcohol abuse did not have a special effect, but all new initiatives were constantly emerging.
Most of the beer producers have been affected by the ban on the sale of alcohol in kiosks introduced this year.
"We have now lost 35,000 consumers," said Isaac Sheps.
For the next year, the brewer has two forecasts.
The optimist is what Sheps said: the sale of wine drinks is still at the previous level.
Pessimistic will fall by 2-3 per cent.
In order to preserve its profits, businessmen are forced to leave the classes that are expected to be the "premium": beer will become less, but it will be expensive.
However, the radical effects of the drop in sales with a small amount of alcohol have not yet been seen.
“In my observations, the level of alcoholism remains at the same level,” said Dr. Alexey Satnikov.
True, there has been an increase in the number of patients using strong drinks surrogates, as well as those who have "sucked" into alcohol-containing alcoholic beverages such as "Yaguara", while ten years ago he overpowered "drink" alcoholism.
In September, 600 people were fired from Ford's car factory in Universal.
According to the trade unions, all those who were fired received compensation.
However, where the problem of workers is more acute, there is a reduction in production in the region.
A member of the ZackSa Aleksey Etmanov said at the meeting that about 600 people had been reduced in the Ford plant in Universal.
According to him, this happened again in September: at that time, about 600 people had left the factory on a voluntary retirement program, which had been developed with the trade union.
The workers who decided to resign on their own had been offered “gold parachutes” in several instalments.
As a result, the overwhelming majority have left their jobs on their own.
However, according to Etmanova, that number of people is a whole night shift.
I don't think that's gonna be the case.
However, the authorities for the next two years do not plan to adopt any programmes of support for regional enterprises in difficulty," he explained, adding that, when adopting the budget, the Government does not take into account the stagnation of production in the region and the large reduction of jobs.
Ford does not object or confirm this information.
We expect an answer from the company, and as soon as it shows up, we'll have to publish it.
Talks about reducing workers at Forda plant in Universal are going on for a long time.
For example, about the company's plans to fire 600 people became known in September.
In the past, the plant stated that the production of cars was suspended.
As a reason for the plant, they called the fall in demand for Ford cars in Russia.
According to Petrostat, the industrial output in Lenoblastia decreased by 5.4% in 2013 after nine months.
The production of vehicles and equipment decreased by 11.5 per cent.
Mobiles can be used in the United States during flight and landing
New rules for safe use of mobile devices are approved in the United States, the BBC Telecommunication Corporation reports.
It is expected that US airlines will allow passengers to use smartphones and tablets throughout the journey, and new rules will begin to work by the end of 2013.
However, the Internet connection for receiving and sending e-mails will be prohibited during flights of less than 3 kilometres.
Because of the danger of interfering with the radio equipment of the aircraft, the voice communication will remain under ban.
Thus, air passengers will be allowed to read electronic books, play board games and other gadgets and watch videos during internal and international flights.
Before the rules are adopted, airlines will be required to verify the safety of the use of electronic devices during the flight.
In addition, airlines will have to convince the U.S. Civil Aviation Administration that they are able to cope with the alleged impact of the aircraft's mobile and aircraft management equipment.
According to this source, such as the United States, existing rules for the use of electronic devices may also be revised in Britain.
For the Russian Mafia in the United States, a new name was finally established - the British Circle.
This week the black list of Russian Mafia in America was filled with new names and four companies.
The United States Ministry of Finance introduced three Russian representatives, two citizens of Uzbekistan and an Israeli.
One of the Russians was a well-known Gregorio Leps singer, whose United States suspected of transporting money to members of the group.
Still, in the blacklist, 22 persons involved in the "Bratskir" and six organizations affiliated with it.
However, many experts question the existence of such an organization.
"The announcement of the British Circle is more likely to unite various criminal groups," said the expert on organized crime and Professor Mark Galeotti at the University of New York.
In his view, the Bratsky Circle reflects the popular perception of the Russian Mafia.
"I have not met anyone in Russian law enforcement agencies or anyone else who would confirm the existence of such a criminal organization," quote Mr. Galeotti, American Centre for the Study of Corruption and Organized Crime.
Mr. Galeotti agreed with Professor George Mason Liz Shelly.
"If they are working together, it is more like a criminal network, but not an organization," says the Centre for Research on Corruption and Organized Crime.
In the middle of last year, Mark Galeotti suggested that the "British Circle" unites more closely the Russian War in Aslan Usoyan, known as Grandpa Hasan.
The criminal authority was murdered in January of this year.
Yes, the activities of Lashi Shushanashvili and Zechariah Kalashov, who completed the list in 2012, were closely related to Grand Hasan, and another member of the list, Temuri Mirzoev, came as Grandfather of Grandpa Hasan.
However, Mr. Galeotti noted that some individuals were not related to Usoyan.
In his view, all of them were more united in financial and criminal interests, such as drug supply from Afghanistan.
Meanwhile, the scandal surrounding the inclusion in the "British Circle" of Gregory Leps, the favorite singer of Russia's President Vladimir Putin, drew Kremlin's attention.
Of course, we expect to receive more detailed information from our American partners, as a result of which such a decision has been made, as it has been made in such lists, the press secretary of the head of the State of Dmitry Peskov said.
In any case, he (Leps) is a citizen of the RF.
As well as the interests of all citizens of the RF will be protected.
The head of Gasprom Alexei Miller says that the pipeline in Bulgaria marks a new era in the gas field
The beginning of the construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of the largest energy projects in Europe, said Gazprom.
“Today there has been a significant event: the construction of the Bulgarian gas pipeline "South Stream", the largest and most important project in Europe", said President Gazprom Alexei Miller in his statement on Thursday.
The project is a key element of energy security throughout the European continent.
The South Stream is intended to diversify Russia's export routes across Europe.
The gap between Gazprom and its partners in Ukraine, where most of Russia's gas is destined for Europe, increases the level of risk for ordinary routes, officials say.
Miller said that direct association with Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, meant that geopolitical risks associated with transit countries were “always”.
Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from the South Stream at a reduced price as soon as the whole project starts to work in 2015.
Gazprom stated that construction should begin in other countries further along the gas pipeline by the end of the year.
The annual project capacity of the pipeline is 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.
This morning in the Sarat district, a Peugeot car driver went to the meeting area at 115 km from the foot of Odessa-Rani, and met with a bus with six people.

A 55-year-old passenger and a 44-year-old bus driver was injured.
The doctors provided the woman with first medical attention on the ground, and she refused hospitalization.
Early medical personnel also surveyed all other passengers.
With the help of a crane, the rescuers picked up a bus and released the bus driver whose leg was knocked on the door of the bus.

Two YMCA officers were charged with sexual offences even before the charges against Jonathan Lord, as the Royal Commission had become known.
Two YMCA NSW staff had been charged with sexual crimes against children prior to charges in 2011 against a childcare institution employee in Karingbahe Jonathan Lord, reports to the Royal Commission on Sexual Violence against Children.
But the Commission ' s introductory statement stated that it had “never dealt with cases of sexual violence against children within its organization”.
The Chief Executive Director, Philip Heira, was asked about one case where the YMCA employee was charged with child pornography offences and on the other when the instructor was deported to the YMCA Caringbah Hall for sexual crimes against children under his supervision in 1991.
Mr. Hayer told Gail Ferness, a lawyer who assisted the commission, that he knew about the first case, but didn't know about the second.
He acknowledged that YMCA also allowed introductory statements for the Commission to be incorrect, claiming that “YMCA’s external verifications had been recognized as YMCA’s first-line child security check”.
The evidence provided by the commissions is that YMCA has been notified that it has received a second from the end of four possible evaluations of the quality audit carried out by the Department of Education and Communities in August this year.
Mr. Hayer, who joined YMCA when he was 21 years of age, acknowledged that he and the following leadership had let go by hiring Lord, and had not been able to provide a clear understanding of staff's obligations regarding reporting violations of children ' s security policy.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sexual crimes against 12 boys for two years at YMCA.
He was in prison for at least six years.
But Mr. Hayer rejected the assumption that the YMCA corporate ethics prevented staff from reporting on the violations of the Lord in the field of child security.
The staff showed that they had observed violations, including the fact that Lord was alone with the children, putting them on his knees, saying that he loved one of them and allowed them to play with their cell phone.
Daniel Oakwell, who was under the leadership of Lord and asked to teach her child protection because she was concerned about his conduct, showed that Jacky Barnat, the guardian of YMCA's children in Karingbache, who was the head of Lord, was “a fearsome and often difficult person”.
The Executive Director said that he did not explain to staff that they had been reluctant to report the situation to their senior managers.
Rather, he said that their friendship with Lord led them from the point of view of the need to report about him.
Mr. Hayer said that he had presented to the YMCA Council of New South Wales his opinion that the lesson for the organization from the “accident with Jonathan Lord” was not “to provide information” by staff, and the Board agreed with him.
Mr. Hayer said that the decision to force staff to sign confidentiality agreements soon after the indictments had been issued was adopted by the Director-General of YMCA on Child Care, Liam Whitley.
He said that it was meant to prevent a breach of evidence, but that was “overreached” and that the decision had been badly implemented.
YMCA, New South Wales, was not safe for children by the organization during her work, Jonathan Lord, between 2009 and 2011, informed the Committee of Experts on the Development of Children, Professor Steven Smolboun of the University of Griffith.
He said that there were “serious problems” in the recruitment, selection, training, training and monitoring of staff.
The hearings shall be postponed until 20 December.
A week of fashion in San Pablo.
She's not just a model, she's a real star.
Despite the fact that Giselle Bundssen had for some time left her job as a mother, she had come to a special position on these days and this week's defiling.
The lack of months did not prevent her from keeping her place on the podium and on the pedestals.
Life remains the highest-paid supermodel of the world.
This time she was involved in the "Colchchi" profile.
The final week of fashion is usually the most interesting shows.
It's kind of like he organized a stylist Lino Villaventura.
The brand is more than 30 years old, parallel to the production of a luxury pre-port, the model works actively in theatre and cinema, designing spectacles and designing costumes for many well-known paintings.
In general, more than 30,000 companies and companies that are relevant to the textile industry and the world of fashion participated in the final week of the fashion in San Paulo.

Tony Blair said he was taking advantage of the opportunity to return as Prime Minister of Britain, but admitted that the return was unlikely.
Earlier this evening, in an interview on the fifth anniversary of his retirement, 59-year-old politicians expressed their views on various aspects of domestic policy.
Since his resignation in June 2007, after ten years as a leader, Blair has avoided much discussion of British policy, limiting most of his comments on foreign affairs and his role as a ambassador to the quarter of the Middle East peacekeepers.
Responding to the question of whether he would return to the Prime Minister's office, Blair, according to the London Evening Standard, said, "Yes, of course, but it's not going to happen, so... "

The specialist also noted that failure at the start was caused by a series of traumas of leading players.
I'm very sorry we couldn't win, Tmw says, Allegrey.
The team played a good match, creating 3-4 good opportunities.
In the first time, we didn't allow "Laceio."
In the second Romans, they added, but in general, I can't say that we lost concentration.
We had to win.
Last season, we had a mission to hit the League of Champions.
Now we're off the chart, but this is due to a whole series of key football injuries.
Rammy and Honda?
It's a very good game, with a character.
But our composition is good now.
Take a look at the Kaka who held a high-level meeting.
The experts from the Consortiffs were aware that competition would be very high.
But no one was ready for Fenton Kirkland's three-year-old appearance.
Not even a schoolboy, just a few months before he took his first step, this young man with his piste Shetland Pony Toffi went through three tours to take the main prize easily, leaving 30 adult opponents far behind.
This undiminished couple — the same growth — received high grades for the appearance, behavior, and style of the annual competition held by the Sannibank Horse Sports Centre in Radri near Cardiff.
Going out to the general view of the background of men and women, he pushed his hat around and proudly held around two-year-old Toffi.
The judges praised Fenton for not having been able to handle the horse for years.
And Toffi has received a high degree of externality and character assessment.
Fenton was given to Toffi on his third birthday last March, and since then he has been dealing with the Shetland pony every day.
His 30-year-old mother, Donna, said, "Fenton and Toffi make a wonderful duet."
They had many rivals, but these two went out with a gold cup and a silver cup.
It was just his second speech from Toffy, and we were all in the woods when he won.
Very strangers in the arena considered him so phenomenal that they wanted to take a picture with him.
This boy from the village of Nantiglo, near Eb-Weil in South Wales, is walking along his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been exhibiting horses for over 10 years.
Ms. Howels said, "The whole audience was defeated, and everyone shouted for approval and the boys."
He ran through the sand all along the arena, and although he looked so fragile, he did a wonderful job.
He loves horses, tractors, and farms, and he has two shoes he cares about.
In view of what he started, he will soon take part in the November of the year, and I am sure he will do well.
The representative of this annual horse show said: "The Fenton is only three years old, but he knows how to address his pony."
They're a great team together.
The judges noted Fenton and Toffi for their appearance and for the way they presented themselves at the show.
They appreciate the agreement of the poet and the co-founder, Fenton and Toffi were the best in the ring.
I'm sure that Fenton helped his attractive suit, he really took a good look at his role.
Publishing a call from the Chinese newspaper “Reorganization”
The Chinese newspaper, which issued a first-class appeal for the release of the defendant in the reporter ' s cage, should be reorganized, the press regulator reported.
The New Express, published in Guangzhou, made an unexpected public statement requesting the release of a journalist, Chen Junjou.
But Mr. Chenh later admitted on television that he had taken the lead in writing false articles about a company with a public share of property.
Now, the New Express must go through “the process of complete correction of errors”, as the regulator says.
The order for “Error Management” came from the Guandun Office in the field of press and publications, radio, cinema and television.
The preliminary investigation showed that Yangcheng Evening News Group published several false reports on the Zoomlion stock exchange from September 2012 to August 2013.
“The manual of the New Expression was disoriented,” said the regulator.
He reported that the decision had been made to “use the administrative appeal to Chen Junjou in the form of a return of his reportary licence”.
He also “instructed Yangcheng Evening News Group to correct all errors in the “New Express” and recommended that it carry out an investigation into the situation of the journalists and to immediately amend the “New Express” guidelines”.
Mr. Chenj wrote several articles for the “New Express”, in which he reported financial violations of the construction equipment of the company called Zoomlion.
After he was arrested, his newspaper published two appeals for his release on the first floor, claiming that he supported his journalistic activities.
But Mr. Cheny then appeared on public television, recognizing that he had published false money articles.
“In this case, I damaged Zoomlion, as well as the entire news industry and its ability to earn public confidence,” he said to CCTV’s public broadcaster.
I did it mainly because I wanted money and glory.
I realized my fault.
After his confessions, Mr. Chenya “New Express” issued an apology for the first floor, claiming that the paper was not able to properly verify his reports.
Recently, several high-ranking suspects were admitted on television.
Experts say that China's recognition practices are still widespread, despite the recent amendments to the laws that prevent the authorities from forcing anyone to comment on themselves.
U.S. tunnel discovered — Mexico for drug processing equipped with its own railway
One of the most complex tunnels for drug trafficking between the United States and Mexico, equipped with its own lighting, ventilation and electrical relay systems, was found.
The U.S. authorities described this tunnel four by three feet as one of the most complex secrets ever discovered.
This tunnel, with a length of almost six football fields, connects the warehouses near the city of Tijuana (Mexico) and San Diego (USA).
This area is filled with undetectable storage facilities, which facilitates the hidden loading of drugs into the truck.
The tunnel was closed before there was a sudden transfer of any drugs, as the authorities said.
According to the court documents, the lawyers confiscated eight and a half tons of marijuana and 327 pounds of cocaine in the discovery of the tunnel.
Three men, who, according to law enforcement, were employed by drivers, were charged with the storage of marijuana and cocaine for distribution.
In the event of conviction, they are threatened with imprisonment from 10 years before life imprisonment.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers use extensive underground drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth major passage found in San Diego since 2006.
Several major tunnels were found in Central Mexico after the harvest of marijuana in October, which posed a difficult task for drug users to deliver their products quickly to consumers.
In 2010, the authorities found a passage of some 700 yards, equipped with traffic routes, from the kitchen of one of the houses in Tijuana to two San Diego warehouses.

British police hand over to Assangu a notice of extradition
The British police today issued a notice of the extradition of the founder WikiLeaks Julian Assang, who hid in Ecuador's embassy in London and sought asylum.
In Scotland, they said that they had assigned an “official requirement” to the 40-year-old Australian to appear in the police station, adding that in the absence of that requirement, he would continue to be arrested.
Assanju threatened to extradite Sweden on sexual offences after he exhausted his options under British law, when the Supreme Court rejected his appeal for extradition earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm would transfer it to the United States, on 19 June he hid in the Embassy of Ecuador in London, requesting political asylum in that South American country.
Scotland-Yard “has handed the 40-year-old man an official requirement to surrender, which obliges him to come to the police station day and time after day,” the press secretary reported.
He continues to violate the conditions of bail-out.
The Embassy refused to comment on the notification of the police.
Assange is afraid that he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States to make possible accusations in spying after the publication of more than 250,000 US diplomats on the WikiLeaks website.
Driver with a speed of 130 miles per hour with hot drinking between the legs, charged at £1000
The car driver was charged £1000 for driving up to 130 miles per hour (210 km/h) with a hot drink held between the legs.
35-year-old Andrew Howy of Typtri, Essex, was observed for the role of his Mercedes Benz on the A120 track in Brendri on 27 May.
When the police stopped him, they found a drink for him between his legs.
In the world court of Colchester Houi, he acknowledged the charge of driving without due regard and attention.
The addendum to his driving licence of seven penalty balls led to a six-month driving ban.
Houi also had the obligation to pay the cost of £90 and the additional cost of assistance to victims of crime of £100.
Tax for foreign property owners will lead to the London Stock Exchange
The Treasury has carried out a preliminary assessment of the capital increase tax, but expects a final decision by Mr. Osborn, who in the 2012 budget introduced a public tax rate of 7 per cent for houses worth more than £2 million and annual payments for buyers who decide to own houses in the company rather than as natural persons.
To date, housing in the Westminster, Kensington and Chelsea areas of 708 million pounds in 2012/13 already exceeds the total amount for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, North-East, Northwest, Yorkshire and Hamburg together.
Mr. Cook said: “After an increase in the ownership of expensive houses and the introduction of related legislation against the removal, it is very difficult to claim that the taxation of expensive real estate is reduced regardless of the impact of the old municipal tax system.”
“But this step may lead to some foreign investors not willing to buy real estate in London or its current owners will not want to sell it,” he added.
The value of the first-class real estate, above 5-10 per cent of the price-based housing market, was increased by 11.8 per cent in the rich South-West London area, which extends from Fullham to Wimbledon last year.
According to a study by Savillas, prices in central London continued to show sustained growth of 5.6 per cent per annum, but they had become a rapidly evolving “revolving market” with rising prices in the south-west, in the north (7.4 per cent) and in the east (6.5 per cent) of the city.
Scientists shed light on how the dog’s tail movements are related to its mood.
More early studies have shown that enough dogs run the tail on the right side (from the dog's point of view), while the frightened dogs wave the tail mainly on the left side.
But scientists now say that other representatives of the dog family may notice these thin differences in tails and react to them.
Professor George Valortigar, neurobiologist at the University of Trent, says: “It is well known that left-hand people and the right-hand side of the brain participate differently in the formation of positive or negative emotions. ”
This is where we tried to look at it and other kinds of things.
He added that, as with a human dog, the right part of the brain controls the left side of the body and vice versa, and two half-years play different roles in emotions.
In order to learn more about how dogs react to the diverse swelling of the tails of other dogs, researchers observed animals when watching films about other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of animals and analyzed their behavior.
Maybe we'll soon understand why their tails are sometimes directed to one side and sometimes to the other.
Professor Valortigar said: “We showed dogs videos with dogs — either naturalist versions or silhouettes to get rid of any other distorting factors, and we could manipulate the tail movement and drive the tail more to the left or the right.”
When the animals saw that in the rest of the non-expressive dog, the tail was moving right (from the dog’s tail) they were totally weakened.
But when they saw that the tail had moved mainly to the left (again from the dog’s tail), their hearts began to tremble, and they looked anxious.
Professor Valortigara said that he did not think that the dogs were willing to communicate with each other through these movements.
In fact, he believes that dogs have learned from their experience what movements they should be concerned about and what they are not.
He notes: “If there are several meetings with other dogs and their tailing is often linked to more friendly behavior, and the right of the party gives less friendly behavior, the dog reacts on the basis of this experience.”
Researchers say that these results can give owners, veterinarians and trainers a deeper understanding of the emotions of their animals.
The dog behavior expert John Bradshaw, an invited scientific officer at the University of Bristol veterinary school, said that it was not the first study to check whether it was relevant to the left dog and the right of the party.
Last year, a group of scientists from Lincoln University discovered that dogs are turning their heads left if they look at an aggressive dog and right if they look at a pretty dog.
In another scientific work, the University of Victoria, Canada, he reported: “The frogs were more likely to approach the robot dog when its tail was pushed to the left rather than to the right, instead of becoming alarmed, the opposite of Italian research. ”
He said that the differences could be because dogs in various studies did not fully accept animals in films or robots as dogs.
It could be useful to study how dogs react to these dogs, he explained.
“While there is sufficient evidence for different dairy farmers that two brain tumors are used for different purposes, many details are still to be clarified and dogs are not excluded,” he said.
However, given the ease with which their conduct may be recorded, we may soon understand why their tails are sometimes directed to one side and sometimes to the other.
Arctic Monkeys are throwing a concert in Glasgow because of Alex Turner's disease
The Arctic Monkeys rock group postponed the concert in Glasgow after her vocalist was diagnosed with larynx.
The Chief of Staff was supposed to be at the City Conservatory of Hydro on Friday.
However, Alex Turner’s disease forced them to carry the show.
This group statement was made after it had been forced to hold a concert at LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on its official Arctic Monkeys website, “After deciding to transfer the show to the Birmingham LG Arena tonight and after treatment for Arctic Monkeys, the show should also be postponed to the Hydro Square in Glasgow on Friday, 1 November”.
“Alex Turner was diagnosed with laryngitis, and unfortunately he is unable to speak.”
The show at LG Arena in Birmingham will be held on 20 November, and the show at Glazgo will take place on 21 November.
All the tickets for the show are still valid.
We want to apologize to all the ticket owners for any inconveniences they may have caused.

Pope Francis calls the first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will lead the new cardinals of the Catholic Church to the dream for the first time during his service on 22 February, as the Vatican announced on Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest clergy in the Catholic Church after the pope, and they choose the pope, so that France will appoint its first group of people who will eventually participate in the election of his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, after reaching the 80-year-old cardinal, he could no longer participate in the pope’s election, which was the prerogative of the 120 “Credinal electors”.
In announcing this news, the Vatican press secretary, Father Federico Lombardy, said that a meeting of all current cardinals, known as a consortium, would be held before the ceremony.
“Papa Francisk decided to announce earlier his decision to convene a consortium in February to facilitate the planning of other meetings with cardinals from different corners of the world,” Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of the Catholic Votes organization said that by February the number of cardinal voters was likely to decline.
He said that the pope usually calls as many cardinals as necessary to bring back the number of cardinals to 120, as well as as as many cardinals over 80 years of age as he wished.
Consistency will be of great importance next year because it will be the first since France was elected in March of the year, according to Valero.
At present, there is a kind of bias in favour of Europe and in particular in favour of Italy.
“It will be interesting to see if the new pope of cardinals from other regions of the world will be appointed to restore the balance,” he said.
In South America, 40 per cent of Catholics live, but they are represented by nothing.
These will also be the first cardinals selected since the formation of the French Cardinal Council, a group of eight cardinals from all over the world, who have been commissioned to search for ways to reform the Church.
In the past, the pope decided everything on his own.
"Now France has chosen eight cardinals to help him," Valero said.
He said that "very possible", that France would address Cardinals after the council.
But we have not been in that situation before — all of this for the first time.
Valero said that the popes were usually taking the Cardinal of Bishops from large incomes, but France “a lot of surprises, so we don’t know who he is calling. ”
GM reacts to a number of new U.S. pickups to finish the seat back
General Motors Co detects nearly 19,000 brand-new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra models 2014 to address the problems of manual regulation of seat backrests, as reported by US regulatory authorities on Friday in the field of road safety.
On some of the picnics, front seats may have a defect in the rear inclination mechanism.
As a result, seats do not conform to the federal safety standards of road transport by head restraints.
“By hitting the vehicle behind the head restraint, the driver and passengers may not be adequately protected by increasing the risk of injury,” says the National Road Safety Administration website.
The models were developed from 1 August to 10 September.
The GM pickup was launched in June and is the most important vehicle launch for the leading American auto manufacturer since its restructuring due to bankruptcy in 2009.
GM reported a defect to the owners of the pickup in the first half of October.
The National Road Safety Administration could not consider notifying the owners of the 16-day termination of the Government, which reduced the increase in car sales in October.
The sales of Silverado and Sierra pickups, which were modernized for a number of model years, increased by about 20 per cent during the first 10 months of this year, as GM said on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado pickup and 16,503 pickup of Sierra.
GM shares in the New York Stock Exchange on Friday rose by 1.4 per cent before the $37.47.
Summaries of Obama's despair
I voted in favour of President Obama twice, sharing the hope of change
He said that Obama had allowed the destruction of the Republicans to interfere with their efforts.
Obstructionism cannot justify problems with a web site reformed by the health system, unmanned attacks
The 2008 Obama Campaign Memories are a sad reminder of what could be
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second degree student at Harvard University Medical School.
I'm reading a terriblely sad book these days.
I thought that this book would inspire me at the time of my graduation at the second medical school and give me a sense of hope.
It is called "Growth for Victory", and it is a memo for the 2008 presidential campaign, Barack Obama.
When I finish writing reports about my patients at night, and I lie in bed, this book brings me back when politics inspired millions of people, and the speeches could take the spirit.
The election victory was exciting, and the leading news programmes were suspended for the purpose of this historic moment.
My classmates cried with joy, and my parents kept all the newspapers they could only find.
A young team of strategies was to come to the White House, and the people were ready to change.
At the time of Obama's entry into office in 2008, his support rate was 82 per cent.
Then I close the book.
Returning to the present is a gross awakening, as if emanating from a dream.
It is hard to remember those days of optimism — they seem to be a distant memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
In the years since I left my first election bulletin, changes have indeed taken place.
That was what I couldn't even imagine myself.
I commend Obama for his great and varied achievements, from the adoption of the Act on Accessible Medical Assistance to the withdrawal of our troops from Iraq, the repeal of the rules “Do not ask, do not speak” of Usama Ben Laden's murder.
Moreover, I believe that party obstructionism has blocked too many attempts to move our country forward: immigration reform, the choice of public health and the closure of the Guantanamo base among others.
But after countless times, when I was on the side of Obama's administration, protecting her from colleagues and supporters, I ended up explaining what I could provide.
I have reached the point of political despair.
Obstruction of Republicans cannot explain a permit to interrogate foreign leaders or to strike innocent children in other countries.
He could not explain the collection of data on the private lives of Americans by the National Security Agency or the persecution of defamators revealing the wrong actions of the Government.
He could not explain the murder of American citizen Anvar al-Avlaki without trial and investigation or non-compliance with the limits of public funding and expenditure during presidential campaigns.
He cannot justify the conclusions of the report, which states that the White House's efforts to silence the media are “self-aggressive... from the time of the Nixon administration”.
And he has recently been unable to justify the failure to develop a simple web site for more than three years after the signing of the Access to Medical Assistance Act.
I don't know if I should have expected that.
Did I have to understand at the age of 18 that leadership might be contrary to the political campaigns ahead of him?
It is clear that the work at the election post is not a predictable programme of action, as our public dialogue will be formed by an opposition political party and by events such as Newtown's strike.
Nevertheless, all the examples mentioned above show that they were largely their own choice of administration.
And that's what worries me the most.
I voted again for Obama in 2012, but not because I was very enthusiastic about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney was an impenetrable and harsh alternative, and it seemed that he could not decide on his own policies or views.
I thought that, in my second term, Obama, when he was released from the pressure of future elections, justified the hopes that we had heard for such a long time.
However, when Obama's rating fell by 45 per cent this week, it became much more difficult to return in 2008.
This makes me hesitate with many of the promises that have come to pass.
This week, I read that part of the book, which describes how Clinton had caused Obama a deafening defeat in the initial elections in Pennsylvania.
At the analysis meeting, he told his staff that they should return to normal and remain faithful to their goals.
"I want us to return our attraction," he said.
"We must remember who we are."
It's been five years, Mr. President, and I fully agree with you.
The views expressed in this commentary are exclusively of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer argues that the issue of child-care leave is a conflict of interest with MP Tony Ebbot.
MP Clive Palmer said that Prime Minister Tony Ebbot had a conflict of interest in childcare leave because his daughters could be pregnant and benefit from it.
This mining industry magnate, which has an unresolved dispute over the tax on carbon emissions of $6 million, made this statement at a time when it tried to turn away from the question of whether it had a conflict.
The Palmer Joint Party may control up to four votes in the Senate, which may be of crucial importance in deciding to abolish carbon and mining taxes.
But Mr. Palmer claimed that the conflict of interest could only be with the ministers, and he said that Mr. Ebbot's daughters would personally prove to be the winner of political action.
“He has a major conflict of interest when it comes to paid leave for childcare, because if any of these daughters are pregnant, he will have a direct interest in whether they are to be given leave or not,” said Mr. Palmer.
Two months after the elections, the electoral commission officially declared Mr. Palmer a winner in the fight against the seat of the Sanshain-Costa electoral district, Ferfax, with a vote of 53, after the recalculation of the votes.
Mr. Palmer called for a review of the vote counting procedure in the elections to speed up the process.
The daughters of Tony Ebbot Francis and Bridget.
Should it be decided on these elections two months after we voted?
"We need a better system," he said.
Why should we not have a system so that you can come, put your data into the computer, vote immediately and get the result at 18:30 the same night?
Mr. Palmer also criticised the use of Canadians for notes in the bulletins.
That's because they can figure it out if he doesn't like anyone?
It seems strange to use krantas in our time.
The Electoral Commission is examining the possibility of an electronic vote and has recently published a joint discussion paper with New Zealand.
Mr. Palmer, 59, said that his programme included an international airport for Sanshain-Costa and would be “very serious” in relation to his new work.
The State office involves the service of society.
“We do not achieve any reward except through history, because at a critical time we can serve this district,” he said.
RBS removes two currency traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland temporarily removed two traders in its currency operations sub-division, according to the information provided by two people familiar with the situation, which is another confirmation that the global verification of the alleged manipulations in the currency market is rapidly taking place.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are cooperating with regulators in investigations involving the world's largest financial market, whose daily turnover is $5.3 trillion.
These two traders will be the first RBS staff to be removed during the development investigation, which is called the LIBOR Interbank Manipulation scandal.
By refusing to comment on the removals, the Bank confirmed that it had received requests for information from the regulatory authorities this month.
“Our current investigation continues, and we fully cooperate with FCA and other our regulators,” the bank reported two weeks ago.
Last month, the informed persons said that RBS had transmitted e-mails and instant messages that had received and sent it to the UK Financial Control Office (FCA).
This trader, Richard Asher, left the RBS in 2010 and, as far as he is aware, was granted a leave on his current position as head of European spot exchange trading in JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of European spot trade in Citi, went on vacation this week, while Matt Gardiner, the former currency dealer in Barclays and UBS, was removed from work by the Standard Chartered Bank this week.
None of these traders were charged with any violations.
Mr. Asher's Emergency Communications Group included bankers from Barclays and Citigroup, according to informed persons.
The Bank of UBS reported this week that it had taken action against some of its staff after the Swiss regulator Finma said it was investigating alleged manipulations in the foreign exchange market in several Swiss banks.
At least six world regulators — the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss Anti-Money Authority Weko, FCA, the US Ministry of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Administration — are considering allegations that bankers have entered into a dispute to influence the monetary market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse also started internal checks or received requests for information from regulators, said familiar with the situation of the person.
The banks have been looking for instant communications and e-mails for several years in the search for offences.
The audit reports have raised traders in recent years as one of the largest sources of income for investment banks, which this year, however, has faced difficulties because the low volatility of currencies has reduced the opportunity for buyers.
Some bankers have tried to minimize the seriousness of the situation, saying that it is practically impossible to manipulate a large and highly liquid currency market, but senior traders say it is not always true.
According to the senior trader, despite the large number of daily trades in the foreign exchange market, the fragmentation of liquidity between different trading platforms and the wider use by banks of their domestic platforms means that “they can begin to influence the market at a very low price”.
That news came the same day as the Bank of Credit Suisse announced that he had fired one of its London Stock Exchange brokers this week after it had caused a loss of nearly $6 million at the end of last year.
The Bank immediately informed the relevant authorities and cooperated with its regulators.
“We are confident that the trader was acting alone and that the issue could be localized,” said Credit Suisse.
The Supreme Court supported Obama's health law
The U.S. Supreme Court today decided that the Barack Obama's health mark law was constitutional, which was a major victory for Obama's administration.
Voted 5 against 4, the judges decided that separate provisions under the Law on the Protection of Patients and accessible health, requiring citizens to obtain medical insurance by 2014 or to pay a fine, were constitutional in accordance with the authority of the Government on taxation.
The President of the Supreme Court, John Roberts, joined four more liberal members of the court, while the judges of Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy opposed.
The Court also upheld the remaining sections of this 2700-party law and further decided that the requirement of the Health Act to increase compliance by states with the Medicaid programme, otherwise losing all federal funding of the Medicaid programme, was not unconstitutional.
The request to block the bill was made by 26 states and by the National Federation of Independent Business.
The law strongly opposed each of the major Republican candidates in the presidents during the 2012 initial election season, including the alleged candidate Mitt Romni.
Football - the reason for the difference?
As part of the Open Tribunal, politicians and experts spoke about how to maintain national peace in Russia.
Among the proposals were: banning football in the North Caucasus, because of this game, there are scandals and differences.
Speaker Sergei Narishkin recalled recent developments in Birjulev and said that to reduce the "treasure in society" policy and the media should be correct in the statements.
He probably meant a recent scandal with Vladimir Girinovski, who in one of his television broadcasts threatened to surround Caucasian with a bulwark if they did not want to limit fertility...
All speakers also spoke about measures to regulate migration from CIS countries and on measures to harmonise relations between the peoples of Russia, which led to discussion.
Maxim Grigoriev said that the events in Birjulev were "the model conflict that could have been forecasted", but "we have too many people and bodies responsible for these issues," and seven children with no eyes.
The concept of multiculturalism, which Europe has long practiced for migrants, in the opinion of the public, has failed and must seek its way.
Historian Yury Peterov placed great hope in a new one - story textbook.
"It is still necessary to create a cultural benefit for the peoples of the country so that schoolchildren in Tatarstan know that people live in Dagestan and vice versa," he said.
Gennadius Zuganov offered to impose criminal responsibility for "calling for Russia's dissolution": "If you say on the radio that Alaska is to be given to Russia, you will be arrested and sentenced to 20 years in prison!"
Vladimir Girinovski has tried very hard not to burn.
As usual, he has accused journalists throughout the world who pose painful and sharp national issues for public discussion: "In dust of controversy, can you say anything?"
The leader of the Russian Federation's only group, Vladimir Vasiliev, advised journalists here to conclude the charter and agree to hold talks on the subject in an accurate manner, and then the same commitments could be made to themselves and to policies.
We have adopted about 30 laws governing migration, and in general, Mr. Vasilev said.
As an example, he introduced the law, which entrusted regional and municipal authorities with responsibility for international peace in their territory.
But Lukmila Andrichenko's insistence on this law did not divide: it did not have “clear perceptions of the adaptation of migrants, of their mechanisms and limits.
Thus, the entities will treat the various levels of these powers.
In addition, municipalities have no staff needed to address so many complex issues, no funds, and no methodological recommendations that they could take advantage of do not provide them with...
The head of the National Affairs Committee, Gajimet Safaraliev, proposed to establish a special department called the Ministry of National Security, which would deal with national policy issues.
But Valerie Tischkov, who was the head of a similar department in the 1990s, subsequently abolished, objected.
It is enough to have a special person at the federal level, a “minister without a portfolio”, to which one could be asked, if so.
"We are on the move, the pipelines are falling apart, very important for representatives of different ethnic groups and religions to act together against provocations, and this work should be given decent information support," said the representative of the RPC on relations with the society of Allevold Chaplin.
No State neutrality with regard to dangerous ideologies, including religious, should be considered.
This is where Oleg Nilov said in an unexpected tone: "More talented people than in Chechnya or Dagestan still need to be sought, but they are not pushed that way, not that way," he said.
"Not the way" is the development of football: "The footballer is killing the whole crowd, the flags are burning, the friends with stones are throwing each other away...
Maybe we don't need such a football?
There's another kind of sport - the regby is called...
"There will be no fairs in the world in this kind of sport!" he said hotly.
There will be no one to play in the Kaucas Regiment!
You're still a Kerlinger!
I need to know the national features, but it's just like the "Bad of Fire" Grove to propose"...
In Jaroslav, the wild behavior of the tribunals was distinguished from that of the Moscow club - during the games with the local club.
Football's gonna have to ban all over the country...
The head of the RFS Monitoring and Discipline Committee, Arthur Grigorjánz, reported that the Cubans were sentenced to 500 thousand rubles, transferred from the U.S. football correspondent Philip PAPENKOV from the House.
Such sanctions for the Red Cross Club are applied for the fire of the Dagestan flag by the patients at the court during the 14th round of the day against Anji.
The meeting was attended by representatives of both clubs, a member of the RFPL.
We have studied all available materials.
For the illegal conduct of Cuban spectators, 500 thousand rubles are fined.
Against Google, Samsung, Huawei patented claims by Nortel
The Group of thousands of Nordel's former patents filed a series of patents against mobile phone producers, including Google, whose price it went to the Nordel bankruptcy auction on Thursday.
The Rockstar Consortium, which had purchased $4.5 billion of Nortel patents, filed claims for patent violations in the U.S. District Court in Texas v. Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
These patents cover technologies that help to compare the key words of search on the Internet with their respective advertisements, it is stated in the claim that Google's search business is the basis.
The representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were inaccessible and did not comment.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC are making phones working on the Android operating system from Google, which is fiercely competing with mobile products from Apple and Microsoft.
In 2011, Google proposed an initial price of $900 million for Nortel patents.
Google has increased the proposed price several times, eventually offering a total of $4.4 billion.
I lost my case about the patents Nortel Rockstar Consortium, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, which was partly a patent library for Motorola.
“Despite the unsuccessful attempt to acquire the patents that are the subject of the request, Google has violated and continues to violate them,” the court said.
Rockstar claims an increased loss from Google, since it claims that the violation of patent rights by Google is intended, according to the claim.
In Egypt, the first freely elected president took an oath
Muhammad Murcy took an oath, but his birthday would hardly be the end of the political struggle in Egypt.
ISLAMISTER Mohammed Mursi promised “new Egypt” when he swore to become the first freely elected president of the country, changing Hosni Mubarak, who was defeated 16 months ago.
At its inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morris also became the first freely elected Islamic President of the Arab world and the fifth head of the State in Egypt after the monarchy had come into existence some 60 years ago.
He swore before 18 judges in black robes in the building of a court on the shore of the Nile, built in the style of an ancient Egyptian temple.
“We are striving for a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic,” Mursi said during the Christmas ceremony shown in the live air on public television.
“Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundations for a new life — absolute freedom, genuine democracy and stability,” said Mursi, a 60-year-old American-educated engineer from the "British-Muslim" group, a fundamentalist group, who was most of the 84 years of its existence banned by an organization that served as a target for harsh action by changing governments.
The building was guarded by hundreds of soldiers and police, when Morris arrived with a small corset shortly after 11 a.m. local time.
Only a few hundred supporters gathered at the courthouse to welcome the new President, and, unlike the Presidential Pump Mubarak time, the movement was stopped only for a short time to miss his autocolon on the usual road that connects the city centre with the southern suburbs.
Although the Murs were smiling as a non-harismatic “salvable wheel” of the Brothers, his personal prestige grew sharply since his victory and Friday speech, in which he tried to present himself not only as a candidate for Islamists but also all those who wanted to bring the case to the end of 2011 against the authoritarian Mubarak.
“Egypt today is a civil, national, constitutional and modern state,” said Mursi, wearing a blue business suit with a red tie, to the judges in the wooden panels of the hall where he took his oath.
Later, Morris was sent to Cairo University, where he had to speak his inaugural speech.
He was given an official reception with an army orchestra, performing a public gym, during which he stood “quietly”.
Military officer Feldmarshal Hussein Tantavi was present.
His arrival was met with the slogan “Army and People — One Hand”, which scandalized hundreds of gathered in the main lecture hall of the university.
Founded in 1908 as a fleet of secular education, the Cairo University in 1970 became a fleet of Islamic student groups.
Morsi took a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahrir Square, where there was a resurrection that had completed the authoritarian rule of Mubarak last year, and promised to return the credentials of the President whose office was deprived of his post by the military council that took action by the defeated leader.
But accepting an official oath before the court, not before Parliament, as it has been accepted, it is a sign that the fight for power will continue.
The word "Murcy" in Tahrir Square was filled with theatrical populist gestures.
The main meeting of the Tumeni Association of Engineers was held on the basis of the Yalutorov vehicle plant.
A new steel tube line was presented in the course of the event.
As explained by the business director of Denis Gribanov, a marketing study was carried out in 2011, with the appearance of a new owner to study the market for the sale of steel structures in the Thumensk area.
It was found that the region consumed more than 50,000 tons of electric tubes per month.
It was subsequently decided to change the vehicle profile and to install equipment on it for their production.
This year more than 7,000 tons of production has been charged.
Investments in the plant amounted to over 120 million rubles, said Denis Gribanov.
In October, a new state was launched, allowing for an increase in the range.
The plant has a small tube profile that is used for carpeting, small forms of construction and in the furniture industry as well as for the construction industry.
We plan to make 50 thousand tonnes of production per year, which will account for about 10 per cent of its consumption in the Tumen region.
Despite the transition to another type of activity, the number of staff in the enterprise has not decreased - now it is 157, in plans for the purchase of new equipment - more than 50 employees.
The company is retraining, and the necessary specialists are selected from the existing ones.
The next year, a new long cutting aggregate is planned to be a thickness of up to five millimeters, which will reduce the productivity of the product, as well as another state, with the speed of production of the tube up to 47 metres per minute.
By the end of 2014, the company will be planning to release the pipes used in the housing industry.
The company ' s management is tasked with closing up to 70 per cent of the need for the Tumen area in this product.
The Deputy Director of the Investment Policy Department Leonid Ostrumov, addressing production managers, advised more attention to the modernization of machine-building enterprises.
This is also the case in the form of State support for industry, which includes reimbursement of interest rates on loans for the purchase of new equipment and the cost of licensing.
For these purposes, 150 million rubles have been allocated for the current year, two thirds of which have already been lost.
The last commission, which will consider grant contracts, accepts documents from undertakings until 15 November.
In addition, the budget reimburses the costs of the participation of local producers in international fairs.
For the next year, the budget has a budget of 150 million rubles that can be used to compensate for lease payments and loans for the acquisition of new equipment.
5 million will be allocated to the fairs, 3 million for energy conservation programmes.
Up to 72 million rubles are reduced to reimbursement of the ordered and paid equipment that is made in the south of the Tumen region for the oil gas complex.
According to Leonida Ostroumov, this form of support would, in the future, cease because it was the reason for the introduction of the tax on the acquisition of useful excavators, which oil companies had paid in the area budget.
They do not do so at present and subsidies become direct cost obligations in the region.
In this regard, the Government considers the area of priority to be direct support for industrial enterprises rather than for the oil sector.
Budget support will be linked to investment projects that will be implemented in production.
Many business leaders expressed concern about the oil situation.
The allocation of equipment to them is a competitive advantage of the South Tumeni area industry, and it will be difficult to compete at the price of the Russian middle belt, where the labour force is cheaper.
In addition, there is an unclear question about the legacy of the new owner of TNC-WR, Rosneft, which has not yet placed its orders on prison companies.
The Agreement for the Implementation of the Utah Project expires in 2013, and no applications for extension have been made.
At present, companies in the South that specialize in equipment for the oil sector cannot form a portfolio of orders for the future year.
The question remains whether taxes from the oil source in the Utah region will be paid to the region's budget or whether they will be paid at the place of registration of the new owner of the place of origin.
Tomic plays 240 hours for an extremist role in the cosset
The Leninian District Court of Tomska sentenced 240 hours of mandatory work of the city's residents, who posted an extremist video network, to the RIA News on Friday, a press representative of the District Court.
According to the court, in March 2013, a man posted a video on his page in a popular social network, which was included in a federal list of extremist materials.
With regard to him, a criminal case has been initiated under article C.C.E.R. "Acts aimed at incitement to hatred and hostility and to the reduction of human dignity done publicly".
"The Lenin district court has dealt with this case in a special way and has recognized the man as guilty of the above-mentioned crime by appointing a 240-hour penalty," said the interviewer of the agency.
She added that the man fully admitted his guilt.
Azarov promised Ukrainians a price on goods after signing an association with the European Union
The Prime Minister of Ukraine, Nikolai Azarov, is convinced that the country's prices will decline significantly after the country signs an association agreement with the European Union.
He said that during the conversation with his readers on Facebook.
I can of course say that prices are determined by a large number of factors, including customs payments.
Thus, following the signing of the agreement and the entry into force of the Free Trade Zone, the level of customs duties on imports of goods from the EU will be significantly reduced.
And that would mean that prices should be reduced.
"This is about goods coming from EU countries," he wrote.
As for other goods, the impact of the agreement on prices will not be so direct, it will be centered.
However, there should not be any price increases.
Therefore, reports on billboards that have recently appeared far enough in our country, that association with the EU is an increase in prices, not at all, or if more accurate, not at all," said Azarov.
The investigators verify information on child abuse in Bijska
On 29 October, the media reported that the educator of one of the children ' s gardens in the city of Bijska had put the child in the basement for educational purposes.
The investigators are currently investigating all the circumstances, as well as legal assessment of the actions of child labourers.
Evgenia Vasileva spokesperson after charges of stupidity
The Evgenia Vasileva, who has been paying close attention to the media for almost a year, has not yet commented on numerous publications in the press, both on thefts in Minobour, and on them personally, on relations with former Minister of Defence Anatoli Serdjukov, her poetry and on the passion for valuables.
However, on 1 November, a figure in the Defence Service case violated silence.
In an interview, Life News Vasileva stated: “The task was, of course, equally one: to extract from me any negative information about the former Minister of Defence.”
There was a chance that I would have to testify, otherwise I would be put in prison.
To date, these threats have ceased.
We're going to court, we're going to prove our innocence.
We have 100 per cent confidence in victory.
In this interview, it can be concluded that, please, most of all, Vasileva has said that she does not care about taste.
It is likely that the statement by the official representative of the FC RF Vladimir Markin was made that the paintings collected by the Defence Service figure had been sub-contracted.
Among the property seized are a number of paintings that the owner, confident in his deep knowledge of art, acquired as the masterpieces of the world’s painting.
However, the expert expert appointed by investigators after the arrest of these paintings found that they were of no artistic value and were, in simple words, a cash subcontractor," Markin noted in early October.
Some of the pictures stolen from the Ministry of Defence...
And then they admitted that they weren't stolen from Minobara, and they said I had a bad taste.
Who has the right to discuss my taste, to discuss some personal moments?
I think it's just pointless," Vasileva says.
On the other hand, while recognizing her guilt in one of the 12 criminal episodes she had committed, Vasileva said: “No, of course not.
To admit something at all.
Moreover, there is no harm to the Russian Federation.
They're just misleading people, that's all.
In addition, in response to today's statement by the HR, that Vasileva is turning away from the study of criminal matters, the counsel of the figure stated that he and his client “the investigator is not able to get to know the material of the case”.
What has been the cause of the revelations under Vasil's house arrest, so far not in contact with the press?
Perhaps how could a woman not answer the charge in a bad way?
Or did the rights of journalists from Cosmosmolka, who claimed a few days ago, that she had “falled into an even greater trance under house arrest” because of the reconciliation of Anatolia Serdjukov and his return to his family?
A well-known military observer, Victor Baranec, in his article "Serdjukov returned to the woman?", wrote: "The followers do not rule out that after such a shock, she may become more talkative in interrogations."
In the past, Basileva made some accusations of the illegal sale of real estate by Minobara.

The Flight Centre seems to have a reverse trend.
The company renewed its forecast for the full year and expects record revenues from the rest of Australia and Britain.
The tourism company now expects its main annual income to be from $325 to $340 million, compared with the previous forecast in the range of $305 to $315 million.
If the current guidelines are reached, they will be 12-17 per cent growth compared to the recorded income of $290.4 million received in 2011/2012.
The Managing Director, Grem Turner, said that Flight Centre had received 8 per cent of the first half of the year and had started the second half with good indicators, especially on Sunday trips to Australia and Britain.
“From the beginning of the year, we have been working on income in our 10 countries, and some of them are expected to have a record of high income before the percentage and tax contributions,” he said.
“This is Australia and Britain, which usually brings us the greatest profits.”
In Australia, a business in the field of leisure in the second half of the year has been remedied to compensate for a slightly weaker internal market for corporate travel.
Similarly, in Britain, the business of Flight Centre in the field of leisure was doing well, while corporate customers were spending less.
Her business in the United States compensated for the losses suffered during the season of the weak first half and was expected to receive income in the third full year of the contract.
Last night the Flight Centre rose by 3 cents to $38.20.
On 31 October, the Barnaul police discovered two playgrounds.
First worked in the Industrial District on the High Street.
At the time of check-in in the institution, the game is gone.
The club has 24 cars.
Another game club was found in the Lenin district on the street of Anton Petrov.
20 slots were used here.
UNMIS Russia on Barnaul reports that administrative material has been prepared under the article “Electrical Organization and Gambling”.
They cut the tech.
In the near future, the evidence will be sent to the courts of the industrial and Leninian districts of the city.
In Ekaterinburg, a criminal killed two sisters and burned their bodies.
In Ekaterinburg, police are looking for a criminal who has been brutally quarreling with two sisters.
After killing them, their bodies burned.
As reported to the "New Region" in the press service of the IMF RF on Sverdlovska, two women with signs of violent death were found in the Kyiv district of the city after the fire was extinguished in a three-room apartment located on the street of Uralska.
The persons of the dead were soon identified.
It was found that this sister, one of them, was a resident of Ekaterinburg 44 years old, the other was a 33-year-old resident of the Orenburg area.
The hotter apartment they took off a few days ago.
His investigation was conducted by Michael Borodin, the chief police officer.
The internal authorities shall draw up various versions of the murder, check the alibis of former convicted citizens and persons inclined to such acts.
In addition, the purpose of which women were taken away from the apartment was to establish, and where they lived before what they were dealing with.
Schools called for more attention in mathematics, orphography and grammar
School courses in English literature will require students to study at least one Shakespeare play, the 19th - century novel, the romantic poetry, and the modern British artistic literature since 1914.
The examination will also provide “non-programmed texts” to encourage more extensive reading.
The joint course of English literature and language will be abolished.
Since 2015, students will be required to submit a separate language exam, with strong recommendations for the selection of English literature as a separate exam.
The Department of Education should issue new training programmes in English and mathematics tomorrow, the first subject under radical review.
It will make changes to other major items next year.
The separate regulatory body in the field of the examinations of OFQUAL will present a revised structure of the secondary school graduation exams, with a new evaluation system and a smaller number of courses.
In summer's speech, Minister of Education Michael Howe said that there would be “a broad consensus that we should reform our exam system to regain public confidence”, insisting that school graduation exams would be “more complex, more ambitious and more stringent”.
Studies show that English schools give less time to mathematics (116 hours per year or 3 hours per week during the fourth period) than most countries.
For comparison, Australian schools average 143 hours a year, and students in Singapore spend about 138 hours.
While the formal requirement for more time to schedule mathematics would not be met, the coalition sources said that large school graduations on mathematics in combination with the higher rate in the rating table would probably provide an incentive to provide additional education for schools on this subject.
In the curriculum, more attention will be paid to “real life” tasks, including financial mathematics.
Tickets in the Hague will be traveling by 200 rubles
Tomorrow, from Blagoveschenska in Haye the tourists will start driving the courts on the air cushion.
For those wishing to join China, this means additional routes
The ticket on the puu is traditionally worth much more than the heat.
As reported in the AmurASSO reference service, the value of the usual ticket will be 2,200 rubles.
The walk through the hall of comfort will be 2,800 rubles.
In this season, the tickets did not travel: at the same price, they drove tourists and the past spring, and the year before, in autumn.
Dmitry Medvedev: GDP growth rate is insufficient for the development of the State
Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev considers that the growth rate of GDP is insufficient for the RF and is confident that the situation can be improved by simplifying business lending and changing the structure of the Russian economy, focusing on innovation, Reuters reported.
We planned GDP growth this year in the area of 3%, maybe even more.
It'll actually be less than 2%.
In the face of recession in a number of European countries, it would not be very bad, but for us, it is small, because the economic base is not as powerful as in a number of countries, and in general, for development to be higher.
It is now very important that the Russian companies, the Russian business, receive normal loans at a normal price, which is the first thing that must be done," stressed the head of the Government.

Travel by sea, rivers and jungles to provide free medical care
Dr. George Bwelle provides free medical care in rural Cameroon
Bwelles and their team carry out almost every exit, taking hundreds of patients
Not so much in this West African country as one for 5,000 people.
Vote here or through your mobile device
Dr. George Bwelle is one of the 10 major heroes of CNN 2013.
You can vote for him or for any of the other 10 major heroes to become the Year of CNN.
This person will receive $250 000 to continue his work.
During the 21st year, George Bwelle saw his father return to life and return to a state of unconsciousness, looking for hospitals that were not adequately equipped to help him.
James Bwelle suffered a car accident in 1981 near Yaounde, Cameroon’s capital.
At first, he had only a broken hand, but the infection spread to the brain and caused a hematoma that had been remembered for the rest of his life.
"There was no neurosurgery in Cameroon," said George Bwelle.
If we had the money, we'd get him out of Cameroon.
Instead, Bwelle has been accompanying her father for years in overcrowded hospitals and hospitals with any treatment they could receive.
"It's not easy," said Bwelle.
- You can leave home at 5:00 a.m., go to the hospital to be the first, but you're not the first.
There's a lot of patients.
Some may die because they have to wait.
The situation has not changed much since Bwelle's father died in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one doctor in Cameroon for 5,000 people.
For comparison, the ratio in the United States is one doctor for 413 people.
And even if the Cameroonians could turn to a doctor, many of them would not be in the carnival.
Two out of five people in that country live in poverty, and almost three-fourths of the health costs are private.
“Their only problem is poverty,” Bwelle said.
“And because of poverty they cannot enjoy their lives.”
Because of the suffering of his father and many of his contemporaries, Bwelle was determined to do something about it.
Last year, Dr. George Bwelle and his team of volunteers carried out 700 free operations.
He's been a doctor himself, and he's working as a forensic surgeon at the central Yawnde Hospital.
It also established an ASCOVIME non-commercial organization, which organizes trips to rural areas to provide free medical care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have assisted almost 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday it and up to 30 people are loaded in vans, tied to medical supplies, and went to the crossroads to visit the village ' s needs.
They don't always have success.
They had to push their cars through rivers and bridges.
But when they come, they meet them like these heroes: it's a party with songs and dances and the best rooms that locals can only offer.
Free medical services in these villages are indeed an occasion for a holiday, and Bwelle, with its wide smile and unlimited energy, is more than happy to join the party.
The next morning, the brigade starts taking hundreds of patients.
"We take 500 people on every trip," Bwelle said.
They come from all the districts within 60 kilometers of the village, and they come on foot.
Each of these exit clinics provides a variety of medical services.
Many people are treated with malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may receive a gift, a gifted eye, or a free birth certificate — documents needed for schools that many poor families simply cannot afford.
After dinner, the brigade conducts simple operations under local anesthesia.
Operations are usually carried out in schools, municipalities or at home; patients are then set up and enter the post-operative zone to free a place for the next person.
By using a generator to illuminate the operation and sanitation of equipment, Bwelle and his volunteers are working until early Sunday morning.
This is an insatiable pace, but the team’s determination usually helps to support village musicians.
"They'll be in the drum all night, so we can fight and continue to work," Bwelle said.
On Sunday, the crew members return to the city, tired but proud of their work.
The group, consisting of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students, carried out 700 free operations last year, and they know that their assistance can be of great importance to those they assist.
One man explained that his free care operation would allow him to work again.
"It will change the future for me and my family," said the man.
In addition to these clinical admissions, Bwelle also works nights in private medical clinics around Yaounde at the hospital.
It is this second job, he said, that provides 60 per cent of its non-profit organization ' s funding; the other funds are covered by private donations.
"I don't even know when he's asleep," said Katie O'Malley, a medical student at the Second Drexel University in Philadelphia, a volunteer at the Bwelle Group.
He's always in the hospital, or he's trying to make money for the organization to continue the campaigns.
For future doctors and nurses, such as O'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe to join the Bwelle in carrying out its tasks, this is an opportunity that they would never have received at home.
"We have been given the opportunity to assist in operations where we have helped to remove five blood or to keep the tools for Dr. Bwelle," O'Malley said.
As a high school student, you'd never get that opportunity in America.
Voluntary students usually pay for their trip to Cameroon, often coming with donated drugs.
But when they arrive in Yaounde, their food, transportation, and training pay Bwelle.
"He's a hero, no doubt," said O'Malley.
He gives his life to this organization, and his desire to help the people of Cameroon is endless.
For Bwelle, the almost permanent load of work is not a difficult test.
To help others live a happy life, to fulfill this promise to their father is what brings him great joy.
“ I’m so happy when I do this job,” Bwelle said.
- And I think about my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
I'm doing this to make people laugh to ease their pain.
Go to ASCOVIME and see what you can help.
Snowden agreed to give evidence of Merkel's interrogation.
Mr. Hans-Christian Strebelle, a member of the Bundestag, met with Edward Snowden in Moscow.
During the interview, the question was whether Snowden could be questioned as a witness by the FWG's GMO on the possibility of hearing the German Chancellor's phone by U.S. Special Forces.
Snowden expressed his willingness to give the necessary testimony.
The meeting could be held either in Moscow or in Germany.
He made it clear, said Hans-Christian Strebel, that he knows a lot.
And despite the fact that the National Security Agency led by China Alexander has blocked all its movements, Snowden is ready to come to Germany.
However, all conditions of his arrival must be clearly defined first. .
Meanwhile, American lawmakers are beginning to take action to respond to the scandal around US spy programmes.
The Senate Intelligence Committee approved yesterday a bill introducing additional restrictions on the activities of the American Electronic Intelligence Unit.
Belarus and Turkey are interested in developing and deepening relations in all areas and areas.
This was reported to journalists by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Belarus, Vladimir Macei, at the press conference following a meeting with the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Turkey, Ahmet Davutoglu, a correspondent from BELTA, reported.
We are very pleased that our Turkish colleagues and partners at all levels are interested in the development and deepening of the Belarusian-Turkish relations in all areas and areas.
Belarus is also interested in this, so we have agreed that the authorities of the two countries will provide mutual assistance and support to entrepreneurs that establish direct trade and economic contacts between themselves," said Vladimir Macei.
He stressed that the Government of Belarus would create all necessary conditions for this and provide maximum assistance.
The Minister also reported that there was a regular 8th meeting of the Belarusian-Turkish Joint Intergovernmental Economic Commission in Ankara, which signed the Protocol.
The Parties have drawn up a road map of Belarusian-Turkish cooperation, which, according to the head of the Belarusian foreign policy department, aims to deepen bilateral cooperation in trade, economic and investment areas, in the fields of industrial cooperation, transport, agriculture, energy, and new forms and areas of interaction.
"The minutes of the last meeting have been fully implemented, and I am convinced that the present protocol will also be implemented, because Belarus and Turkey consider each other as reliable partners," he said.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Turkey, Ahmet Davutoglu, in turn, reported that in the negotiations, the heads of the foreign political units of the two countries had decided to further develop mutually beneficial cooperation and to implement various projects.
Trade between Belarus and Turkey, in the Minister's view, needs to be increased and brought to $1 billion.
Turkey is also an important partner in the area of investment cooperation, which needs to be further developed, as there is no use in this area, he believes.
There has always been a very warm relationship between our countries, and we hope that they will further strengthen and expand.
All necessary conditions will also be established for trade and economic links and for the successful work of Turkish companies in the territory of Belarus and Belarusian enterprises and organizations in Turkey," Ahmet Davutoglu said.
Both reject their words of health
In the midst of a storm of criticism, President Obama yesterday went on to a hunch about his often repeated, unanimous promise that “if you like your medical insurance plan, you can keep it”.
Since hundreds of thousands of people have been notified of the termination of their services by their suppliers, the Republicans have been criticizing the President for the fact that he misleads American society.
Yesterday Obama made his original public promise a few times.
“Most people with medical insurance who work can keep it,” he said in his statement in Boston.
In view of his call for “renewal in the news”, Obama called for other market options for receiving these notifications.
Most people will be able to obtain better comprehensive health insurance plans at the same price or even cheaper than expected.
"You'll get better conditions," he said.
The Administration stated that no one should be surprised that 5 per cent of the people who buy insurance on their own might be forced to change their plans because their coverage did not meet the new standards required by the Act on Accessible Medical Assistance.
"Let me tell these Americans directly: you deserve better," Sibelius said in a statement to the Energy and Trade Committee of the House of Representatives in Washington.
Sybelius, who advocated the implementation of the Act on Access to Medical Care, said that the launch of the Internet sales site was “horrible” since October.
“ I’m upset and upset just like everything, ” she said.
"I really want to get your trust back."
The angry Sibelibius addressed this phrase, which was captured by the included microphone, sitting behind her by the assistant at yesterday's hearings in the Chamber after a heated debate with a member of the House of Representatives Billy Long, a Republican of Missouri, whether she was obliged to join Obama's health programme itself.
After more than three hours of hearing, Long urged Sibelius to say why the “architator” of the Accessed Medical Assistance Act had not voluntarily waived the insurance scheme sponsored by the Government to acquire a plan through HealthCare.gov, which it now imposes on millions of Americans.
Rosbalt rejected media status for non-consensual defences
On 31 October, Mosgorsud decided to accept an invalid license for the registration of Rosbalt, a letter from Lenta.
The detention of the media agency insisted on Roscondozor - for systematic and gross violations of the media law.
During the process, an unpleasant precedent was established: the court considered it possible to close the media, in fact refusing to issue counter-arguments.
What's "Rosbalt"?
The Rosbalt Information Agency was established in St. Petersburg in 2000.
In the following years, the Agency opened the second headquarters in Moscow and a number of regional units.
The Agency also has representations in the countries of the former USSR.
Since 2001, Rosbalt has developed and functioned as a federal information and analysis agency.
By the mid-2000s, the agency had included a list of the most familiar private media in Russia.
However, Rosbalt has always been quite specific: the Agency's core exclusive publications were (and still are) notes with reference to sources in law enforcement agencies.
Discussions on the proximity of the publication to the force structures continued throughout the Agency ' s existence.
In addition to having a large source base in various departments, Rosbalt also spoke in favour of such assumptions and what was in the head of the project was Natalie Chaplin, the wife of Victor Cerquesov.
However, the role of Chaplin in the "Rosbalt" leadership is unclear: it is most often called the "project manager".
The Director-General of the Agency is Larissa Afonina, Chief Editor-in-Chief Nikolai Ulyanov.
In recent times, Rosbalt has not been listed in federal media ratings, either by quote or by the audience.
In October, the agency took the 25th place in the rating of Russian media sites on the LiveInternet version.
According to the same LiveInternet, the rosbalt.ru website averages about 150 thousand unique visitors (and up to 500 thousand visits), a monthly audience of about three million unique visitors.
Among the most popular materials in the past five months, Kremlin's inability to deal with Ukraine, the death of a soloist group "King and Shot" in the capital city.
The Rosbalt conflict with Roscondasor began in July 2013, when an amendment to the media law had entered into force, banning journalists from unconcerned locks.
The authorities found a forbidden lecture in two of the video agency's website ("Jigit of Krasnodar" and "Pussy Riot have distorted oil spills").
The other parties describe different.
Rosbalt, on the basis of the findings of the video, charged with gross and systematic violations of the media law and appealed to the court with a request to select a licence from the agency.
In Rosbalte, claims were found to be incorrect: first, the roles were not editorial, second, the mother words were masked, and third, immediately after the role was warned, they were removed from the site.
The Agency's representatives complained about the claims of the Russian Federation in the world court - and when Mosgorsud adopted the request of the Russian Federation on 22 October 2013, these complaints were still pending.
However, 25 of the world judges have already taken a decision not in favour of Rosbalt: Chief Editor Nikolai Ulianov has been found guilty of a violation of the Code of Administrative Offences and has been charged with 20 thousand rubles - for 10,000 per roll.
Clearly, that would have prejudged the outcome of the hearing in Mosgordud - if you refuse to think that the outcome could have been predestined earlier.
On 31 October, the Court decided to accept the invalid certificate of the registration of Rosbalt, de facto derogating from the status of the media agency.
You can't say "Rosbalt" remained alone during this opposition.
The Agency supported the representatives of Gosduma (a statement on behalf of the head of the Russian Federation, Alexander Jarova, signed 26 MPs on 10 October; the document itself was submitted on the initiative of CRC).
The publication was misdirected by the head of the Union of Journalists of Russia, Universal Bogdanov, President of the Moscow Union of Journalists, Paul Gusev, and the President of the Human Rights Council, Michael Fedotov.
Moreover, according to Bogdanova, the Roscondozor leadership has even provided him with some assurance that the case will not come before the withdrawal of the licence.
The Rosbalt Court has pointed out that the media in Russia is more secure than it is today.
Syria destroyed equipment for arms
Syria destroyed all declared chemical weapons, recognized the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.
The first phase of disarmament in Damascus was completed by the day of the deadline.
By 1 November, Syria had to destroy production and other support facilities for the preparation of combatants for use by Bibisi.
The destruction of the toxic substances themselves or their chemical components should be completed by mid-2014.
According to the representative of OPCW, the toxic substances are currently in sealed warehouses.
International inspectors traveled to Syria after more than 1,400 people died in a chemical attack on the coast of Damascus on 21 August.
The main task of the inspectors was not to waste time - to prevent the Syrian authorities from producing more chemical weapons - and to destroy the infrastructure for mixing chemicals and ammunition.
These production capacities will now be carefully monitored so as not to allow them to do so.
The next wave is mid-November: by this time OPCW and the Syrians must agree on a detailed plan for the destruction of existing stocks of toxic substances.
There's a lot of questions here.
Where will they be destroyed?
Who will provide this equipment?
All Syrian statements will be carefully verified by Western intelligence.
They are willing to advise inspectors on new inspection facilities if there is reason to suspect that Damascus is not open to the end.
The US$ estimates that the shooting was carried out by regular troops.
Syria and Russia insist that this is the case of the Syrian rebels.
The world community has demanded that the Syrian leadership, in accordance with the agreement reached in Russia's mediation, destroy or irradiate all the capacities for the production of gas and liquid fuel and for the filling of those substances.
Now that this phase is completed, the next step must be the destruction of the already existing Syrian arms army.
This arsenal is expected to contain more than 1000 tons of nerve-paralytic toxic substances, natural gas and other prohibited chemicals in several dozens of different locations.
It is necessary for the destruction of OPCW and Syrian authorities to agree on a two-week schedule of action to begin.
The Director of Field Operations, OZHO Jerry Smith, told Bi-bi-si that his inspectors had been "watching for the destruction of equipment".
"They are now unable to carry on the production or mixing of chemical weapons," he said.
The WHO statement states that the inspectors have visited 21 of the 23 sites in Syria and have been convinced that the plants for the production of shells and toxic substances are either destroyed or damaged.
The remaining two objects are too dangerous to carry out an inspection there, as stated in the document, but equipment from there has been transported and verified by OPCW specialists.
According to Smith, the process of destruction of the chemical-weapon generation infrastructure was “insult,” as work had to be done in the context of the ongoing conflict.
At the beginning of October, OZCO received the Nobel Peace Prize, but Smith said that it was time for inspectors to make it clear that they were too busy working.
John Kerry says in his unprecedented confession that the U.S. spying went “unlikely away”
John Kerry demonstrated a mitigation of the US tracking strategy, and made it unparalleled that in some cases, US spying “has gone a long way”.
The Secretary also acknowledged that he was guilty, along with Barack Obama, that he was “on a pilot” when Edward Snowden’s heavy-duty clothes appeared on ANB’s spy activities.
These leaks have put the U.S. Government at the centre of the diplomatic scandal with its allies.
Speaking on the video of the open Government Conference in London, Mr. Kerry said: “There is no doubt that the President and I, as well as other members of the Government, have actually taken up some of the things that are happening on the aircraft, because such an opportunity has already existed — both during the Second World War and in the very difficult years of the Cold War, and finally, 11 September.”
He then became the first high-ranking member of the U.S. Government to recognize that the United States was too far away, but stressed that no rights had been violated.
He said: In some cases it is most hateful.
And the President is determined to shed light on this issue and to explain it to people, and he is now doing a thorough analysis to ensure that no one has a sense of abuse.
I assure you that there is no harm in this matter for innocent people."
Mr. Kerry insisted, however, that the ANB had acted in good spirits and that his tracking operations had saved many lives.
He added: “We are working in a new world where people are willing to explode.
In the world, there is a radical extremism, senseless and complete determination to kill people, to explode people and to attack governments.
And if you were able to capture it, stop it before it happens?
We have actually prevented violations of aircraft, explosions of buildings and killings, because we have been able to learn about these plans before."
Meanwhile, American legislators will go to Europe to help resolve issues related to alleged foreign spying and convince Europeans to continue joint anti-terrorism activities with the United States, the Chair of the Senate Committee on European Affairs said on Thursday.
The Senator of Connecticut Chris Murphy said that he had been talking to members of the European Parliament and others this week and was concerned about their threats to stop participation in anti-terrorism organizations due to disappointment over the report by the National Security Agency.
“For the interests of national security in the United States, it is really important for Europeans to remain our advocates for our common anti-terrorism efforts,” said Democrat Murphy, who served for the first time as chairman of the Senate's subcommittee of international relations on European affairs, in an interview with Washington.
“And I am going to Europe to let them know that we must continue to cooperate in the fight against terrorism, despite their anger over these ANB programmes.”
The news that the ANB has collected millions of phone records in Europe has deteriorated relations with some US allies, although the head of the agency said this week that they were incorrect and reflected a lack of understanding of the metadata gathered by NATO allies and shared with the United States.
Other disclosures have been published by Snowden, which shows that NAB has been monitoring the mobile phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, as well as the telephones of some 34 other world leaders.
The director of the National Intelligence James Clapper has protected spy activities against allies as necessary and said it is a common case on both sides.
In front of this noise, Murphy said that his office was organizing a visit to the Congress, which was expected to take place this year, and that he hoped that members of both parties and the two chambers would be included in the delegation.
The names of other participating legislators should be heard in the coming days.
According to him, the travel programme is still in the process of development.
Although Murphy stated that the purpose of the trip was to promote better relations, he said that some degree of “hardness from better motivations” would also be demonstrated.
He said that European leaders should be honest with their people in what Spanish programmes they themselves have used for many years.
"While we can change our monitoring programmes to better protect the rights of Europeans, they must also agree that we are not the only ones involved in intelligence," Murphy said.
In the meantime, Mr. Kerry had to go to those exits in the Middle East and Poland to address the hostility of the United States strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as the United States intelligence activities.
The new composition of the public observation commissions will increase the impact of prisoners
Today, the Board of the Public Chamber (ODA) can adopt new compositions of the public observation commissions (ONC) in 43 regions of Russia.
If the option put to the vote is adopted, lobbyists will increase their influence.
The UNC is a social structure that controls the conditions of detention in places of detention.
The Cases of Sergei Magnitski and Leonida Razuzjaev, the tensions in the Kopi colony, namely, through the UNK, have been exposed to most of the resonant incidents.
There is a fight between human rights defenders and lobbyists.
At the meeting of the OPC working group on the formation of the OPC, I suggested that the selection of human rights experience should be selected.
"It has not been accepted, and lists have not been drawn up," explains Valerie Borstev.
Borštov is the current President of the Moscow Monitoring Commission and the Association of Independent Observers, a comprehensive human rights defenders' structure dealing with prison problems.
In his home country, Mr. Yabloka had established a law governing the activities of the UN.
The OPC Council should vote on the composition of the OPC in 43 regions of the country.
In 1800 vacancies were claimed by fewer than a thousand volunteers, while in Ingushetia and in the Balkans, competitions were unable to organize due to the lack of candidates.
The OP promises to organize a selection of vacancies.
The ONK Moscow is one of the small commissions with a competition, despite the fact that there will be 40 participants in the new composition instead of 20.
According to Borscheva, the current composition of the headquarters commission of 11 human rights defenders and 9 supporters, and the option of voting in OPC, the ratio is changed from 17 to 23.
In this regard, 30 human rights defenders wanted to be found in the Civil Commission.
Therefore, the representative of the Divine Brotherhood may return to the new composition.
He was a member of the ONC for three years, but never visited prisoners.
Bortev believes that the forces, having appointed their chairman, will be able to make the work of human rights defenders unbearable, so human rights defenders do not exclude a collective exit from the commission.
In their view, the promotion of the forces is coordinated by the UN member Anton Cvetkov, leader of the Russian Officers, an organization that resists the interests of the forces.
"I don't eat babies on the track," said RBK daily Anton Tvetkov.
He denied that he was lobbying for the promotion of any lists and said that he was not going to prevent human rights defenders from visiting arrested opposers.
According to Cvetkova, he was not even interested in what list they are now voting on in the O.P.
The publication of Borstät's information is considered a form of pressure.
Possible success of human rights defenders is the planned change in leadership of the Chilean UN.
Its former leaders will be removed because of last year's copious riots.
In the Public Chamber, it was concluded that the leadership of the local commission had ignored the problems of prisoners.
And here's the ONK Rostova-na-Donu can move from human rights defenders to soldiers.
Of the new lists of "propal" the human rights defender of the local commission, one of his opponents turned out to be, despite the fact that in May 2013, the Federal Public Court excluded him from non-ethical conduct.
The lists of the Moscow and Growth Commissions of Borstev are considered as "a place for Copesk".
The revelations of the Toloconnik Hope did not affect the UNK Mordov, which is considered "strong": in the new composition, only one human rights defender wanted to become, and had not even accepted the documents for the competition.
A member of the OP Council, Nikolai Swanidé, told RBK daily that he had voted against the proposed list, as he was upset with the situation in Moscow and Rostov-na-Donu.
He sent his position to other members of the council.
His colleague on the OP Paul Gusev said he was voting for, because he liked the proposed Moscow list.
He co-ordinated the development of the UNC lists by the Deputy Secretary of OP Vladislav Grib, also a staff member of the FSIIN Research Institute.
The Grib told RBK daily that he did not consider it appropriate to assign candidates to human rights defenders and silhouettes and did not agree that the chairman of the commissions had sufficient authority to prevent the work of its members.
The summit was not to predict the outcome of the vote of the OPC Council.
If the proposed list is rejected today, an amended option will be issued in the coming days.
Australian woman appealed against the prison term in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney sentenced to 15 years in a prison on the island of Phuket for a false claim that she had been attacked by a taxi driver, appealed to a sentence and was released under bail.
Steve Roshel Bemford was initially recognized by the Phuket Provincial Court on 15 June as guilty of a false charge after the Thai police reported that a local taxi driver had attacked on the night of Sunday, 10 June, while two other men held her.
However, the video surveillance camera later found that she had returned to her hotel well after breaking up with her Australian boyfriend.
The Phuket police interrogated Bemford within two days before she recognized that she had made this story.
Before the trial, she was held in local police chambers.
Bemford was sentenced to a 15-day prison term in the detention centre of the general regime on the Phuketa border, not in the adult women ' s prison.
She is a daughter of the former Australian League of Peter Tanx, who has been in the Foreign Ministry of Canberra for her daughter.
Tanks told Sydney's Sunday Telegraph that the whole family was “very concerned” with the welfare of their daughter and was waiting for her return to Australia.
“It’s obvious that it was an alarming time, but we hope that she will return home as soon as possible,” Tanks said.
Bemford appealed to his sentence and was released on bail in 50,000 B.C.E.
According to reports in Australia, she is currently on her vacation in the Krabi resort in southern Thailand.
The legal sources in Thailand reported that Bemford was currently a local lawyer in Phukete, but warned that the appeal could result in a court increase its sentence for up to two years and allow it to be held in a prison for adults.
However, after the recent murder of Australian tourist Michel Smith in Phukete Thailand, he could also seek to restore his corrupt tourist image, which would lead to a valid conviction.
Roman Senchin is now in Paris at the presentation of his Roman "Eltischeva", translated into French.
Remember, that's what his novel became the finalist of four prizes: "The Clear Pole", "The Russian Booker", "The National Bestceller" and "The Big Book".
Last year, the author of the book was awarded the prizes of the Russian Federation's cultural Government.
Roman Senchin is an unquestionable leader in the generation of the present 30-year-old and sororcal prosaic.
Almost every publication of his hard-working stories and stories in modern life has sparked heated disputes among critics of the most diverse ways.
It can be claimed that the combined articles on the prose and publicity of Senčina, reviews of its books and journals create a curious and unexpected landscape of Russian literature from the end of the 1990s to the beginning of 2010.
In the discussions on the “one of the most controversial modern writers”, according to the critic Sergey Chuprinin, most of her participants are said to understand the word “literacy” as they see the present and future not only of our vocabulary but also of our lives.
Unfortunately, most of the articles and reviews from regional media and blogospheres were not included in the book.
Analytical and review articles are usually provided in the "Abstakes..." sections.
