What is she supposed to do, the ČSSD? The Czech Social Democrats in Prague don't know any place of refuge or the "confectionery".
The new councillors of the capital of the ČSSD series will obviously have to overcome certain language barriers in order to understand their old-new colleagues from the ODS in the Prague Council and in the city representation at all.
The newspaper Aktuální.cz has once "cut off" members of the new Council from the ČSSD, as they rule the notorical slang that has been in the last years, in which the present coalition partners in Prague were at the Ruder.
The coded wordchatz, which was introduced by the Prague political elite in the scared era by Mayor Pavel Bém, is dismissed by some of the most famous actors, situations and causes.
Surprisingly, the new Councils showed that these new terms are something in the dark.
At least they claimed that.
"Who's Voldemort?"
"I don't know."
"I am a new in Prague's politics," Lukáš Kaucký, the new Councilman for Culture, responded to the test of the "Patinian Dictionary".
But also Councilman Karel Březina - a political veteran - reacted similarly.
For example, the term "Golfloch".
"This is the only expression of those you present to me here that I go and use again."
" Otherwise, I don't care much about snakes."
Out of the vocabulary published by the daily Aktuální.cz in June this year before the ODS election Congress, the editorial took out six terms, especially those that are notoriously associated with the Prague Magistrate.
The Social Democrats should define the terms "Voldemort", "the largest Prague Golfloch", "go to the confectionery", "Stynacken", "The City's betrayal" and "remain".
Three Prague Councilmen agreed to the test, the fourth - Antonín Wineert, the future head of Prague’s school - promised first his participation in the conversation, but did not even take the hearing off.
The fifth Councilman, Peter Dolínek, rejected the test from the outset.
"I don't care about these things, and I don't judge how the citizens of democracy interact."
"For me, it is important how we understand ourselves in our programmes," he said.
As already indicated, Lukaš Kaucký in the above-mentioned strike line would probably not have recognized that the talk is from the influential entrepreneur and friend of former mayor Bém, Roman Janousek.
The term "Voldemort" says nothing at all, and the only term he got right in the test was "the biggest Prague Golf Loch".
"That's the Blanka Tunnel," says Kaucký, but he added, "but I know that from the newspaper."
And jokingly, "I'm probably going to have to take a language course."
The "Golfloch" will then be delivered not only by Matador Karel Březina, but also by the President of the Council for Environmental Questions Lukaš Plachý right as a tunnel Blanka.
But both Social Democrats also know for whom the term is Voldemort and Lukaš Plachý even knows where to find this figure and what it means to "go to the confectionery".
"I think that means going to some Prague gastronomy operation," Plachý is pretty close to the puzzle solution, knowing that this is the seat of Janousek companies.
In agreement with Březina, however, he claims to have created these knowledge from the newspaper rather than that it would be his own word.
According to the test participants, it does not appear to be a similar snake among the Social Democrats.
"I have also asked my colleagues, but obviously there's no such thing with us."
"We call us by name, we also use shorts or tip marks again," says the President of Prague ČSSD Petr Hulinský - named "Hulda" by his party owner.
"In the school I was called Bríza (Birke), but I don't know if my colleagues call me that," Karel Březina told us.
The newspaper Deník Aktuální.cz has tried the name and see there - it works.
For the party owners, the "Opa" or less the "old" is friendly, the representative of Miroslav Poche, who took an interest in the party sponsoring before the elections, is called "Igráček" by some colleagues (known Czech lego figure).
The only sign that allows the Social Democrats to use the internal language is the latter.
Hullínský may not have it if it is called "Hulda", but Deník Aktuální.cz registered another top marks of the President of Prague.
His top name "Doctor of Gummiknüppel-Recht" is allegedly to do with the fact that Petr Hulinský acquired his title Doctor juris at the Bratislaver Police Academy.
The government wants to stop the torture of "Hexen" and issue a brochure
Women who are stamped in Burkina Faso as witches usually display a number of common social characteristics.
They belong to the older generation, they find no work - for example for health reasons, they are free and have no children.
If one of these women goes to the witch, she's strictly isolated so that she can't be dangerous to the rest of the village.
"Men are very rarely affected by this fate."
"Even young and healthy women are spared this because they help with work and bear children," says an ordering sister, who is in the capital city of the West African state of Burkina Faso in a special home, cares for more than a hundred women who have been expelled from their communities.
The local government has now decided to take action against this abnormal "social measure".
And for this reason, a brochure was issued to stop the "excuse of sex".
But the thing has a hook.
"More than 70 percent of all adults in Burkina Faso can't read," the newspaper "the Standard" pointed to the dilemma of the written explanation.
Hexerei is also seen in other African countries.
In Ghana, the neighboring country of Burkina Faso, the 27-year-old Ammy Hemmahová was tortured by three women and two men to death - they burned them with petroleum and simply burned them.
The BBC server also reported on this incident.
The perpetrators claimed, however, that the matter would have been only a meeting of unfortunate circumstances.
According to your version, oil that will be used for ritual saves is extracted.
And indeed, after the group tried to "extend a wicked spirit" from the woman."
The isolation of "Hexen" is supported by people here, regardless of their education.
"The Standard" quoted a 42-year-old businessman from Burkina Faso as saying, "The hairdressers of human souls are a danger earlier than today," he said.
While the government in Burkina Faso is at least trying to remove the hexenjagd, the Gambian President himself took the lead in the past year.
"President Yahya Jammeh invented a monstrous witch after the death of his aunt, as these supposedly had a share of their death and would now try to kill the president himself by black magic."
"He called for help from the nearby Guinea, who, along with policemen, soldiers and the president's bodyguard, had violently taken women and men out of the Gambian villages and brought them to the president's farm in Kanilai," the Amnesty International said in its report.
On the farm, the mixed people were forced to drink an extract from plants with hallucinogenic effects, but also caused stomach and kidney problems.
Two of the arrested people did not survive the stay on the farm.
Just because of international pressure, the almost thousand prisoners were released again.
A tenant of Bacala: He is hot in the oven - yet he is paying higher rent
An older dissident leaves the client centre of the company RPG Byty of Zdeněk Bakalak Zdeněk, the largest private owner of rental apartments in the Czech Republic.
Under the arm a folder with three new leases to three apartments: for the own and the apartments of his daughter and his son, who just suffers a prison sentence.
All three of them were just increased in terms of the so-called "deregulation".
Instead of 3500 kroner monthly rentals, the son will pick up 4100 kroner next year for a 2-room apartment with kitchen of the second category.
"And there's not even running hot water in the apartment and you have to heat in a simple coal oven," he is angry with his finger on the new rental contract of the son, to whom he has a full power.
"But what - I have signed," he explains half agreed and half resigned.
The BytyOKD.cz Association, which described the new terms of the rental as "incorrect and immoral", advises the tenants not simply to sign the new contracts and to wait until 7 December, in which it intends to publish an instruction against such contracts.
But the man only cares.
"One says this, the other says that," he makes a window face.
The Ostrava region is thus becoming the major deregulation laboratory.
After a new year, this deregulation is facing most of the rental apartments in the Czech Republic, whose tenants have not yet paid market rent.
Currently.cz decided to visit this "labor" personally.
The RPG workshop in Havířov is one of four in the Ostrava region and already nine in the morning this Tuesday is breaking full.
Right next to the door are the bodyguards of a security agency and a call device with her.
"Render 2011", a special keyboard lights on the touchscreen.
Shortly tapped and already the device triggers a number list.
We have hardly counted the number "157" and already taps it on the large display on the roof of the waiting room.
A half a second later, you're on the line.
A little later, an older couple enter the waiting room to ask for the rent, but the storm in the waiting room obviously does not apply to the new rent.
Most people are here to solve the common problems - repairs, insurance matters and so on.
From mid-November in the Ostrava region, the envelopes with the new rental contracts will be extended to most tenants of the total 44,000 apartments of the RPG portfolio in the mailboxes.
The RPG Byty suggests in the letters a rental increase of about 15 to 38 percent.
The special switch for the new rentals in the client centre has been opened since 18 November.
"The action runs a little over a week, that is, it's only the beginning," the ladies behind the switch respond after a moment of delay when the "client" emerges as a journalist.
The deregulation and Bacala's former mining apartments are a brilliance theme.
Before the elections, the President-in-Office of the Parliament from Ostrava, Lubomír Zaorálek, of the ČSSD, had taken up this subject quite well, no wonder that today the newspapers are full of it.
"I want a new floor of them for twenty years."
"Don't worry. WC-Brille could change them," says the man mentioned in the entry air.
To date, employees are particularly encouraged by the employee on the switch to make sure that they actually receive the promised rent reduction that promises them RPG when they sign the special offer in time.
The other tenants who sign the new lease by 15 December are also expected to benefit from a half-remote holiday rental.
So far, "deregulation switch" in Havířov is everything but overloaded by requests.
"Only about 40 to 50 customers from the 360 clients were rented in 2011 because of this," the switch officers estimate.
RPG offers individual rental agreements on their websites as well as wall tables where it appears necessary.
However, if the rental parties do not agree to the new lease, it will be determined by an independent court.
"This should not be a threat, but it is as information about the only possible and fully legitimate legal procedures to be understood," RPG explains on its website.
"No one goes to court here," says one of the employees of RPG Byty and a man on the street in front of the client center at least partially right.
"I have 13,000 (Kron) rents, of which 5,000 are left for food, where I should take the money for a trial," he says.
Then the employees will be insecure.
"Look at me."
"Mr. Zaorálek tells them about the media that they should not sign and so the people are still waiting," she says.
The regulated rental ends in most of the Czech Republic in the new year 2011 and according to RPG Byty, the rental increase is an economic necessity.
"The existing height of the rent is not enough to maintain the housing fund," argues Pavel Klimès, the director of the apartment portfolio of the company RPG Byty, and - precisely the cancellation of the housing fund criticised by the tenants is, in the opinion of the owner, the main reason for the increase in rent.
While RPG was able to invest in the apartments from the rentals received between 2005 and 2010, it is expected to be 5.2 billion in the four years 2011 to 2014.
On the large-format LCD display on the deck against the wrists in the Havířov waiting room, however, a few red lighting information is constantly on.
"The rental increases in 2011 account for 15% and less for 31 200 apartments, which means more than 90% of RPG's apartments."
"Always means a maximum of 7,50 CZK per square meter and month", is to be read on the LCD monitor.
Only 400 apartments from the RPG portfolio increase the rental by 38 percent.
"In these cases, the increase is extremely low in rental prices of 19,66 CZK per square meter," RPG argues.
At 2600 apartments, the rental remains at the same height as next year.
RPG Byty promises that the deregulation does not push the rent upwards, but gradually takes place within four and eight years.
What's more - the company has a further obligation: all income from the rental increase (see diagram) wants to put the company back in the apartments, especially in heating savings - in new windows and in heating.
But, above all, those who sign the agreements on the increase in rent will benefit.
Architects view - the office also includes a children's garden
The office building Avriopoint in Brno is the new seat of Arch.Design.
But who would expect a mini children's garden here, with all that belongs to it: colourful walls, creative furniture, a lot of toys and even a mini-game on the outside terrace.
This children's garden has been available to Arch.Design employees since last year.
The design and architecture office Arch.Design, from which the studios come up with a whole series of so-called brünner buildings, calculated from the first drafts for the new building of Avriopoint with the space for its small-scale garden.
In a wise expectation, because most of his 90 employees (inside) are in babyboom age and the company is located to return the project antennas and architects as quickly as possible to their workplace.
Together with the possibility of short-term work, the children's garden is another bonus, the Arch.Design has to offer its employees in the concept of their social program.
Building engineers and architects have so much easier to bring their demanding profession and child care under a hat.
The mini children's garden is an original idea of Arch.Design's employees and with the support of management, they managed to earn the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs for their project.
The operating mini-child garden is financed by the Operational Programme on Human Resources and Employment by the European Social Fund and the State Budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to this funding (CZK 2.8 million grants), the necessary facilities and equipment were available and for the duration of 2 years is provided for qualified staff and for the operation.
After the expansion of the funds (2 years) the company Arch.Design is obliged to continue operating the mini-child garden for another 3 years at its own cost.
The preparation of this project took place a whole year, with the company's economic rating providing effective assistance in the resolution of the application.
A well-qualified staff - a nurse and a teacher of the children's garden - care for children without age restrictions, although most of them are over three years of age.
And since this is about a mini-child garden, only 5 children may be present at the same time, however, the day changes over several children.
The children's garden is flexible to the needs of parents who have the children of all employees in relation to the use of the child's garden the same rights - regardless of the firm hierarchy and their respective position.
Although it is individual education and care, the content of the programme in the mini children's garden is still comparable to the framework programme for pre-school education.
The children are not only playing here, but above all excellent teaching is offered to them - from basic knowledge to pre-school education, as well as learning English.
The classroom is not only with toys and creative games, but also equipped with a computer available to children.
More - the presence of small children in the company contributes to a friendly and positive company environment.
The parents can look at the children at any time, and so the stress disappears when the children are picked up from a far-off garden.
Parents therefore take advantage of their working time more productively.
No wonder there are natural and loyal employers working relationships.
Arch.Design thus chose among the Czech companies that offer significant benefits in the recruitment of new employees, which are family-friendly and through such programs enhance their staff marketing.
A bone house also fascinates after 100 years. Look at Gaudi's interiors
The roof encourages like the back of a prehistoric axis, the stairs like the vertebral column of a dinosaur and the balconies are crushed fish mills.
This is the Casa Batlló of the Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona.
From the inhabitants of the house, the house with its organic forms received the peaks of "Knochenhaus".
Organic shapes, wild colors, the unusual use of stone, tiles and mosaics, the façades and contemporary soft lines, all these are typical features for Antonio Gaudi’s style of youth.
The façade of the house plays with dreamy lines, charming colors and textures that remind nature and life.
Only in a more precise way can it be observed that everything is governed by geometry, rhythm, and thinking order.
In the night the whole facade is even more plastic, more dramatic, and the special lighting enhances the brightness of the colors.
The same swinging lines and curved shapes also dominate the interior of the house.
Well-formed wood copys the window frames, lands, Ziel elements of doors, even guckholes and performances.
The house Batlló in the Eixample district on the inhabited shopping street Passeig de Gràcia nr. 43 was created by the construction of a house from 1877, the architect Emilio Sala Cortese.
The reconstruction took two years and was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrial Josep Batlló, was originally on the abbreviation of the old and the construction of a completely new building, but finally he agreed to the idea of Gaudís to an unusual and even cheaper construction.
However, the rental house Casa Batlló designed Antoni Gaudí not alone.
He worked with architect Josep Maria Jujol.
The decorations for the representative apartment of the real estate and also the use of mosaics on the facade were made on its own.
However, many other artists and artists also worked with the design of the facade.
The joint work on the drafts for the Casa Batlló was the beginning of fruitful cooperation between Jujola and Gaudí.
Jujol also participated in the construction of Gaudís Haus Casa Milá in Güell Park, where there are also other works of Antoni Gaudí.
Shortly after its completion, the house was acquired by the inhabitants of the home of its organic forms due to the peaks of "Knochenhaus".
Others called it the special window-opening mechanism because of the "dwelling house".
It is also said that on top of the building, the sword of the holy Georg, the patron of Catalonia was represented.
But also other imagery elements symbolize hidden religious motives.
Gaudí designed a unique central heating system with ventilation channels and typical fireplaces for the house at the time.
It's a little bit weird. It's a 45-degree trend.
In his creation, Gaudí ignored all the construction regulations at the time and was not allowed to wear any of these.
However, before the construction began, he obtained from the city the corresponding building permit, but the details made by him about the planned reconstruction were so vague that the city's fathers were so dissipated two years later at the completion of the project that they demanded relief.
Among other things, the Soviets also insisted that the construction with its arrows even enter the public ladder.
However, there was no change, on the contrary - only fifteen days after the city district's call for this, Josep Batlló applied for permission to rent the two top-level buildings of the house - and it was promptly granted to him.
The housekeeper himself entered the lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor there was a living room, on the third floor there were the bedrooms and private rooms of the apartment.
The ground floor was confiscated in a jewelry store.
The entire six-storey building passes a stairs up to the roof terrace.
The basic elements of the structure removed all right angles and straight lines and replaced by curved and curved walls.
Gaudí, however, also worked with a modern concept for the mutual connection of spaces.
The social part can be fully connected by opening the leases, and thus a larger society could easily boast without having to give up a certain intimacy in a more confidential conversation.
The house also received a fairly unusual roof and two other floors with Gaudís Umbau, except for a new facade.
Gaudís is also impressive game with the light as well as the blue and white glass tiles with which the inner courtyard is dressed and the lights.
The game of these two colors gives all the floors of the house a maximum light.
He made it easy to use the principle that White better reflects the light than dark colors that absorb the sunlight on the contrary.
The House Casa Batlló, which was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2005, can visit today anyone.
On the first floor, the most spacious and magnificent apartment of the public is made available.
The houseowners decided to take this step only in the year and this on the occasion of the 150th birthday of the famous Creator.
When it was found that this was a rather effective business, the visits were held, as well as extended to other joint and roof areas, including the roof terrace.
However, the price for visiting the building time is not a paper style, it is 16,50 euros, students, pensioners, groups and holders of tourist exhibits get 20 percent discount.
This amount exceeds the entry prices for other Gaudí buildings in the city.
Anyone who wants to know the real atmosphere of the house with his dragon towers should try to close friendship with one of the house dwellers and visit him at home.
The right mattresses and the right bedrock? Women have different wishes than men
Not the most beautiful beds, but the quality of the surface - so mattresses and rust make up the good bed.
However, these must be supplemented harmoniously in order to meet the user's wishes.
In the selection, many things play a role - the weight, the size, the state of health and not least the sex of the sleeper.
Also important is the interior in which mattresses and rust are subordinated.
Typical example?
In a weekly house where not regularly heated, latex mattresses are not well suited, as they need much longer to become "hot".
In addition, they are significantly worse than usual polyurethane mattresses.
And they should be returned on a regular basis.
If they do not have enough air channels in the core and are still on a fixed plate, moisture is present: so it is not excluded that they form under their mold.
Of course, the choice also plays a role in what you are used to.
Those who have been abroad for a long time, where very high mattresses are common with soft layer, will find it difficult to get used to a low mattress with hard surface.
"Although all the ice hockey players who came back from the NHL have complained to me that they can't sleep right here anymore."
"For their hidden shoulders, hips and hips, they simply need a visco layer of foam (Memory Foam - a form memory polymer)."
"I recommend these, among other things, sugar-treated people who suffer from a disorder of the nervous system, so that they can receive the "information" from the joints and the skin badly," explains Sylva Hadamczyková, who specializes in powder furniture.
That's why I've cared for many ice hockey players years ago, but also other customers with Visco-Schaum (Memory Foam).
"Today this is no longer a problem, because such mattresses offer the manufacturer Tempur, the Italian company Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer Tropico."
And you don't necessarily have to be a famous ice hockey player to appreciate the advantages of the visco show.
This "wonder" is actually very simple.
The foam optimizes its hardness and shape according to the absorbed heat, otherwise it softens regularly on the warm body.
Nowhere does it feel like in the night you don't wander around like after a hard fight.
You just sleep a lot better.
In addition, the viscous foam also offers protection against decubitus (Wundbrand).
When selecting the matrix size, you should still calculate the length of the soles, i.e. approximately 21 to 34 cm.
Men like women who are 180 cm in size need a 210 to 220 cm long bed.
Each of the straps should be at least 90 cm wide, so together 180 cm.
For single beds, for example for singles, 120 to 140 cm are fitted.
The comfort is half and also for any visitors.
Otherwise, the following rule applies to the ideal bed width: "If you are on the back, there should still be enough room for the slightly angled arm," says Helena Prokopová, the master of the wrists and room replacements who has been devoted for years to the problem of healthy sleep and the ergonomics of furniture and this subject is also presented in specialized schools.
On a double bed, everyone needs their own roast and their own mattresses, but be careful when shopping, so that the mattresses are also high.
Otherwise, nothing else remains than mounting the rock at different heights and this is not possible at all at any bedtime.
foam mattresses should be at least 14 cm high, mattresses with spring skeleton 15 cm, of which should be at least three centimeters on the shape layer and the fine powder.
"With your hand or when you insert it, you must not feel the feathers," Helena Prokopová warns.
Each mattress requires a special type of brush.
Fully polished beds with mattresses and basements like adult Siamzwilli have nothing to look for in the bedroom.
These mattresses can't blow up and the relationship can't wash what's going on today.
And since one night you lose between 0.2 and 0.75 l of sweat, it is clear that the mattress will slowly become a giant (and hidden sieve) after five to seven years.
This is why experts reject advertising, which promise a lifetime of up to 25 years, even lifelong guarantees.
Every thing you've got is her and her.
And so a practical advice from the dealers: In mattresses of 120 or 140 cm width, you should not look at the hygiene of washable, removable relationships, but it is recommended to use a mattress cleaner that can be easily removed and washed.
Even if today, as a rule, matrices are made with round-up locks, so that after opening you get two halfs (very important for washing and washing machine size!), the manipulation with larger mattresses, especially performed alone, often like the unequal fight between David and Goliath.
Do they have a hard plate in their bed instead of a rock?
Get out of here!
Or the highest for a bed for unloved guests and for one night only.
Also, they should prefer to use the plate with air holes (if they are not already inside) and mattresses with spring skeleton and 15 cm minimum height with so-called pocket spring cores and fine powders.
Polyurethane mattresses do not belong to such a base.
For non-adjustable latrine ruses with 14 to 18 latrines (lamellas), latex or sandwich mattresses (e.g. combinations of latex and coconuts) are always suitable for latrines with a larger number of latrines, i.e. from 28 to more latrines, with latrine supports in the lumbar area and the possibility of regulating latrine hardness.
No mattresses with spring skeletons are included on adjustable lamella rice, as they do not react to the ergonomic production.
In addition to the setting of the stairwells, special flexible shoulder modules are also offered.
This is a special fixation of the spring wires, which enables the spring wires to be pressed or even angled so that they allow the point-by-point hints of the shoulder of the shoulder.
Especially for men with broad shoulders an important thing.
There are even mattress manufacturers who have begun to use soft zones for the shoulder area at "herren mattresses".
The ladies are also thought of - they are allowed to do these soft zones in the main area.
For most demanding customers, point-static wing suspension systems (Lattoflex) or rock with point-elastic contact pads with so-called multitorsion suspension are determined.
The pressure is distributed to several points, thereby reducing tension.
But - when you use a bad (too big and full) head pockets for the right mattress and right rust, most benefits go back lost.
Here too is a rule: the head cushion should support the head, its tips should only reach the shoulders so that the shoulder muscles can relax.
Ideally, therefore, a 50 x 60 cm large pocket appears, as the Scandinavia likes.
In the side area, the head cushion (with the shoulder load zone in the breast or the soft zone in the mattress) should be equal to the shoulder height.
Something that has our modern mattresses has to do with the single (filled with heu) sacks of straw.
Modern manufacturers are increasingly using natural materials or at least their mixtures.
The new magic word "Bio" is also used in mattresses.
Instead, petroleum materials are used to produce polyurethane foams that are increasingly natural oils - such as rice and soya oil.
Soja is probably used by all known manufacturers.
"Bio is called in the case of mattresses whose core is of pure natural origin from materials," says Petr Vasičekek from Tropico Plus.
But natural substances are also used in the manufacture of mattresses - one of the first was Aloe Vera.
However, you can also enjoy microcapsules that spread fresh forest or lavender fragrance when you sleep.
Here too you make a difference between a man and a woman.
While men use a "colder" plant extract from birch leaves to absorb the heat and cool the body, the relationships for women "heating" have an effect.
Extracts from red paprika shoes are the blood circulation, so the weaker sex becomes warm during sleep.
And today's favorites?
Matrates from cold foam (it has larger pores with damaged cell structure and is therefore more breathable than commercial polyurethane and also much more flexible).
The combination of the different layers (hards) of cold foams and visco foams creates multi-zone mattresses that know exactly where heads, hips and vertebraes are.
For a high quality mattress, however, you have 7,000 crowns and more.
However, health mattresses are usually charged with lower VAT, as they are considered as medical aids.
As the first Czech company, Gumotex was granted this advantage.
It's not that easy to save on the mattress and on the rock.
Again and again, there are special offers from manufacturers and dealers that offer two mattresses for the price of one.
The Magniflex brand offers the Matrate Duofreize with respect to hidden Visco-Schaum Memory for 11.990 CZK.
The second one is for free.
It was the material tempur that led the era of viscous foams with open cell structure and high density into almost cosmic tempo.
No wonder they were developed for NASA, because the astronauts are exposed to enormous overload at the start.
Tempur is soft at heat, in cool environment it strengthens itself again.
Thus it fits perfectly with the human body and optimally distributes the body pressure.
It is therefore not only ideal for preventing print fires, but generally increases the comfort of sleep.
However, viscous foams are used not only for mattresses, but also for other health products, such as for special footrests, which are intended to facilitate the legs and the tissues.
Domestic manufacturers use e.g. the foam materials Eucatherm C, Twinsaver or similar products.
More and more parents want human surveillance devices to have the child under control
The fear of their own children grows and thus more and more parents consider monitoring them through GPS.
The system that was originally invented for driving to cars can be as good people as it would be in such cases, as in the case of the undetected disappearance of the nine-year-old Anička Janatková.
The device is now about as big as a cigarette box, but soon it should not be larger than a bracelet watch.
Many people have put the case of the missing Anička in fear and horrors and thus keep them looking at the means and ways to better protect their children.
Also for the price of damage to their privacy.
"We are all trying to tell everyone that it is not about spying around here, but about an effective means to reduce the likelihood that there will be a tragedy," Petr Pilin from the company Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of GPS locations on the Czech market.
"I admit that it can happen in a case of abuse of such devices, for example, if you put someone in the bag without knowing about it, but we didn't have to record such a case so far."
"Most customers really buy it for security reasons," added Pilin.
In his opinion, however, the child should always know the purpose of the "schachtel" and how to use it in the event of need.
However, child psychologist Dana Bočkova points out that if a child does not have to wear such a thing, it will simply be removed.
"Even very small children show great creativity when it comes to losing certain things deliberately if they don't want to be controlled."
"Since the phones initially raised great expectations with the parents, they can easily be turned off like these new surveillance devices," says Mrs. Bočkova.
Your opinion is also controversial whether such an institution actually helps in the event of an attack.
"In the planned executions, the Kidnapper is practically always checking whether the child has any electronics with which it could be sorted."
"Today it's the phone."
"If such monitoring equipment were to be used more widely, they would also be looking for them, as their sale would certainly be accompanied by massive advertising."
"In these cases, police criminals are always a step forward," says psychologists.
However, it argues that similar devices can be very helpful in a sudden attack by a paedophile.
Roberta Čech from the company RC Monitoring according to which the location services are offered for both cars and persons, the existence of such a device can also help if destroyed immediately after the attack.
"The device can be set up in such a way that it reports the respective position at certain intervals."
"Even if it was destroyed immediately, at least the last position of the person concerned is available."
"In the case of expensive devices, even a voltage meter is integrated, which means that if you fall down and lie down without movement, the device will immediately send a warning in the position specified," said Mr. Czech.
In his opinion, similar services could also provide intelligent mobile phones with navigation, only one needs to play a special software.
The problem with the current location devices is that it is either a device in strip wooden box size that resembles the trailers or a smaller cell phones.
There's always the danger of losing it.
According to Mr Pilin of the Macro Weil, it is therefore tested in the present devices that look like normal digital clocks.
"This has the advantage that any attacker must not at all recognize that it is a monitoring or location device.
"Or he only notices after a certain time what the police have to do," he adds.
No matter what direction the development takes - to arms or trailers, the same technology is always used as in the vehicle location.
So for the combination of location function using the GPS system (as well as the Navi in the car) and the function of a mobile phone that reports the current position.
The army has so many closures that you can convert all of the Czechs but you can only hold two years
The Czech army has purchased 445 kilometres of closure, sealed with brakes.
In the previous year, the Ministry of Defence had already delivered 224 kilometres of Zündschnur to the army camper.
It is comforting to know that the fighting forces have been in place for 225 years.
The problem is only the durability of the closures - two, but at most four years.
The army bought the closures from the stock company STV Group, i.e. for 40 million kroner.
In his explanation for the purchase of this huge amount of Zündschnur, General Staff MF DNES replied that the soldiers would consume the Zündschnur 60 kilometres a year.
According to the research by army pyrotechnicians, the MF DNES argues that the entire army had to complete an extremely intensive pyrotechnic training every year - from all generals and officers of the army commanders, to the secretaries and women.
Defence Minister Alexandr Vondra and Army General Vlastil Picek are not exempt.
Only in this way did the remarkable annual consumption of 60 kilometres of seal doors justify half-way.
This length corresponds to 25,000 detonations.
But so too, these armies would be rich for more than ten years.
But if the old rule of experts still applies that for the training of each new professional soldier, two meters of closure, then the army has created a calming for the 225 years already mentioned by these new purchases, even in view of the increased need of the pioneer and special units.
In this case, soldiers of the rapid deployment brigade complained to Prime Minister Vondra soon, they had almost no patterns for hand firearms anymore, so that shootings of missing funds are severely restricted.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
"I don't even know why they buy from us such a lot of closures."
But finally this is their decision, they will know what they need."
"For us, the army is a good customer, which we want to fight as a dealer most widely," says the sales manager of the STV Group Jan Děcký.
Jan Pejšek, the spokesperson of the Ministry of Defence, argues that the purchase of hundreds of kilometres of Zündschnur would have covered the army for at least ten years with this "munition".
Jan Děcký from the STV Group, however, speaks only from a four-year period of use of the seal and police and army pyrotechnics for only two years.
"When it comes to perfect storage, the four years mentioned may also be possible," says one of them, who wants to remain anonymous, in order not to be subjected to criticism by the army as a soldier.
After the duration of use, any ammunition must be thoroughly tested whether it is still reliable and not endangering the lives of soldiers.
But these tests are not unnecessary, but they cost more money.
Another argument of the Ministry of Defence is the reduction of the quantity for the 445 kilometres of closure.
"They cost us 60 percent less than the last year's delivery of 244 kilometres," the speaker Pejšek tells us the position of the buyers of the Ministry of Defence.
Only for comparison: The annual consumption of seal rings of police pyrotechnicians, the ammunition from the Second World War or the Soviet Brotherhood, has been nearly 1,500 metres long for several years.
And the police always order only such quantities of this ammunition that they can still consume before the end of the period of use.
Because of the safety of pyrotechnicians, it is also possible to buy more modern and therefore reliable closures.
The Ministry of Defence has nevertheless enormous problems in the liquidation of tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the time of the Warsaw Treaty, when the two hundred thousand head of the Czechoslovakian People's Army prepared for the Rhine on its campaign.
According to the pyrotechnics who claimed the MF DNES, the Czech forces expect the same problem in a few years when liquidating hundreds of kilometers of old closures, which they have bought today as "funishable".
To this day, the contacts that I have gained through competition will come to my attention.
The winning position in the competition "Small Entrepreneur of the Year" helped Lukaš Pytloun to sell the Franchise of his hotel.
The winner of the last year of the competition "Small Entrepreneur of the Year" was Lukaš Pytloun from Liberec.
The story of his success encourages like a film series.
Lucas Pytloun is willing to go.
Only abroad did he realize that there was a lack of reasonable prices in Liberec.
From the savings of his work abroad and with the help of a bank loan, he created a house with five apartments.
Considering that he was then a high school student in the sixth semester, this must have been a brave arrest.
"The price-quality relationship at the time upset me and so I tried to do something against it," says Lukaš Pytloun.
The first renovated apartment he rented to foreign workers.
He immediately invested in the house, which he then converted step by step into a pension with 54 beds.
Since then, he has been able to open in only seven years of business activity in Liberec four pensions, two quiet restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of over 300 beds of all categories of accommodation.
The most comfortable of them was the 4th hotel "Pytloun Design Hotel".
This year another first-class hotel was added.
"We have signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tísé, which we sold our Franchise concept and other stakeholders at the Franchise of Pytloun hotels have already reported," says the Entrepreneur Number One of the last year.
"A large share of this licence sale for the operation of hotels had just won in the competition "Enterprise of the Year", Mr Pytloun added with recognition.
The victory has brought him greater popularity, yes popularity in Liberec and the surrounding area.
"The people recognized me on the street, often congratulated me even in the afternoon, and I have to say that it did really well," he recalls.
I really recommend that everyone who wants to create something participate in this competition.
You don't have to win at the same time. Every vision is good.
He says that he still benefits from contacts and acquaintances, to which he would not have come at all.
"With some people that I have met thanks to competition, I maintain regular business relations to this day."
The fame associated with success is even slightly down to every employee.
And that's where he's at seven.
"I note with them greater loyalty and pride that they are part of something that is given general recognition."
I also see this not only as personal success, no, it is the result of the good work of all of us."
"My name is just a little stuck in the foreground," says Lukaš Pytloun modest.
I wish my followers a calmer year than we had in the farm
The victory victory victory was quickly resolved by the consequences of the crisis.
Thanks to his aim, Farmet has the worst behind him.
The price for the first rank of Vodafone company of the year last year was taken by Karel Ždźárský, the owner of the farm.
At that time, the jury appreciated the efforts he made to get a company from the small tool building in Česká Skalice, making hundreds of millions of sales.
"I can say that this appreciation not only encourages me, but also encourages all my employees and has strengthened our self-consciousness in the fight against competition," says the previous year's winner.
At the beginning of the farm's history, the effort was made to do something useful.
And then when the state offered his father Karel Ždźárský as a compensation for the property seized by the communists, he did not hesitate long, left his career in the company in which he had been employed, slummed and founded with a few comrades of his father's own company for the manufacture of plastic cars.
Shortly thereafter, they began to focus on plant oil presses.
Within 18 years, they have become the largest manufacturer of automatic presses throughout Central Europe.
But only because of the success of the competition mentioned and its mediaization has it also entered into the consciousness of non-professionality.
"Not only that our customers now perceive the Farm brand significantly more intensively, our foreign partners also began to be able to work with a company that has achieved the greatest success in their country,” says Karel Jjárský.
Last year, however, Farmet was not the only sign of victory.
The assessment was based on the company's economic performance in 2008 and part of 2009.
And just 2009 was the toughest year for the sale of tool construction products.
The crisis, which was even less the citizens at the time, but above all the company, reached its peak - many companies were forced to set up their investment projects and restrict the purchase of new facilities and technologies.
"Of course, we couldn't get away with this."
"The sales went back by 40 percent, we had to restrict production and even grab discounts," says Karel Ždźárský.
A viable company must also take such unpopular measures.
However, it managed to get the situation in the grip and keep the company in the black numbers, even with lower profits than before the crisis.
At one time, the company was unwilling to withdraw - in the case of investments in research and development.
"In addition, we built a research and training centre, strengthened our presentation at international fairs and acquired major prices at domestic exhibitions," says Jjárský.
Everything proves that we've overcome the crisis.
The turnover is growing again and with them the number of new employees.
"I wish the new winner a lot of joy at the victory - but in a calmer atmosphere," Karel Jjárský points out.
A question of opinion, which is covered by foolish rules
The question of "absorbability of the year" is the fourth part of the competition.
Some foolish rules have already been made to create from the world.
To doubt the winner of the next year's opinion poll "absorbity of the year", the obligation to create documents on the authorities that are available online advanced.
So more than a third of non-agricultural companies decided.
The Social Insurance Administration thus demanded a paper extract from the trade register, even if it could have been accessed by the official through two mouse clicks.
Thanks to the question of opinion, this is now changing.
"The Czech Social Insurance Administration will no longer require any withdrawals from the trade register in the future when social insurance policy is checked," ČSSZ spokesperson Jana Buranová said.
The meaning and purpose of the question of opinion "absorbability of the year" is to take all the rules and arrangements under the lupes, to meet the entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic and to lift the foolish.
This is already the fourth time this year in a competition organised by the e.g. Economic Journal (HN) and is pleased with growing popularity in the public.
If three thousand people participated in the vote last year, it was already four thousand this year.
No wonder, for there are still a lot of legal obligations that serve only and alone to hinder business.
"For example, as regards the number of income tax forms, we take a leading rank in the world," notes Karel Havlíčekek from the association of small and medium-sized enterprises and traders of the Czech Republic.
Simplification of entrepreneurship has been the proclaimed goal of all governments in recent years.
However, compared to the world, the situation in the Czech Republic has improved little.
According to data from the World Bank, the Czech Republic takes the 74th rank in terms of business conditions, compared to the previous year, one in eight worse places.
The competition of the year's absurdity was first called out in the year and played out every year after the same scenario.
From April to the conclusion of the competition, anyone can report administrative and bureaucratic nonsense at the end of September.
For registration, the website www.firmaroku.cz. Then the competition organizer is looking for seven candidates for the "anti-price" and allows the public to vote on the websites www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
It beats the absurdity that gets most votes.
For this year's opinion poll, more than one hundred, 105 meaningless rules and regulations have already been registered.
The tips are not only from entrepreneurs, but also from professional associations and journalists.
For example, among the nominated "finalists" of the competition are also provisions that maintenance vehicles have to pay for motorways and motorways dead or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two toilets must present every two years.
The list of this year's "Sieben" is published on the sides of the competition.
The opening of the competition in Prague at the beginning of November is part of an event in which political and public life also participates on a regular basis.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodová, the director of the Association of Small or Medium-sized Enterprises and Business Operators of the Tsch. Republic and Petr Kužel, the president of the Chamber of Commerce of the Tsch. Republic at the height of the competition with the party.
"Where the state throws business knots between the legs, there can be no real economic upheaval, so it is my goal to remove at least thirty paragraphs each year, which are still unnecessary to entrepreneurs today," said Martin Kocourek, Minister of Industry and Commerce.
Efforts to create unwise arrangements from the world show an effect.
In 2007, most of the employees were in breach of their obligation to report to the trade office at their permanent place of business three days in advance of their intention to go to an exhibition or Kirmes exhibition.
This obligation was lifted by a novelty of the commercial law.
The obligation that the second largest number of votes received in 2007 - the obligation to report to the Labour Office services of employees for up to 30 days - was abolished by the "Green Card".
And all the good things are three:
To the absurdity of 2009, the regulation which put in place physiotherapists was chosen to have a mirror, a refrigerator and two passenger cars in the speech room.
This Regulation has been extended to some extent by the Ministry of Health this year - the refrigeration obligation has fallen.
A new category is appreciated by socially conscious companies
Evaluation criteria are humanitarian, environmental, educational or sports projects
A new feature in this year's fifth anniversary of the competition of the Economic Journal (HN) is the category "Responsible Company of the year 2010".
In the light of this competition, it is appropriate and fair to encourage businesses.
"We would like to support such companies that are aware of the consequences of your business activity and support socially responsible initiatives," says Patrick Bartholdy, regional manager of the Vodafone mobile phone company, the caller and guarantor of this competition, as well as the "Rebell of the Year" competition.
For this year's first year of this special subcategory of the main competition Vodafon Company of the year notified companies for which success is not the only long-term goal.
The story of each of them is extremely inspiring and punishing enough substance for an independent article.
Although they differ in terms of the subject matter of their activities, their efforts still have a common denominator - support and consideration.
For example, this is about disabled people, as it is about personal problems or the health of their own employees.
Among the 14 finalists from all over the Czech Republic, for example, the Prague software company Et Netera, which promotes the creation of non-formal sports teams among its employees, who then participate in numerous tournaments in various sports.
Another example of a responsible company from the Pardubice region is the company Isolit-Bravo, which has been the principal sponsor of a fund for children with disabilities for seven years.
A paper factory from Poděbrady also deals with its health-related staff who make up 70 percent of their staff, for which it was rated as "the most responsible company in the region of Central Böhmen"; in the competition Vodafone company of the year it placed the third rank in the context of this region.
In the Olomouc region, the bookkeeping company MiRyz Soft, which introduced a floating and also reduced working time to an average of 35 hours per week, without a relative reduction in wages.
The jury also honored the fact that the company purchases mainly from Czech producers, supports citizens' initiatives in its environment and works according to environmentally friendly principles.
"We strive to recycle as much as possible in order to keep the consequences of our business activities and administration for the environment as low as possible," explains Managing Director Milosze Ryznarová.
The responsible IT company Enlogit from the region of Ústí nad Labem is also located at the health of its employees and therefore it has created ergonomic sessions and keyboards for all notebooks, and also supports them in their work at home and in business activities, using cartoon services offered by a home-protected workshop.
"In addition, we support the Foundation "People in Not", which provides concrete help to the Roma community," says Ondřej Suchý, the representative of the company.
Not least, the activity of the cleaning company "Praní a čični" from the Karlsbader Region is also worth mentioning, which contributes to their employees in the form of extra bonuses to their pension insurance.
"We provide our employees with contributions to care, to work, to increase their qualifications and to holidays," says Josef Strapáč of the construction company Czasch from Bruntál, the winner in the Maurish-Schles region.
To the category of responsible company of the year, all district finalists of the competition Vodafon company of the year were automatically registered, which answered the questions of the questionnaire attached to the application and sent it to the organiser by 15 August at the latest.
False or incomplete answers in the questionnaire were excluded from the evaluation by the organizer.
"If the representatives of the law enforcement companies did not answer the questions, they were excluded from the competition "Responsibility-awareness company of the year", therefore in the main competition Vodafone company of the year they were not disqualified."
"A separate application for this competition only is not possible, as it is only a subcategory of the main competition company of the year," explains Karel Goldman by the eventing agency Bison & Rose.
Pilsner Ground Fund - arrests of the police at a public tender
In the building of the ground fund in Pilsen, the anti-corruption police took over the last few days.
In this case, the current media contractor and real estate dealer Luboš G. was taken over by the detectives in handcuffs.
It had allegedly attempted to manipulate a direct public competition to settle claims for refunds in such a way that the property offered in the competition would be of particular interest to a particular person.
This is supposed to have paid Luboš G. half a million for it.
"At this point, I can only confirm that the police are pursuing a person because of the crime of fraud in a public competition," said Antonie Zelená, the head of the Pilsner State Prosecutor of the "Právo" newspaper, could not provide further details regarding the ongoing investigations.
24 hours later, the 46-year-old businessman was released from the police.
In what way he was able to manipulate public competition, one can only speculate in view of the special official information.
The speaker of the Lubomír Černá Foundation raised the question of Právo, which the police had actually arrested in the Pilsner in front of the Foundation, and this during a public competition.
"It was about a client and it was about one of our employees," she said.
According to the public competition, Mrs Černá had the correct name "Proposal for the submission of claims for the transfer of land in accordance with the Land Law" and would take place in cases where several applicants refer to interest in the proposed land.
"These persons offer in the framework of the call a higher value of their claims to be made by the transfer than the value of the called land."
"In accordance with the requirements offered, the order of the potential buyer is determined, then the floor fund transfers the property to the person with the highest bid," the speaker of the fund explains.
Luboš G. was obviously available information to those who had signed up to the invitation and since he was entitled to be the person himself, since he had purchased a number of claims for refunds, he suggested that he withdraw from the competition.
Obviously against a fat find.
This would also be a sufficient explanation for why he had a large amount of money with him when he was arrested.
Luboš G. already had very good contacts with the Pilsner Ground Fund in the past.
He also played a role in the cause of the former head of the foundation of Václav Sankota, which was prosecuted in criminal law because he issued land in replacement refunds to which local decisions had already been taken.
At the time, for example, Luboš G. acquired land from the soil fund, which was intended to build public roads, more precisely, at the place where the construction of the access magistral was planned for the Borské pole area.
Later he exchanged it very kindly with the magistrate against a house directly in the historic center of the city, which exceeded the value of the land.
At the time, the town hall had to give serious hearts so that the construction project would not be endangered by the blocking of the plots.
The housing costs of households increase by a few hundred per month
As of January, the budgets must not only be charged with higher costs for all energy types, but also with higher water and wastewater charges, and also for remote heat and in some places the rents also grow.
As of January, several hundred crowns will have to be pulled out of the wallet every month.
Electricity will be expensive up to 4.6 percent, gas by 2 percent and more, in some cities you will have to pay up to a tenth more for water supplies, and in some places the heat supplies will also be expensive.
Only the electricity flow rate costs the apartment budget a few hundred crowns per year.
The strong current prices have been reduced by all major suppliers, so the clear promotion of electricity generation from renewable sources, particularly from photovoltaic sources.
However, gas will only become more expensive, but this is precisely when people have to heat the most and have the highest consumption.
So here too is to be calculated with a few hundred crowns per year.
While electricity and gas become more expensive throughout the Czech Republic, the prices for remote heating from town to city vary.
Especially larger places plan price increases.
For example, the households in Pardubice and Hradec Králové have to pay more from January to 50 crowns per month, more than 1000 crowns per year for families in Liberec.
In turn, the inhabitants of Prague threaten 9 percent higher water and wastewater charges and this in case the city increases infrastructure rents.
If the rent does not change, it is only 6.8 percent.
However, the price in Prague is still among the lowest compared to the whole of the Czech Republic.
In the North Bohmen, where prices are already among the highest, water and wastewater charges are expected to rise by 7.4 percent.
For example, huge rental price increases are expected in 140,000 rental apartments, where the so-called rental regulation will disappear from January.
For example, the apartment company CPI Byty, which has 2500 apartments in Ústí nad Labem, plans to increase the rent from January to 100 percent.
Anyone who does not agree with this increase will be interested in the company's legal interests.
The regulated rentals, which are still paid in about 300,000 apartments today, are expected to increase by more than 10 percent next year.
Czech children drink with remote and Rum beer is out - it just seems too slow
Fernet, Rum and Wodka, except for once a good whisky that was stolen from the house bar to the father.
These are the drinks, after which limited Czech teenagers must be treated at least 15 times.
No exceptions are children who have to sleep in the hospital repeatedly.
This is reflected in the experience of doctors who are confronted with similar cases in the admission of child clinics.
"Beers or wine are completely out of fashion, because it just takes too long to be drunk."
"The current trend is clearly hard alcohol," said Právo Ludźk Pelikán, the chief of the children's department in the Middle Bohmical Clinic of Hořovice.
"Whisky, if it succeeds in removing a bottle from the house bar to the father, and if not, then at least remote or wodka.
"Wodka has the advantage of mixing it with Juice, then he doesn't smell so strong," explains the chief.
The speaker of the Faculty Hospital Motol Eva Jurinová gives him the right.
"Most often, it's about remoteness or space."
"This is the current trend of alcohol, especially in primary schools."
"It was also about Slibowitz, which you take home from home," said Ms. Jurinová.
According to Chefarzt Pelikán, thirteen or fourteen-year-old drinkers are no exception in hospital admission for a long time.
In front of the hospital in Hořovice, where he has been working since this year, he has been working in the Paediatric Department of the Hospital Motol, where the rescue cars were supplied by students from nearby and remote.
"A girl had to be hospitalized four times."
"Your career began at 12 years of age when she was first delivered to blood with 3.5 promille alcohol and still in combination with "extase", the doctor described a particularly serious case.
"She was in the exhibition field in Holeshovice on some dance party."
"The interesting thing was that it didn't seem strange to her mother that her daughter didn't come home for 48 hours," says the chief.
Especially the lack of interest of parents or their incredible tolerance when encountering their own spruces is considered to be one of the main causes of the growing alcoholism of children.
For real dependence in the true sense of the word, experts do not say in children.
"In alcoholism is a long-term chronic dependence on alcohol and all related phenomena, and this is not the case with these children."
In the case of those who repeatedly enjoy alcohol, it is usually a negative family-social background characteristic," explains Chefarzt Pelikán.
According to the spokesperson of the hospital Motol, Ms. Jurinová, about forty drunk children were sent to the nursing department for children and young people until mid-November.
However, only cases of severe alcohol poisoning that require hospital stay go into the statistics.
Concerned children who are taken home from their parents or, where appropriate, from the police after an ambulance treatment are not registered.
In addition to the cases in which children only use a bottle of snacks in the school base, in the opinion of Mr. Pelikán, there are three year-old amplitudes on which one hundred percent is left: Walpurgisnocht, Silvester and the end of the school year.
"The last one for two reasons - either because of the bad testimony or because of the joy of the holidays."
"I've also experienced seven undercover children on the night of the Walpurgis," says Dr. Pelikán.
A drunk child who spends the night under medical supervision is paradoxically better than a child who has only to fight an unpleasant cat the next day.
The headaches in the morning, which are caused by dehydration and glucose deficiency, can be caused in the hospital by a fluid-dependent infusion with glucose and nutrients that are lacking in the body.
"They're clearly better at it, because after the "wonderful" experience in the evening, they wake up with good pay, without doing anything to hurt."
"They're just a little confused about where they are," says Dr. Pelikán, who saves the patients from at least the good wage by telling them the costs they will cost the treatment.
Because transport with the rescue car and the night will be good in an emergency bed and would like to receive a few tens of thousands of crowns.
"He and I used it as an educational tool when I gave the children directly to the visit, which cost them their drinking and that it could happen exactly that they had to work over the whole holiday to earn the money for a single such fat," Dr. Pelikán added.
In his opinion, however, the hospitals do not take into account regression procedures, in order to require the parents to pay the necessary costs for the care of the children in need.
Two training planes L-159 for the first time in a foreign hand - in Spain
Two light combat aircraft L-159 of a total of five, which the Czech Ministry of Defence exchanged against the transport aircraft Casa C-295M, flew to the Spanish city of Seville on Tuesday, where the Spanish aircraft manufacturer Casa - EADS sits.
It is the first time that machines of this type are owned by a foreign army.
In the Netherlands they were only to see manovers or airshows.
This is about the two-axle L-159T1, which was operated by the Czech army.
The remaining three aircraft are L-159.
These are still preserved in the Aero Vodochody, the broker of this business - the company Omnipol - has taken over last week.
When sending the planes physically from Vodochody, Jan Pejšek, according to the spokesperson of the Ministry of Defence, is not yet known.
The L-159 single combat aircraft were once again isolated from long-term aircraft, without further investments and investments from the Ministry's location.
"The two-sided L-159T1 were replaced in current condition and appearance," said Pejšek of the newspaper Právo.
He added that the army would not have to leave without two-six combat aircraft, as in May 2009, the Ministry of Defence signed a 200 million contract with Aero Vodochody on the refurbishment of four surplus L-159 to the two-six version.
A new aircraft has taken over the army in July, the second will take over by the end of this year.
According to Pejšek, EADS has committed itself to carrying out the combat aircraft in the equipment of one of the NATO countries.
"The contract clearly states that EADS is the carrier of the L-159 aircraft and that they should be used to train NATO pilots.
"It is therefore the matter of the receiver, how he realizes the matter," Pejšek said.
The Economic Journal (HN) had previously reported that the Spanish government had no interest in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159 against a transport aircraft Casa and the purchase of additional aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns was approved by the government of Mirek Topolánek last year.
At the time, the Ministry of Defence did not prescribe a tender procedure for purchase, but EADS spoke directly.
The former defence office argued that this exchange will support the future export of L-159 abroad.
The Czech army bought aero 72 machines, of which only 24 were used, and the rest wanted to sell them.
The purchase of the aircraft Casa may also have a legal role to play.
The European Commission has declared the Czech Ministry of Defence to be the European Court of Justice.
The army has already taken over three Casa planes, which will be landing at Kbely Airport in the last fourteen days.
A longer sign finger than ring finger means a lower risk of cancer
Men whose sign finger is longer than the ring finger are obviously at a lower risk of becoming exposed to prostate cancer.
This is the surprising result of a study published by the British Journal of Cancer on Wednesday.
This is to relate to the mirror of the male hormone testosterone.
"Our results show that the relative length of fingers can serve as a simple test for the risk of prostate cancer, and this is especially for men up to sixty," explained the co-author of the study, Ros Eeles, professor at the Cancer Research Institute at the University of Warwick.
The finger could help determine which men should necessarily undergo a prostate cancer test, especially if there are genetic risks or other risk factors, such as family health burdens, Mrs Eeles added.
In the period 1994-2009, she followed more than 1500 patients with prostate cancer with her colleagues in Britain, while at the same time 3,000 healthy men.
In more than half of the participants in the study, the sign finger of the right hand was shorter than the ring finger.
For these men, the same probability of prostate cancer was the same as for 19 percent of the men whose rings and signs were the same.
However, in men whose sign finger was longer than the ring finger, this risk fell by 33 percent, in men by up to 60 percent.
The ratio of the two fingers mentioned, which are already formed in the prenatal age, clearly reflects the different mirrors of sex hormones that the child was exposed to in the womb.
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer sign finger.
Previous research showed that the testosterone accelerates the growth of prostate cancers.
Václav Pačes, leading Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, said ČTK, that this study was quickly known to him, yet he did not hold the relationship between finger length and cancer risk until now.
Czech Republic in snow - D1 and D5 are closed
Like most of Europe, the Czech Republic is under a snowshoe on Thursday morning.
On the streets and roads is usually snowy, winter workers were in many places all night on the corner.
The D5 motorway between kilometres 89 and 90 towards Rozvadov is blocked due to some accidents of Lkws and Pkws and also the D1 at Brno towards Prague "stands".
This was said by Novinky.CZ of the Dispatcher of the Central Auto Moto Club (UAMK).
At kilometre 91, an LKW was damaged, at kilometre 93, two Lkws fell together, and in this accident there were injured.
There are also a few pkws in the street.
There are also problems at 185 kilometers of the D1 motorway towards Prague.
Two lkws are broken up here, too.
Drivers should leave immediately behind Brno at 190 kilometers or over Brno and rise at 182 kilometers at the place Kývalka.
There are miles of staus.
Also on the D11 is an accident and the same when you travel to Prague.
In Prague itself is a few centimeters thick snowboard and the thermometer shows minus seven degrees Celsius.
Autocolons form, for example, in Prosek, the street of Štěrboholská is completely hidden.
The safest means of transport is in any case the metro.
The highways run with delays, for example on the line between Karlsplatz and Peaceplace.
At eight o'clock in the morning, the Prague crisis staff will meet.
There are also problems at the railway and at the airport.
The Czech State Railway had to cancel seven fast-track connections due to snow trips.
There are problems, for example, on the Prague - Kralupy route or also Prague - Beroun.
Travelers should be informed of the current situation.
Ruzyně Airport has been closed from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Wednesday.
Most of the roads in the South are only accessible with increased caution.
About Vyškov three sideways are completely impenetrable, in the vicinity of Brno there are apparently snow trips and in the surroundings of Blanco you are forced to use snowflakes on some higher roads.
One of the most affected areas is Výškov.
There are still three streets completely blocked: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and also Sharatice - Milesov.
Here too you will have to use snowflakes for snowflakes.
When they are rehabilitated, they cannot be estimated until now.
In the Hodonín region, care is taken in the area of white carpathies.
On the streets that can only be lined with built-in beams for natural protection reasons, one to five centimeters of thick snow cover was introduced by the ČTK.
In the Czech Republic, between two and ten centimeters of neuschnee fell, most of which in the north - up to 18 centimeters.
In the Maurish-Schlesian region, up to 15 centimeters of snow fell.
In the Czech Republic, however, it is slow to cut.
American soldiers have a new "intelligent weapon".
For the first time, American troops have used a new "intellectual" weapon in Afghanistan, which is now known only under its code name XM-25.
The generals hope that this new automatic weapon will influence the conflict there with the Taliban and shift the force to its advantage.
The new weapon is something like a super-precious cannon.
Their projectiles are aimed at the target by laser with only a few meters of impact safety.
The special bulkheads of 25 mm caliber, which have been developed for this weapon and contain high-explosive explosives, work practically like small grenades.
The bulkheads can be programmed so that they can explode not only when they are up to the target, but at any point of their ballistics flight.
That means they can be used against an enemy who is hiding behind a barrier - a wall or in a protective tomb.
From above he is usually not protected, so he can easily be left out of combat by the murdering steel lines from above.
According to Richard Audett, who took part in the development of the XM-25, the new war weapon is the first infantry weapon that makes use of "intelligent" technologies.
"The soldier basically goes like this: he targets the target and sends out a laser beam that determines the distance, then he wins a precise point of view after which he corrects the rise angle, then he only needs to cancel.
"Let's say you measured 543 meters."
"When pressed, the weapon is called up and shoots the shot at the distance 543 meters plus one, two or three meters.
400 jobs are being reduced
The Fujitsu Group leaves its location in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July next year, 400 employees will be placed in the Astro Park from the former office building at the Marienbader Square in Bad Homburg.
The Japanese group Fujitsu leaves its location in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As reported on the computer and its maintenance industry crisis on Wednesday, 400 women and men will be placed in the Astro Park in July next year from the former office building at the Marienbader Square in Bad Homburg, which is a large office complex at Lyoner Street in the Frankfurt city of Niederrad.
A speaker from Fujitsu explained that, in the medium term, there should still be 100 more jobs in the group that have been distributed to the region.
The rental offer has been extremely attractive, and the big office in Astro Park is better off against the employee's way of working.
In Bad Homburg, Fujitsu was also only owner.
Managing Director Bernd Wagner said, "With Frankfurt-Niederrad we have found a central location with excellent infrastructure".
The excellent connection to the airport is of great importance for a global company such as Fujitsu.
The recent transfer of an important company within the region brought joy to the winners and disappointment to the losers yesterday.
The Frankfurt Economics Senator Markus Frank (CDU) said that a global player was once again won.
That was a "great locality."
Fujitsu goes to the city, the settlement is an important impulse for Niederrad.
The Bad Homburger Mayor Michael Korwisi (The Greens) regretted Fujitsu's decision.
The city was informed by the management of the intention.
"We have offered the company our help of course," Korwisi said.
However, the friendly contacts could not have changed the difficulties of the computer manufacturer with the owner of the property at the Marienbader Square.
Finally, economic reasons had given rise to the challenge.
Now it is to prevent a long gap in such a prominent place.
"I hope the owner and owner of the building is cooperative."
The house used by Fujitsu so far at the hall and the nearby "Small Vertical" belonged to the other buildings at the Marienbader Square ten years ago to the most controversial construction projects in the Kurstadt.
As a joint project of the city and a private project developer, between the railway station and the town hall, a new city centre was created, which provided both for the massive construction of the previously used areas as a parking lot and the height of the buildings for criticism.
In 2001, the plant consultancy and rating company Feri, the software manufacturer for travel sales systems, Start Amadeus, and then the computer manufacturer Fujitsu connected to Siemens.
The building used by Fujitsu was acquired in 2006 by the Frankfurter Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Group together with the Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund and was sold to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid one year later.
The Fujitsu consul, located in Tokyo, is the third largest IT provider in the world.
For example, it provides companies with computers and servers and also provides the necessary service.
The location in the Rhein-Main area is one of the largest in Germany, but far more employees include Fujitsu in Munich.
From Bad Homburg the subsidiary Fujitsu Technology Solutions in Frankfurt-Niederrad, the other subsidiaries at this site should be Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
For this purpose, the Astro Park 7000 square meters were rented in the office building.
In the twenty-year-old complex - the name plays on its star-shaped foundation - has its seat, among other things, in the Central Association of Electrical Engineering and Electronic Industry.
Amazon Blocked Server - Threats to Assange
Wikileaks is increasingly in need.
The Internet service provider Amazon has banned the disclosure platform from its servers.
Perhaps there is political pressure after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomats.
Wikileaks founder Assange reportedly stopped in England.
Wikileaks' revelation platform is increasingly under attack in the United States.
Internet activists have lost access to their previous American server and are now searching for an Internet home in Europe.
The leading American senator Joe Lieberman called in other countries and companies for the Boycott of Wikileaks.
And Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is on Interpol's catch list, is expected to stop after a newspaper report in Britain.
"Wikileaks forced by Amazon server."
"Free speech in the country of the free," the entertainment activists shared via short notice service Twitter on Wednesday (location time).
The Amazon Internet company had recently banned the Wikileaks documents from its servers.
Internet activists had withdrawn from the Amazon Web Service (AWS) in the publication of the secret diplomatic depeces in order to manage the high numbers of access to the documents.
On Twitter, Wikileaks continued on the move: "Excellent - our dollars will now be spent to employ people in Europe."
If Amazon has such problems with freedom of speech, "they stopped selling books".
Amazon has stopped using its server by Wikileaks after employees from Senator Joe Lieberman had commissioned research, the TV channel CNN reported on the Liebermans office.
The president of the Senate Committee on Home Protection had threatened Amazon with a boycott, reports the British "Guardian".
"I wish that Amazon took this action earlier in view of previous publications of classified information by Wikileaks," said the Senator.
Lieberman therefore called on the platform to also ban the use of servers in other countries.
"Wikileak's illegal, unforgivable and negligent action puts our national security at stake and is at risk of global life," says a statement by the Partiless Senator.
"No responsible company - whether American or foreign - should help Wikileaks in his efforts to distribute stolen material."
Wikileaks founder Assange, who is sought by the authorities in Sweden due to the suspicion of rape, is on Interpol's arrest list.
According to a report by the London newspaper "The Independent", the 39-year-old Australian in Britain, the exact place is Scotland Yard.
The Internet activist has always referred to the investigations in Sweden as an intruder of his opponents.
Wikileaks speaker Kristinn Hrafsson said in London there were threats.
"There were even calls after a murder of Julian Assange."
Assange was therefore quite afraid of his safety, Hrafsson said.
The Wikileaks founder will therefore continue to be kept hidden.
Hrafsson obviously responded to statements from North America.
In America, the former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, had demanded that the person responsible for the Wikileaks discoveries be charged and ordered for treason.
In Canada, a consultant from government chief Stephen Harper - apparently ironic - said that assange should be "killed" and Obama could "use a drone".
Between the White House and Assange, there was a fire exchange.
The speaker of American President Barack Obama, Robert Gibbs, called it "synthetic and absurd", that Assange had demanded the resignation of Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton if she was responsible for recently known spying appointments to diplomats.
"I'm not quite sure why we care about the opinion of a guy with a website," said Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more important than its website."
The U.S. government now includes the protection of its databases.
As Special Representative, the White House was appointed as the vice-director of the Anti-Terrorism Centre, Russell Travers.
Travers is responsible for developing "the necessary structural reforms", which have become necessary after the revelation of the message reports by Wikileaks.
The White House also wants to examine ways in which the entire government exchanges and protects information.
The US government also announced that they should be in danger of ensuring the safety of dissidents and activists through the publication of Wikileaks.
"We have done everything to get in touch with them," said external speaker Philip Crowley.
"We are ready to protect them if necessary."
The University of Ice
At the "Gelato University" at Bologna, ice detectors are prepared for better seasons.
The three-day basic course for future gelatiers has the largest summit and visitors from around the world.
Where does the whole ice come from?
From the gelatier and from the gelatio.
The gelatier, somewhat old in Germany, presents the cream according to all the rules of Italian icemaker art.
The gelataio takes the ice cream out of the fridge with a spoon, stretches it into the waffle and then sells it.
To know that, you do not have to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But who wants to know more about ice, does not come to the "Gelato University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The ice University has set up the manufacturer of ice machines in 2003 so that the ice cream from its machines can be repaired all over Italy's high ideals.
The three-day basic course for future gelatiers has the largest summit and visitors from all over the world.
However, there are also multi-day special courses around chocolate and practice in the house itself.
Some dream in the midlife crisis of a new career, others simply wander on the smooth ice of their vague luck.
This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents - from Brazil to Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, an art teacher from California, loves the slow-food movement and wants to offer a European quality product in the country of industrial ice cream in the future.
Anke from Berlin is a business consultant and wants to do something of his own in a nervous job after years.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening an iceberg in Cairo.
A man from Malta and one from Brazil want to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars - and Canadian housewife Julia comes because her children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro-Geltiere Luciano Ferrari first explains to the participants the ideal properties of the perfect ice cream.
It is crucial not only to taste good, but also to the silky greed and good consistency.
Luciano, however, does not forget the sahnehäpchen of the national and even the southern superstructure: "Italian gelato is just the best - and then every amount of romance is there."
The first step to manufacture seems quite simple.
Luciano cuts the basic ingredients of milk, soap, milk powder, sugar and stabilisers into a large mixer that heats everything up to 85 degrees with an electronic program and then cools it down to four degrees immediately.
Then he turns on the machine a hat, and comes out a pasteurised white bass cream, the basis for all dairy varieties.
Immediately, the teacher will ask questions: Can you produce ice cream only with natural substances without stabiliser?
How can you let your own experimenter run free?
Luciano warns that from the spirit of time to the Irre.
Who speaks of ice cream "only made of natural ingredients" may have used stabilizers, however - usually a natural product, such as guarkernmel from the guarbohne.
Of course, you can make ice without a stabiliser, only then it must be sold within one day, otherwise it will melt in itself, and the customer will bite on loud ice grains.
Certain variations in the base mass are allowed.
It's going to be more exciting with the aromas.
For the taste in ice, Maestro Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients you buy in the fruit department or in the sweets of the supermarket.
There are also powders and pasta.
"The suppliers will all try to give you dozens of aromatized supplements."
"But you should just experiment."
Either with the fruit sorbates with sugar and fresh fruits.
Or even at the ice cream from the white base mass, which becomes yellow cream with eggs and cocoa powder on the basis of all possible chocolates.
Now the participants are allowed to use the ice machines.
Luciano allows each to produce four different types of vanilla, chocolate, mokka and hazelnut ice - with or without eggs in the basic mass, with more or less vanilla flavour or other natural additives.
In the same experiment, the fruit varieties are also subject to the same experiment.
More flavourings, more fruit pears - delicious is not necessarily better.
Hazelnut ice does not taste much more nuisance if it contains more hazelnuts.
The most popular Kiwi ice represents the working group that uses more fruit, less water and somewhat less stabiliser.
Only a balanced mixture brings out the taste of a gelato, says Luciano.
Icemaking is a task: If Pforsich powder is used with a lot of sugar, the sugar content must be reduced in the basic recipe.
An extraportion sugar is necessary for lemons.
Luciano draws up a device with which he determines the sugar content of the fruit varieties (winzers measure the oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately, tables facilitate the calculator.
Ice does not require as much physical use as before.
Not only does the device help the automatic production of the base mass.
There is also a device in which the finished ice mixture is also creamy and cooled at minus temperatures.
All automation to the contrary, small pans do not remain.
The Brazilian Gustavo hangs himself and his students from above to below with fruit pears, when the over-dimensional Stabmixer beats him out of control.
"In every course," says Maestro Luciano, "it's only a matter of time until something like this happens."
Controls the selection
The European Food Authority is undermining the industry experimenting with replanting.
This proposal is now formulated by the Expert Group Test Biotech, which is an independent Institute for Biotechnology Impact Assessment.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we have well documented it," said Testbiotech Chief Christoph Then on Wednesday in Munich.
The head of the Efsa Group of Experts for Genetically Modified Plants, Harry Kuiper, and another Efsa expert have been under contract for years at the Ilsi Lobbyist Association.
It is paid by groups such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper has largely cooperated with the Efsa test rules for plants and thus stood in a clear conflict of interest, criticised Then.
The Efsa regulations are inseparably equivalent to the position papers of the Ilsi and thus bear the handwriting of the industry, which is actually to be controlled by the Authority in the Italian Parma.
It was already the second time that Test Biotech had a conflict of interest.
So be a high-ranking Efsa manager just without a delay or transition time to the Swiss Agricultural Group Syngenta - and thus changed the pages.
The medium-sized German radio (MDR) had recently revealed personal links between the EU's controlling authority and industrial lobby, as has been done by the Environment Agency as well as EU Parliamentarians.
The EFSA cannot detect any conflict of interest.
All serious data, including those of the industry, should be taken back as long as they are of high professional quality, as stated in an opinion.
The experts working for Efsa do not require that they have no contact with industry.
But they had to reveal them.
Kuiper organizes his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the United States.
This is itself a neutral forum for experts from science, industry and politics - including risk assessment for biotechnology without lobbying.
In the case, independent experts such as Then criticise that genetically modified plants are currently allowed without any animal feeding test and the response of plants to environmental influences will not be tested.
"We want to know what is doing, for example, genetically modified corn on the acker," says Then.
Current practice was to test only isolated proteins, but not the whole plant, which did not provide reliable results.
"If you don't look for the risks, how can you find them?" says Then.
That's what Angelika Hilbeck sees.
The scientist has been researching genetic engineering since 1994 and is currently working at the Technical University of Zurich.
The industry is now increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists in Europe as well as in the US.
There are hardly any researchers who are not involved with groups.
Critical studies for companies would generally not be published.
"The industry controls security research," Hilbeck claims.
The Trace of the Stones
Uli Gsell has also taken care of, a total of about 400 kilos.
On Monday night, he stood in the shape of Stuttgart train station, the tuba on the back.
It was Demo.
It's cut.
The story is known: In September the bakers were excited and had begun to break a large piece of the north wing.
The Stuttgart world was no longer the same: tens of thousands of demonstrations against S21, the billion-thousand-threshold construction of the railway station.
When it came to the construction site, most of the bird was in drums.
Broken in 6000, 7000 pieces.
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a soft stone, built between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Eastfieldern, 43 years old.
He saved a few of the breaks.
"These stones are Reliquien."
"They must not disappear."
"A cheaper and poor stone, simple and earthy."
When he gave up, he was smoking like a cigarette.
What he's gonna do with the fractures, he doesn't know yet.
Stones have time.
Uli Gsell, too.
The trail of the Stuttgart Stone leads to a forest near Tübingen on a former munitions depot of the French army, where Manuel Rongen has built his stone kingdom.
The 44-year-old is dealing with old stones.
He bought all those who attacked in Stuttgart when he was abriss.
"It would be a shame, they would be crushed to pieces or disappeared in the deponia," he says in his office, a wooden box that once was a watchhouse.
He was arrested and threatened when he was told in the September newspaper that he bought the rest of the north wing from the breaker.
But he talked to the S-21 opponents for a while.
And he told them he couldn't do anything for the abortion right now.
And if it ever happened, then it would be the wisest thing if the stones were to be used again.
Approximately 200 S-21 competitors then took one of the 80-kilometer-weighted quads, a piece price of 6,50 to 14 euros.
As a thought, some, but also in the hope, can return him to a reconstruction.
500 tons had bought rounds, 25 large trucks.
About half is still in the forest, the rest is sold for the longest time.
Garden owner, landscape gardener, house builder.
From everywhere, they had come and had slipped away what the trunk and trailers could carry.
The Stuttgart stones of the attack have long been transformed into "mauerle" or into limits of herbs.
"In fact, this stone is nothing special," says Rongen.
"It wouldn't be the political component."
He rises in his car, makes a tour through his 20 hectares of kingdom.
Jura has studied and broken down, later biology, then he's interested in computer and has finally become a stone dealer.
And stone lovers.
40,000 tons of stone stored it.
From all over Germany, he collects his treasures.
He says he's the biggest old stone dealer in the Republic.
He's slow.
In the snow there are artificially preserved sandstones.
"They were once part of the Dresden Marienbrücke," he says.
Elbsandstein, yellow, hot, it warms.
"My Lovestone."
It's going up the road through the forest.
It shows on a hill: red sandstone, former part of Karlsruhe Railway Station.
And so on.
"Schöner Travertin."
At one time the camp belonged to the Tribune of the Stuttgart Neckarstadion.
Everywhere in the snow stones and stories, Cannstatter Travertin from the Stuttgart Police Bureau, red granite from the Dom Sankt Blasia, Tuff from the Heilbroner Hospital.
What work, what effort, what sweat.
When rounds think about how the stones were cut by hand and moved with simple bottles and oxcarns, he will be very afraid.
"It would be a scandal if you were to do something like that."
He didn't become rich, he didn't even become a stone.
But 14 people are busy today, as well as in the forest stone metz, a sculptor, a hamster, a glassblower and a garden builder.
"We work hard, but it is satisfying," says the restorative.
He'll have to go to Cologne soon.
There are also rocks to save.
Talent struggle for high-potentials
It reigns and reigns at the buffet.
16 Students work for salmon, tomato soup and sweets.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the Autobauer Volkswagen have invited the machine building and design students to a workshop.
In a kind of idea competition, they are supposed to be familiar with VW developers via the car of the future – and in addition to popular cars.
In the competition for the smartest heads, many companies now go to the close struggle and, like VW, engage in cooperation with the universities.
Your mission: The most successful graduates will be recruiting in the hearing rooms as early as possible before they come to the labour market and are bought by others.
And because the universities don't issue statements about the performance of their students, you try to track the exceptional talents in practical projects and connect to yourself.
On the second day of the workshop at the TU Braunschweig, the car group throws around the talents.
A young lady from the staff department distributes ballwriters, rubber jars and folders with VW logo.
She tells the hopeful young people about practical programs and student jobs and shows them ways in the group.
Nico Selle from the TU Braunschweig supports the project with VW.
He sees the benefits for both sides: "The students come into contact with industry and collect experiences."
"VW can meet students at the same time, look at interesting candidates and think about who comes in question as an employee."
Such co-operations, such as celle, are not uncommon.
Newly said that the students would be so offensive.
"In fact, the focus was on the professional project," says Selle.
The fight for the fresh graduates will probably get even harder.
In many sectors, companies can no longer choose their employees from a wide range of applicants.
In particular, they need to be awarded and particularly to train highly qualified workers.
In particular, graduates from engineering disciplines are in an excellent negotiating position.
According to the Association of German Engineers VDI, more than 40,000 engineering stations remained unoccupied in October.
And the so-called engineering luck will be even greater according to VDI forecasts.
For the business audit and consulting company KPMG, Roman Dykta goes to the talent yacht.
He organizes exciting recruitment events such as the KPMG race, a kind of modern cutting hunt where participants must find their way through GPS coordinates.
Eight promising students want to send the company around the US next year.
In addition, participants can view KPMG files and get to know the company.
Anyone who can decide in two selection rounds in advance.
Only the Créme de la Créme of the many applicants fly to the United States.
In the Hauen and Stichen around the high potentials at the universities, the shields, according to Dykta, are growing.
"We want to get rid of the race."
"Just a simple sailing session was too little for us."
For talent hunters, Dykta seems to be counting.
"We have so far been in contact with all participants of a similar action in the past year."
"Some are shortly before their conclusion and they want to apply with us," he says.
In addition to the direct booming at the campus, small and medium-sized enterprises also go to the Pearse in professional fairs.
"We're trying to reach graduates at trade fairs."
"Etwa on the Intersolar," reports Sita Stübe, staff leader at Solar Technology Manufacturer Solarworld.
The Bonner Company employs around 1500 employees in Germany.
Stube knows about the growing problem.
Currently, 35 posts are published on the company website.
"It's just very difficult to occupy vat positions."
"It costs a lot of time and money," she says.
Another way is to contact the Uni-Professors.
Solarworld cooperates with various universities, such as the University of Freiberg.
"The professors show that we can practice or write his degree."
Deer advertising activities are not mentioned in the solar specialist.
For this, the company tries to hire with other advantages for itself: Personal atmosphere, flat hierarchy and light communication.
"This can often not be offered by a large group," says staff manager Stübe.
Money no longer plays the main role in looking for jobs.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good climbing opportunities are other crucial factors.
In a study of the Great Place to Work Institute, Solarworld placed the 55th place among the 100 best employers in Germany.
The Institute is setting up an annual best list of German employers.
It asks employees how satisfied they are with their work and their work environment and looks at the framework conditions for the employees.
Staff leader Stübe is also expected to place additional points in the job seekers.
"I think that applicants look particularly at external evaluations about a potential employer," she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler from the German Employer Branding Academy advises companies that want to build a good reputation as an employer with a long-term strategy.
He advises his customers on more authenticity.
This means, according to warlord, especially internal measures.
"The best way to be attractive as an employer is through its own employees," he says.
In the sector, the internal employer branding, i.e. employer branding within its own staff, is called the internal employer branding.
"Cheered employees are the best ambassadors."
If you treat your people well and identify them with the company, they would be all alone with friends and acquaintances for their employers.
"It's like a gang game," says warlord.
Obama stops new oil drilling
Before the coast of the US state of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico, there will be no new oil drilling in the coming years.
A corresponding ban has been imposed on the government in Washington - thus finally withdrawing its earlier plans.
New drillings remain first and foremost in front of the Atlantic Coast.
This was shared by Interior Minister Ken Salazar on Wednesday.
The trigger for the strict ban, which should apply at least for the next five years, is the explosion of the drilling platform "Deepwater Horizon" in April.
Before the accident, which cost eleven workers their lives and led to the biggest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama had signaled on the pressure of opposition and industry to allow new drillings in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
As a result, the sponsors want to reduce US dependence on foreign oil supplies.
Those who bear the responsibility for the depleting olive oil in the Gulf have not been fully informed so far.
In the centre of the criticism, the British energy group BP is confronted with billions of demands.
A committee of inquiry under Obama's mandate will present its results during December.
In October, Interior Minister Ken Salazar lifted the drilling stop that was suspended after the explosion.
As a result, different oil groups had submitted applications for new drilling projects immediately.
With more stringent controls and more stringent safety regulations, Obama and Salazar want to exclude a recent disaster.
At present, the competent control authority, which has been substantially reformed following numerous corruption proposals, will be reformed.
At the same time, Obama has announced that it will close lucrates for the oil and gas groups.
The industry now publicly warns that the amount of aid in the Gulf would be significantly lower by a stricter regulation than before.
"The government's plans are the biggest brakes for the growth of the oil and gas industry", says the result of a current industry survey by the BDO consulting firm - even before the drilling ban on Wednesday.
The American Energy Alliance also complains about the uncertainty in the sector: "No one knows exactly what will change with the regulation."
Investments in new support projects would be suspended until further notice - loading growth.
Ogoniland is burned
The water in the rivers is oil brown, it smells like at the tank site: billion liters of crude oil have destroyed nature in Nigerian Ogoniland.
People live from theft, corruption and illegal oil cooks.
Celestine Akpobari thinks it's good.
"Don't worry," the Eco-Activist calms the journalists: "You'll still get enough oil slam in front of the lens today."
The 37-year-old Nigerian has been trying to light up a boy in the water to the breast with the scars surrounding him: In the rainbow-coloured water glass, the scene seems pretty.
That under the surface of brown crude wood is not visible.
Previously, she had collected yarns here, says Esther Badom on the shore of the Bodo-Jetti river.
In the meantime, the flow of running water is completely dead.
Five years ago, ergosken came from a rusty pipeline, a lot of crude oil in the vast wet area.
Fisher from the nearby town of Bodo has now had to mine six hours to reach fishy waters: the country of Ogoni in the heart of the Niger delta is considered one of the worst waste regions in the world.
On the journey through the mangrove noises caused by rivers, the entire extent of destruction is apparent.
Instead of light water, the motorboat blows brown bridges, who dives his hand into the water, pulls out the oil fingers.
The roots of the mangrove trees reach like black lactating rods from the ground, causing the flowers to hang their silks individually.
Bird fever, as they are otherwise common in areas of moisture, is sought for forgiveness: As soon as the outside of the surface is wet, it spreads into the past paradise rich as a gas station.
"What happens here is ecological warfare," says Celestine Akpobari window: "We live in constant danger to health."
The war comparison is in place.
The settlement area of Ogoni has been a battle field for decades: more than 60 years ago, the first explorers from Europe, organized here in the 1980s with the later executed writer Ken Saro-Wiwa of the first resistance, here the Shell Group of 1993 had to set up its production because it became too dangerous for its oil workers.
Today, the company is still denied the return to Ogoniland: While from the whole delta region from the three-fold size of Switzerland with more than 5000 drilling sources and 7,000 kilometres of pipelines are pumped daily more than two million layers of black gold, the oil fields broke in Ogoniland, the situation is too unstable for the group.
All a couple of hundreds of meters reach styling sites like bizarre sculptures from the water: "Christe trees" are called the heads of drill holes too viciously.
They are up to 50 years old, most of them corroded to the mark.
Always break one such drill head apart, means Akpobari, then a constant stream of crude oil flows into the water.
More than two billion liters have been flown into the delta's ecosystem in 50 years, according to expert estimates: the amount of oil per year, as it was when it came to the Havaria of the supertanker "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago, into the sea in front of Alaska - one of the greatest environmental disasters in the history of mankind.
Those who are responsible for the continued Eco-GAU will be challenged.
While the Shell Group is responsible for sabotage and organised oil dust for more than 90 percent of pollution, environmentalists see heavy drilling heads and leak pipelines as the main causer.
Shell has significantly lower safety standards than usual in the world in Nigeria, U.S. scientist Richard Steiner suggested to the group in 2008: Only the rate of defects on the lines is "to be a multiple higher than elsewhere".
At a place that looks like a deserted, olive-colored workshop under free sky, dives from the mangrove shapes: they are split-down and oil-coloured up to the neck.
Under one of the many fibers that are partly connected with pipes, partly willing to spread out on the ground, a fire flares: an illegal small refinery.
In the façade, the crude oil is heated over the fire for several hours, explains Michael, the leader of the group.
At first, gasoline penetrates through the pipes into the pick-up top, later drop-down at the end of the drive of Kerosin and finally diesel.
Michael and four employees produce up to four barrels of Diesel 300 liters daily: "This brings us 34,000 Naira" - about 22 dollars.
The Delta residents use the chronic fuel shortage in the largest oil country in Black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
The slightly low diesel price of almost 40 euro cents per litre can still be covered by illegal chefs: because their raw material gets them unsanitously.
It comes from "bunkerers", which hit the pipeline network across Ogoniland: in this way, experts throughout Niger lose at least 16 million litres of crude oil every day.
However, only a small part of the provisional intermediate raw material is illegal: The lion's share of organized criminal networks, including politicians and high-ranking military, are to be part of the world market in tank ships.
The debate, whether the environmental disaster is due to the movement of the population or to the lax production method, keeps Akpobari active for purely academic purposes.
"If oil companies were not to be regarded as intruders and had not destroyed the fish's life base so fundamentally, there would not be any sabotage or theft and illegal refineries."
In the meantime, however, the Ogoni's relationship to Shell was destroyed, so that only a withdrawal of the group would be inquiring: "Perhaps other nationalities like the Chinese will be better off."
Michael's gonna be nervous.
"The greatest time that you're missing," says the muscleless oilman.
"Every minute the soldiers can come."
If the illegal oil refiners are caught by the special unit of the fighting forces, they are not threatened with arrest, but perhaps a painful smear money.
Soldiers from the north of the country, like all Nigerians, want to benefit from raw material.
"This damn witness has brought our country in every respect to the dog," Akpobari says.
Detector detect dangerous drums in A380 engines
The A380 obviously has a major safety problem.
The investigators have discovered a potential baddler in the investigation of a land-based machine that could lead to a "catastrophic engine failure".
The Qantas plane will now report to the engine manufacturer.
The passengers of the Qantas-Airbus were obviously much more fortunate in early November than they were so far: the Australian Air Safety Authority has identified a major safety problem in the engines of some A380 machines in its investigations - and now warns of a possible bomber.
The potential defect would have serious consequences: in the case of an oil pipeline connection, it could create a stress crisis and leaks, as was the opinion of the ATSB, published on Thursday.
This could have led to "a catastrophic driving accident".
Affected were engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce in 20 aircraft of the A380 series.
Among them is the Qantas-Airbus, which had to not land in Singapore on November 4.
The Australian airline has now taken legal steps against the British turbine manufacturer.
It opened a dispute with an Australian Federal Court in Sydney, which allows him to take further legal action against the company.
Qantas-Chief Alan Joyce said his airline will be in need of compensation for the incident at the beginning of November.
At the fire of the engine, parts had been dissolved and the bearing surfaces were damaged.
Rolls-Royce made an oil fire as a cause of the damage.
After the incident, up to 40 engines have to be replaced worldwide.
The Australian investigators announced that further safety tests should be carried out on the superjumbos equipped with the relevant engines.
The safety recommendation was the result of cooperation with Rolls-Royce, said ATSB speaker Martin Dolan.
The safety problem has been considered important enough to inform all concerned.
After the landing of the Qantas machine, the airline had kept its A380 fleet on the ground for weeks.
Singapore Airlines temporarily left about three of its eleven A380s on the ground.
The Lufthansa changed the engine as a precautionary measure in an A380.
The double-stationary flyer is the largest passenger plane in the world.
National snowfall triggers traffic noise
Germany all in white: Over the night snow has fallen almost throughout the country.
On many streets chaos, trains and flights fall out.
At least three people died in car accidents.
The winter colds Germany: At icy temperatures, almost all the Republic is connected at night on Thursday - which leads to traffic chaos in many places.
In the north and in the east there are partly 15 centimeters thick snowdecks.
On several motorways and many roads traffic is severely restricted.
At the A7 at Flensburg, the winter service was in use, but the ever-changing snow was not finished.
In addition, heavy bows were weighed over the east coast.
The Federal Office for Sea Navigation and Hydrography (BSH) is expected to be on the east coast of Schleswig-Holsteins from the morning to storm currents with water stands of 1.2 metres above the normal level.
In Saxony, snow travel on highways and federal roads led to major problems.
According to the weather central Meteomedia, therefore, alarm level was violet in Switzerland – the highest level at all.
In part, there was 30 centimeters of snow, fresh and strong wind provided for the journeys.
Several trucks and cars remained there during the night.
In Saxony-Anhalt, the police also reported major road disturbances.
Snow and wind on the A2 led to steady traffic and staus.
In Thuringen, the A4 and A9 were affected by the snowfalls.
According to the German Bahn, there are significant disturbances in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and Northern Bavaria.
Snowing on the tiles, twisted trees on the rails or destroyed bridges and meadows are the main problems.
In Saxony, transport from Leipzig to Nuremberg had to be adjusted.
In the Thuringian Saalfield an ICE had to stop its journey to Munich.
The 165 passengers were provided by firefighters and rescue assistants with woolen blankets, food and drink in the train.
Snowwinds were floating across the streets.
On large German airports, snow winds lead to numerous accidents.
Some cancellations have already been reported in Munich, according to a speaker from the airport centre.
In Frankfurt am Main, 40 flights had already been cancelled, according to a French speaker.
The winter service is in use.
Although only a few beached passengers at the airport are still ready for them, they still have almost 400 beds.
On many streets there were accidents already on Wednesday night.
In the evening, an Lkw professional came to live with a train on a train crossing in Ostholstein.
The driver was slightly injured.
Near Nuremberg there was a similar accident because of snow-covered roads: here a truck was picked up on a train crossing because the vehicle was stuck.
The driver came to life.
Four passengers were injured in the train - the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was therefore blocked until the morning hours.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died after she had crossed over with her car at Ashcherenburg on smooth road.
But the meteorologists have a good message: even though the snow will still be loose and pulverized and will therefore be found in light evils.
But the wind will weaken.
Only the Baltic Sea is visited by fast and stormy winds.
However, it remains very cold - locally up to minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for its twins
The Deutsche Bank wants to separate from its trademark: According to a newspaper report, the Moneyhaus is looking for the two office towers at its Frankfurt headquarters.
Up to 500 million euros could bring the property.
The German Bank has only made its group seat very nice: the twinning storms in the Frankfurt Bank district have been modernised; in the meantime, the banks were allowed to return to their old workplace.
But now the financial group wants to recover the costs of the renovation - and is looking for a buyer for the two high houses, as the "Financial Times Germany" is calling on a speaker.
Reasons for the planned sale did not come from the speaker.
"We always check whether it is more meaningful to own or sell properties themselves and then rent back," he said.
Germany's largest credit institution thus returns its company seat after a short period of time.
By mid-2007, the Bank had taken over the double towers for 272 million euros from the founders of a home fund and then carefully recovered.
The energy conversion fell to about EUR 200 million.
A sale would probably bring a lot of money to the bank.
Industry experts estimate the value of the current "greenowers" towers in the newspaper according to about 500 million euros.
Whether the buildings are resold to a bank-owned fund or to an independent investor, the speaker said.
Thousands of mourning for a dead friend
More than 10,000 people in New Zealand have thought of the hidden mountains that have been declared dead after several explosions in a mine.
The bodies were still unable to be protected because the safety situation in the accident box is still precarious.
Almost two weeks ago, the Pike River Mine came to a severe explosion near the city of Greymouth.
29 mountain workers between the ages of 17 and 62 were hidden under days.
A probe had been left in the accident box, but no trace of survivors had been detected.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and subsequent explosions, no rescue forces could be lifted for safety reasons.
After the second severe detonation, the authorities and experts assumed that there was no longer a chance of survival for the party.
The bodies could not be hidden so far.
Now the relatives and friends recalled with a memorial celebration to the dead.
Tens of thousands of people had gathered on the New Zealand South Island when the sun appeared shining in Greymouth.
For two minutes, they're sweating.
In honor of the hidden mountain glares, 29 tables were set, on which helms, lamps and the name of the buddy were seen.
Pictures and personal items, including clothes and surfboards, also found their place here.
In front of the government buildings of the country, the flags were half-massed.
New Zealand hoped that the mountain climbs would come back to the surface "from the depths of the earth", New Zealand Prime Minister John Key told the participants of the Memorial.
"But they never came home."
He could not finish with the death of his son, until he had seen his body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the grave.
In addition to the Prime Minister and the victims, several foreign diplomats took part in the Memorial celebration.
At the first explosion on November 19th, British and South African mountain ranges were also hidden.
Rescue workers began to wipe out a fire inside the Kohlbergwerk on the southern island of New Zealand.
As soon as the explosive gas is forced, it will start to cool the glowing temperatures inside the mine, Police President Gary Knowles said to journalists.
Go to hell, warrior!
Does Splater fit the art kino?
The director Nicolas Winding Refn re-launchs old genre boundaries with his "Wallalla Rising" battle epos.
What audience might Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn have thought when he turned Wallalla Rising?
A captured Viking warrior with only one eye (Mad's Mikkelsen) is free from his tormenters and with almost superhuman forces, his opponents in particular - sounds ideal for young male viewers in the search for bloody action, just because our hero likes to serve angry killing methods and his enemies are already running the stomachs out of the living body when he has a bad wage.
On the other hand, Insight says, as it is actually called, that the whole film does not say a word, and also the other figures can go up to one or two sentences or a few qualifiers of death.
In other words, the beautiful hilly landscape of Scotland, which the Viking world has been offering for about a thousand years ago, is being smothered.
Ideal for adult cinemas with interest in existentialism and very quiet camera tours.
Nice, if a movie has several target groups, it only hurts if they shut down each other.
Director Winding Refn has since his wild and controlled drug trilogy "Pusher" as a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, but he is reluctant to make his works more humorous to the mainstream or to make something less brutal to the arthouse accessible.
Most of the art kino friends were allowed to be frightened by the swarming brain mass and the guts.
At the latest, action fans die before long periods of time, when ingenuity for freely interpretable reasons with a troop of violent Christian missionaries ascends to Jerusalem and establishes an eternity in flute and nebula before the team becomes manifestly in America and continues to float there.
So no wonder Wallalla Rising did not find a cinema award in Germany and now it's only appeared on DVD.
This is especially because of the magnificent images a pity, but also because behind the pretentious to bloodthirsty façade a sometimes exciting piece of cinema that deserves some attention.
In this film, it's not about dialogue or a tight action, it's all the atmosphere, a filmed fiebre dream.
And there's no way out of it for the viewer.
Refn barely gives him a moment of relaxation and ties him with his icy pictures and the window trance-like soundtrack very slowly to the throat, but especially with the incapacitable hatred that confronts him from the heart of the figures.
Only a little blonde boy, who is loyal to his side, saves something like innocent, all others are driven by anger.
For the most part of the unsuspecting hero whose motive is never explained, but for enemies and temporary allies will at some time become the warrior from hell, perhaps the messenger of the devil himself.
It means corruption, but perhaps only for the innocent.
Wallalla Rising is a violent film that you can hate and admire, for anger, excitement and staunchness.
An experience.
Resolute Earthwork
The IAEA Atomic Energy Authority has new indications of a secret nuclear programme in Syria.
However, the country refuses to take a position - it still has control.
On Wednesday 5th to 6th September 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 in combat aircraft attacked a mysterious, platform-shaped building in Syria.
It is on the shore of the Euphrates; the next largest city, 30 kilometres away, is Dair as-Saur.
Its name appears in the documents of the International Atomic Energy Authority (IAEA) when it comes to the reactor that allegedly built Syria with the help of North Korea in the camp, hidden in a valley that runs from the stream.
According to a letter from the CIA Foreign Secret Service of late April 2008, the current reactor under the name of the nearby village of El Kibar would have been well suited to producing plutonium - from which nuclear weapons were built.
For other purposes, however, the technology is hardly invigorating from the five-digits.
The CIA conducted a video presentation with uncharted satellite images.
By computer animation, it showed where the components of the reactor should have been before the destruction, which is a reduced copy of the North Korean model from the Yongbyon Atomic Center.
In addition, she introduced photos showing the building from nearby or even the interior.
The reactor was just before the launch, but it was still not occupied with fuel.
Today, more than three years after the bombing, the puzzles have become much bigger in time.
Former U.S. President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that the CIA was quite sure before the attack that Syria built a reactor in el-Kibar, but hardly saw that there was "an active nuclear programme" in the country.
Some secret officials in Europe prefer to be careful and speak only from a "probably reactor" even if they hold the CIA presentation for "plausible".
You lack strong evidence, as well as the IAEA.
Asked how certain he was to have a reactor ahead of him, a high UN diplomat in the summer answered only Lapidar, which IEA has "sufficient material to ask questions".
The protection of the alleged "unused military building" created the acidic side and planned the site thoroughly.
However, in June 2008, an IAEA team was found under former Chief Inspector Olli Heinone in el-Kibar traces of Uran, which was produced by humans.
In addition, the IAEA received from a Member State satellite images of commercial suppliers from time to time following the attack that should be more pronounced than those presented by the CIA.
However, these recordings are not to be obtained on the market because the unknown customer - perhaps Israel - has bought them exclusively.
Therefore, the IAEA cannot verify its authenticity independently.
Syria has always appreciated never operating a secret nuclear program or having built a reactor.
The Uranus came from the Israeli weapons, Damascus explained.
But this was shown by the IAEA after analysis of the particles as unlikely.
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss this - as well as the satellite images.
It also prevents the controllers from having a second inspection in el-kibar and access to the ruins of the bombed building.
But Israel also bows to iron.
"We will never comment on this," the newly confirmed official position of Prime Minister Ehud Olmert at the time of the attack.
Thus, the investigation of the case has been ineffective since June 2008 and "develops increasingly into a serious credibility problem for the authorities", as a high Western diplomat at the seat of the IAEA in Vienna - a serious breach of the nuclear weapons contract in the area over which the IAEA is awaiting.
As a key to progress in the disclosure, the IAEA obviously sees three other institutions, which are to be "in functional connection" with the required reactor - and other than that still exist.
The inspectors have so far not revealed what facilities they are dealing with, what function they have or what they appear suspiciously.
According to information from the South German newspaper, they are referred to internally as Marj as Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah at the IEAA, again removed from nearby cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) has identified these sites and discovered a building complex on satellite images at Masyaf, where it is most likely one of the suspicious objects.
It may be located in or immediately next to a military base - with this very reason, Syria of the IAEA denied access to the three places.
In Vienna it is said that the Syrians feared a fishing expedition - that the IAEA will be sent by the United States to spy out military facilities.
Because the nucleo-deceptives had become attentive to the institutions through a tip of the US intelligence services.
The IAEA has indications, including satellite photos, that material was transported between the three locations and the square at the Euphrates.
A high Western diplomat in Vienna said at least one of the facilities could be "in connection with fuel production".
However, there is "no indication of sensitive activities", i.e. uranium enrichment or reprocessing; processes necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The type of reactor is operated with uranium, which is not enriched.
But where the uranium should have come from and where later the plutonium should be removed for the bomb, there are at least plausible suspicions about these central questions.
It is also unclear whether drums, which could raise valuable traces, were stored in three places.
As the hundreds of trucks had disappeared from the ground, no one wants to have information about where the protection was left.
The saltmine al-Tibni, located just a few kilometres from el-Kibar on the other side of the Euphrates, which Syria has examined for its suitability in 1998 as a storage facility for radioactive dust, is unlikely to be considered by the IAEA.
Former IAEA Inspector Robert Kelley had recently contacted the reactor in an analysis of satellite images for the renowned magazine Jane's Intelligence Review.
However, recordings from the Orbit show that Syria went to the three suspicious locations of land and removed large containers after the IAEA had requested access.
This may be a coincidence, but it has hardly contributed to exorcising suspicion.
In addition, in diplomatic circles, the IAEA has used several months to develop a plan for inspections there, which should allow Syria to keep any military secrets - only the effort shows how great the interest of inspectors is.
Indes, Damascus also tabled this proposal.
Western diplomats in Vienna were weighed down a year ago, the reactor was destroyed, so the matter has not been very urgent, for example US ambassador Glyn Davies has been carrying out special inspections in the game for a few months, one of the strongest means that the Vienna nuclear power plant has to carry out controls.
IAEA Chief Yukiya Amano, who had to propose these inspections, has already spoken of "an option for which I am open in the future", but he hesitates.
There is a high risk in this way: for one, there is a need for a majority in the Council of Governors of the IAEA, and a number of the 35 countries represented there are all different from those on a scale.
For others, how can there be a diplomat to think, "What if they don't find anything at the end?"
Love in Times of War
Since Angelina Jolie started working on her nameless regiment in summer, there's a lot of trouble.
The spinbook itself wrote a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a Serbian man.
Much more you don't know about it - but that's enough for trouble.
The rumor, the woman, a Muslim, is deeply in love with her Serbian rapist during the Yugoslavian war.
Bosniak women's associations immediately protested, and some of the rotations planned in Sarajevo were moved to Hungary in a short time.
Meanwhile, the film has been filmed in Hungary and in post-production, but it is still protested in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic from the organization of female war victims wrote about the UN Refugee Relief Agency UNHCR to Jolie and demanded a meeting with the actor, has now reported a Bosnian newspaper - Jolie is the ambassador of the UN Refugee Relief Agency.
She is not diplomatic - she offered the women a meeting in Hungary a week ago, which they refused.
The meeting must take place in Bosnia, so hasecic.
Love stories in rape camps did not exist, and Jolie's attitude towards the victims told her enough about the spinbook.
Its organization has recommended to the UN Refugee Relief Agency that Jolie be released as a messenger, reports the Guardian.
But what exactly did Jolie write for scenes?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which has been given permission to read her spinbook, has granted a spin-off for Sarajevo - it is not quite clear why Jolie did not come anyway.
The young author himself believes that she does not pursue political intentions with her film, has worked hard in the Yugoslav conflict, wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and give a voice to all the parties involved.
However, the content remains vague.
This is how a second synopsis of the film in the network, which then sounds quite different: Lovers knew about it before the outbreak of war and met again, when she, a Bosnian Muslim, is dragged into a Serbian camp where he works as a guard.
What sounds a lot different from the variant "Violence victims are falling apart in torture."
That Jolies film actually starts before the war - so much is certain.
The pressure on them, so Jolie, is "unfair and based on misinformation".
Now you can only buy the hackers of Hollywood peace: By putting the spinbook, as many before, illegally into the network.
Nothing like this.
Finally, this evening, it again runs right around for the irons.
No sign of distress.
For this, the home team dominates its guests from Sweden, Finland and the USA too much.
The fans gloat before joy with loud music, they gnaw with their feet.

"Bierpong" is called the bizarre spectacle, there is 500 Euros prize plus tickets to Las Vegas for the Bierpong World Championships in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet type; this spicy drinking game and the withholding computer player that doesn't really fit together.
And yet, the 26-year-old is trying to amuse himself to withdraw from the boring question, what the future will bring.
On his plan there is no fun in Las Vegas, he will conduct application talks in New Zealand in January.
"I'm feeling a lot like that," he says.
"It's so far from home and I still don't have a job there."
Anyway: His girlfriend is waiting for him in Auckland - "she had a bad, sucked her wish job as an event manager, maybe a good sign," says the young man and smiles.
Because of poor perspectives at home, two of the Tanners' three siblings have already sought happiness abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now has a place as an IT consultant in London.
The boys go: As with the dancers, it looks on the island in many families.
100,000 irons will probably leave the country in the near future, experts from the ESRI Institute for Economic and Social Research in Dublin say.
By 2015, they even count on 200,000 immigrants.
For the small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants, a huge loss.
If the forecasts are preserved, there is a wave of emigration comparable to that of Ireland in the 1980s.
After a decade of awakening, which brought great prosperity to the Iranians, there is now again a great deal of sadness.
The economic crisis in particular ensures that the young, well-trained Irans, for which it has only gone up to this point.
Job loss and social decline seemed absurd in the boom years.
Everyone was needed, money was in the flood.
In the meantime, three out of ten women and men are under thirty without work.
In the Irish Times there are also letters from young immigrants who complain: "Everything goes down the hill in Ireland."
"There should be a rebellion against politicians and bankers - but who can go away and thus our country loses an entire generation."
"The last one makes the light out."
Jura-Student Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish Student Union, sees a dark future as the government only operates eyewashing and offers no future prospects for young people.
"They reduce minimum wages, but they have no strategy to create new jobs," says the 20-year-old.
She observes how her fellows hang from an unpaid practice to the next.
Her greatest concern, she says, is to have to expand itself in four years.
"This thought is sad and depressing."
Men like Stephen McLarnon try to make the subject positive.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo", a trade fair that offers a Rundum service on the topic of working abroad.
"For starters, working abroad is a great opportunity to take the first steps on the career leader," says the manager.
On his website show photos Surfer in Australia and Snowboarder in Canada.
The message is clear: working abroad is not a gale service, but also brings freedom and fun.
How it feels to build something elsewhere, Seán O'Donovan has known for half a year.
Since the 29-year-old engineer in Ireland had nothing to do with, he now works with 15 Irish colleagues on construction in Germany.
In Gelsenkirchen, they just pull up a fashion hall.
In January it will continue to go to Hanover or Berlin, for the next project.
In the meantime, his home sees O'Donovan only rarely, because he makes extra sheets to pay the credit for his house at home.
"The situation is already a bit crazy," he says, after a long time, for the first time, about the threshold of his house.
"I earn money in Germany for a house in Ireland where I am as good as ever."
He laughs a bit and goes through cool rooms.
The small house is located in a fine residential area with decorated fronts, parked in the entrances large expensive cars.
Together with a sister, O'Donovan bought the house for four years ago for 380,000 euros - 100 percent credit financed.
"There were crazy times, there was simple money without many questions," he says.
Is he afraid it could go off with the credit?
O'Donovan spends a while, throws hot tea and says, "I don't have any kids to feed and I'm young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start from New."
The construction engineer does not like to hear the complaints he is hearing at the moment.
"No one must be hungry - our situation is not as dramatic as it was on the island in the past," he says.
"Working abroad, that is not the worst thing that can happen - perhaps we feel as if it were iron."
He laughs and then tells of his father, who went to England in the last major economic crisis.
"After seven years he was back there and life went on in Ireland, quite simply."
Cian Tanner likes this thought.
Let the future open and just look at how it goes with the life away.
A few years of work in London has he already been behind and why should it not run well for him and his girlfriend in New Zealand?
But one thing is still bothering him in these days: the celebration on his 27th birthday in Dublin.
He's afraid it might look like a life- well-being party.
"Not just too many emotions," he says and drinks a great deal of his beer.
"Well, that sounds scary."
"We'd rather call it a road party, very loose, with a couple of friends, a couple of drinks, a couple of games."
The Democratic Routine
The democratic movement in Latin America is becoming stronger, as is the support of private companies.
Crime is a bigger problem than unemployment.
In many parts of the region, Brazil's influence is greater than that of the United States.
The Latinobarometer survey, which was carried out in 18 countries, was published exclusively in The Economist.
This survey has been carried out regularly since 1995 and thus shows the change of opinion in this region.
Two facts fall in this year's survey of September and October in particular.
First the good mood in Latin America
and secondly, the growing interest in democracy and its most important institutions.
In many countries on the South American Pacific coast, the democratic movement has increased greatly (see Table 1).
In Peru, for example, where the economy has grown by about 6% annually since 2002, the number of democracy advocates rose from 40% in 2005 to 61% in this year.
Even in Mexico, where the economy has recovered since the strong break-in last year, such a trend is to be recognized.
But only half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the richest countries of the region, are convinced Democrats, which reduces the regional average (see Figure 2).
Approximately 44% of respondents stated that they were satisfied with the democratic practice of their country, which is as much as last year, but 25% more than in 2001 (Figure 3).
About 34% trust the Congress of their country and 45% of their government. Both values correspond to those of the last year, but show a significant increase compared to 2003 (17% or 24%).
A decade ago, the Latin American economic crisis undermined the efforts of more democracy.
This also lasted during the global economic crisis, perhaps because the countries of Latin America have only experienced a short period of recession and have recovered quickly.
In addition, the poor were arrested by a stronger social network.
(According to reports by the UN Economic Commission for Latin America this week, the poverty rate in Latin America increased only slightly and 32% fell again this year.)
But from country to country there are strong mood differences (see diagram 4).
Brazil's strong economy and the popularity of its distinguished president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, is reflected in a widespread view of progress.
In Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more noticeable and increased violence, this is less the case.
For the second time since the beginning of the survey, many people in Latin America have seen a greater problem in crime in their country than in unemployment (see Figure 5).
Approximately 31% say that either they or a family member have been victims of a crime in the last year. However, compared to 38% in the last year, the values have fallen and thus reach the lowest level since 1995.
The increasing economic performance is reflected in increased support for the private and market economy: approximately 71% of respondents said that the private sector was indispensable for development, in 2007 56% (see Figure 6).
Approximately 58% stated that only the market economy can make progress in its country, compared with 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of the respondents in Venezuela have maintained this view (and 80% are for a private economy), although their left president, Hugo Chávez, has published many private companies.
According to 19% of respondents (18% last year) Brazil has the largest weight in the region, followed by the United States (9%, unchanged since last year) and Venezuela (9% compared to 11% last year).
On the other hand, respondents in Mexico and most countries in Central America see the most influential country in the United States, taking over this role in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua of Venezuela.
A selection box
No one had expected the elections to be perfect in Haiti on November 28.
But the facts far outweigh the fears of the electorate who led the country to help.
Overfilled polls, multiple votes cast, rhinestone ballots, destroyed polls and intimidations were only part of the problems.
Wahlokale opened with a long delay.
Many Haitians, many of whom had become homeless by the earthquake in January, fought around looking for a choice.
Some finally gave up.
A dozen presidential candidates, among them some of the most important leaders, demanded the abolition of the election results on the basis of a alleged fraud.
In the whole country there were partial violent protests.
However, Edmond Mulet, the leader of the UN mission in Haiti, called the election "as pretty good in many interests".
According to a cautious statement by observers of the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community "make these irregularities as seriously as they may be, the process is not necessarily invalid".
In other words, the show goes on.
The election authority, which is supposed to be committed to the unbelieved separatist president René Préval and his candidate, Jude Célestin, will announce the preliminary results on 7 December.
The expected selection is scheduled for January.
There is hope in the election.
The two leading opposition candidates, rap-musicer Michel Martelly and former First Lady Mirlande Manigat, have withdrawn their initial invalidity claim.
If Jude Célestin, who has little or no agreement with the voters, explains that the election authority is the winner of the election, this could lead to problems.
Because of the cholera epidemic and the fact that more than 1 million of the victims still live in tents, a small electoral involvement was feared.
On the election day, many Haitians were prevented by a lack of organization from voting.
Shortly before the election began, about 250,000 demonstrations needed for the election were not yet distributed.
There's a lot on the game.
The donor countries consider a legitimate, recognised government as an important step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
The Haitians themselves are the same opinion.
Homely in the middle
In the weeks after your husband's sudden death, Argentina's president, Cristina Fernández, experienced a wave of sympathies that has driven their popularity rates by 20 points to over 50% above. This is the highest value since her election in 2007.
However, if you help this to be re-elected next year, it depends whether the apparently sad Cristina Fernández is more committed than her deceased husband, her predecessor and political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
The signs for this are not clear.
Néstor Kirchner, who, even after his wife's election, linked economic policy, often presented budget plans that did not take full account of tax revenue, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the President-in-Office to spend extra income on their own merits.
On paper, the Fernández government lost the majority in the congress last year.
But the opposition was divided and Kirchner's death after a heart attack on October 27 led to further convulsions.
Some regime critics from the ranks of the ruling Peronists stood behind Cristina Fernández.
However, after chaotic meetings (where one parliamentarian struck another in the face and others visited the government of the siege), it was not possible for the Congress to adopt the 2011 budget.
"I will not discuss it," said the President.
The 2010 budget is now also valid for the next year, which gives the President an even more opportunity to spend money on his own merits.
The economy is running: it is likely to grow by up to 9% this year.
For example, the official inflation rate is 11.1%, but many private estimates - and wage requirements of trade unions - are almost 30%.
Kirchner, who took over the office in 2003, when Argentina was sheltered from economic crises, explained growth and poverty struggle to its main objectives, rather than inflation.
He refused to cooperate with the IMF, scandalized the private sector, and praised the National Institute for Statistics and Population Index, which then made the official inflation statistics beautiful.
Can Fernández take a more moderate course now?
She called the private economy and the trade union leaders for talks.
And according to official statements, wage increases will be limited to 18% next year.
The high world market prices for Argentina's agricultural products have given the economy a strong boost.
Inflation, however, undermined the growth gap by a major devaluation in 2002.
It is possible that Cristina Fernández would like to return to the rest of the world financially.
At the beginning of this year, the government entered into an agreement with securities owners who had rejected the country's earlier debt in 2001.
Now Fernández seems to insist on an agreement with the donors from the Paris Club, to which she owes about $6.7 billion.
The churchmen had always rejected a check by the IMF, as usual.
In the last month, however, Economic Minister Amado Boudou announced that the Fund will provide "technical support" in the creation of a new national consumer price index, as if this would be the first step towards the purification of the INDIC.
It is not known whether Fernández will be politically active even after the end of her term of office without the support of her husband.
If so, it needs the support of the middle layer, which most of it has enough of the church.
If the Argentines return from their summer vacation in March, the wave of the sympathy they have received will be removed.
If she wants to win another choice, she has to decide whether to withdraw many political decisions from her husband in silence.
Weakapplaus for China
Taiwan voters are slowly approaching a closer connection to the mainland.
What does Taiwan keep from his great brother beyond the sea?
On 27 November, more than 7.5 million voters, which are 70% of all voters, stood to choose mayors and city halls in the five urban districts. This is appreciated as a broad assessment by President Ma Ying-jeou.
Through the construction of railway relations, including a partial free trade agreement, Ma itself is a figure for relations to the mainland. Her policy has changed the relationship to the Chinese country for the first time since 1949.
Ma has passed the test, but only recently.
Although his Kuominang party (KMT) is set by three of the five mayors, she did not receive a majority.
Instead, the Democratic Progress Party (DPP) that supports greater independence in Taiwan received almost 50% of the votes received by KMT 45%.
In the case of a presidential election, this would have meant problems for Ma.
Since his election two years ago, his party's voting rate has fallen by about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP even joined the KMT in the streets.
During the election, it came to the usual events in Taiwan, such as cargo convoys with cranes, flag-swimming crowd suits and only very well-dressed dancers.
There was even the obligatory, mysterious attempt to kill.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan and the honorary president of the KMT held a speech on a KMT candidate on the night before the election,
When a man shot him in the face from the crowd, he was struck by a demon and killed by an omnipotent seer.
Bizars' guide is not clear whether the shooter killed linen or wanted to argue with the candidate.
Whatever the case, according to Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the DPP, affected the election and turned the DPP into a bad light, which protected the KMT more votes.
Perhaps China was the biggest winner of the campaign.
Significantly, relations with the mainland have not been thematicized.
Instead, the candidates debated plans for social housing and job creation.
The Taiwanese love their actual independence and reject China's military threat.
For this reason, the KMT does not like its relations with the government in Beijing.
But this time, too, the DPP avoids cutting the anti-Chinese feelings very much.
She responded to the new awareness that Taiwan's economy cannot survive without China.
However, he would like to confirm that the majority of Taiwanese support its Chinese policy.
The government in Beijing will continue to pursue its strategy of withdrawing Taiwan with economic incentives into the Community.
China immediately sent a distributor to Taipei to prepare a summit for investment security and medical cooperation.
Of course, it also wants political integration, but the most important.
It is better to wait until the 2012 presidential elections.
In the meantime, the DPP has come up again.
Two years ago she was severely weakened: the former leader Chen Shui-bian was in prison for corruption.
During his presidency from 2000 to 2008, he was very much in favour of absolute independence.
But under Tais Regente, a new generation of decent politicians developed, and the DPP was fighting for the voices of professionals and young people.
Tsai, as a presidential candidate for the DPP, found great agreement, such as Su Tseng-chang under Chen.
Her party is now doing everything to show that she is also able to build close relationships with Beijing.
Tsai plans an idea as a point of contact between the DPP and China. However, this presupposes unprecedented discussions.
Tsai publicly stated that its party offers a "confidential alternative" to mass faster approach to China.
Chen seems very upset about this change.
From his cell he explained that the DPP candidates would have done better to remain independent of Taiwan.
He even asked Pragmatic Su to refuse the presidential candidacy.
Even without Chens interference, the DPP is difficult to choose from its potential candidates.
The KMT will have to undertake its own self-analysis.
But values are bad, despite rapid economic growth; KMT candidates wanted to win their election without him.
The main reasons for his infidelity seem to be unemployment and the continuing gap between the poor and the rich.
According to a KMT speaker, he will transform his cabinet as well as the local facilities.
The strong appearance of the DPP suggests that Taiwan only supports a reintroduction.
At the same time, most Taiwanese people see economic cooperation with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, "there is no return already".
Grammy nominations: The Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding was surprisingly awarded in the category Newcomer of the year
If you appear at the request of a president, people will notice it.
President Obama himself asked Esperanza Spalding to attend the ceremony on the occasion of the 2009 Nobel Prize. Now the 26-year-old jazz-bassist and singer was nominated for this year's Grammy in the Newcomer category of the year.
In view of the fact that Spalding has already been a celebrated star in the jazz scene since her album "Esperanza" in 2008, the nomination appears a little unusual. However, it complies with the Grammy rules that an artist may have published at least three albums prior to the release of the album, with which he was known in the public.
Your ambitious 2010 album, "Chamber Music Society", is certainly a step forward. And with its strong voice and a good sense of pop, funk and Latin music, you can compare Spalding quietly with Norah Jones 2003, whose great success in 2003 as a jazz interpreter in this category of nomination spaldings next.
In addition, the album "History" by Vijay Iyer Trios was nominated as instrument albums in the category. This critic's favorite was a huge success.
Among the competitors Iyers are "Moody 4B" by experienced saxophonist James Moody and "Positootly" by keyboard John Beasley.
Trombone Shorty, a rough favorite from New Orleans and a frequent guest in HBOs "Treme", was awarded in the category of contemporary jazz, where the other albums by Stanley Clarke, John McLoughlin and Jeff Lorber can be found.
The Secret Society of the Wild Steampunk-Musicer Darcy James Argue has received well-deserved attention in the category of Great Group. He therefore opposes the Billy Child's Emsemble with his chamber jazz and the adventurous Dave Holland and his octet, whose life ablum "Pathways" is a good example for a bassist as a democratic band leader.
Grammy nominations: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey leads to classical categories
The classic nominations for the 53rd Grammy Award include a colorful mix of musicians and composers from all over the world.
The list of Michael Daughertys "Deux Ex Machine" for piano and orchestra with five votes, and Steve Mackeys "Dreamhouse", an eclectic orchestra, with three votes.
Among the nominees with connections to Southern California, the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt with his symphony No. 4 "Los Angeles". This piece was commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonics and launched in 2009 at the Walt Disney Concert Hall.
The composer Avner Dorman, based in L.A., was also nominated for his Mandolin concert.
Classic nominations are divided into 13 categories, from orchestra, opera, choir to solo recordings.
Five artists were nominated this year in the category of classical producers - Blancon Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Among the nominated classical albums are Bruckners Symphony No. 3 and 4 of the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daughertys "Deus Ex Machine" and "Metropolis Symphony" played by Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackeys "Dreamhouse" by Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati" presented by various artists; and Verdi's "Requiem" by Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chor.
In the opera category, Bergs "Lulu by the orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hases "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" by Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariahos "L'Amour de Loin" by the German Symphony Orchestra Berlin; Rodion Shchedrins "The Enchanted Wanderer" by the orchestra and choir of the Mariinsky Theatre; and Arthur Sullivan "Ivanhoe" by the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
As composers, Peart for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machine", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionatetato Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer" were nominated for a Grammy.
Pärts Symphony No. 4 was released and recorded at Disney Hall on 4 January by L.A. Philharmonics under the direction of Esa-Pekka Salons.
The approximately 30-minute piece bears the title "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the former oil magnet Mikhail Chodorkowski, who is in prison in Russia.
Dorman's "Mondolinen Concert" received a nomination in the instrumentalsolo category with orchestra.
The composer from L.A. stated that he wrote the 15-minute piece specifically for the Mandoline artist Avi Avivital, who performed the concert with the New York Metropolis Ensemble.
"I used sounds from the Middle East and numerous North African sounds and rhythms," Dorman explained in a phone interview.
The director Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the orchestra award category for a recording of the works of Strawinskis with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under his direction.
As instrumental soloists, pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin, organist Paul Jacobs, Geiger Julia Fischer and Harfinist Sarah Schuster Ericsson were nominated.
This year only women were nominated as vocal soloists, including Anne Sophie von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the category Classic Crossover, Soprano Jessie Norman was nominated for her recording "Roots - My Life, My Song".
Moscow in Temecula wins the approval of the Planning Committee
The building of a mosque in Temecula was found after a five-hour, often hot public hearing the unanimous commitment of the local planning committee.
Critics proposed to promote both terrorism and traffic.
However, according to a Commission statement from Wednesday evening, the new religious centre complies with local regulations and will become an aesthetic look.
"The project is supported by many good people - by Christians, Jews, Bahais, and many others," said Hadi Nael, chairman of the Islamic Centre of Temecula Valley on Thursday morning.
"As an American, I'm proud of it."
"It shows that justice reigns."
"There are only a few enemies," he added.
"They're just very loud."
"In this valley, wonderful people live."
The meeting began at 18:00 and the discussions for and against the construction of the centre lasted almost until midnight, with the votes on both sides according to the press enterprise being distributed fairly evenly.
The debate was continued on the website of the newspaper.
"There is no America anymore," said one comment.
"It is another planet of monkeys, and the statue of freedom is dead in the sand."
"America is at the end."
Planned Islamic centers have also led to protests in other parts of the country, e.g. near Ground Zero, the scene of terrorist attacks on New York City on September 11, 2001.
In Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmoush has called for violence.
His community with approximately 135 families has lived peacefully in Riverside County for years. However, they wanted a larger and better place than the warehouse they rented together with a water filter plant manufacturer.
The new, approximately 2,300 m2 large mosque in the Mediterranean style should have two minerals and become about 13m high.
It is intended to develop on the approximately 17,500 m2 large plot at Nicolas Road near the Chaparal High School.
Opponents can still object to the project at the City Council.
Arsen-resistant microbe could allow new life forms on earth or elsewhere
The discovery of a strange type of bacteria that can live by arsenic, among other things, opens up new possibilities for new forms of life on earth and elsewhere.
Although scientists have discovered this unusual bacteria here on earth, it is in their view a sign that a life is possible even without the elements considered to be vital.
"This organism has two possibilities."
"He needs to grow either phosphorus or arsenic."
"This makes it something very special, although it is almost a kind of 'foreign' life form," explained Paul C.W. Davies from Arizona State University and co-author of the report, which appears on Thursday in the online issue of Science magazine.
So far, six main elements have been considered as vital - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur.
But as the scientists discovered, the bacteria in the California Mono Lake grow even further when it replaces phosphorus by arsenic.
"There is a question of what else is possible," said the co-author of the Ariel D. Anbar report from the Arizona State University.
The discovery is an important step in the search for extraterrestrial life, since scientists must recognize life and its forms, as well.
The study deals with microbes found on earth.
The announcement of a press conference where no details of the discovery were made known gave rise to excessive speculation on the Internet that the report could act on the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
This is not the case.
The discovery "shows that in other planetary systems organisms can put other elements of biochemical processes into action and that the 'standard elements' which are absolutely necessary in our opinion are not necessarily determined," explained Charles Cockell, Professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institutes of the Open University of Milton Keynes in the United Kingdom.
Cockel wasn't part of the research team.
"This work is a novel because it shows that in basic biochemical processes and structures one element can be replaced by another," Cockell added.
This discovery was not accidental.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA's Astrological Institute, which conducted the study, chose the Mono Lake because of its high arsenic content.
Since Arsen and Phosphorus are chemically identical, they assume that microbes, which are both exposed, may be able to replace one element by the other.
"The toxicity of arsenic is primarily based on the chemical behaviour of phosphorus."
"This makes it difficult for organisms to distinguish one element from another."
"But the difference is so great that arsenic works differently than phosphorus. It reaches into our biochemical system, where it melts almost everything," Anbar explains.
The researchers replaced the bacteria GFAJ-1 with an increasing arsenic concentration. It adapted and grew.
Although the microbe grows better in Phosphorus, it is also able to survive in arsenic, shows that an arsenic-based form of life can occur naturally, either on earth or on another planet or moon, on which arsenic occurs more frequently.
According to Jamie S. Foster, professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, the idea that phosphorus can be replaced by arsenic is not new. But so far there has not been a working example.
Arsen came more often in the early ages, she says, so science has come to the conclusion that early life forms have used it.
"This gives reason for the assumption that life can have evolved differently from the early age of the Earth," said Forster, who was not a member of the Wolfe-Simons Research Team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Health Authorities.
Other stolen exhibition dogs found in Compton
The other two of the four dogs that were stolen from a Bellflower motel were found, according to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's statement, from Thursday.
The four exhibition dogs - two Akitas and two Pembroke Welsh Corgis - disappeared on Tuesday, when unknown the 2006 Chevrolet Express van, in which the animals were kept in front of a Bellflower Motel 6 night, so the authorities said.
Two of the dogs were discovered in the middle of the afternoon, and the last two of them were discovered in the middle of the afternoon, says Steve Whitmore, a speaker of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
"The good news is: the dogs are well," says Whitmore.
"They're in good condition."
"They were returned to their rightful owners."
Whitmore did not make precise information about the dog's foundation yet to the circumstances that led to their discovery.
"The investigations are still under way."
"We don't want to say that anymore," explains Whitmore.
"We're following some leads."
The dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were not available on Thursday for information.
They took their two dogs in a district home in Downey on Wednesday afternoon.
The sheriff's representatives found the delivery cars and the two dogs in different locations in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a 3-year-old red, and Didi, a 10-month-old dog - were reportedly unharmed.
But the Corgis Bunny and Peter, Rickard and Peek this week on behalf of their Japanese owners at the competition, remained missing until Wednesday evening.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were on this weekend because of the AKC/Eukauba National Championship in Long Beach in the city because Trace should participate in the competition.
As Peek told the Times on Wednesday, the other dogs should participate in other competitions the days before the AKC/Eukauba show.
South California is a stop on the almost one-month tour of the couple from Hundeschau to Hundeschau.
On Monday evening, Peek and Rickard checked in the motel.
They often stayed in motels and park their delivery cars in front of their room window.
They took three more dogs - a boxing bag, a Parson Russell Terrier and a Brittany - with their motel.
The dense Akitas and Corgis stayed in the delivery car because it was colder there.
They left the window wide open, so the dogs had fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported their car on Tuesday at 6:00 as stolen.
Peek promised anyone who could give a reference to the Corgis, a finder pay. The animals were implanted microchips for identification.
On Thursday it was not yet established whether a finder's pay was paid.
The lion reopens after a judicial approval of the MGM restructuring
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty MGM now finally got green light for a new start.
On Thursday, a New York competition judge officially awarded the "prepared" believers plan to pay $5 billion debts and the 86-year-old entertainment company the way for new films and television shows.
According to Thursday's statement, the plan meets the requirements of US competition law, so that the relaunch of MGM under the leadership of Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, the founders of Spyglass Entertainment, is no longer in the way. Barber and Birnbaum are presented to the somewhat speculative studio as the main business leader.
The number of employees is reduced from over 400 to about 320.
For MGM, Chapter 11 will actually come into force only when JPMorgan Chase has completed a planned loan of $500 million to finance the new MGM productions.
At the moment, a consortium of the investment bank, which itself brings $75 million, leads the company. Financing should be up to mid-December.
The restructuring of the studio began in May 2009 with the mandate of the Investment Bank Moelis & Co, the company manager who fought with interest payments of $300 million/year to help solve their financial problems.
In August, Managing Director Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO of Enron and restructuring experts known for his activity at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis & Cooper's efforts to solve MGM's financial concerns and pay out more than 140 believers in the studio took longer than expected.
After months of discussion, the parties decided to offer the company at the end of 2009.
But the auction only attracted a few bidders and no one wanted to pay the $2 billion required by the creditors.
In the spring this year, everything began in advance when the MGM team began with the restructuring plan, which was signed by the believers after months of debate and internal disputes at the end of October.
If MGM has officially won the competition in the coming weeks, Moelis and Cooper will receive a bonus of several million dollars for their work.
The share for Moelis & Co., which has already received $1.2 million, is $9.5 million.
Cooper, which was paid monthly for the company's management of $375.000, receives a 4 million success bonus.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production at MGM. This year the studio brought out only one film and created an annual plan of seven or eight films to come to the cinemas in early 2012.
They also plan two films after "The Little Hobbit" in co-production with Warner Bros.
The studio needs a separate loan between $265 million and $275 million for its financial share of these two films that are to be created under Peter Jackson's leadership.
The investor Carl Icahn, who financed approximately 18% of the MGM-Darlensen, tried a merger of the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, whose largest shareholder he is.
However, the last negotiations between the two companies did not result in any result.
Tech Toys keeps your gift budget in balance
This year's favorite among the gifts is the iPad, possibly followed by a Microsoft Kinect video console. Both games can ride a significant hole in your gift budget.
An iPad costs as much as five BMX wheels for $99, while the price for a Kinect game is about 10 classic jumping lines or about 48 doses of Play-Doh.
But you can save your gift budget.
Recently, I visited three electronic toys in search of $80, three national toy dealers - a Wal-Mart, a Toys "R" Us and a BJ's Wolesale Club.
I immediately realized that Moores Law had come into force. This year the technology players are more efficient and at the same time cost a little less than last year.
And although fewer new toys appear on their own website, you will find the most famous of these types, Webkinz and Club Penguin, a wider offer.
More and more button cell-operated toys come on the market, and many contain rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(If not otherwise specified, all prices of Toys "R" Us.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, for children from 3 years of age) are pluschfigures, as big as sea pigs, who sing a note when pressing on their belly.
Once pressing corresponds to a note, you can play a song through multiple pressing.
Several sing-a-ma-jigs sing in harmony.
Attention: If you have started with the press once, you can no longer stop.
The Dance Star Mickey (Fisher Price $60, for children from 2) is the best choice.
On the basis of the Elmo Live technology, which has been developed last year, the animatronic doll offers exchange games such as 'Simon says', and thanks to the innovative shirt feet with wheel-blocking, it dominates the Moon-Walk.
Children who test the device use Mickey as a dance teacher. However, their parents complain about the lack of volume control.
If you are a child of the 80s, remember Alphie, one of the first computerized learning games.
Now he's back there (Hasbro/Playskool, $40, for children from 3), with a whole bunch of questionnaires, with which you can take a ride to an hour of instruction, with a better knowledge of self-correction as a teacher.
If you don't want to trust your child's smartphone, there are three independent alternatives.
MobiGo by VTech ($60 for children from 3 to 8) is the most affordable and user-friendly solution, equipped with a qwerty keyboard. However, the games included on it are not as educational as those on the Leapster Explorer ($70, for children from 3 to 12), which is equipped with the first major processing of the Leapfrogs series with a new, brighter screen.
None of the versions are compatible with older cassettes.
iXL by Fisher-Price ($90 for children from 3 to 7) uses a system similar to iTunes for games and eBooks, and thanks to the SD card drive, family photos can also be viewed.
Finally, there is Scrabble Flash ($30 by Hasbro, for children from 8). The five blocks are no bigger than a strip wooden box and have a own LED screen.
The game involves combining the blocks with words before the time runs out. It is great for an improvised letter competition.
More and more toys have a kind of online connection.
If you go alone after the offer in the playgrounds, Webkinz and Club Penguin are the most important.
To give your child an online animal at the Penguin Club, for example, you can buy a Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match Figure Package ($5 for children from 6 to 12), which contains a coin with a secret code.
If you enter the code online, your child will receive enough credits for two more parts at the Penguin Store Club.
They can be roller shoes or a puffle duster.
The latest head cell microbot, Hexbug Nano ($10 for children from 5) is no bigger than the head of your toothbrush.
The cage moves quickly to 12 vibrating silicones in any direction.
It's fun to send him out of the basement by an error garden.
And he's holding a few.
Ours fell from the kitchen table and even survived some time in the mouth of our dog.
Police intruders in China become softer
As a training officer, Tang Shenbin walked over a city square, checked his nervous subjects and handed orders with military authority and damped voice.
He wanted his female members of the Chengguan - China's robust guards of the city order to fear and disregard for their arbitrary passions and their attachment to violence - to impress the viewers.
"Stand right there!"
"Look right away!"
"Show them," he whispered to them, "how beautiful girls are!"
Four girls, barely grown up with teen age, with white gloves and identical olive green jackets and pants stand tight.
Four pairs of black pumps stood in straight line.
Four neat hats sat perfectly on the hair held with blue-white strips.
"For me, they look on average," said Mr. Tang.
"Models are nice."
Several governments have already tried to polish the image of China's city inspectors.
In a city, all new applicants must have a university degree.
The province of Guangdong introduced a bright blue uniform instead of the gray.
Wuhan, in Central China, replaced violence by low-strength: 2009 cross-reported reports say 50 officers had an unplanned imbussive car and tried to force the operator until it packed after half an hour and left the place.
Xindu, a city district in Chengdu with 680,000 inhabitants, wants to fundamentally change the image.
Since 2003, 13 women have been strengthened by the urban police force. They have been selected especially because of their appearance, their good figure and their youth.
They're supposed to give the brutal police a softer, feminine aspect.
Unfortunately, however, Scarlett Johansson would hardly have managed to improve the bad image that the Chinese have of these city commands.
Right, so the critics.
Unlike the police, these officers are allowed to enforce urban laws only by means of fines or other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese media routinely show a different picture.
In January 2008, officials in the province of Hubei shot a viewer to death when she filmed with his cell phone how they shot a protest station against a mullhalide.
Last year, a training manual was stolen from Beijing officials and published on the Internet. It describes how criminals can be punished without bloodshed.
This year a Shanghai watermelon dealer suffers from a quantity of hand-held brain damage.
A violent video game that can be downloaded from the Internet shows officers trained in China in an attack on street dealers.
"Chengguuan scares the government," the national newspaper China Daily complained last year, after further controversy about the tactics.
The newspaper demanded a "very fundamental cleansing".
Skeptics find the current approach for clearly insufficient.
When the District looked for eight female recruits in October, an editorial in Beijing Evening News asked whether women should have real jobs or only as optical decomposition.
Probably both.
According to the position, women aged 18 to 22 were searched for with good figure and harmonic facial features.
You should be on average large - more than 1.5 m or 5 feet, 2 1/2 inches.
The employment relationship ends with the achievements of the 26th year of life.
According to the officials, the activity for women is too intense for more than 25 people.
"The most important thing is her image," an unnamed district official said at the almost government website Rednet.com.
"If the candidates get the job, it first depends on their appearance, such as size, weight, facial features, etc."
Then come temperament and "inerior qualities".
"The common Chenguan are like flowers," he said, adding, "but they also have other duties."
Zheng Lihua, Deputy Head of the City Administration of the District, does not wish to undertake this description,
however, it stated that in China, the size requirements for both sexes are not uncommon.
The same applies to uniform faces.
Whether to compare it with a good look is controversial in China.
But people with disabilities or physical disorders do not need to apply.
"Unfortunately, we cannot use wools or bunnies here," said Mr Zheng.
"Your image wouldn't be good."
Liu Yi, who patrolled on the Baoguang square near a monastery, is 22, has apple branches and a well-formed mouth.
She did not feel so sesistically that so much value is placed on her appearance.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asks with ironic view.
Her colleague, the 21-year-old Xu Yang, commented, "We have the task of representing the image of the city."
According to their statements, they do not regret the short attitude, as they had more ambitious career plans than simply sneaking through the gases to prevent them from doing business.
Each morning, the strips deal with about twelve street dealers, who try to sell as many pieces and tofues as possible on foot or on the bike before they are pursued.
"Mr. Wang, please get out of here."
"We've told you so many times!" says Fr. Xu, a dealer who was on foot and had left his nudel kitchen on a bicycle stick temporarily in the stick.
According to the officials, the activity is rather monotonous.
"It's almost every day the same," says Huang Jing, 20, who studies sales in leisure.
"All Routine."
One reason is that women officials are not allowed to confiscate the goods of the dealers, as their male colleagues.
They can only threaten criminals to report to their male superiors.
This is intended to protect them from public opposition, which officials in China are often exposed to.
This year, hundreds of inhabitants of Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, randalaly, after the rumor was heard, Chengguan officials had killed a dealer.
More than a dozen police officers and Chenguan officials were injured at night, 14 government vehicles were killed or burned.
Xindu has been expelled from such violence so far.
But unrest is not to be excluded.
Only two blocks away from the quiet Baonguang square, where the women's officials patrolled this morning, gathered more than 50 people on a street corner.
Officials had confiscated a motorcycle that was repaired in a workshop instead of the rules on the citizens' ladder.
The owner was shouting Zeter and Mordio.
After a 15-minute drive, the officers turned their way to their vehicles with a rough face and drove on with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a male strip coordinator, remained back. He turned his white name sign to remain anonymous.
Like their colleagues, the coordinators - men over 40 - play a purely supportive role.
But they were not trained to present a clean image.
"Sometimes we're going crazy."
"Many times but also physically," says Mr. Li nychtern.
"Most of the time, people start fighting."
Senator Ensign will not be prosecuted
Senator John Ensign, who, after his case with a former electorate and his attempt to give his husband a lobbying activity, was brought up against him, announced the senator's lawyers on Wednesday.
This decision ends with the most serious legislative proposal against Senator Ensign, the Republican of Nevada. Until the scandal that took place across the country and set a damper on his career, he became a possible presidential candidate for the Republican for 2012.
As Senator Ensigns' office announced, he was "very pleased" about the verdict after the one-year investigation.
However, the ethics committee of the Senate could impose another disciplinary penalty.
According to Ensigns, they were informed by the Ministry of Justice that investigations against Senator Ensign had been initiated and that there were no further charges in this case.
The Ministry of Justice did not want to comment on the case.
The verdict was a surprise for many ethics lawyers outside the Ministry of Justice. In your opinion there was sufficient evidence that Ensign did not accept the lobbying ban.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents published for the first time in October 2009 in the New York Times gave rise to the suspicion that Ensign Douglas Hampton, one of his constituents, was involved in licit orders in order to purchase his debts on a case with Hampton's wife Cynthia.
Cynthia Hampton worked as a treasure teacher during an election campaign.
Ensign made contact with some political friends to provide Hampton with work. According to the documents and interviews, he took over for them after setting up Hampton's lobbying.
Since Hampton was recently in the Ensigns election team, for a year he was not allowed to take up lobby work for his former employer or the entire Senate.
According to ethical experts, the unusual agreement between Ensign and Hampton, who were very close to the case, was against the so-called prohibition of turning door lobbying.
According to the published index, "all seem to be an agreement and a violation of the rotating state," says Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients who are in the government's vision.
While the Ministry of Justice officially refused to give notice of the reasons for the decision in the ensign case, Mr. Brand and other Ethicin Wälten said, the Ministry seems very careful in the recording of political charges after a number of cases that the media had been very interested in, including the decision last year, to drop the charges against the former Senator Ted Stevens for misconduct by the State attorney.
Public prosecutors "are obviously fearful," said Melanie Sloan, president of the Association "Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington" (an organization whose aim is to combat corruption in the US's parliamentary and government's crises), a group of lawyers who have brought various charges against Mr. Ensign.
"This basically means that senior government officials can now assume that the laws do not apply to them," she added.
Paul Coggins, chief defender of Mr. Ensign, said in an interview, he received a phone call from a public prosecutor on Monday and another day, when he was informed that the Ministry would not raise complaints against his clients.
Mr. Ensigns had cooperated with the prosecutors in order to convince them that the senator, as his office repeated in a statement on Wednesday, "acted in accordance with the law".
Mr Coggins refused to explain more precisely the legal arguments he had put forward against the prosecutors.
"I don't think I'm going to go into the details of the conversation between the Ministry of Justice and me. It's just so much said: we believe we've made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to set up investigations for a separate complaint by the ethics group after a payment of $96,000 from Mr. Ensign's parents to the Hamptons against the Federal Election Act.
The electoral commission said that there was not enough evidence that the money was something other than a gift.
NV Energy, a large company in Nevada that long supported the senator, was one of the companies in which Mr. Hampton was found thanks to the help of Mr. Ensign lobbyists.
An e-mail from December 2008 states that after Mr. Hampton moved on as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensings Stabbef, John Lopez, had an understatement with Mr. Hampton, in which he informed him that he was at the Ministry of the Interior because of a matter of "attach".
Mr. Ensign also agreed with Mr. Hampton and another customer from Nevada, Allegiant Air, for lunch and asked the Minister of Transport to arrange a meeting on behalf of the airline after this Mr. Hampton had set up lobby work.
For the first time in the last year, Mr. Ensign apologized to the public about this affair and gave up his position in the Senate, where he was in the ranks of the Republicans in fourth place.
After many months he was no longer dead, Mr. Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he sought a third term of office in the Senate.
In the announcement that Mr. Ensign was no longer the target of police investigations, his press spokesman, Jennifer Cooper, told the senator that the Ethics Commission was very quick to follow the example of the Ministry of Justice and set up his investigations.
"Sentor Ensign is pleased to continue his hard work in the service of the people in Nevada," she said.
Cheshire calls on Twitter
Half a dozen of them dived into the barracks in the courtroom.
In the minutes of the attack, they sent their reports on cruel testimony on Twitter.
In the end, so the defense, there were more than 140,000 Twitter messages about the process of rape and bed-tied children in a house that went up in flames.
On Thursday, Steven J. Hayes, who was accused of having killed three members a family of Cheshire, Connecticut, will find an official end if the court's sentence on the death sentence that the jury has pronounced falls.
However, Mr Hayes' lawyers have already submitted applications to the court, the reasons for a summons and the courts will be occupied for years.
One of the most provocative reasons is that the intensive reporting of the process - including the extensive use of Twitter by average reporters - has come to a "circusatmosphere" and a so widespread, ongoing flow of student details, so that the jury has been unduly influenced by public equipment.
This opposition could lead the Court of Appeal to ask whether new rules in the courtroom are necessary for the new technologies.
"As I have experienced it during this process, I believe that it is really a danger if the introduction of new technologies into the courtroom affects the right of each individual to a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullman, Mr. Hayes chief defender.
The presiding judge, Jon C. Blue of the Supreme Court of the Chamber, withdrew the applications by decision last week briefly and bindingly when he said that the new media would be "supervised carefully", and that there was no evidence that the jury was driven by passions.
But that was certainly not the last word in this matter.
For decades, the Court has held that the report on famous reported cases has raised doubts about the fairness of a trial.
In his historic decision of 1966, the Supreme Court of the United States dismissed the judgment against Dr. Sam Sheppard, an osteopathian from Cleveland who was supposed to have killed his wife and said in his decision that there would have been a "carnival atmosphere in the courtroom" because of the new media.
Some believe that the TV series and the game film "On the Escape" is based on this crime.
Some lawyers say that court cases which Mr. Hayes considered a half century later could follow the argument that new rules have become necessary to regulate the communication routes from the courtroom that were still unimaginable at the time of the Dr. Sheppard case.
"There is a good reason to be concerned about the influence of the new media in processes that are being pursued by a wide public," said John J. Donoue III, Professor at the Stanford Law School, who investigated the death penalty in Connecticut. According to his report, it will be deliberately suspended.
Professor Donohue said some appeals courts could be fascinated by the idea that the restriction of an ongoing communication from the courtroom could make the proceedings fairer.
The Twitter issue is just one of many who are asking Mr. Hayes' lawyers to discuss years and thus to issue a conviction.
The defenders also claimed, for example, that Mr. Hayes could have already been convicted as Judge Blue had not allowed them to test the reactions of potential jurymen by showing them ugly tattoo photos during the jury selection.
Some of the jury have said that photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48 years old, and her daughter, Hayley, 17 years old, and Michaela, 11 years old, had met with abscheu.
The defendants say they would also question the constitutionality of the death penalty constitution, and argue that the judge has mistakenly exchanged a jury that has been a critic of the state prosecutor, and that he would have unduly put pressure on the judge when he made the unusual decision to release the jury over the weekend.
The jury was not isolated.
However, their arguments about the impact of the detailed report on the process may be of the greatest interest.
In an attack they filed last month, they found that the case had dominated the news in Connecticut and that during the election campaign for the office of the Governor and the US Senate were discussed by the candidates.
They argued that the new media had continually re-evaluated the flames of emotions over the case.
"A day-to-day trend of media broadcasters, cameras and reporters outside the courtroom," the lawyers wrote, "have not experienced before in New Haven and perhaps even across the country."
Its focus on reporting on Twitter is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists said that the claim that these direct messages were higher than reports that were slower replaced was a technically hostile view that weakened the report on future processes.
However, some lawyers said that appeals were often confronted with the argument, social and technical changes required adaptation by the courts.
Mr. Hayers' lawyers are strengthening this claim.
In their opposition, they referred to the decision of the Supreme Court of 1966, in which Dr. Sheppard's conviction was suspended on the basis of the report and made it clear that the new media needed new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "represents Sheppard against Maxwell of the 21st century."
Can Juvenile Connect the Separation?
After a campaign on crosswords and negativity this week, there was little courtesy in Washington.
Is it a genuine bilateral cooperation or a moment of illusion before you return quickly to the fight of the parties in the capital?
The meeting on Tuesday between President Obama and the summit of the Congress did not lead to a breakthrough in the major issues that had to be dealt with during the so-called 'lame Duck session' at the end of a government period in which decisions were no longer taken.
After everything you hear, it was not a polite discussion between two different sides, nor a respect for their shared responsibility, but rather an empty episode of a partial collection.
The public meeting of the President's Deficit Commission on Wednesday was also civilized, despite the political differences that continue to exist between the members.
It seems clear that a close interaction over a period of months can create a mutual respect that distorts the ideological struggle that continues to divide members.
This is hardly enough to claim that there was a new era of cooperation.
Both sides are now in a test phase - in which one of the other signs of cooperation and compromise is required, while one is trying to weigh the limits of public opinion and the patience of voters after a renewed party war.
Therefore, the meeting on Tuesday itself and its assessment by the participants were limited to a minimum of claims or charges.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too large and too deep to expect a rapid change in the atmosphere that prevailed over the past two years.
Whether it's taxes, donations, health or expectations, both sides are miles apart.
Finally, the November election in Washington has at least voted mildly for a short time.
"No question, the sound has changed," said Pete Wehner, an official representative of the Bush government, now working for the Ethics and Public Policy Center.
"This is inevitable after elections.
Elections generate partial passions that die again.
And that's good."
In some matters, especially those in the agenda of the "Lame Duck session", Republicans and Democrats have hardly any choice but to find a solution."
Bush's tax cuts end at the end of the year, and no one supports it.
Both sides want to find a way to get some or even all, whether it's temporary or permanent.
It is also a compromise to be expected with regard to increased unemployment, even though only because the Republicans can't afford to believe that the preferential tax cuts for the rich while they refuse to support the unemployed workers.
After the meeting on Tuesday in the White House, optimism has increased that one can agree on these issues during the "Lame Duck session" and at the same time ratify the New START Treaty.
However, William Glaston of the Brookings Institute warns that successful cooperation on urgent issues of the Lame Duck session does not necessarily lead to permanent cooperation of the parties when the new 112th Congress is called in January.
Instead, as he says, a phase of non-conformity is more likely, perhaps even impossible.
"After the things that have to be done are done, this short-term psychology will be turned into confrontation," he said.
Wehner is also skeptical - and this skepsis is shared by many - leads to genuine cooperation.
"I see a lot of what is happening from today to 2012 as a pre-fighting, or shadow boxes, for the 2012 main event," he said.
The reasons for this have a lot to do with the opening up of the new Republican majority in the White House and with the tea party voters who had been trained.
As concerns the Republican leaders, they may also be too high for poker, they know that they have to try to keep their promises, reduce government expenditure and put health reform out of control.
These party lines are already clear in the first reactions to the recommendations of the Deficit Commission, which include a tax reform and the lifting of some taxes, and the lifting of the interest rate and the reduction of public expenditure.
The vice-presidents Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken up one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and, according to their own assessment, have so much pressured them to put the deficit on the public agenda that they can no longer be ignored.
But they need 14 of the 18 votes within the Commission in order to make their plan for formal recommendation and they fight very hard to get even closer to this number.
The largest resistance is found in the body's elected representatives, since in financial matters, at least today, there is little space or little sympathy for compromises.
Galston says two phases in the fight between the White House and the Republicans at the Congress.
The first fight will take place next year in the form of party clashes if the Republican Obama challenges the state budget, taxes and health system, later followed by a phase of greater bilateral cooperation.
What will lead to this change?
The public opinion.
It is proved that, despite the partiality of the current election, the majority of Americans still wish that the two parties work together.
If confrontation leads to a gas as it happened in 1995, both parties must pay attention to the public response.
Anyone who is convicted of losing will change the course and have to look for compromise.
This may in fact be an optimistic view.
Participation and polarization are now greater than in the mid-1990s, and they seem to be a larger ideological gap between Obama and the Congress Republicans than between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans.
At the same time, the activists of the two parties see 2010 as a clear example of a much broader choice in 2012.
This is how many Americans welcome the courtesy that will be shown this week.
But it will take a lot more effort on both sides to find a common denominator in the issues that still separate the two from each other.
Persuaded US document depicts Moscow as the port of corruption
The control of the city lies in the hands of the "Cleptocracy" and it gives part of the bribery and protection money it collects to the Kremlin. Thus in February the American message in Russia reported in a memo.
Both the police and the State Security Service are pushing high protection money so that they can maintain their expensive standard of living in Moscow, as it is.
They collect money not only from legitimate businesses, but also from organised criminal gangs.
Every layer of bureaucracy - what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called "Vertical Authority" - takes its part of the money that the head moves up.
The memo sent under the name of Ambassador John Beyle to Washington was published on Tuesday by WikiLeaks on his homepage.
The memo is based on sources whose names have been edited.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still a Moscow mayor, and it accused him of corruption.
He was fired in October by President Dmitry Medvedev, but there is hardly any evidence that he would have been cleared in the meantime.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns a well-known construction company, have repeatedly rejected corruption proposals over the years, and he has won numerous complaints against such accusations.
In September, he explained to a Russian television broadcaster when he was asked for a documentation that suggested he was corrupt: "It's crazy, it's dirty, it's dirty."
> An incredibly large number of Russians believe that their society is corrupt.
But it is unusual that, as in the Ambassador's report, individuals are named, and it is not surprising that this is done by a diplomat of a foreign country.
"The direct link between the government of Moscow and the crime has led some to call it "distorted" and to the conclusion that the government acts more like a leptocrat than a government," says the memo.
"Criminal elements enjoy a "kryshna" (a concept from the world of criminals / the Mafia, which literally means "Dach" or protection), which extends to the police, State Security (FSB), the Service Supervisory Authority (MVD) and the Office of the Public Prosecutor as well as to the entire Moscow government bureaucracy.
Experts have discovered a three-dimensional structure within the criminal world of Moscow.
"Luzhkov stands for the Colonel's seat."
"FSB, MVD and the militia are on the second stage."
"Lastly, the ordinary criminals and the criminal inspectors follow at the lowest level."
"This is an incompetent system in which criminal groups close a gap in some areas because the city does not offer any help."
The report goes on to say that the FSB is cashing out of the biggest companies and that the police are arresting small business people.
A source, that is, "declared that Moscow's business owner understands that it is best to get protection from the MVD and FSB (and not from organised crime), because they have not only more weapons, resources and power than criminals, but also because they are protected by the law."
"For this reason, protection by criminal gangs is no longer asked as before."
The memo notes that while the collection of money is comprehensive, the protection itself is not very modest; even those who pay are sometimes arrested.
Those who do not pay will find their business closed very quickly - because of some advance.
Medvedev has repeatedly talked about combating corruption, but at the same time has noticed that he has made little progress.
The memo of the message contains descriptions of men going to the Kremlin with suitcases that were probably full of money.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev must rely on the bureaucrats," said Georgy Satarov, director of Indem, a Moscow expert commission, recently in an interview.
"But he's part of this bureaucracy."
"It is not part of the political class because a political class in Russia no longer exists."
Without politicians, without opposition, without separation of violence, he says, corruption is inevitable.
In fact, according to India, corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year.
The country rankings 154 of a more recent survey into the global perception of corruption by the non-State organization Transparency International (countries are listed from "minimum corruption" to "most corruption").
The revelation of the memo of the American message, which took place after Moscow late in the evening, will surely trigger errors within the Russian government, although since Luzhkov can be accused of the failure of Moscow, it can also be a possibility for the Kremlin to claim to solve the problems.
In an interview with Larry King for CNN, Putin claimed that the WikiLeaks documents could be a forgery and responded furiously to the revelation that American diplomats named him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth is that it is our interaction, which is an important factor in internal policy in this country," he said.
"But to be honest, we didn't expect this to happen with such arrogance, with such pressure and in such an unethical way, you know."
Khmer Rouge Veterans forced to face the past
In a weakly lit, accentuated classroom with dirty and defiant walls, the director of the Anlong Veng High School reminds the man who built it of the later Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader and he took care of his people," said Singh Kor Ma, 42 years old.
Because of his brutality during Khmer Rouge rule, the commander remains popular in this remote former Khmer Rouge-Hochburg in northwest Cambodia, where he built hospitals and bridges, developed the infrastructure and where thousands of former soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the capitalization of Khmer Rouge against the government, long-term supporters are challenged in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local truth and reconciliation forum allowed the victims to face public confrontation with the people who once supported the regime.
In June, the government distributed a school book that tells the history of Khmer Rouge for the first time children of former soldiers.
And in July a UN and Cambodian Community Tribunal condemned for the first time a former member of Khmer Rouge when it sentenced the former head of the notorious Tuol Slang torture chamber, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as the duke, to 35 years in prison.
With all of these developments, fear grew among Khmer Rouge veterans Alnlong Vengs, making efforts to reconcile and reintegrate into the society of Cambodia.
"There is still denial and fear in the former Khmer Rouge, but they have no power to do anything," said Chhang Youk, head of the Cambodian Documentation Centre, an independent organization that investigates the regime.
"For her life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"It splits families itself."
During the Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, 1.7 million people were estimated to have been executed or died of diseases, processing or hunger.
When the Vietnamese arrived and the Pol Pot-Ied government collapsed in 1979, the remnant of the regime and its military fled to the border of Cambodia to Thailand.
They spread here until December 1998, when the last movement capitalized, unrest.
When Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the Guerilla war from their base in the west of the mountains and jungles of Cambodia, Ta Mok brought the next generation to Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, when a 1993 UN-supported peace agreement led to the country's first democratic elections, large groups of Khmer Rouge started to take over to the government, leading to the capitals of Ieng Sary 1996 and Nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan 1998.
Pol Pot died in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had not survived, was arrested by government forces at the Dangrek Mountains in 1999.
He died in 2006 in Phnom Penh prison, where he waited for his trial.
When their graces no longer protected them, most former Khmer Rouge fighters fled into the devastating poverty of rural Cambodia and many kept the movement in nostalgic memory.
Even if a few elite officers of Khmer Rouge kept their local government posts because they dropped their weapons, the simple soldiers remained poor, untrained farmers.
"These people have only benefited very little from the capitulation," said Sok Leang from the Centre for Justice and Reconciliation, which holds public forums throughout Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
"They are anchored in the utopian agrarian ideology of the regime."
"They grow up without any professional knowledge."
Sor Lim, 55 years old, who had joined in 1974 as a teenager of the Rhmer Rouge, fought for Veng in the jungle before leaving in 1998 to lead a life as a poor traveler.
"Life under Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
"Ta Mok has given everyone something to eat."
"But now life is hard because we have to take care of ourselves."
The current Khmer Rouge Court has also caused concern here.
At the beginning of next year, the Court will try to bring Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sarah and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge Minister to trial.
The order of the Court is to condemn the old leaders and those who are primarily responsible for the atrocities, but it is not said whether it will pursue further acts beyond these four cases.
This has little to do with calming the fears in Anlong Veng.
Current media speculations have focused on the Chaem, 64 years old, which during the Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970s was district chief in the province of Manteay Meanchey.
In 2007, she had told the officials of the Cambodian Documentation Centre, she had led the construction of the Trapeang Thma Damms, a project that probably killed thousands of forced workers.
On a hot evening, I returned from work on the fields to her wooden house on a dirty street outside of Anlong Veng.
When the sun was long shadowed on the dried grass, it refused to discuss its past at Khmer Rouge.
If the court offered them, she would refuse to go, she said.
"Cambodsha lives in peace and stability," she said.
"If there were no more persecution, war would be here."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who escaped from Khmer Rouge in 1878, has also repeatedly warned that the situation would become uncertain, the court would accuse more suspects, although experts and historians are discussing this.
"Cambodsha must dig a hole and bury the past," he said.
But the confrontation with the past is what Cambodia needs to do in order to be able to move forward, Chhang Youk from the Documentation Centre said.
"Comparance with the Khmer Times means bringing together the broken pieces," he said.
"It is our duty to put these broken parts together, so that you can understand everything."
The centre created the first school book approved by the government on Khmer Rouge, the 75th "History of Democratic Cambodia".
It distributed the book in June in Anlong Veng as an annex to the history book for the high school of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four pages over the Khmer Rouge.
As often in Cambodia the young people in Anlong Veng know only a little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city's connections to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, a student at the Anlong Veng High School, said that the new school book helps students understand an important part of their history.
But his parents were skeptical when he brought the book home to read it.
"My family rejects many parts of the book and the court," he said.
"They're ridiculous because they're not sure how many people are condemned by the court."
Such resistance makes the reconciliation process complex and complex, Sok Leang said.
But the public forums, the school book and the court get to and from influence," he said.
The Khmer Rouge still has a powerful attraction here.
On top of the Dangreek mountains one leads a smoother and dusty road with plastic mulch to a rectangle of black rust, covered with a red sheet.
Paul Pot's body was burned here after his death in 1998 on a tire.
Noum Sothea, 31 years old, a mobile salesman on the street, said she didn't know much about the man who was burned here.
"But he has a strong spirit and many people here go to him to pray," she said.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday and later on the day she wanted to go to Pol Pot's last resting place where she's going to lay down a bush of mature bananas - in the hope that he'll bring her luck.
Belarus agrees not to collect any more weapons-enabled uranium
In a surprising victory for President Obama's campaign for global nuclear safety, the government of Belarus announced on Wednesday that it will no longer collect highly enriched uranium, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was announced in a joint statement following a meeting of Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton with the Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov in an additional article of the Security Summit.
The US government had been trying for years to convince Belarus not to collect highly enriched uranium and seemed to have reached a peak in the last spring.
However, officials of the U.S. government told Washington Post that two secret agreements had been reached with Belarus in the past two months to remove 187 pounds of weapons-resistant uranium from a Belarusian research facility.
This prepared the stage for the convention on Wednesday to remove the rest of the material - according to an official employee who remains anonymous due to the sensitivity of the theme, about 500 pounds.
The agreement seems to be one of the most important results of Obama's "Nuclear Summit of 47 Nations" in April, which had excluded Belarus.
And it was obviously good enough to ensure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the next summit in 2012.
"I was really excited about the fact that they wanted a seat in the nuclear safety summit (from 2012)."
"This proves to me that it works," said Ken Luongo, president of the Global Security Partnership, a group to promote nuclear security.
Clinton called the agreement "a very important, important step" by Belarus.
Obama promised in April 2009 in Prague to secure everything in four years' time.
Since then, the US government has helped six countries to release their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be the seventh.
A dozen countries did it under the government of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama's nuclear safety summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko stated that the nation will never give up its uranium.
"How to maintain highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilos, which is fundamentally weapons capable, and less enriched uranium," Lukashenko said at the time.
"This is our raw material... we won't make dirty bombs and we won't sell it to anyone."
"We only use it for research purposes, that's all."
However, Russia approached the United States a few months ago when it showed interest in the conclusion of an agreement.
The first move to remove the uranium from Belarus in October was particularly complicated because the material was easily distributed, officially said.
It was downloaded into a special suit, which more than 1,300 miles to a Russian plant for storage and disposal, officially said.
The second event was decided on Monday and was conducted according to the official by aircraft.
The US government pays $14 million for these efforts, with most of the money flowing into Belarusian research with weakly enriched uranium, which cannot be used for nuclear weapons.
"This was very carefully coordinated and agreed to build trust," said Andrew Bieniawski, a representative of the Ministry of Energy, who is working on global risk reduction.
The James Martin Center for Non-Performing Studies estimates that in this year, Belarus had at least 88 pounds of weapons-powered uranium and hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus intends to dissolve its stockholding under the Joint Agreement by 2012.
The relationship between Belarus and the United States has been strained for years, primarily because of the harsh disregard for human rights in Lukashenko.
But the status of Wednesday suggests a possible approach.
"The progress of these global security issues is welcome, the United States of America and Belarus announces that an increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central theme in improving bilateral relations and it is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens," it explains.
No objections from the Spanish government against CIA flights
The Spanish government had no objection to the CIA flights with Taliban and Al-Qaida prisoners over Spanish territory to Guantánamo, as reflected in a telegram by the ambassador of the U.S.A. in Madrid.
This reflects the documents forwarded by Wikileaks to the daily newspaper "El País" (by cable). It is added that former deputy government chief María Teresa Fernández de la Vega called for the Spanish government to be informed "to prove that foreign aircraft flying Spain are being properly monitored."
In June 2006, following the publication of a report by the Council of Europe, in which the aid for human rights-related practices in a thousand countries, including Spain, was charged, the former North American Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega discussed themselves.
The Deputy Head of Government stated that the Council's report "has met Zapatero in the absence" and confirmed that Spain has nothing to hide in this matter.
"De la Vega stressed, Spain has no objections to the secret service flights over Spanish territory."
"They just want to be informed," to not be "unprepared to be surprised," Aguirre told by cable.
Also the former Foreign Minister, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, pointed out to the ambassador that the Spanish government "does not want to pay much attention to this matter, although the government has little influence because they are in the hands of the judges."
In January 2007, the Public Prosecutor Vicente González informed the message that he would not block the right initiative, declassification of the documents of the Spanish Secret Service Centre (CNI) and the Minister of Defence on CIA flights.
"These reports do not contain any burdensome or sensitive information," the Ambassador explained after a discussion with the Public Prosecutor.
Nevertheless, the United States was more concerned about the "appearing coordination between the Spanish prosecutor and the German prosecutors" than about the classified information of the CNI and the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to deal discreetly with governments," Aguirre complained.
At a lunch in March 2007, where the US ambassadors and Spanish Interior Minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba took part, the latter commented that "although the Spanish judges are deeply concerned about their independence and do what they consider appropriate," he instructed his employees to avoid "explained rhetorical comments in order to overcome the tension."
The Ambassador also expressed concern about the conduct of the PP in this matter.
"Despite its general pro-American attitude, our experience teaches us that the PP will not doubt the fact that the government of Zapatero's actions in the United States that could have been subjected to human rights violations, tolerated or deliberately ignored, capital will be struck, even if these discoveries could have a negative impact on the US government," he said.
The child killer stood on the Internet complaining about the "museum" of the motherhood.
The young woman spoke of the child when he was already dead and she had a blog: "Terror in a Galactic Way"
Monica Juanatey Fernández is on the Internet "Muki".
Under this name, which she leads from small to small, she keeps with a cousin and at least a friend contact. Both come from Noia, a village in the province of La Coruña, where she was born.
The notifications are from 2008.
To understand this, you need to know your loved ones, who reconstruct the ABC daily newspaper based on testimony from their family members.
The 30-year-old Galician woman entered into a relationship with Iván Túñez, an industrial worker in 1998.
She was a year old.
Shortly after she had dissolved her relationship, she was known to be pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was from him, but his ex-wife never let him carry out a DNA analysis.
Soon she went into another relationship.
The choice was Alberto, a young man from Lousama, a neighboring community.
She lived with him for a long time.
César lived with them.
When the young woman went to the Balearic Islands to take care of herself in the labour market, the little girl stayed with her partner, who accompanied her to Palma for a week.
But from the contents of her messages, it can be concluded that their relationship broke and they separated.
In March 2008 she is alone at Menorca and writes: "Alberto is very peculiar and sadr because I came to work."
"When I told him, he found it good, but now he notices of course what it means to be alone with the boy all day long and not to be free, to do and let him do what he wants."
She later mentioned a message she just received on the phone: "I want you to come back this month or let me get an address that I can send you to."
She complains, "If he doesn't like me leaving the boy at my mother's, I'll pick him up when I'm back."
In May she says from the return to her village: "This week I will go there, but I will only stay there until the 19th, because I have to introduce myself to a job on the 20th, if I don't want to lose it."
She explains that she'll take her first birth if it's all right.
"He will be with whom he must be, that is, with me. Never in life will I leave him with someone other than my mother," a dubious intention when considering their bad relationship.
There's another mail in July.
When she writes this, it is assumed that the boy who came to the island on the 1st of the month and was allegedly murdered on the 10th.
"César is satisfied on the one hand, not on the other."
"One way he's with me and the place he likes a little, but the other way, he has to go to school every day."
She's talking about a move to Mallorca.
"There he (the boy) will visit a summer course, so I have less expenses for the baby girl."
On 17th: Memories and complaints.
"A giant kiss from César who asks me when you come."
"Alberto says he sent me some videos on the e-mail. You see, if he wants, he finds me, he's such a liar."
On the 30th again, "The boy is doing well. He's going to a summer trip to learn Catalan."
From Victor, her current partner, there is one: "He shoots money at me."
On the Internet, in anime and manga blogs, there are messages from her.
She even had her own blog in MySpace, which is now blocked, and in which she called herself "Muki, the prisoner's laser.
"Terror a la gallega (overwriting)".
The last man who was living with her, a hardened hunter, explains to have a bisces of conscience because he feels guilty.
He can't believe everything happened because she didn't tell him that she was a single mother.
Monica was transferred yesterday from the Centre for Prisoners to Menorca to Palma's provincial prison.
The defendant, Carlos Maceda, explained that she could not remember the outcome of the case, "and she did not intend to add damage to the small."
Before, however, she had stood up to drink César in the bathtub and to have his body in a suitcase.
Defence and public prosecutors applied for a psychiatric opinion.
Popular Party won 4 congress seats and PSC won 9
With the results of November 28, the PP could play a crucial role in the cities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona
Following the significant increase in voting and parliamentary power in the last regional elections, the PP has already taken a look at parliamentary elections - or not. Their expectations are more than positive, because the number of votes that this party achieves in these elections is usually twice as high as those in Catalonia.
In this way, the Catalan People's Party received 610.473 votes in the 2008 parliamentary elections, while this figure was only 316.222 in the 2006 regional elections.
On the last Sunday, the PPC reached 384.091 votes.
If this rising trend - the result of the conversion of the PSC's voting rate and the binding of the PP's election - should be maintained, the analysts of the PP predict that in the parliamentary elections, the PPC could rise from 8 to 12 congressional delegates, while CiU also won four (now 10) and the PSC would lose at least 9 (from 25).
These calculations demonstrate the fundamental importance of Catalonia for PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the People's Party, the ERC would lose a member - it currently has three - while ICV holds or could win one.
However, if the election calendar is maintained, the next date will fall with the municipal elections in May 2011. Also, the People's Party (PP) can be the tongue on the scale to prepare the socialist rule for an end, in four provincial cities and with its majority in the Barcelona City Council, one of the city's largest budget administrations: 661 million euros for 2011.
Both the nationalists and the People's Party agree that the PSC will lose the cities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the Socialists can neither achieve a majority nor return to their traditional allies (ERC and ICV).
After the Republican debacle, it is not surprising that this party will lose its representation in the municipality of Barcelona, in which it had to raise 5% of the votes.
On the other hand, the PP recorded an increase in its vote in the four provinces and could become the decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced that they can play the main role in Tarragona's revolution. There they had ruled before the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros, along with the PP.
A Lérida is only 500 votes behind the PSC. The mayor, Angel Ros, maintains good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during the last election they met several times.
In other important places, such as Badalona, Casteldefels or Reus, the People's Party was able to record a significant increase.
Currently, the PP is represented in 34 city administrations of Catalonia and aims to develop lists in as many places as possible.
The Catalan cell provided Al Qaida thousands of travel passes
In addition to the seven arrests in Barcelona, there were three others in Thailand
The seven Pakistani and Nigerian police officers, arrested by the Barcelona Police Department, formed the Thai-controlled dshihadist cells, the various Al Qaida groups, including the "Moving for the Liberation of Tamil Eelam" (LTTE) and "Laschkar e-Taiba" (Let) - the latter was the author of the Atentat in Bombay, who claimed the 2008 106 dead - with fists.
The Spanish Minister of the Interior has a major role to play in these investigations, so far as he is concerned, with the "Operation Kampai" being "weaked" and "so their ability to act" worldwide.
The researchers assume that in the two years in which the cells were active in Catalonia, thousands of passports were sent to Thailand, where they were faked and then sent to the groups from which the criminal galaxy Al Qaida was composed, so that their "combatants" could go beyond the borders of European and other Western countries without penalty.
The discovered cell is not the only Dishhadist network that has been active in Europe. Therefore, other European police units have also been involved in the investigation, with the exception of the Thai investigation agencies, and it is not to be excluded that similar attacks will occur in the EU in the next few days, such as those carried out in Barcelona last Tuesday.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigerian Babaounde Agunbiade were arrested) another was carried out in Thailand where Pakistani Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt were arrested as well as the Thai Syrianslaya Kijbumrumung.
They had led Bangkok out of the cells in Spain and other European countries.
The Catalan network - part of which was destroyed in 2009 - in particular, stole tourist passports according to the so-called "International Islamic Front".
This means that the documents on the names of men aged 25 to 45 were issued and had to be valid for several years; they were not allowed to bear visa marks.
In the investigation, it will be stressed that until now no connection has been established between the arrests in Catalonia and the assassination in Bombay, although the author of this attack, "Laschkar e-Taiba", was one of the recipient groups of the stolen and then fake travels in Thailand.
However, it should be recalled that a few days before the assassination of Catalonia, several thousand dollars were sent through a money transfer company, which were "invested" in the purchase of prepaid cards for mobile phones, which were later used by members of the "commando", which was prepared for the lives of 106 people.
The police have seized extensive documentation.
PP requires a meeting of the tax agreement by Mas
The President of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, took the opportunity to personally present her terms of reference to Artur Mas to support his entry as Prime Minister of the Generalitat, which are not different from those already held during the election and can be summed up with the priority of economic recovery and the decline of regionalist independence constituents, as a financial compensation agreement which the regionalist leader wishes to propose at the height of his mandate.
The president of the Catalan People's Party turned to Artur Mas, who gave her the 18 MPs she had won on the last Sunday - a figure that is more than enough to feel unstoppable. For the candidate from the Ciu civil-regionalist party, it is pointed out that at least one of the opposition parties is included in the vote at his entry to the vote.
The future alliances that the regionalists want to join in the upcoming parliamentary elections in Congress depend on a possible agreement with the PP. However, the talks, which are taking place with the rest of the parties, are turning around in Catalonia.
As far as the PPC is concerned, it calls for "all talks relating to the sovereignty and independence of Catalonia" as well as an agreement on the financial compensation between the State and the autonomous region - similar to in the Basque country - and the party leader of the CIU even wants to submit a referendum.
Both political leaders are aware that they make the proposed political apparatus of regional administration easier and want to abolish inheritance and gift taxes.
With the details of the negotiations on the entry of Mas, the PPC Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat are concerned.
Mas has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who announced a strong opposition - and Joan Herrera (ICV). Today he will meet with Joan Puigcercos (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The old-age shelter confirms that deaths are not due to "missing measures"
The owners of the old house in Olot do not conclude that their manager killed eleven older people
The managers of the old nursing home La Caritat in Olot (Gerona) gave a press conference yesterday, in which they exposed the damage to the criminal acts Joan Vila Dilmés - the manager who had killed at least eleven old people he was responsible for during his work - the institution added.
The head of the nursing home, Joan Sala, joined his lawyer, Joan Cañada, and announced that "La Caritat wants to accuse the responsible (for the death of the victims)", but "the law and our obligation of liability compels us to accept the process and civil liability".
The institution has to take not only a social loss because it had not detected the criminal acts of the manager in time, but also now pay a high amount of compensation calculated by the legal representatives of the family members of the victim.
Joan Vila Dilmé said that the first crime would come back to August 2009 and that he had been killed since then.
The judge arranged for the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the nursing home - since he suspected that no doctor had examined the dead personally, but the formalities were developed by telephone due to their age and diseases.
La Caritat’s head of state derailed this point and declared that “the remaining measures could never have been the reason for the events.”
La Caritat's lawyer added that "there was no indication in the dispute of anyone else's prompt actions other than the accused."
The man who was already a "dead angel" was killed yesterday eleven murders and declared that the first crime was committed on August 29, 2009 and that half a month later the second old lady was murdered.
In this case, he killed with an overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime in which he had given a mixture of various anti-inflammatory drugs.
The director of La Caritat explained that the access of staff to the drugs was only difficult to control.
The insulin syringes and the restorative cocktail were used by the caregiver for six of nine crimes committed in order to free the patients with death from their suffering.
But the results of the laboratory investigations will show whether Vila is lying and actually chose a less cruel death for his first victim or whether he burned it out from the inside by handing them a leechlous, as he had made it out of three women, who he murdered between 12 and 17 October.
In La Caritat, there is no belief in the manager's statements, not even with regard to the number of murders that could be quite more. This statement is justified by the fact that Vila had made very different statements before the court and that it makes no sense to change his behavior after eight successful murders suddenly.
They say they made themselves available on this basis and to clarify the scope of these cases of justice.
The European Central Bank (ECB)’s threats
The investors responded yesterday to the threat of the ECB President Trichet, who warned that "the markets should not underestimate our reaction assets."
The risks of euro periphery countries have increased dramatically and the shares of European banks have increased by more than 5%.
At the same time, we should not underestimate the possibility that the ECB may be fooled and that the euro has little to do with issues that cause concern.
The events of yesterday are typical of an ilicid market, which, to the extent that it collapses, recovers, however, due to the closure of short and high speculative positions.
The institutional investor will not for a long time lose his fear.
Today, one month ago, the European Central Bank called on us to withdraw our liquidity measures, to which the ECB must make a retreat for the fourth time in two years tomorrow, and probably a few more times in the future.
The Bundesbank called for the end of the plan for the purchase of State debts, since they were ineffective, as well as the abolition of all exceptional liquidity measures.
Following the Irish crisis, we expect the current liquidity measures to be extended "at least until March" and the quarterly calls with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity will be maintained until at least June.
We also expect that the programme for the purchase of bonds will continue and a strong signal will be issued.
If the created expectations are not met, the excellent response of the markets will be rejected from yesterday and if we are persistently insisting on taking back our liquidity measures, only God can help us!
As well as at the ECB meeting in May, in which the Bank confirmed not to take into account the purchase of public debt and the markets to do so, this story could be repeated tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and sustainable.
In May she showed the teeth and on Wednesday she said that she had bought a lot already, causing a new collapse of the market.
Yesterday, the auction of one-year state titles in Portugal was quite weak.
The state asset management accounted for only 500 million to 5.28%, compared with 750 million to 4.81% in the previous auction.
Nevertheless, the interest rates in Portugal fell by 30 basis points throughout the curve and thus reflected a change in market perception according to the words of Trichetes.
In Ireland the figures of Allied and Bank of Ireland debt gap were published.
The sum is estimated to be about 10 000 million in the short term and possible additional 15 000. There is time until February to acquire private capital or these banks are made public.
Although Ireland has lost its credibility completely after it had not recognized the problem with the stress test in July, the figures in the rescue plan are acceptable and help to reduce uncertainty.
However, on Tuesday, the government must receive parliamentary approval of its new budget, and since it still does not have sufficient support, Ireland is still a source of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has made her speech more moderate on the summit of the Heads of State and Government on 14 December. There is a political unity asked to show that we play the same score together.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the other countries the ninth symphony Beethovens.
The Spanish President presented yesterday the plan of action to be adopted by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Rent reform, transparency in the autonomous regions, as well as in the financial institutions, the reduction of the state deficit, liberalisation, privatization and employment measures.
The double effect of Zapatero and Trichet explains why the Spanish stock exchange has increased by 4.5 percent, doubles as much as the rest of the European stock exchange.
Compared to February, the reaction of the government and the Spanish central bank was fast and convincing, and we benefit from the surprise effect.
Today there is a significant auction of a three-year government bond that will benefit from the Trichet effect. That is why we call for a strong demand that will eliminate all doubts about our indictability.
For Spain, the request for an aid plan would be a self-defence sacrifice.
We would get liquidity that we don't need. The treasure has 40 billion euros available, three times as much as in March. The interest rates are extremely expensive and access to the markets would be endless.
Nevertheless, our strategy should be in line with the Moto Caesar's wife: "Now not only the Being but also the Light."
It's just courage, we're doing it!
At the request of his children, the Chairman of the Board of Directors of Eulen called for the Social Assembly of Vega Sicilia
The storm in the open conflict of the family Álvarez, owner of the companies Eulen and El Enebro, does not float.
David Álvarez, founder of the company's gurpey, will challenge the company's meeting of El Enebro, which will take place at the request of five of his seven children on the 16th, since he considers them "absolutely worthless". His children will be tried to receive a majority to control the management bodies of the company - owner of the winery Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Álvarez and his children Jesús David and María José are preparing the legal measures for a new chapter of justice in their struggle to control a part of the group.
The founder of the largest holding for business services does not appear to be prepared to submit in his legal dispute to the control of the authorities of El Enebro.
He was expelled from the Board of Directors by five of his seven children, who were appointed as members of the Board of Directors at the shareholders' meeting on 18 January this year, which has already been registered in the Trade Register.
The meeting of El Enebro, which was convened by the judge of the Court of Commerce No. 2 of Madrid for the 16th time, triggered a new thunderstorm at the head of the Álvarez family.
The summons of the judge to call the assembly is the only legal way to ensure that the assembly is called up.
The last strategy of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta y Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz will be recognized by David Álvarez as a "debtful means of the applicants - his five children - in order to be able to recognize the assembly which was declared void on 18 January, by means of legal stipulations, fraud and abuse of law, as official speakers.
This argument is the basis for the attack of the assembly in the background to declare it "absolutely void".
These same protagonists, who hide in discreet silence, have already tried unsuccessfully in June to convene a meeting in the right way.
At El Enebro - property company and holders of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, in addition to other assets - David Álvarez' seven children control 100 percent of the capital.
On the other hand, according to family protocols, the founder of the service group calls for the right of use of 51% of the capital.
This is the actual background of the case that the judge has decided in the hearing to deal with the complaint for which a date has not yet been set.
Red Bull wins in the F1 with a secret weapon from Siemens
The cars are improved with a real-time software.
Since Red Bull entered the world of Formula 1, its history has been marked in this read universe by the speed of surprises and successes.
At first, no one gave the new attention and despite his steady rise in value during the last season, all at the end of November, all at the victory of the Ferrari of Fernando Alonso.
Without the ability of the German pilot and world master Sebastian Vettel or the power of the engine of Renault, the "Geheim weapon", which the Multi Siemens Red Bull put into his hands, and thus created a victory team, became a legend.
In fact, it is a powerful software for the simulation of processes that led the German company to market for purposes that do not have to do with authors.
This software program, known as PLM, was used for the development of assembly chains in factories around the world, energy works and high-precise instruments.
A reliable reproduction or simulation of a product or process is intended before it is actually built to avoid errors and excessive costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of the cameras of Canon, the planes of Sukhoi and the most famous vehicles of Nissan.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of Siemens' industrial department, explains that using this software in Formula 1 - Factory Red Bull "in a few hours, almost in real time" can design and implement the changes and improvements that are identified on the race and in the tests.
Russwurm argues that in 1992, on average, ten technicians worked in the stations, who were able to introduce up to three or four improvements in a season.
In the Red Bulls team today, 180 highly qualified young people are employed. With powerful EDV systems, they carry out analyses and any possible changes to the racing car.
The Siemens Manager explained that the PLM software is able to analyze and improve all components of the Red Bull racing car, with the exception of the engine for which Renault is solely responsible.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are amended.
The changes can be transmitted within less than 24 hours from the virtual reality of the simulator to reality thanks to advanced production facilities and high-tech autoclaves.
The only limit set by this crazy technical perfectionism is the 40 million dollars that a Formula 1 team can spend on its winnings in a season.
Red Bull has built its high-tech factory for the development and manufacture of its racing cars in a 50-mile-long place from London.
It is two buildings in which visits - especially by journalists - are very limited.
Everything that's going on there is Top Secret.
The team includes 580 people, including the two pilots, the World Master Vettel and Mark Webber.
But Red Bulls true Formula 1 - hero is undoubtedly the latest world champion Sebastian Vetell.
Behind the enormous technological resources that the energy-drink manufacturer places in the services of its participation in the race, further protagonists, whose support is invaluable and their recognition is zero.
The director of the work, Steve Nevey, stressed that five years ago, it was still possible to say that the progress in the F&E area for racing cars was 50 percent in the win and the pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today, the share values have changed. Technology accounts for 85 percent of the success, while the pilot's contribution is estimated to 15 percent.
Nevey admits that Vettel and Webber can never be replaced by EDV because they are "unpredictable gladiators".
HP will open twenty-one shops with local distributors in two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) visited his first exclusive shop in Barcelona yesterday in collaboration with his partner Ront Reyes.
It is the first of a sales network consisting of twenty shops with 80 to 100 square meters each intended to open the multi in the next two years in Spain.
The company agrees this initiative with the existing 16 sales areas in the wholesale industry, such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The deputy president of HP España, Helena Herrero, called for example the refurbished cargo at the Gran Vía in Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, who has been working with HP for thirty years.
The North American Group intends to set up 200 sales outlets in Europe by 2010 including 20 divestments in Spain.
The first week was dedicated to Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia). Barcelona is the third business.
Herrera did not want to talk about the coming new openings, but did not conclude that Madrid could be the next target.
The vice-president, who is also the head of HP Personal Systems, assured that the philosophy of loading was always the same. It is based on a local distributor with experience and industry knowledge.
The North American Group advises this and takes over the exclusive charging equipment (with interactive products to be used).
HP is also responsible for training the loading staff.
Helena Herrero said that it was not a Franchising system and that the exclusive sales network was intended to "optimize the customer service and the advice of small and small companies when shopping and then even the packaging."
The loading in Barcelona has a pioneering pilot program that solves the technical problems of HP devices with warranty.
An online service builds a connection to the technical centre in Maastricht (Holland).
"In this way we can solve problems in ten minutes that sometimes take up to two days."
"This system has been developed in particular for small and medium-sized enterprises as well as private customers, because large companies already have their technical customer service contracts," Helena Herroro said yesterday.
Sabadell wants his rivals in three years a million customers 'klauen'
Banco Sabadell's managerial board member, Jaime Guardiola, is more optimistic than other managers. He believes that 2001 will be a hard year for the banks, but first a new liquidity crisis and forecasting the end of the debt war.
However, it foresees a break in the interest rates that banks are trying to offset with increases in fees and in the price of loans.
Sabadell expects to receive a million private customers in three years - a subject that still exists.
Sabadell has found the way to spend the next three years, and thus to survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The Bank will introduce a new three-year management plan in 2011.
The objective is not only to survive, but also to increase the market share of a million private customers - 700 000, if the customers who lose the bank are withdrawn - that is the great challenge facing this bank, because so far it has paid more attention to its business customers than to its private customers.
This year it has received 250 000 private customers and 50 000 companies.
Its market share for private customers is 3.5 per cent, while business customers account for more than 10 per cent.
Another principle of the 2011-2013 business plan is to increase productivity, speak austerity, cost reduction. The challenges facing the bank will be presented together with the annual final report.
Only a few banks dare to set and publish targets in these difficult times, as through the financial crisis all the plans of the banks have come together.
Sabadell will conclude this year's four-year lead plan Optima. It was originally designed for three years, but due to the market situation, it was extended for a business year.
The customers who leave the savings are the bank's main target.
With a breakfast organised by the APIE, Guardiola stressed, 2011 would be a "hard" year "with a large range".
The manager assumes that Spain only "slow" comes out of the crisis.
It would also be "very difficult", in two or three years "to create work" - fundamental for the survival of the banks.
Even if it appears that the war on Passiva - which is punishable by interest margins - will run out, the risk allocations that banks and savings have to pay for their emissions to maintain liquidity will have to be paid as compensation for falling profits at the credit price.
"The topics of liquidity and financing are structural and they will exert pressure on credit."
"We haven't turned the hill, but the interest differentials are very high," said Guardiola.
Banesto already issued the order on its branch network on Thursday to restrict the granting of long-term loans and increase interest differentials (cf. Cinco Días of 22 and 27 November).
The manager also agreed that the banks were currently pursuing the Stategy "to increase the fees", however "within a framework marked by competition".
Sabadell's plan is based on organic growth, even if the group, as always, does not exclude corporate business.
It does not, however, ensure that in Spain "larger companies are necessary."
"In the coming year everything will change," he assures.
He emphasises that the need for capital is currently "absorbing" and does not conclude that some Spanish financial institutions will be abolished in red numbers.
He is of the opinion that FROB could replace the monetary market when capital is invested.
After ensuring that Sabadell can also survive a temporary closure of the markets, he removes the argument of some bankers who are already predicting a new liquidity crisis.
He stressed that there was nothing to be done, but that, unlike the events in June, it was possible to obtain short-term financing through repossessions and thus overcome the crisis.
CECA excludes a second fusion wave of the savings boxes
The Director-General of CECA, José Antonio Olavarreita, yesterday rejected the possibility of a merger wave of the savings banks and stressed the speed with which the sector will be restructured.
When the concentration process of the Spanish Sparks began, several Sparks failed to participate in the first phase. They held the second round.
On the other hand, the Director-General of the Spanish Stock Exchange Association (CECA), José Antonio Olavarreita, assured that this second round would not take place.
"I believe that most of the mergers are completed. The involvement of Cajasol in the Banca Cívica group cannot be seen as a second round, but it was more about adaptations."
"The main part is completed. It may be that we have instead of seventeen or fourteen, but all important processes have already been completed. They have been controlled by Banco de España, who has supported all the operations strongly."
In a breakfast organised by the Adea Manager and Manager of Aragon, Olavarrieta said that the concentration process "was completed as quickly as possible and that we must be satisfied with the time-limit, which was not now established in the context of the business plans with Banco de España", he stressed.
"The transition from 45 savings with an average of 28 000 million assets to 17 with 75 500 million is a historically unparalleled process. The number of financial institutions has been reduced by 62 percent and they are now much larger, so we have fulfilled the Basel Agreement," he said.
Olavarrieta stated that "there were a number of unfavourable opinions about the slowness of the process, the inseriousness and insanity" because "Banco de España encourages us to conclude the deadline before the end of the year."
The Director-General of CECA, José Antonio Olavarreita, yesterday assured that Spain has one of the most rigorous financing systems in Europe and "maybe" throughout the world and added that those who doubt this "without deeper knowledge".
The manager noted that in the current economic context, we need to make "no concern" about the situation of financial institutions and savings that have undergone a "very important" concentration process that will be completed "as quickly as possible".
He also recalled that the Spanish banks had very well maintained the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July.
Zapatero and the red line of Germany
Berlin has decided to maintain the euro, but at the same time, conditions for the whole European Union.
The tensions on the markets have triggered a double response from the government.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has introduced new adaptation measures, starting with tax reductions for small and medium-sized enterprises, the regulation of time-consuming enterprises, or the abolition of the 426 Euro support for unemployed people, which do not cover unemployment, up to 49 per cent of AENA, the management of the airports Barajas and El Prat and 30 per cent of the state lottery.
On the other hand, the Deputy Head of Government, Elena Salgado, with the help of former President Felipe González, supports the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel as responsible for the current crisis.
How are these actions to be understood?
It was assumed that Markel's position was not an error in his public work.
On the contrary, it is a new round in the difficult process of redefining the euro.
Germany is taking a fundamental new perspective for the design of our future, which coincides with the maintenance of the ancient traditions of a large part of its partners.
In view of Europe's resistance, Germany is beginning to speculate on three possible ways out of the crisis.
The first: a strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the south had to leave the euro area.
The second is that the reintroduction of the German Mark - although it sounds more like science fiction - is supported by a majority of the public opinion, about 50 percent of the population.
The third is the conversion of the euro in line with German proposals, which means more macro-economic control; strict budgetary management; penalties for countries that exceed the deadlines; possibly the payment of some countries and the extension of the costs of potential adjustment measures in the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been shown for some time. That is why there are no excuses now.
At first in 2009, both the IMF and the European Commission were encouraging deficits, and the German government took a constitutional reform from the arm to prevent this from 2016.
This was the first sign of the inter-operation between what Germany considered necessary (strict tax plans and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France.
The second sign put the Central European country out as a scarf to the decision to save Greece.
But the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public and the published opinion was absolutely against a salvation of Greece.
Finally, in the last few days of October, Merkel comes out again with a clear position, calling for a reform of the European Union's agreements to enable a country to save and at the same time oblige private lenders to bear part of the costs.
This position has been set up as an anti-European, since it drives the Irish crisis and all the following.
But her proposal was adopted, even though it was a pleasure, and in the coming months we will be participating in the reform of the European Union, which will allow for these measures from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that does not think to exceed.
It is clear to everyone that, even if unaccompanied measures must now be taken, the old way of functioning of the euro will no longer exist from that date.
2013 will be the year of birth of a new currency area in which the opposing countries are severely punished, forcing them to declare themselves indemnity and, in this case, the private sector must take part of the cost.
Germany shows us that we need to put in place a hard growth rate, with high savings and investment rates, consumption measurement, productivity improvement and competitiveness as well as positive external balances.
The other alternatives, based on debt and construction with huge gaps in the balance of payments, as indicated by Spain in booming times, will simply not be taken away.
The offer is clear.
And we'd do a bad job not to understand it.
It is not just about lowering the state deficit by three percent by 2013.
The demands are much harder.
And the worst we can do under these conditions is to deceive ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will go to more rest.
And that we will use the opportunities offered to us until spring 2013.
Zapatero seems to have understood this too, and his double announcement (the promised reforms after the discussion with the large companies last Saturday and the announcement of new measures yesterday) indicates that despite the criticism of Merkel the hypothesis to create order in his own house has been prepared.
But the red line drawn from Germany is there, and it doesn't seem that something would change.
Under the options considered, we should not exclude the euro area which we have left with very few serious countries.
In this case Germany could still tell us that it warned us.
Sports and entertainment
Tricks like that of Alonso and Ramos in the game against the Ajax show the spirit of invention, but not the will to commit a penalty.
The alleged exclusion of two players from the Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the game of November 23 against the Ajax in the Champions League led to the fact that a lot of ink was wasted on whether it was an unsportable act or not and whether both players should be punished by UEFA.
As is generally known, the two players lost a few minutes before playing (his team had already made clear) time and played several fools so that the judge showed them the second yellow card.
In this way, and since the Real Madrid would lead its group, the two players will meet the prescribed penalty in the next league game against the auxerre and thus enter the next game phase without cards.
Finally, the UEFA Disciplinary Committee punished the club coach José Mourinho with two games and the players involved with different amounts of money.
The provocation of a yellow card under such or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is more often to be found in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the Ethos - the unwritten but in this kind of sport - rules.
Part of the ongoing debate on the case is that a team of the football club Real Madrid (which presented in its Hymne Noble Mot and Honor and on other occasions had punished its players for similar events) played the main role, and on the dramatization by Maurinho, who added an episode to his long history as theatrical and provocative technician.
In any case, the debate focuses on whether these behaviours that are not expressly prohibited by the statutes are contrary to the principles of sport, that is to say whether these actions constitute a rule of law.
In this regard, the damage caused by the sport spirit should be investigated.
The sports spirit defends the physical integrity of the opponents, an aspect that was not threatened by these actions, because it was not an aggressive game.
Another aspect of a clean game is to avoid the anti-trafficking players taking unfair advantage of the team.
The paradox of the action of the players of Real Madrid is that it does not match what we normally understand under false play or rule, because the circumvention of the rule has not been completed secretly in order to avoid a penalty, but it should be as reprehensible as possible to punish it by the judge.
The players waited and accepted the penalty gladly.
Another question is what kind of advantage the opponents of the deliberate fraud.
Here it should be pointed out that the rival was neither put into a less unfavourable position nor the benefits for the game played, because the obvious result of this action was that the own team had to continue playing with fewer players.
It is also not a useful strategy for the next game, because the club then does not have these players.
The advantage is obviously that the players start the next game phase of the Champions League without cards that could threaten their participation in a future game.
But it is a long-term, to a certain degree unknown advantage, as the team could sometimes also be separated. Furthermore, players with this procedure receive a penalty and go over in the second card cycle, in which they are separated by a card with a card less than in the first cycle.
It is not so clear whether this really is an advantage.
Finally, such actions are not directed against the sports spirit, which also includes strategic decisions in order to benefit the greatest possible benefit from the rules.
In this case, the players did not want to be punished (that would actually be a clear case of compliance), they wanted to choose rather when they submitted to it.
They made a strategic decision not to avoid or to flee before a penalty.
Although the boundaries between the gift of invention and the environment are confused, I believe that this is a clear case of the gift of invention.
I have the impression that the controversy has arisen due to two factors: because it was about two self-conclusions and because of the nature of the caused transfer of the rule.
The damage added to the principles of sport by these actions is less ethical than much aesthetic.
Offering Fenfensive for groups weekend evenings in Barcelona
This year, the dictatorship of the calendar will allow a wave of reservations to fall on 16 and 17 December.
The holidays paid by employees themselves spread out. They do not want to spend more than 20 to 30 euros.
Like the Turrón and the Christmas lottery, in the Christmas season, there are also group dinners that lead to Barcelona's hostel and leisure oxygen. But because of the economic crisis, they trigger a price-fensive solution to include the customer segment that represents the large mass: almost all want to spend between 20 and 30 euros for a lunch or dinner, the companies and associations in question confirm.
In order to make the booking even more complicated, the calendar (silvester falls on a Friday) has left all orders in the week of December 13th, with the result of a layer of dinner reservations on two peak days (the 16th and 17th) and almost no orders in the week.
Since 2008, when the bad times began, many companies have set up group dinners for budgetary reasons.
In order not to give up this tradition, many employees pay these out of their own pocket.
As is always the case, low prices are required, confirmed by the chairman of the Barcelona Hospital Board, Gaietà Farrás.
The representative of the summit is not waiting to predict what the holidays will look like this month.
"People think it'll be ten times before they book."
"They would like to go out, but they look hard at the prices," he stresses.
The business will go well with those who offer "quality at good prices with a good service", he adds, and calls on us to remember that customers are saving in times of crisis, so prices are asked at 25 euros the most.
In an investigation into various central restaurants, it appears that the evening of December 17 brings the suppliers to the collapse.
The group Soteras says that the requests for this Friday with the intention of spending less than 30 euros would be booming. The group has adapted its menus with complete offers between 25 and 35 euros to the economy.
In another leading group, Andilana, which holds 16 guest places in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), has led the property of the calendar to pre-reservations, even from the beginning of November.
"We have made it impossible to maintain the previous year's prices with menus for each taste from 19,95 to 30 euros," he explains.
At AN Group, led by El Mussol, Attic, QuQ and a total of 23 locals, there is no loss of optimism after the revenue has been re-flowered and good since the second quarter, even if the prospects for the Christmas business are not met for a few days.
Sources of the company group argue that the 18 will also be an overactive day with friends celebrating Christmas.
A Christmas menu was added to the six groups menu for 30 euros or more than price hot. It seems that customers are ready to spend 10 percent more than in the previous year and want more details on the contrary, such as Cava.
Also in some companies you see green sprays spraying, so the employees are invited back. This makes it seem that the groups are back in the process.
The chairman, Enric Gomà, trusts to see the end of the tunnel and notes that the reservations are quite "living" at all, although the customers "exhaust a maximum".
The fun at the celebration, however, did not go back, no matter who paid.
Pakistan's nuclear programme is of great concern in the United States
Islamabad puts nuclear weapons "faster than any other country".
Discoveries of Wikileaks confirm relations between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the North American Embassy in Pakistan and the U.S. State Department, revealed by the Internet portal Wikileaks confirms the enormous concerns the Pakistanian nuclear programme in Washington.
On the edge of clear and jubilant details, which offer the documents on the content of the talks and the thinking of accredited North American diplomats in Islamabad, they reveal that cooperation between the two countries in matters of atomic security is not strengthened, but rather "removes", and that the unstable Asian country produces more nuclear weapons "to a faster rhythm than any other country".
In particular, the nature of the Pakistani nuclear programme - that the weapons are not put together, but their parts are stored in order to make their destruction difficult in a possible attack - Washington prepares sleepless nights.
The following risks include the Ambassador in Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, in a report prior to the visit of the former head of the National Security Council, James Jones, "The proximity of some nuclear installations to the area attacked by the Taliban, the probable spread of nuclear material and the susceptibility of transport of nuclear material".
The large number of people implicated in the nuclear power stations and missile programmes will not only be seen by the US, but also by Russia as the reason to be cautious.
"Pakistan needs to set up strictly religious personnel to monitor nuclear installations; due to the low level of education and culture, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who work on nuclear or missile programmes," said Yuri Korolev from the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs in a discussion with his North American colleagues.
New to the documentation revealed by Julian Assanges Internet Portal is that cooperation between the US and Pakistan in nuclear proliferation is lagging behind and the increased pace in which Pakistan is producing nuclear weapons.
In May, by an office of the message, which describes communication with Pakistan as "frustrating", it is stated: "There is often no transparency; we do not receive answers on aid offers or they are rejected."
In another communication, Peter Lavoy, the official of the State Secret Service for South Asia, confirms that "in spite of the economic disaster Pakistan is producing nuclear weapons as quickly as no other country."
Ambassador Patterson asks Washington during a visit by the chief army leader, General Ashbænd Kayani, to "clear the responsible," that "Pakistan's Army has its silent support for terrorist groups."
On the hunt for Wikileaks Chief
Obama appoints a high responsibility for the fight against terrorism to prevent new discoveries.
Interpol provides a red warning for the persecution and invention of Assange.
Everything associated with Wikileaks and its founder, Jullian Assange, is a complicated labyrinth, in which the facts are only difficult to explain.
Yesterday, Interpol issued a "red warning" for "suffering and persecution" of Assange.
However, this is not a traditional procedure for arrest.
Besides, she's not new, she's from November 20th.
It also has nothing to do with the last revelation of over four million diplomatic documents from the United States, but with the charges of sexual abuse to which the Australian must be in Sweden.
Furthermore, the lawyer of the founder of Wikileaks, Mark Stephens, assures "the police knew where and how they could contact Mr. Assange."
Already on 20th, the International Police Office, with its seat in Lyon (France), issued the order on request of Sweden, but it was not announced until yesterday after the Swedish authorities were given the authority.
This is the case. The 188 Interpol countries are assigned to identify and discover assangs to "to temporarily detect and deliver them."
Although Interpol cannot arrange for the arrest of a person affected by a red warning, many Member States consider the red alert as a free letter for arrest - which must be carried out by the national police - especially if they have a bilateral delivery agreement, as is the case with Sweden and England, where Assange is likely to be present.
The action was carried out by Assange's lawyers, who publicly published a letter informing them that the 39-year-old founder of Wikileaks is ready to answer the questions of the Swedish authorities by videoconference.
They also remember that Assange applied for an exit from Sweden and was compared to the state attorney Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, the security chief of Stalin, who was granted the appropriate authorisation.
"It is like a hunt, not like a legal persecution," it is stated in the letter.
While the world is looking for him - and his mother from Australia admires her son's innocence - Assange is standing in an unknown place, however, does not hesitate.
On Monday, he gave the head of the magazine Time by Skype from an unspecified place for an interview. During the interview, he applied for the resignation of the U.S. Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be proved that it was responsible for the organisation of North American diplomats to spy out the UN and thus violated international agreements signed by the United States, it had to retreat," he said.
His opinion was condemned yesterday by the Press Secretary of the White House, Robert Gibbs, who described the application as "synthetic and absurd".
"I'm not sure why we should put value to the opinion of a guy with a website," he explained to the CNN sender.
Obama himself has commissioned a high responsibility for the anti-terrorism campaign, Russell Travers, with the prevention of new document disclosures.
The attempt by President Barack Obama to pay less attention to Assange is contrary to the views expressed by conservative politicians and commentators in these days.
Congressman Peter King, who will be chaired by the National Security Committee of the House of Representatives from January, has invited the State Department to investigate the possibility of putting Wikileaks on the list of terrorist organizations, "to seize their funds and to prosecute anyone who supports them or makes a contribution."
Tom Flanagan, adviser to Canadian President Stephen Harper, was still going on, and he had to revoke his statement that Assange had to be "killed".
"Obama had to turn him into a target disc and use an unmanned aircraft or something."
Whoever did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, Baptist minister, former Governor of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate.
"Whoever has ever been able to secure information in the government, he is guilty of betrayal and everything that is not directed, is one too mild penalty," he explained to the sender Fox.
Puigcercos is looking for the close peace of the Carod in the ERC
The Republican leader shall allow the party to vote in secret on its continuing office.
Huguet proposes a more pluralistic government and the end of the assembly principle.
Joan Puigcercos seems to have found a recipe to get out of the way for the tenth time an internal riot in the ranks of 11 MPs after the loss and half of the voters' votes in the direction of the ERC.
The Chairman is aware that his threat of withdrawal is not enough for the supporters of former leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira. But he also knows that the influence of this sector is as weak today as its mentor and he will not be protected by the same head fractures as other former currents.
Therefore, the leader of Esquerra tries to win the new critics with a eyebrow, which would ensure his position until the next municipal elections.
Earlier yesterday, it was announced that over 200 regional members of the Council of the ERC could speak secretly about their stay in the office.
With electoral records, not with raised hand.
If the charodists wanted to pass a criminal list on to the president, they could do so without having to fear reprisals.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid both the impression of separation and the impression of undermining among his staff.
In several interviews he confirmed that he would feel half the votes plus one not confirmed, and he added no percentages, a result "in Bulgarian style" would not be good either.
The Carods are asking the President to make more than the party's office available. An insufficient gesture, as Puigcercos controls the top organ of the congress.
However, since they do not have a sufficient majority to force retreats, they will be agreed with the Board on a plan of action from now until May.
To this end, they expect to be able to participate in the preparation of the document on strategic umorisation, which will be put to the vote on 18th of the Council.
Its intention is to provide for Puigcercos. On the contrary, it is to promise to present to the Congress in the autumn of 2011 what the party summits already consider to be a fact.
The chairman of the ERC is the opinion that "polyphony" damages stability, and he strives to get the organization to wash their dirty laundry behind closed doors for all times.
In this sense, the article that the acting adviser Josep Huguet signed in his blog is symptomatic.
Given that Puigcercós is an ideologist, the owner of Innovací took it for a fact that the Chairman of the party will be supported "in exchange for various objectives".
He counted five of them in front of them.
First of all, the "restructuring" of the board to represent at least 90 per cent of the members of the board, which means the inclusion of new faces from Carod's environment.
The second could be the great novelty.
Huguet suggests that the ERC should finally give up the principle of assembly as a way of operation.
He therefore advocates a reform of the statutes, which will allow the Congress to hold with elected delegates.
From the end of the full-session model - an exception in the Spanish party system - Puigcercós' team has already been fighting for the last two congresses as occupied.
In fact, at the 2008 meeting, the holding of the party with the review of the principle of assembly was commissioned at a convention to deal with the reform of the statutes.
This is due to the fact that infogle of the internal excitement of the last few years has not been correct in dealing with this matter.
Now, without the critical sectors lying on the laureate, the time could have come to take this issue again and to complete it forever.

China maintains its objectives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions
The representative of China stated at COP16, his country has made enormous efforts to reduce carbon footprints and it would maintain its bid to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 per cent by 2020.
China maintains its bid to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 per cent by 2020, assures Su Wei, the representative of this country at COP16.
At its first public performance at the 16th World Climate Summit of the United Nations (COP16), Su Wei, his country had made enormous efforts to halt the carbon footprints and to transform his industry.
He claimed that in the last four years, his country invested $245 million to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
On the other hand, he stated that China would not change its goals, but would work together with the international community on this issue.
He explained that the Chinese strategy on climate change was divided into four aspects: dialogue, capacity building, institution building and support for pilot programmes.
In all aspects, progress has been made, including the adoption of a new energy law last year, which includes the targets for the reduction of gas emissions.
On the other hand, he pointed out that in China, the authorities of the states had cooperated with those of the Central State and the Communities in order to achieve the objectives of energy saving, effective use of energy and emission reduction.
In addition, some multi-year plans have already been or have been completed, both those financed by the Chinese Government and those that received funds from other countries.
For example, he referred to the energy efficiency programme introduced in the last five years and had received investments from the United Nations (UNO), the government and private hands.
It also runs a project at provincial level for climate change, another for the exchange of traditional glaucoma through energy savings and another for mitigation and adaptation, he explained.
Martin Krol, a scientific government adviser on climate change in this country, confirmed that China's efforts would be much larger than in general.
He pointed out that the per capita emissions of greenhouse gases in China amounted to six tonnes per person, while in the United States it was 100 tonnes. China is responsible for a nine-percent contribution to environmental pollution.
Also, there has been unprecedented progress in the field of energy use. Energy efficiency has been increased by 20 per cent over the last five years and is expected to take place by 2020, he explained.
Legal Exclusion Espinos: César Nava
The national leader of the PAN stated that the former Panist Chairman had the right to appeal to the National Ordinance Commission and to request what he was entitled to.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the exclusion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was right and that the former PAN Chairman had the right to appeal to the National Ordinance Commission and to request what was right to him.
In an interview that took place before the appeal of Gabino Cué Monteagudos as Governor of the Federal State, he explained that Espino's exclusion was a decision that was made at local level.
"This is an independent decision of the Sonora Ordinance Commission."
"Mr Espino has the right, in his case, to appeal to the Commission de Orden del Conseil Nacional in order to make a decision by a competent authority," he added.
On the other hand, he explained that it was not about the time of 2012 and that an alliance with the presidential candidates had never been at the negotiating table.
Nava Vázquez was convinced that Action Nacional was a strong source of internal vote on the next 4 and 5 December, when his successor is elected.
"This (an alliance in 2012) is a topic that has never been on the negotiating table, at least not so far. It was a proposal for the Community choice, it was successful and fulfilled its purpose," he said.
The Panist leader explained that the PAN looks back on 71 years of dialogue, so "we are not afraid of internal competition; on the contrary "we enjoy it and it strengthens us," he commented.
He said that the Council would undoubtedly choose the best president, the Action National, for the next three years, so he passed the letters "to those whom the Council would appoint."
"I am uneasy and open there. I would be proud to transfer one of the five to the office of the chairman of the party."
He predicted that the party's rise in the final elections of 4 July would be reflected in the next elections, although "it's not time to think about 2012."
"Now it is up to the Governor Gabino Cué to support his mission."
In this context, he pointed out that the three governments, drawn from alliances between Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa, would carry the flags and be observed throughout the country. That is why "many hopes and fears will be put into them and I am sure that Gabino is above the requirements."
When he was questioned about the criticism of the PRI at President Felipe Calderón because of his record course in his four-year government, César Nava called upon the PR to reflect on the six-year period of former President Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI believes that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Calderón, they should first defend them, they should finally come out of the closet," he confirmed.
He is of the opinion that the holder of the federal government expresses what he could do in his speech at the Auditorio Nacional, because in this country there was no oral ban and even less a censorship.
Obama joins in Twitter for the law for undocumented students
"If you are for the adoption of the Dream Act, then call your senators and insist on the adoption of this law," the president of the United States tweeted in the popular social network.
President Barack Obama today supported national mobilization to support the Dream Act - laws to legislate undocumented students with a message on his personal blog on the social network Twitter.
"If you are for the adoption of the Dream Act - Law, then call your senators and insist on the adoption of this Law," Obama tweeted.
His short notice contains a cyber link to a broader document that calls for the public to contact with its senators, as the vote of the law directly preferred.
"With your voice that we are waiting for, the time has come to listen to you," he stresses.
The message was spread after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block all votes for each law, except for the extension of the tax reductions from the time of Bush and the financing of the government.
Such a blockage, which was announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote of the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START agreement with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Regarding the blockage of the Republicans of the Dream Act and other projects, President Robert Gibbs said he trusted that if the tax issue was resolved, a timetable for the other projects could be set up.
"I think we still have a lot of time..."
"We all agree that the tax issue must have been resolved before the end of the year..."
"I think we can make an agreement about it at any time and then we can plan the end of the rest," he said.
The president of the democratic majority in the Senate, Harry Reid, announced on Tuesday that "he would apply for the vote at the end of the debate" so that the Dream Act could be approved by the initiative to legalise undocumented students from the next Thursday in the Senate, although the next week would be more likely.
The version of the Dream Act or the law of the American Dream would legalize some 800,000 young people who have migrated to the United States when they were not even sixteen years old, while living in this country for the last five years and who have been enrolled in a higher education institution or in the army.
But the legislators need sixty votes to adopt the initiative, which is why they are referring to the votes of a full-fledged Republican. At the time, the organizations of the sponsors of this project are organizing an intensive influence on the adoption of the law.
The Democrats, most of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said he would vote against and only a Republican, Richard Lugar of Indiana, announced his support for the law.
Therefore, the defenders of the Dream Act have to get several Republicans on their side if other Democrats should decide to take the initiative back.
Among the most popular Republicans are Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as Senator George Lemieux from Florida, who took over the mandate of Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who in the past supported the Dream Act are Orrin Hatch from Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson from Texas, but they explained that they no longer supported it on another occasion.
Another Republican who had spoken for the law, John McCain, has not yet determined his attitude.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the Dream Act in the Senate is facing the greatest obstacles.
Put the finger in the wound with literature
The second round of 'The Lust of the Language' was a walk where participants made themselves strong for the story
"I understand that with the sex in the language, but... the finger in the wound? What is expected of me?" asked writer Luisa Valenzuela, who was to open the second round of 'Los placeres de la lingua', a cycle that celebrated Spanish literature and used the subtitles of her question on this occasion (on another occasion the round table was dedicated to the sex in the language, she explained it).
The finger in the wound... "takes us in trouble", the Argentine writer called against the audience, which consisted mainly of young people who met at the International Book Fair in Guadalajara (FIL) to attend this round table, moderated by Marisol Shultz, attended the Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text she dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio, and then she marked the Shultz as a great story. Luisa tells in the first person and is the protagonist who is looking for what is a "Wonde" and goes to a doctor, from which she does not receive an answer, but guidance for the guides of her story.
The infectors leave her convinced: "Gedulance is not my strength, maybe it is my wound."
Finally, after a frustrating approach to the traumatologists, who stole the breath in the middle of the walk, and who explained that Wonde was not a scientific concept, the psychoanalyst revealed the secret: "The Wonde is really the open, the symbolic is the scar."
The main figure of the story makes it easier and concludes that she has "only experienced from the wound that it is really open and not exist". But she is convinced that the desire for language and its traps mix.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also presented a thrilling story he called 'Lob of the invention', in which the finger is not mentioned in the wound, but discovered.
He told of a famous magician who returned the clouds, traveled back to the men who had been lost by a girl, or restored the deed lost by a girl. The story made a turning point and reported to America, the great Roman who was not missing from his own chronist from the beginning, and he quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who criticised the abundance of the stories told by the emperors.
"Cervantes, who introduced all of us (the writers), ridiculed the pretense witnesses who appeared in the stories as true, but otherwise the story of America would never have been told - with the imagination that even the feeling of shame came up."
However, he said, "it is the foolish and the liars who best imagine things," and there the reality and lies approach one another, where one no longer knows which side the story is, where the fictitious literature reaches the summit.
He actually calls it the Tradition Cervantes.
"We inherited from him to be what is told."
When Mayra Montero was on the line, the writer commented and praised the variety of interpretations to which the invitation of the Phil had contributed to the round table 'The Finger in the Wound'.
The Cuban and Puerto Rican devote their contribution to the great wave of social violence in their country - like all Latin America - as a result of the fights against drug trafficking.
"I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a silent, unplanned commitment," she explained after she had pointed out that literature is communication and commitment that builds between the author and the readers as in a "chemical reaction".
In the evening, the Spanish poet Luis García Montero, whose contribution was also "this finger of the committed writer in the wound of the writer", decided.
He noted that in a fast-lived world also the intellectual habits and control of consciousness run out on dogmatisms, and will be forgotten, "that behind every confirmation there is a little no and behind every lie a little yes."
"In order to be in our possession of our thoughts and reality, we need to be nuanced: and nuances often mean putting the finger into the wound and harassing those who feel much better when they think in the form of cartoons, in black and white, in pre-produced ideas without nuances, and also harassing the powers that prefer it to divide the world into black and white, he said to discover a sense of writing.
Romano fights for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three defeats in final games, he has experienced ups and Abs in his career, but three times he played decisive games.
In the duel between Santos Laguna and Monterrey at the end of the game, two different styles are compared to their respective trainers, and the encounter marked by contrasts is reflected in the results.
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three defeats in final games, he has experienced ups and Abs in his career, but three times he has had decisive games, and so far he has been well behaved, which is why this opportunity is very important to him.
The Argentinian has played with the medal for the second champion, he is a step back behind the winners, and surprisingly he has played consecutive games with the same team.
The Sentimental Strategy reached the first final game as a coach at the 'Torneo Apertura 2002', when del Morelia had the toes in hand with which he experienced a major defeat against Toluca with 4-2; later, when 'Clausura 2003' he reached the decisive duel he also lost with 3-1 against Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna on the 'Torneo Bicentenario 2010' in which they played against Los Diablos, Rubén had to re-invente the game with 2-2 against Los Choriceros after 210 minutes of playing, but at the 11th metre he came with 3-1 ahead and got two ways to score his title, but finally three of his players missed the eleven steps and the game turned into a 4-3.
Rubén had already lost two games with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterey, his great rival. Therefore, he does not want to be persecuted once again by the evil sorcerer to be able to celebrate a title for the first time, although he confirms that the most important thing for him is the game itself.
"I want to be a champion, I don't want to break statistics, that's for a club, that's for my affection that I give up, and so the title will come to me, but what happened before is the most important thing," the taxpayer commented when asked him about the lost endgames.
The last final game is still strong in his memory, he assures us to have learned a lot from it: "The only lesson we can learn from it is that until the end of the trial, we cannot celebrate, we are prepared on the line, the players too, because the last time we were prepared with two eleven meters on it, and I believe that this is a lesson until the game is over, there is no reason to celebrate."
To know that this series could be decided by Elfmeter shooting, it does not bother him, because he trusts his players: "You never want to get to Elfmeter shooting, you want to finish in the regular game time, but sometimes there is no alternative and you need to be prepared for it, in the previous tour we were prepared, but unfortunately the fate prepared us a bad game, sometimes due to nervousness or the intense effort to keep the title in the hands that leaves us something for this final game, and we hope it won't come to it this time."
It is in Romanso Power not only to be a second champion and to spend the first time bringing the title.
The United States changes the rules for obtaining a visa
The persons must submit themselves to the visa application services at the consulate before their consultation; costs are so reduced.
With effect from 10 January 2011, the procedures for applying for a visa are changed in the message of the United States and in the consulates.
In the new procedure, most applicants must present themselves before their consultation at the visa application services (ASC) starting letters in English).
The staff of the ASC shall record the biometric data of the applicant, which shall be verified by the consulate before the interview.
The new procedure has certain advantages for the aspirants, including:
The total costs for the settlement of the visa are reduced, as it is no longer necessary to pay separately the time-limits, the processing of the visa application and the transport service with which the document is issued.
The applicant shall provide only one payment covering the three services.
The current price remains unchanged: the equivalent of $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for Visa with request (including Visa for timers) and $390 for hands and investors.
Those who wish to extend their visas must not have a conversation in the consulate, they must only introduce themselves to the next ASC, where they will present their documents and take their fingerprints.
As biometric data are collected in the ASC, applicants who need a second deadline for the conversation in the consulate remain less time than before.
Those who apply for the visa in the consulates of Ciudad Juárez, Monterey and Nuevo Laredo must no longer pay the service charge of 26 dollars.

NASA announces the founding of extraterrestrial life
The North American Space Agency called for a press conference to present a fund tomorrow, which will have an impact on the search for living beings in all.
The National Aviation and Space Authority (NASA) of the United States will give tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery that could confirm the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The project will be presented at 1 p.m. at a press conference at NASA headquarters in Washington by astrobiology experts. It is a science that examines the origin, development, distribution and the future of life in the universe.
At the opening of the press conference, NASA assured that it would present "a supervisory fund for the search for extraterrestrial life", which triggered speculation in experts from other countries.
The discovery could prove the theory that in hostile environments that can be considered to be uninhabitable, human creatures can exist. The hypothesis was put forward that they could transform into intelligent living beings - like humans - if their living conditions improved.
It is apparently a microbe that was found on the basis of the Mono Lake in the Yosemite National Park, California. It lives there in an environment that was considered too toxic for all earthly life forms, as the lake is highly arsenic.
In any way, the microbes use the arsenic as a survival resource. Taking into account this ability, they increase the chances that there may be a similar life on other planets that do not have our protective atmosphere.
When these organisms change the arsenic, according to the astrobiologists, "there is actually another form of life, a second form of life that is different from what we know."
The space agency will inform the actual scope of its fund on Thursday at the press conference tomorrow.
The conference is attended by geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who investigates the possibility of life on Mars, and by biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists, Titan (the largest moon Saturns) is studying whether his chemical composition of the earth resembles it.
Gesta PRD, PT, Convergence and Pattern form an opposition block
With the reform of the organ law on the Congress, the two-party system will be introduced, they complain.
The 60th Legislature period had just begun, and an opposition block was already installed, as indicated by the representatives of the PRD, PT, Convergence and Jesús Manuel Patron Montalvo, who presented himself as an independent person. The four asked the question: the introduction of the 'two-party system' into the chamber.
Before the beginning of the opening session in the 60th legislative period, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergence, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo of the PRD and patron Montalvo against the reform of the organ law, as they would therefore be excluded.
With this reform, they repeated, they would introduce a 'two-party system', for now there would be two people, the same number as the parties who controlled the congress.
These four MPs, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of the PRD, were the only ones who voted against the presidency of the Panist Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca in his capacity as vice-chairman.
Corvera Quevedo stated that the PRI and PAN parties had institutionally introduced their political position with these reforms.
He claimed that in the coming days they would speak to the representatives of PAN and PRI to change the scheme. In doing so, they departed from their political will and if they did not have it, they would again be unfair from both parties, thus ending the opposition coalition.
"To this end I come (the opposition coalition), that is what I see, because we will be excluded from all the decisions that do not even go back to taking into account the opinion of the others."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergence explained that there were agreements with PRD, PT and pattern and that a pluralist group would be formed.
It cannot be allowed, he continued that the Congress, after he was monopolistic, should now be "duopolitic".
"It is not the spirit of the law reform that should govern an eternal two-party system in Congress."
"At the beginning, this group starts with five Members and talks with other colleagues and colleagues to make them more active," said the Convergence member.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza from the PT pointed out that the congress had now turned into a 'bate' for two.
"Before it was just a party, now they're sharing it to the second."
Patron Montalvo asked to respect the Members and give them their place at the negotiating tables.
"The five who are currently divided into different groups have decided not to agree to take our place at the negotiating table, because because of the reform that has been carried out and distributed by the others, we have stayed outside and we have not agreed to this reform."
200 000 peso more for "the supplier"
The city administration of Mazatlán pays a further check to the disputed owner of the company for electrical material.
Another check of more than 200 000 peso for Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the city administration.
This is the sum paid to the owner of the company for electrical material in the second half of the year, 1 200 000 pesos.
According to the site for more transparency of the city administration, this check was issued at an amount of 200,144,56 peso, with number 9258447 in the last 16 November, with the purpose of "Cutting Open Accounts".
The treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had already arranged for more money from the community to go to this supplier. It is observed by the Auditoría Superior del Estado because it sells too high prices.
What has not been mentioned is the total amount you still owe her and therefore the number of checks that are still issued in favour of Camacho Palazuelos.
"Nothing was bought with her, it's just paid the debts, just like the rest of the suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last checks "show up" in the last quarter of the year: September 24, two of October 15, October 19, October 29, and the last of November 16.
Although the supplier has not yet been published in the Official Journal, as provided by law, when a company is questioned by the ASE in order to avoid other administrations applying for their services, the Treasurer assured that their services would not be applied again.
After publishing the check issued by the city administration to its suppliers on 25 July, it was announced that, from March 2008 to 9 July 2010, during the three-year term of office of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the municipality had paid over 10 million pesos with 42 checks on Camacho Palazuelos.
There were also businesses with Jumapam, where they took checks in the value of over 3 million peso.
Tourist sites need to be improved urgently
Tourist companies regret the accident of foreign tourists due to the bad condition of the Gloriata Sánchez Tabooada in Mazatlán.
Following the shock of a foreign tourist in the collapse of the Gloriata Sánchez Tabooada, the tourism industry of Mazatlán requested special attention from the authorities, the areas in which they were in bad shape, and the poor image of the port city.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, chairman of the trade union of the Zone Dorada, recalled that it was required to maintain the destination and to transform the bad conditions of tourists into new employment opportunities or routes.
He said that the bad condition of the roads and roads had had a negative effect, as the tourists came to a halt and saw the disorder, in which they would turn their backs on the nearby shops.
"The politicians don't know what it means to have to close a company one day and they don't think about how much money you lose, because otherwise they wouldn't slow down and do the construction work this way."
The hotel owner José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said the tour operator's tour would have paid attention to the lack of prevention and the remaining maintenance work on the side of the city.
"The community must take over its responsibility and avoid what is going on again. How is it to do this? Well, by taking preventive care instead of improving everything in the future," he explained.
"We look forward to having a clean city, for not only because it is a foreign transport area, it must be maintained, we also have a right to a clean living space. The city administration must change its strategy to keep the city in good condition."
"There are other places that also look unappreciated and incomplete," he said, "for example el Escudo y el Venadito by Mazatlán."
"Today, we need more than just advertising to attract tourists. It has to be offered a good product, a city that cleans its beaches and streets, and the tourist attractions keep on shooting," he added.
"These provisions have not been given enough attention, and these kinds of events are simply what is obvious to all: maintenance is urgently needed."
Raúl Llera Martínez, Undersecretary of Promoción Turistica, expressed how important it was to save the tourist places of Mazatlán, because they would not be properly used and had a bad image created.
He mentioned a number of places that were to be brought to Vordermann along with the city. To create the city clean, orderly and attractive for foreign traffic should be a priority.
"Happyly, Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural sites that first need to be cleaned and cleaned to make them attractive to foreign traffic and to provide them with the inventory with which we hire this destination.
IP Demands Congress Results
Mr Dávalos, Chairman of the CCE, proposed that the Members take the great responsibility to provide a model for a better Sinaloa, which faces many challenges.
The company sector of Mazatlán calls for a worthy Parliament, free of agreement, to move the parties and the government, because Sinaloa is in need and is facing major problems.
Yesterday the 60th Parliament was dedicated. It consists of seven political forces, 19 members of PRI, 13 of PAN, three of Partido Nueva Alliance, two of PRD, one of PT, one of Convergence, and another of PVEM. This makes 40 representatives.
The new members of the State Congress are expected to do a clean job, to feel committed to society and the various social groups, which are geared to responsible parliamentary work, and not to repeat the same pattern of partnership and paternism.
Eduardo Dávalos, chairman of the CCE entrepreneurship Board, proposed that the new Members should take the heavy responsibility to provide an example of a better Sinaloa facing many challenges.
"We hope that the Members will really exercise their right to act free of agreements between the parties, because it is common for them to enter into agreements with which they represent their own interests, thus transforming themselves into carnival competitions between the governments and the leaders of the parliamentary groups."
He said that they should prove their commitment to building the necessary bridges to support the current government.
"We take care that they do a good job of trust and use themselves above all for the society and their groups, because they were the inhabitants of Sinaloa who spoke to them about their trust in the last elections."
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Tres Islas Hotel Association, believes that one of the major challenges facing 40 peoples is the drive and joint work for the economic growth of the state, because today the economic situation is extremely complicated.
"The most important thing is that they drive economic growth, create investment incentives and infrastructure measures, which will in any way promote job creation."
With regard to the foreign transport sector, he called on the new Members to contribute the necessary value to the State budget to encourage the Ministry of Foreign Transport.
"I understand that it is the Ministry with the two most important resources, which is incompatible with an important economic activity that brings foreign currencies and investments into the country and is in direct competition with the agro-industry."
The tourist projects need to be allocated funds, state security needs to be supported, and the alcohol legislation, which has not been reintroduced in previous legislative periods, needs to be updated.
The Holy King Is Seeking
The children of the Coronado Valenzuela family want to have fun, cars, bicycles and other toys.
It will be difficult for parents to meet these wishes on the next Thursday, because the budget does not consist of more than twelve people and a goat.
Nevertheless, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaiah, José Juan and Miguel do not hope that Melchior, Caspar and Balthasar will give them the toys and clothing they wear.
The family lives a modest house in the village of Salvador Allende. They live by hand in the mouth, because the father has no hard work.
"Sometimes hard times have been said because my husband has no job. But we sell mandarins and potatoes... I'm going to the street with the gorges already in the afternoon," said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
The four-year-old Adelaida would like a doll or a bike, while her three-year-old sister Isabel wants a Barbie doll.
The ten-year-old José Alfredo has long wanted to have a 'monster car' and for his eight-month-old brother Jesús proposes Cayetana clothing in size for single-years.
" (José Alfredo) said to me, 'I would love this monster so much,' but I replied to him, 'let us wait, boy', for it was very expensive,' Cayetana recalled sadly.
For the older children who were in school, clothing and shoes would be ideal.
The eleven-year-old María Guadalupe has the size 12; the ten-year-old Isaiah has the size 10, while the eight-year-old Miguel has the size 8.
The 14-year-old José Juan lacks tennis shoes. A couple in size 5 1/2 or 6 would be very helpful.
If you would like to help to realize the dreams of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family, you can participate in the campaign 'Holy King Is sought' by contributing a toy or cash in the reception hall of the newspaper Noroest.
14 Absence of moderate drug use
On Wednesday, in the context of the collapse of a cannabis production and sales network, ten household investigations were carried out in the management region of Estonia.
Fourteen persons were arrested and various charges brought against them.
The household searches took place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, where they were supposed to have served the main production of drugs.
"About 750 cannabis plants, four kilo Haschisch, cash and equipment that have served the production have been confiscated," Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesperson of the Quebec Security Police, said.
A total of eleven men and three women were arrested, of whom two men, who were considered to be the chief drug addict, came from Sherbrooke.
The detainees should have appeared in Sherbrooke for hours after their arrest before the court building.
Among other things, they could be charged with the production of cannabis, the possession of which is for sale, the plot and the service of crimes.
These household surveys had been carried out as a result of long-term detection, which had been paid over a year.
"The information received from the public has enabled us to carry out these arrests," said Mr. Ruel.
The 70 police officers of the regional intelligence unit Austria of the Quebec Security Police, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphrémagog Police Authority participated in this police operation.
The secret migration could be followed without problems
The draft legislation of the Conservatives, which, according to the Government, is to regulate the problem of ships loaded with secret immigrants, will be adopted in the light of the fact that the three opposition parties announced on Wednesday that they cannot support the proposal.
"I'm renouncing myself against this charter."
"I am with a party that has put you on your feet," said Michael Ignatieff, head of the Liberals, after the weekly Caucus meeting in front of the assembled delegates.
The Liberals claimed that the draft legislation, which allows each vessel identified as a carrier of illegal immigrants to be detained for up to one year, violates the Canadian Constitution on Law and Freedom, as proposed.
Gilles Duceppe, head of the Bloc Québecis, also indicated that the draft legislation could not be supported as he turned against the wrong target group.
"We are against it and it seems that all opposition parties are against it, so we will expect what the government is doing," said M. Duceppe.
The criticism of the immigration question by Olivia Chow, NDP, has shown the critics by hand, who demand that their party not consistently behave against the secret migrants.
"The Neo-Democrats agree to take action against the blind passengers, and that is what we are trying to do by means of another legislative draft, C-35," Chow said.
Therefore, we do not support the draft legislation of the Conservatives because he is looking for the debt of refugees and keeps children trapped for at least a year," Chow explained.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney accused the opposition parties of playing politics and ignoring the will of Canadians.
"The Canadians strongly tell the MPs that they do not tolerate this kind of secret immigration, these criminal proceedings involving Canada and treating the country as a pedestrian."
"You expect Canada to take hard action," said Minister Kenneys.
"The government has not announced any confidence in its draft legislation which could have led the country to elections that had rejected the government.
However, a conservative has spoken to the QMI agency, the government would call for a vote so that any opposing MPs would immediately make a statement against his electors.
The new unit does not find any unanimity
Despite the announcement of the possible establishment of a new, standing unit to fight corruption and collapse by Jean Charest, many observers continue to call for the formation of a public investigation committee on this issue.
Robert Dutil, Minister of Public Security, claims that this idea is not from yesterday: Quebec had already consulted the New York Department of Investigation on this issue last January.
Since 1870, the metropolis has had a standing unit against corruption.
However, the announcement of Wednesday has more than one surprise.
It must be said that this measure was not discussed at the least in spite of the presence of Robert Dutils at the meeting of the Permanent Committee of the Quebec Police Service on 29 October last year.
It was also not missing that Stéphane Bergeron, Critics and a member of the Québec Party, qualified this announcement in public security at the point as "sweeped rabbits" as well as "a rightly-assembled solution" in a table.
Minister Dutil had, in turn, turned to those who feared that political power had too much influence on the inquiring, future unity.
"You'll see the result when we announce it," he was encouraged to confirm.
"Man is aware of this problem."
According to Réjean Parent, the president of the CSQ, nothing can replace the conduct of a public inquiry.
"The more Mr Charest insists on preventing the formation of this committee of inquiry, the more people like you and I think he has something to hide," he explained.
"The only means to be able to form a committee of inquiry is the resignation of Jean Charest," said Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and political systems at the ENA (state University for the Training of High Administrative Officers).
In order to get out of this gas, he proposed to Quebec that the financial audit should provide a special mandate to enable it to carry out investigations related to corruption and secret agreements.
"You should be able to extend the mandate of the inspection control," he decided.
He also expressed the view that the Quebec of the inspection control could extend the same power as the Commissioners, which would allow them to oblige the people to speak.
The formation of a standing unit is not the only project in the government's schools of Charest.
The Quebec will also require Ottawa to amend the criminal law there in order to be better set up in this kind of crime.
This request was made by the Chief Prosecutor of Operation Marteau, who informed Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the prosecution in this kind of criminal investigation is not clear.
Vic Toews, Minister of State for Public Security, confirmed, on the other hand, that his colleague, Rob Nicholson, was currently dealing with certain innovations related to this dossier.
During Operation Printtemps 2001, which seized the gangs of the motorcycle policemen, 131 persons were arrested, although the criminal law had not been renewed.
As a result, Ottawa passed the law against gangsterum.
Rivers under strict surveillance
Several flows remain under strict surveillance due to the high rainfalls that have taken place since Tuesday in some regions of the province.
In Shawinigan, in the Maurice administrative region, it came to an earthquake on Wednesday afternoon.
Two houses were preventatively evacuated.
In the evening, another earthquake occurred in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in the Lanaudier administrative region.
A road has fallen together.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening strong rainfalls ranged from 40 to 70 millilitres of rainfall on several regions.
Between 20 and 40 additional millimeters of precipitation were expected here according to the regions until Thursday evening.
The areas north of the river and the valley of the Outaouais region were most affected.
In total, up to 100 millimeters of rain shows have gone down here.
As the snowflakes, which have already been collected in certain sub-areas, are still to be taken into account, it is feared that more water flows will be exceeded.
On Wednesday, the Quebec Security Service issued a warning message on the high-water alarm concerning the Ouereau and Achigan rivers in the Lanaudire region.
The rivers in the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentian mountains and the Chene in Lotbinière will continue to be the object of high water monitoring.
In the Lanaudière region, the severe defeats of some lakes in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and Rawdon have led to their survival.
In Saint-Calixte a bridge was opened due to heavy rainfalls.
Ten residences had to be evacuated as a preventive measure.
In Outaouais, the breach of certain lakes caused the closure of several roads, especially in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The security service will continue to be in alarm service and will monitor the situation as well, so Security Councilman Annik Bouchard.
On Wednesday, the Quebecer Landeshochwater Centre issued warnings of the strong rise of several rivers, in particular by Maskinongé, Assomption, Ouereau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Doubon partially justified
The Quebecer Rundfunkmoderator Stéphane Dupont has suffered a partial defeat before the Canadian Supervisory Board for Rundfunk Standards (CCNR) because of his controversial statements about social care and Haitians as well as because of his outstanding speech about Funk.
Although the CCNR represented the opinion, M. Dupont and his CHOI 98.1 FM team had the right to express their own opinions, certain statements had "inaccurate information on social security and unfairly negative representations of Haitians as well as an unaccompanied speech that is not appropriate for the daily broadcasts."
The Supervisory Board also concluded that a discussion on suicide involving the dissemination of the names of two persons who have committed suicide violates the code of radio transmission.
The CCNR received several complaints concerning comments made during the 2008 and 2010 broadcasts.
The first available was submitted as a result of a complaint by the "Front commun des persones assitées sociales du Québec".
The Activist organisation had claimed that the amounts mentioned in the consignment were negligible.
The moderators should provide more solid information than misleading information.
With regard to the topic of suicide, moderator Stéphane Dupont had represented the opinion that suicide was an expression of cowardice.
The majority of members of the Supervisory Board had reached the conclusion that the message mediated was that suicide should not be considered as a solution to life crises.
"The majority of the Supervisory Board takes into account that the consequences of the inquiring mission "dupont le midi" had a sensitive theme in a family-friendly and appropriate manner."
Therefore, he was found with no table against his person.
The last point of dispute concerned the statements concerning the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had delivered an effective media debate in this regard that had produced a lot of reactions.
The CHOI moderator had explained not to have given in favour of Haiti's aid, as one did not know for sure whether the needy would actually receive the money.
The Supervisory Board believes that these comments have not been abusive characters, but that their cumulative effect presents an unfair negative representation of the Haitians.
"I've already dropped my three-day suspension penalty in this case."
"My record has been youthful for half a year," said the moderator.
In all decisions, the Supervisory Board shall require the dissemination of an unsolicited expression.
In all cases, the CHOI-FM broadcaster has acted "on account of its obligations".
The consequences for the broadcaster, whose decisions were to be notified on a case-by-case basis within a three-day period, are minor.
King of the King-Fu in Montreal
Nacereddine Zemmal, Montrealer of Algerian origin, has taken a very special course.
The athlete, who shines in "sanda" (full contact King-Fu), kickboxes, and Thai boxing, now rises in search of new challenges to the tatami and to the world's boxing rings.
"I started 12 years ago in Algeria with fighting sports such as kung fu and kickboxes," said Zemmal, who has been in the metropolis since 2008.
I personally look for the fight all over, because for those who present the ground struggle as the mixed arts do not like the fights in North America."
Recently, he had given out bad news of his character as a security officer, as well as of his rivals employed by UPS, in which he was awarded two gold medals by the World Karate and the Kickboxing Association (WKA) at the world championship in Edinburgh, Scotland, between October 23 and 30.
"I have won the victory in the categories of the full contact Kickbox and Thai Box," he explained.
"I am currently preparing for the World Cup in San Shou in China."
"The fighters from every category were invited to join the last World Championship under the first four."
"I took my baby in 2009 in Toronto Bronze."
"In 2005 I became a behind in Vietnam."
"I finished the tournament in China in the fifth place in 2007, while I became third in 2009 in Toronto," he added.
"It is worth mentioning that I have made progress in every competition."
"With this rhythm, I'll be the first one this time or next year!"
"San Shou" or "Sanda" are disciplines originating in China, where foot strokes and footsteps are allowed as well as ground drafts.
The twins usually play on a platform, more rarely in a boxing ring.
The most renowned box fighter that has come out of this kind of fighting sport is the American Vietnamese-born Cung Le, who is well known in the world of martial arts.
If Nacer Zemmal had only one event in his career, he would certainly call his presence here at the Super Turnier "King of Sanda", the Super Bowl of the King-Fu.
"This competition is the highest and the highest in China," said the sympathetic pound core.
"It is a bit like the equivalent of the stadium Lumpinee (the largest stadium in Thailand)."
"That was a great experience."
In the semifinals of his category (80kg) he had won his first battle before he lost in the finals.
"He who defeated me was a real professional," he analyzed.
"There are four soldiers per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 95 kg)."
"The winners of the semifinals meet each other in the finals of their category."
"Then the winners of each category offer the stars to crown a single champion, the King of the King-Fu."
450 million in contracts without tender
Hydro-Québec has approved in mutual agreement project planning companies 450 million dollars of contracts for the water power project Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert.
A consortium of more than 100 contracts consists of BPR, Dessau, SM and Axor Group, which received the most important part, namely the project management, to a sum of $295 million without tender.
This consortium, called "Energie gérance", was formed in 2004 as a subsidiary of the decision of Hydro-Québec, the private sector's responsibility to respond to this important hydroelectric project in the amount of $5 billion.
At the beginning of 2005, the consortium "Energie gérance" endorsed the non-profit contract without public tendering.
For the Québec party, the back-up to corporate consortia is a serious ethical problem that raises the risk of distortions of competition as well as an increase in prices.
"This is a new way of playing a carded game and distorts competition."
"This means that instead of playing carded games, you are now performing in a secret way, in an open form," yesterday Sylvain Simard, PQ's MP, explained at the press conference.
In the early morning, Simard had raised the question before the National Assembly, as it seems difficult for him to understand how the public interest can be handled in this way.
Minister of Resources Nathalie Normandeau had responded in the afternoon by placing very strongly in Abbrede that it had acted as a carded game in this treaty.
"I remain faithful to my line," she said, by strengthening the PQ as "unfairly" and "misleading her."
She said it was "at least," that the PQ apologized.
The Consortium model is a world-wide practice.
It is usually a temporary association that allows two or more companies to combine their expertise in an invitation to tender for a complex project.
The Eastmain project shows a high level of complexity regarding its scope.
The construction process is in progress and is scheduled to be set up by 2012.
However, the contract was granted without the possibility of a competition; it had already been negotiated.
Moreover, the model of the consortium in Quebec itself is no longer an exception in relatively simple projects.
As the newspaper "Le Devoir" last week noted, the model used in the field of construction and consulting is the subject of government investigations.
A short stay of the Quebec Company Register allows more than 200 consortia, some of which seem to be permanent.
For example, Dessau works in partnership with the majority of its core competitors, including CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin or also Roche and Tecsult.
Any connection, and there are several dozens of it, leads back to one and the same legal person, namely Dessau.
As regards the consortium "Energy gérance", Minister Normandeau stressed that "the territory of the Bay of James is subject to special labour dynamics and that Hydro-Québec has paid this fact in a special way since the 1970s".
Réal Laporte, the great employer of Société d'énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has made a statement that the nose over the fact that the contract on project management has been approved after agreement.
"If you make an invitation to tender and there are only a few applicants, your prices will be faster."
"So you have two options: either you take the people who are on this march and tell you: you will negotiate a satisfactory agreement at a good price."
"The idea is, however, that the price is not crucial, but the understanding of the people," Laporte confirmed.
This contract awarded to the consortium "Energy Gerance" is part of a long list of contracts of more than 50,000 dollars received from the Québec Party.
The contracts were either approved by the Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After the review, the newspaper "Le Devoir" included more than 100 engineering and advisory contracts, the companies or their branches, including in particular resource laboratories, were approved between 2002 and March 2010.
SNC-Lavalin had reached 22 contracts, Génivar had received 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without their participation in "Energy management".
All these treaties have been negotiated.
They total $449 783 344, including the contract with "Energy management" over $295 131 564.
Sylvain Simard had announced that the four companies forming the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) of the "Parti liberal du Québec are probably known".
Minister Normandeau had made a statement that the PQ was equally linked to the companies that they had 'funded' before she made it clear that it was more about their leadership.
Barometer Conscious Consumers - The "green" label is not trusted
Greener, but unscrupulous sceptical.
The Quebec consumer has little confidence in the main players of sustainable growth, but also less in the marked brands or eco-labels to control its choice.
Unfortunately, even though it is in a media-efficient universe, where information for a responsible consumer is only as confused as it is: the barometer in charge has a lack of credible information, an insufficiency which makes itself known as the brake of its commitment, as the first reading showed, the last reading was held yesterday.
Although they have advanced the consumption of so-called social products in 2010, Quebecers still seem to pay little credit to those trying to sell them.
Two thirds of Quebec's population contribute to the environmental commitment of companies as little faith as the green company's recruitment, so the measuring instrument, which is the responsible consumer centre of the University of Sherbrooke, betrays.
Another finding: half of consumers doubt the reliability of the official certificates attached to the probably fair products, but also the credibility of the products and brands that are conscious of being declared to be environmental.
According to the same pattern, only 14.6% of Quebec's population is seriously affected by the political debate on this issue.
Information on responsible consumption seems to be important for stimulating this consumption segment, which is currently being experienced by about one third of Quebec's consumers.
In fact, empty and questionable character of the information drowned the zeal of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the barometer at the higher price of the products.
In addition, a third of Quebecer’s stated performance of green products and services, which are sought to put in their hands, is regrettable.
According to another Communication, over half of consumers had already changed their habits in 2010 and mainly changed the brand of one or more products to express their conviction.
According to Barometer, they also preferred to buy 61% of their city district merchants and favoured the purchase of food grown in their region.
Greener and more responsible - the index of the most environmentally conscious consumption had reached 64 of the maximum value of 100 this year - the Homo consumption of Quebec likes to present itself as a king of recycling, trying to reduce its traces left in the environment by taking care of animal protection.
However, the social and environmental consciousness seems to stop in front of his car, so the barometer: just 28% of Quebecers have indicated that in 2010 they have used public transport or preferred to have the co-operation centre to demonstrate their environmental interest.
In addition, the addition and cycling were supported by 39.1% of the participants in this comprehensive behavioural survey, which feeds the clichés.
State bonds for the acquisition of eXcentris
The Quebecer government, which was asked by Société Angus and the company Parallelèle to participate financially in the acquisition of the eXcentris cinema complex, agrees with cooperation, but only in the form of a competitive loan.
The developers' company Angus and the company Parallelèle, who had hoped to receive a donation of $7 million from the Ministry of Culture to take over the eXcentris film complex of Daniel Langlois on the Boulevard Saint-Laurent in order to responsibly respond to his actual cinematic function, clearly did not receive what they wanted.
The Government has accepted to be involved in this matter, however, on its own terms.
Instead of the expected expense, the Quebecer government offers a loan of less than the initially expected amount that could call an existing solution to favourable living conditions, at least in the opinion of the sources taken from the public kitchen.
A first action plan as well as a 12.8 million request had already been rejected from Quebec in the last spring, the request for the request has been corrected summarily from the bottom.
A proposal, together with an action plan, has already been sent by the president of the Société de development des Entrepreneur culturalles (SODEC), François Macerola, to Minister St-Pierre, who is leading the eXcentris act.
A few days ago, he had her get her a final case report.
However, the counter-proposal of the cabinet was forwarded to the SODEC on Wednesday.
Parallels and Angus now have until 31 December time to respond to these.
In any case, the awards of the state spending really seem to have been pushed to the side.
We recall that the Quebecer owner community of the cinemas and cinema complex had lent itself to a direct state investment to support the acquisition of eXcentris by providing the argument that the Minister of Culture had no financial aid for real estate projects that he had not even allowed to come to other cinemas.
However, a number of other market participants in the segment claimed substantial economic aid.
After the self-funded construction of the cinema, the film manager, Daniel Langlois, had presented the author in the rooms of his cinema complex for over ten years, which could justify the exclusion from the public register.
The lack of cinemas showing independent films is more than obvious in Montreal, and eXcentris knew how to keep his clients at the stand.
The Société Angus and the company Parallele with Christian Yaccarini at the top, in turn, run a private funded campaign, from which they hope a sum of $700,000 to boost the acquisition.
Since the spring of 2009, only one canvas wall continues to show films in eXcentris, namely Le Parallelèle.
The goal of the future buyer is to reopen the three cinemas next February 27th with the presentation of the very successful film by Xavier Beauvois "Des hommes et des dieux" again.
But Christian Yaccarini did not call the newspaper "Le Devoir" and one ignores what he and his group hold from the suggestions that were corrected below that were made to them.
The secret of complex, protected Canada
The new U.S. diplomats, which were distributed by WikiLeaks, spread the secret of what the United Nations considered under the Canadians' inferiority complex to the Americans; however, with the same blow, they spread the feeling of superiority over Canada.
As a result, American diplomats are surprised that the Canadian electorate in the election did not have the Canadian-American relations in mind, and they believe that President Obama's visit would have helped the conservative government to implement its 2009 budget!
The four new messages between the American message in Ottawa and Washington, which was publicly distributed yesterday, offer even more interesting details than the only substantial content to be read.
A connection dated 22 September 2008, i.e. during the period during which the federal election campaign was in full progress, reports on the point from which the United Nations no longer participates in the events discussed by its political leaders.
To the great surprise of David Wilkins, the American ambassador employed in Ottawa.
Mr Wilkins offers various possibilities for this situation.
"A Canadian almost ordinary minority complex may require the Canadian, political leaders to talk much more about internal issues of everyday life than the United States assigns to black Peter (as in the campaign on free trade in 1988) in this election," he describes.
The United Nations, as he concludes, is therefore "the literal Goliath of this choice: omnipresent but potentially too dangerous to speak of him".
The ambassador understands this "stupid silence" even less, as the two countries have intensive political and economic relations.
" logically," he said, "it proved to be the ability of a candidate, a party and much more of a party's team to lead such an essential relationship that the elector has in mind as a key factor at the time of the emergency."
The other expression of this sense of importance was read in the announcement sent by Terry Breese, businessman in Ottawa on 22 January 2009, that President Barack Obama should prepare for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your trip will help to ensure that the government continues to exist in the federal budget vote at the beginning of February, in which Canada's first deficit will be announced after more than a decade, which is due to a living programme of 30 to 40 billion dollars," Breese describes.
There was no mention of the fact that the government had to hold the parliamentary meeting before Christmas in order to prevent Parliament from falling apart from the coalition and that the continued existence of the opposition parties would have an impact on the quality of the proposed enforcement programme.
A further message from the Ambassador Wilkins, dated January 2008, explains Washington's increasingly negative image that the CBC broadcasts dramatic series from the United States.
The messenger is concerned about consignments such as Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which you can observe little subtle recordings of Maher Aar, the "No-Fly List" or even performances for the purpose of the CIA's muscle prosthetics.
Another communication tells us in detail how Hillary Clinten asked his French official Bernard Kouchner at her first bilateral meeting whether Europe was ready to take certain prisoners from Guantanamo.
Mr Kouchner should have answered the question with yes, however on the basis of an individual 'fall to fall' decision.
At the end of the meeting, it was described as "the Secretary of State has handed out a paper at Omar Khadr's point, a 15-year-old Canadian Muslim origin."
"The Secretary of State has promised to review the file again."
Finally, we note that the guests are warming up about the WikiLeaks website.
Tom Flanagan, an old and Stephen Harper very close advisor, had explained over CBC that those responsible for this massive leak should be "implemented".
He referred here to Mike Huckabee from the United States.
Global plan for the renewal of lighting
Yesterday in Cancun, the UN proposed a plan to renew the lighting of households, trade and industry in 100 countries with a view to achieving a reduction in greenhouse gas (FCKW), corresponding to nearly one third of the additional reductions that need to be implemented in order to stabilise the global climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan takes its position in the concrete major projects that the UN hopes to implement in Cancún in order to compensate for the absence of mandatory reduction obligations of industrial countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, the main problem in the form of 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of the FCKW emitted on earth would be avoided if the white-lighted beers, which so far still represent a monopoly of 50 to 70% on the market, were replaced by fluorescent or better by LEDs.
The lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This corresponds to an equivalent of 70% of the emissions of the global fleet.
Last year in Copenhagen, the major gas stations, such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, had committed themselves to voluntary reduction plans, which should reduce global FCKW emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, 5 Gts had to be deducted from this budget to stabilise the climate increase by 2 degrees Celsius from today to 2020 to prevent this from being controlled.
In the white-lighted beers, 95% of the energy is absorbed in the form of heat, and the remaining 5% produce the light.
With the compact light bulbs, energy consumption is reduced by 75%, with the new LED bulbs it is reduced again by twice.
The compact light bulbs hold between 6000 and 10,000 hours on average.
The new LED bulbs, such as those placed on the market this week by the producers of Philips - this company has also participated in the UN study - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a white-lighted berry, which means a reflection of the savings of the exchange plan to be applied in 100 countries.
In addition to the fact that these completely new bulbs give only very little heat, they can also work with a regulatory resistance.
And they don't contain any mercury.
Several specialists have shown that compact light sources have reserves as they contain mercury and that they must therefore be provided as a special mill, which is not always possible in the developing countries, except for producers, an adoption site is available.
The main source of mercury emissions on the planet, however, is, according to the report, not the compact light source, but rather the coal power plants that emit much more mercury to produce the electricity emitted by the white glow.
In the United States alone, these coal plants emit 25,000 tons of mercury annually.
The report details the gains that each country would make thanks to this international programme.
Indonesia would, for example, save a billion dollars annually on the purchase of electricity and eight million tonnes of CO2, which means an equivalent of 3.5 coal plants whose construction would cost Indonesia 2.5 billion.
Côte d'Ivoire is looking forward to the announcement of the election results
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has requested the "inadvertent" publication of the results of the election of the Presidential Election of the Côte d'Ivoire immediately after their deadline.
"The Secretary-General underlines the need for the independent electoral commission to receive its work and to announce the preliminary results without further delay," said a UN chief press speaker.
"He asks all parties and institutions of the Côte d'Ivoire to demonstrate their responsibilities and to include each initiative until the publication of the provisional results."
Despite pressure from certain foreign governments, the election commission had allowed the deadline set on Wednesday, three days after the Sunday election, without publication of the results.
About forty minutes before the deadline, the president of the CEI on television confirmed that the Commission would "go on working" in order to announce the results.
On Wednesday many calls from all over the world have been made, but CEI may finally call out the name of the winner of the second round of elections under the appointment of Laurent Gbagbo and his opponents Alassane Ouattara.
The Gbagbo warehouse, however, is counting on the cancellation of "striking" voting fees in the north by the Constitutional Council, which was achieved by the former Rebellion camp of the Forces nouvelles (UN) during the coup failed in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, head of the presidential campaign of the Côte d'Ivoire, had confirmed that the United Nations-led manoeuvre to intimidate voters in the north of the country had scared the President's supporters of the election.
The entire election could be annulled if the appeals brought by Gbagbo were taken into account by the Constitutional Council.
However, the Gbagbo opponents are now more of the view that the country's highest court is not neutral, since it is led by Paul Yao N'Dré, a politically closely connected with Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man of the north who disputes each connection to the former rebels, has judged the delay in the announcement of the election results as "unacceptable" and asked Gbagbo to respect them, even if he has not gone so far as to call for victory.
His allies confirmed that Gbagbo blocked the publication of the results, since he knew he had lost; and filed a complaint before the Constitutional Court, after the election commission had been prevented from publishing the results, it was illegal.
The second round of the presidential elections on Sunday was held to establish the union and reconciliation process of a country, which was split into two parts over years.
On Wednesday, the United Nations had warned the politicians of the Côte d'Ivoire that they could be held responsible for any outbreaks.
Laurent Gbagbo had enjoyed the first round of elections on 31 October with 38% of the votes against the 32% for Alassane Ouattara, which was followed by the public support of former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
Unemployment rate in France remained stable in the third quarter
The unemployment rate in France, in the sense of the International Labour Office (IAA) in the metropolis, is stable at 9.3% (under the scope of the overseas departments to 9.7%), thus showing the provisional seasonally adjusted data published on Thursday by the Federal Bureau of Insee.
The unemployment rate in the metropolis is estimated to be 2,631 million.
The second quarter showed 9.3% of the working population in the metropolis and 9.7% of those in the overseas departments.
Over the year, the unemployment rate showed an increase of 0.1 percentage points.
In the third quarter, 3.4 million employees were not employed in the French metropolis, but wanted to find work, including whether they were able to work every two weeks or not.
The situation of young people on the labour market has worsened by an increase in the unemployment rate of 24.2% in the metropolis (+ 0.9 percentage points within three months, +0.5 percentage points per year) and 25% among the overseas regions.
In the third quarter, 637,000 young people between the ages of 15 and 24 were unemployed according to the IAA.
The elderly have a slight increase in the unemployment rate of 6.4% in the metropolis (+0.2 percentage points over three months and over the year), i.e. 482,000 of the over 50-year-olds, 6.6% including the overseas departments.
Only the 25-49 years could benefit from the stability of unemployment in the third quarter; 8.3% in the metropolis (-0.1 percentage points over three months, +0.1 percentage points over one year) and 8.8% in France as a whole.
Following a dispute over its calculation procedures, the Federal Statistical Office has published the monthly unemployment figures since 2006.
On the other hand, Eurostat, the Statistical Office of the European Union, continues in this method and announced on Tuesday a quota of 9.8% in France for October (including the overseas departments) compared to 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini accused and arrested
Against Alexandre Guérini, 53, head of a relief company and brother of the President of the General Council of the Bouches-du-Rhône Region (PS), a investigation procedure was initiated and he was placed in Luynes prison near Aix-en-Provence in the course of a public and suspected investigation procedure.
Alexandre Guérini was accused of undermining company assets, misappropriation of general property, hehlerie, co-existence in corruption, illegal seizure and possession of weapons, as his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini is preparing to fight and intends to address all the questions that will be put to him by the State prosecutor rather than to spread the chirping."
"It's easy for him to submit a number of criminal charges, another thing is to prove them," said Lawyer Florence Rault of the AFP (Agency France Presse) before hearing his agent.
Mr Guérini, brother of Jean-Noël Guérini, the first man of the PS (Parti Socialist) in the department, had put the judge before his hearing by his lawyers to bring a memorial to his justification.
A member of Guérinis, Philippe Rapezzi, was also charged and arrested on Wednesday night.
According to lawyer Lucien Simon, her mandate never did anything other than keep his deposit that he had to lead.
He would never have known about the business area of competence or the destination of the related fund, Simon.
In this case also Daniel Pinna, former Director-General of the Public Service of the Aubagne Ballroom, was charged on Wednesday for subjugation and complicity, but under the obligation to stay away from the protagonists of these acts under judicial supervision.
"My mandate was able to provide explanations of the facts that were presented to him."
"The chief prosecutor took into account that he was not deprived of his freedom," said lawyer Yann Arnoux.
Four other persons were charged and were released on Wednesday night from prison, including two of them under legal supervision, as Deputy State Attorney Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, deputy manager of the disposal company Marseille Provence Metropole (MPM), is being prosecuted for "unauthorized influence and passive arrest".
Two state officials of the Ballroom Aubagne, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, were also arrested, who were arrested because of the title "Reduction and Disposal of General Good by an officer of the Public Service", the other because of "depositment of public money".
The life-threatening of Alexandre Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, was also charged with the "helrich and undermining of society's assets".
The persons who were confronted by Guerini are amongst Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently detained because of a similar case of fraud by the public who had affected Corsica.
The prisoners suspect his company to have contributed to washing money from "high" criminal circles.
The investigation against X due to the need for fraud in the award of public contracts, particularly in the area of disposal, will be conducted in April 2009 by means of an anonymous letter in the files of several open procedures.
It is from close sources that the survey focuses on the conditions of the grant and the operation of a depot in La Ciotat, which is also waste from the Aubagne area, as well as from certain cities of the urban area of Marseille (MPM).
Case Clotilde Travel: the Elysée-Palast exceeds its central function for Syria
Within more than six months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, a young French researcher who was held in Iran because of the "spionage", the French public in spirit, moved diplomacy in alarming society and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
This is all under the eye of the United States diplomats.
The American documents received by WikiLeaks and reviewed by the newspaper "Le Monde" give some reasons for this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée had explained to the Americans its strategy, which went so far as to give these advice to deal with their own crisis of "interventions" in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how the French leaders have tried to convince Washington that the liberation of the young French people does not have the release of Majid Kakavand, a prisoner in France and the US Justice, because of trade in materials in favour of the Iranian nuclear programme.
Finally, they set out the way in which the French Presidency has tried to manipulate the media for the purpose of making this idea credible, the Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad played a central role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss, in a great light.
In fact, he had done nothing in this regard.
A diplomat telegram edited in Paris on 12 August 2009 bears the title "Iran: French comments on how to deal with hostages".
François Richier, Elysée-advisor in strategic issues, is involved with Patrice Paoli, Director of Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explained to her the French method.
They called on the Americans to put everything back in order to bring back their own nationals who would be held violent in Iran.
"Power noise," they said, "articulates loud and clear and without delay" the words "basic human rights", "indemnity", "sudden release" in the media.
This is necessary to bring the Iranian regime to the fore, which is very sensitive to its image.
"Do this more, especially ask the Iranians not to do it."
Because "students solve nothing", past the debate attempts on infallible ways, the Iranians are "masters in exchangeovers".
Mr Richier added that the arrest of foreigners was a "current, Iranian tactic" for political repression.
He announces the release of Clotilde Reiss from prison (which was due on 16 August, on the day she ran into the French embassy) "requires the payment of a large sum of money to the Iranians" (230,000 Euro bail).
And he let it be said that the Elysée anticipates other ghosts, a phenomenon that will "strengthen itself".
The Iranians could "in the near future arrest another of the approximately 1,800 French citizens living in Iran," he said.
August 28, 2009.
Clotilde Reiss was released from prison 12 days ago, but will continue to be held in Iran.
An information was transmitted: Iran's Majid Kakavand, whose delivery to Iran was requested by the United States for illegal trade in sensitive electronic material, was released after a judge's decision in Paris.
The American message is like many other observers, questions about this disturbing coincidence.
The release of Majid Khakavand is a bad news for Washington, following the illegal Iranian networks of the acquisition of the nuclear material for the programme.
Did France buy a cow trade?
The liberation of Iran from those of the French?
On 4 September, Mr Richier confirmed that this was not the case.
The Elysée, he says, was not only "fully surprised by the judge's decision", but he also tried to argue against it.
"There has been a real exchange between the French Presidency and the French Minister of Justice" (now Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot change the ruling," he explains.
Mr Richier would also like to point out that Majid Kakavand is still under "string" supervision of the French secret service.
The Elysée consultant selects a telephone number, re-enters, so informs the American diplomat, the Iranian "is currently in the buildings led by the Iranian embassy in Paris".
During the custody of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elysée did not like to make his efforts, through speech and by the media organized "flight trials", to make the Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad play a "significant" and "influential middle role".
The Americans do not observe this activity without irony and find that manipulation bears fruit, as several press articles reflect the official French version.
A telegram dating from August 25, 2009 describes "the media flash of the French authorities".
On what is so much "thank you" based against Mr Assad, the Paris message is asked.
"In spite of their declarations of praise, the French authorities secretly state that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians have actually done."
The document thus deals with the reasons why the Elysée had brought this fiction to fall.
The intensive communication efforts "will aim to confirm Sarkozy's policy of opening towards Syria", he analyzes.
A 2008 policy was launched, which was "by many critics in France and abroad as early and undeserved".
"The Syrian role building up" tries Paris "to lead Syria in front of the eyes of what can be achieved by playing a constructive role in the region".
It is also intended to "send lust between Syria and Iran".
The American message knows this from a good source.
On August 11th, François Richier trusted her: "Of course, we don't know whether the Syrians have ever done anything."
"But we have thanked them for everything."
"This should at least create confusion in the Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returns to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives her in Elysée.
In a communiqué, he thanked the president of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in the release of our countrymen".
No online games for young Koreans by midnight
The South Korean government will adopt a law called "the Aschenbrüdel", which will forbid young people to play after midnight online games by blocking their access, so stated government officials.
A draft legislation that calls on online game operators to refuse access to these games by 16 years after midnight, will be submitted to Parliament in December, represented by representatives of the Ministry of Culture and Family.
"Many children play these games all night long and thus have difficulties with learning in school and also to lead a normal life over the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep," said Jo Rin, with this draft law, a trusted minister of the French press agency Agency France Presse.
The online games will then be available again from 6 a.m.
For a year the companies had time to prepare for the application of the law, as he pointed out.
The government also insists on asking the manufacturers, which granted them access to these games on a daily basis, to tear down the young people whose parents ask for it, added the responsibility.
It will also provide free software to those who wish to provide it, allowing them to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries, and the newspapers regularly report various events related to intensive Internet use.
The country is also an unrelenting champion in online game competitions worldwide.
In November, South Korea had won over 58 other nations four gold medals in the World Cyber Games.
World Championship 2018-2022: FIFA appoints the developing country
The FIFA Executive Committee, on Thursday, will be very excited about the world championships 2018 and 2022, with the highest political choice in which the range of influence and lobbying threaten the technical criteria in the background.
However, one thing is certain: the 2018 issue of FIFA's royal discipline will take place in Europe, its traditional high-school (the 4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, the Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 edition will then be somewhat more exotic; the International Football Association hopes to be able to win new territories (Catar, Australia) for itself after the 2010 premiere on the African continent, or to continue to pursue its deployment in the United States or in Fernost (Japan, South Korea).
The list of persons belonging to the delegation (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch government chief, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) provides the measure of the economic and political use of a world championship.
So the machines behind the bullets threaten to stop until the last minute.
Otherwise, it's hard to set up a hierarchy of candidates.
According to the FIFA evaluation report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) have better arguments than their competitors.
But these considerations will not be so important for the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the time of the election.
The Sunday Times, which was at the beginning of the revelations, with the suspension of two members of the Executive Committee (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), would also have been able to ruin the chances for their own country, the stage of the football, which could only be the only one time the World Championship was adjourned, namely 1966.
The BBC had given it back on Monday by issuing a documentary report, which took over three influential members of the committee, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Reason enough to upset FIFA and bring the English leaders to the fore, who, in the first place, had engaged in intensive lobbying with David Cameron in these last weeks.
The Chief of Government hopes for a re-establishment of the chess which was achieved by his predecessor Tony Blair, who had achieved the organization of the 2012 Olympic Games in London in 2005.
Would this intensive use be sufficient to reassess the image of England before the Committee?
Nothing is less certain, as Duo Spain-Portugal does not miss a trip with its already finished stages, its expertise (WM 82 in Spain, the Olympic Games 92 in Barcelona, EM 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
However, the economic and financial shadow sides of the two countries could dampen their ambitions.
The possible reprisals against the English and the doubts about the Solvency of Spain and Portugal increase the chances of Russia, which, despite its gaps in the folder (stations, hotels, transport), has become a major outside.
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, however, has decided that the inadvertent opposition to the restrictions of the English press "a unfair competition in the preparation of the vote" has been challenged by the members of the committee.
"It's crazy, you're trying to compromise it," said Putin.
For 2022 the United States, strengthened by the experience of 1994, seemed to be the logical favorites.
The country seems to have a long list of advantages for Japan and South Korea, which have separately set up a very beautiful project.
However, these new candidatures seem to be early for two countries that had organised the competitions in 2002.
Another threat: the approval of the 2026 WM by FIFA for China, which would allow the Asian odds to fall short of 2022.
With Australia and Qatar, which had brought all the registers with the expectation of futuristic stages, FIFA pursues its expansion towards new areas, but these two countries pose a greater risk, because certainty.
As well as Japan and South Korea, Australia could suffer from the lack of television rights (due to time shifts) that the FIFA is experiencing.
Second mandate: transparency
De Gaulle really had the attitude.
In the middle of the day, he had to believe that he was cutting.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac didn't show the least.
And Nicolas Sarkozy is less than this.
A mandate in Elysée calls for the next.
The current head of state will be ergo candidate in 2012.
But the transparency of the mystery that holds the Presidency's function is not good at face value.
So you have to do as much as you can if there's any doubt.
In one, as in the other.
In 2006, the followers of Jacques Chiracs indicated that a third mandate would not be excluded without believing it.
On 15 November, Nicolas Sarkozy made sure to make his decision "sometimes in the autumn of 2011".
The fact that he would put the perspective of "two mandates" in front of the UMP parliamentarians at the Elysée on Tuesday evening had therefore spread a little feverishness.
Was that the official announcement of his candidacy?
That's a long way off.
The President only recalled that the 2008 amendment to the Constitution limited the number of five years of office to only two.
He made a statement, no announcement.
It is not the first time that he mentions the presidential election on the occasion of such meetings in a humorous tone.
"You've been with me for seven and a half years, or at best," he explained to them in July 2009.
A new one in May 2010: "Don't believe I don't think about the phase after that."
His words from before no longer make him a candidate than in the morning; but no less.
If they call out comments, then for a double reason.
The acceleration of the race around the candidacy with the PS on one side.
However, it is not the recording of the competition with Ségolène Royal, which Nicolas Sarkozy is driving to reveal itself.
On the contrary, it is its apparent candidacy in 2012, which urged many members of the PS earlier than accepted to fight.
The bad surveys on the other side.
For the first time, right-wing voters would prefer a candidacy by François Fillon of Nicolas Sarkozy (46%) against 44%, according to the BVA-L'Express survey.
"We have a candidate, and there is no discussion with the UMP about it," the Prime Minister responded immediately and cautiously.
"If he could find a defeat, he would not be a candidate," says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will always believe in it to be able to win," corrects Alain Juppé, who has fallen away with the obvious.
Euro: the ECB is forced to maintain its purchases of state paper
The last meeting of the ECB Central Bank last year should offer opportunities to identify how to emerge from the crisis, or at least to announce a large number of non-conventional monetary policy measures to be completed by the end of the year.
The crisis of European public debt requires that the central bank in Frankfurt cannot without doubt bring about even the present, more tense situation on European bond markets, in order not to cause them to deteriorate.
The political costs would be too high.
On the occasion of a press conference yesterday, the French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde welcomed the active role taken by the ECB in the resolution of Europe's budgetary debt.
It did not hesitate to say whether it was the opinion that the central bank could do more, for example by charging its program of procurement of State bonds.
"I keep my thoughts before my European trading partner (...)".
Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB in Brussels on the occasion of his hearing by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament, did not show much interest in his plans, but rather took the opportunity to point out that the programme of purchases of state papers on the secondary market would be "further" and that at the meeting on Thursday, we will "see how the decisions are being made".
Only certainty: The ECB will make its leadership unchanged at 1%, the historically lowest level since May 2009.
In practice, the purchases of bonds by the Chamber of Treasures from the ECB were doubled to approximately EUR 1.35 billion last week.
And according to the indications of some traders, they were to have made new purchases yesterday on Irish and Portuguese state papers.
Overall, the Eurosystem central banks have purchased 67 billion euros since May 2010.
The sellers do not hesitate to anticipate a continuation of the purchase price (see page 29).
The peoples are no longer waiting for a remarkable change in course.
If the borrowings are already disbursed from the ECB's arsenal for more than three months, the latter will be made available to the unlimited reserves of money, over a period of one week to three months.
The public authorities are already insisting that this measure will be extended for a few months.
"I cannot imagine that the ECB will change its programme in a substantial way".
" Otherwise she would take the risk of triggering new tensions in the short term," says Michael Schubert, a member of the Commerzbank.
"A progressive exit seems more likely to me for the course of the first quarter of 2011," says Norbert Brams, Volkswirt at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In the area of their intervention on the public debt market, "the ECB maintained such a volume of purchases of bonds that the market is experiencing," Norbert Brams added.
In view of the relevance of the exposed position of the European banks on the markets of sovereign debt in the euro area, the central bank has no choice but to retain its presence on the market.
"They must enter and act at any price to the sellers of the missing investors in order to prevent the early enthusiasm for the income paid to the weakest states," a significant bond holder testified yesterday.
For if the interest rates were to be applied to the high-level flight, the States would be even more prevented from reducing their debt or only stabilizing it.
This is the price to protect the euro.
The government of Berlusconi goes to Italy to cover
After a worrying start for Italy last night, the situation was a little relaxed with the fall of the peaks to 10 years.
A return to the pitiful silence.
At the end of the meeting with the Minister of Economic Affairs, the regional president, Giulio Tremonti, had qualified the situation as "uncountable" and had heard it with a "unpredictable" weekend, which the person concerned immediately depreciated.
On Tuesday, the stock exchange with the German interest rates would have reached its 210 basis points record and the prices of the contracts for the coverage of the competition risk increased to 263 points, resulting in some headerlessness in Rome.
Silvio Berlusconi pointed out to his Council of Ministers that Spain's discretion over the German interest rates is at 400 basis points.
His right hand, Gianni Letta, however, had expressed itself as "heavily concerned" with the "market turbulences" and a possible risk of collision with Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third national economy of the Eurozone, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that Italy is like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, Volkswirt at Hudson Institute.
In Putuxt, the problem is that the absence of economic growth and the resulting, desperate tax revenue that threatens the State can no longer meet its financing needs.
The last Brussels forecasts were a cold shower for the government.
In the future, an Italian growth of 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012 will be expected... although the budget currently under review is estimated to be 1.3%, respectively.
Under these conditions, as calculated by the EU Commission, the budget deficit will still account for 4.3% of GDP next year (as compared with the government forecast of 3.9%) and 3.5% in 2012 (as opposed to 2.7%).
That is why the call for a new budget collection that could be used after the holidays for a sum of 7 billion euros.
"If necessary, new savings must be taken," says economic examiner Olli Rehn.
For an hour, Italy will receive the support of international institutions.
"The basic feasts of the Italian economy are in order and its accounts are regulated, which we have been repeating for a long time," assures Arigo Sadun, Italian loyalties of the International Monetary Fund, which is entrusted to the IMF with Italy.
"At the moment, there are no problems, either in the short term or in the long term, as in spite of its high debt from Italy (119.2% of GDP in 2011, A. d. R.) less stabilization progress is required than in other countries," observes Pier Carlo Padoan, CEO of the OECD.
It remains the question of political instability.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion for adjournment of the Chamber of Deputies, which would allow the elections to be held at the end of March.
Thus, there is a little time before a decision on a serious crisis is taken.
Europeans are thinking about the expansion of crisis measures
Christine Lagarde said yesterday at a press conference in Paris: "I believe it has been demonstrated on Sunday afternoon and evening: Europeans are clearly united, ready and committed to defend their currency and their currency."
Although it is quite relative - the discount recorded yesterday at the European State bond interest rates was water on the mills of governments and the ECB.
However, from the beginning of normalization, the speech cannot yet be spoken.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's had announced that it could suspend Portugal's debt rating, which is probably the most effective target disc of the speculators today.
"As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political certainty, especially on banking systems," said the opinion of the peoples of the Exane BNP Paribas.
Above all, especially "political times are much slower than markets".
The European countries, which are aware of both this scourge and the danger to which they are hiding, are intensifying discussions to strengthen the already existing crisis measures.
The informal consultations between the Finance Ministers concerned and the G20 will continue well in the future.
This is also true of the meetings of Eurogroup and Ecofin at the beginning of next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
The plan includes the breakdown of non-conventional measures to strengthen the eurozone countries in the border crossing of the markets (see below).
As far as the EU Stability Fund is concerned, its Executive Director Klaus Regling has already begun his Asia tour on Tuesday in Singapore to inform investors in Fernost about developments in the crisis in Europe.
If the purpose of his visit is not expressive fundraising, he will certainly prepare the ground for this.
The first advertising expenditure from the EU Stability Fund is scheduled for next month.
Yesterday, an official U.S. representative of the Agency Reuters had entrusted the United States with a possible increase in the fund mobilised by the additional direct commitment of the IMF.
Portugal and Spain, the countries in the first series, are committed to taking structural reforms, particularly in the field of labour market organization.
Reforms to reach the savings measures, however, should show effects in the near future.
Lisbon and Madrid are on a different path than Greece and Ireland have done.
Both of them, as well as of the other, are at every price, have to ask for international aid before they have put in place their own budgetary corrections and decided on incessant structural reforms that bring them confidence.
In turn, European capital donors are concerned about the options available to accelerate the process of normalising the markets of public bonds.
Axel Weber, who was on his trip to Paris on November 24th, had come up with the idea that if the 750 billion euros mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to take up its own pocket again.
The peoples of Barclays Capital, with regard to the European public debt market entirely at the forefront of the actor, decide that an extension of around EUR 100 billion would be sufficient, "preferably" in the form of a direct liquidity gap.
This means that the European financial stabilisation mechanism is now at EUR 60 billion.
A council which has every chance to be carefully examined in the European capitals.
Especially if the market conditions are met.
Snow and ice cream: 24 departments in Orange
The snow episodes continue to cause traffic difficulties, particularly in the secondary transport networks of Brittany and threaten to affect various economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now at the alarm level Orange because of the threatening snow and ice risk.
The regions of Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienne have reached the 20 departments already at the alarm level of Orange; 18 since midnight and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, then later in the night.
According to Météo France, the intense snowshoes attract the north of the Gironde as well as the Charentes, it cuts slightly on the et Ile-de-France.
In the departments concerned, snow decks are expected from 2 to 5 cm, i.e. from 7 to 10 cm, as well as 1 to 3 cm, up to 5 cm in the Paris region.
The areas are Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and the regions Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin.
The snowfall is considerable enough to cause traffic barriers and to affect certain economic activities, says Météo France.
In the region of Côtes d'Armor, several regional roads for heavy traffic are blocked from over 7.5 tonnes, including the transport axes Guingamp-Lanion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac.
The traffic situation of the secondary traffic networks in Brittany is very difficult, according to the transport policyists who have broken down to use their own vehicle only in the event of a emergency, and the use of some TER buses has been severed all day long.
In the Picardie, school traffic was cancelled for Thursday.
No specific restrictive measures were provided for in the Wednesday.
The prefecture "needs the drivers to be careful on the roads and to adapt their driving behaviour accordingly."
The Directorate-General for Civile Aviation (DGAC) called on airlines to extend on Thursday 25% of them from Paris airport Roissy and 10% of Orly's starting flights due to the expected severe snowfall.
The DGAB recommends that passengers contact their airlines.
Gatwick Airports in southern London and the airport in Edinburgh, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro Grand Paris: first financial sketches
Since the debate on the modernisation of the transport economy on the Ile-de-France is in full swing, it accounts for billions.
At least in the discussions.
In particular, we call the 23 billion for the Metro Grand Paris to be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
In order to lead the construction of the GSP into the way, the State has raised a capital allocation of EUR 4 billion.
In the theoretical scheme, this is the sum that would enable the SGP to give part of the financial amount to its doubles in the markets.
Today it has finally come to first calculations.
The 2010 supplementary budget, which is to be reviewed this morning by the Financial Commission of the National Assembly, contains the measures provided for in order to raise the first part of this appropriation.
This is a two-way approach: the creation of a special tax on closure and higher taxation of offices in France.
First of all, Article 15 of the draft law is adopted, "for the benefit of the public-law institution Société du Grand Paris".
This is said to be: "The product of this tax is EUR 117 million per year".
Secondly, a reorganisation of existing corporate taxation is "to modernise it in order to increase it from its resulting product and to respond to this increase in Société du Grand Paris".
How much would it cost?
A puzzle.
This sum is not indicated in the text.
From the 4 billion you are far away.
"It is carried out that the tax resources will be added to the 4 billion euros of the capital allocation that will be put in place by the State and the Société du Grand Paris to and from the project," the explanatory statement is received.
The SGP does not even find this system offensive.
"Since the moment when revenue is booked (the two taxes, i.e. R.), you can cover the design over three years and then only create out of the 4 billion," it is explained.
"This will be recorded in the budget and removed after and after".
The SGP suggests that 2013 will begin to record the 4 billion for the 2014 budget.
This measure, whose four promised billions of years are still to be sought, is in danger of calling for a rather moving parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will take place on 7 December.
Missile hacker and emsy spy
The WikiLeaks affair has a double meaning.
On one side it has emerged as an obvious scandal, a scandal, which is only a scandal in the heart of public health, which governs the relationship between the states, the citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes at international level, and gives a taste for the future dominated by regression.
But let's move on to the line.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that every act created by a secret service (an x-believing nation) consists only of newspaper sections.
The "extraordinary" American discoveries about the sexual habits of Berlusconis are nothing more than what you have been able to read over months, as well as in any x-believable journal (except those whose owners are Berlusconi), and the scary caricature profile Gaddafis has been offering Cabaret artists for a long time for their sketches.
The rule that the secret files may consist only of already known news is essential to the dynamics of the secret services, and not only in this century.
If you go to a library dedicated to esoteric publications, you will find that every work (about the grid, the mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau, the temples or the rosescreuzler) exactly repeats what has already been written in previous works.
This is not only because the author of occult texts does not want to publish research (but because he did not know where to find news about the non-existent), but because those who dedicate themselves to occultism believe nothing but what they already know and confirm what they have already learned.
This is also the success mechanism of Dan Brown.
So do the secrets.
The informant is faul, and faul (or limited spirit) is also the head of the secret service ( otherwise he could be anything whatever, for example, editor at Libération), who only views as true what he recognizes.
The top secret information about Berlusconi, who sent the American message in Rome to the state dessert, was the same as those who had already published the week before.
So why was such a cancellation made for the disclosures of these files?
On the one hand, they say what every trained person already knows, that the messages - at least since the end of the Second World War and since then the heads of government can call each other or take a plane to meet for dinner - have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of some small representations, have turned into spy centers.
Any viewer of detection films knows this very well, and it doesn't happen out of a sanity that you do that to ignore this.
However, the fact that it is publicly repeated violates the task of holiness and serves to put American diplomacy in a bad light.
Secondly: The idea that an x-believing hacker can capture the secrets of the most powerful country in the world is the major blow against the prestige of the state desert.
In addition, the scandal brings less victims than the "scarfrechers" in distress.
But we dedicate ourselves to the profound nature of what has happened.
Formerly, at Orwell's times, all power could be bundled like a big brother who controlled every gesture of his understands.
Orwell's prophecy could have been fully exposed since then, where you can control any movement thanks to the phone, any transaction done, the hotel visited, the selected highway and so on; the citizen would become the total victim of the eye of power.
However, if one takes a look at what is happening today that even the secret encryptions of power can no longer escape the control of a hacker, then the control stops to be unilateral and is circular.
The power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - chosen as the sovereign - can experience the secrets of power.
But how can a power no longer be able to keep its own secrets?
It is true that Georg Simmel has already said that a real secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that any knowledge about the character of Berlusconis or Merkels is basically a secret free of secret, since it rewards the public spheres; but in the style of WikiLeaks exposes that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets, means they were to rob any power.
WikiLeaks has not done Sarkozy or Merkel wrong, but Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this restriction that has been added to such a violent power?
It is obvious that the States will no longer place any information reserved in the future online - this would be the same as an extension attached to the road.
But it is also obvious that it is impossible to keep confidential reports on the phone with the current technologies.
Nothing is easier than to find out if and when a head of state has moved on a plane and contacted one of his colleagues.
How could private and only certain relationships be maintained in the future?
I know very well that my prediction at the moment after science fiction and romantically sounds, but I see the need to imagine the government agents secretly moving on uncontrollable march routes, carrying their messages anywhere else than in the mere memory with themselves, and in addition to the few written information they have received, conveying them in the shoe bag.
The information would be stored in a single copy in closed sheets: basically the spying attempt of Watergate had less success than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology has advanced like a cancer today, that is, back.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communication, the Internet reconstructs a telegraph with (telephonic) wire.
The (analogue) video cassettes had enabled film researchers to identify a film band for band by being able to fly from back to front and all the secrets of assembly, while the (numeric) CDs today do nothing other than jump from chapter to chapter, i.e. in macroporations.
The high-speed trains take you from Rome to Milan within three hours, while this takes you three and a half hours to travel by plane.
It is therefore not unusual for politics and communication technology to return to cars and horses.
A final observation.
In earlier times, the press tried to understand what had been corrupted for secrets between the messages.
Currently, it is the messages that require confidential information from the press.
Climate: how France beautifuls its financial promises
One year after the Copenhagen Treaty, it is time to examine the compliance with the fast-released financing promises (also referred to as "Fast Start") implemented by the developing countries.
And they've already discovered the great French beauty series.
With the Copenhagen Treaty, developing countries have committed themselves to providing $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The EU has promised EUR 7.2 billion over three years, France EUR 1.26 billion (i.e. EUR 420 million per year).
On the opening of COP16, the EU has drawn up all the registers to convince its partners of the fact of its commitment to fixed-start financing: a detailed progress report from its Member States, a press conference, a large additional event, a brochure distribution.
The Operation Transparency is remarkable and is appreciated for its real value: the developing countries and civil society are happy to see all developed countries do the same at the same level of precision.
The EU announces to release in 2010 €2.2 billion, which brings it in line with its commitment of €7.2 billion in 2012.
But if you look into the detail, things are a little more complicated.
According to the Copenhagen Treaty, this money should be "new and additional" in order to ensure that additional use has been made without prejudice to public development aid.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what "new and additional" means.
While the EU Commission had proposed harmonisation, certain Member States, including France, blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the right value that he considers best.
For example, the EU Commission has chosen to guide those in 2009: international funding will be maintained and will contribute 150 million to this over three years of fast start funding.
Other countries have chosen similar benchmarks, either for the year or for conditions at the level of public development aid.
In contrast, France considered that the financing of "all new projects" of 2010 was "new and additional".
In other words, there are no benchmarks for expenditure in the previous year or at the global level of public development aid.
In concrete terms, the total amount of French support for developing countries can remain stable (or even decrease) - France proposes to comply with its commitment to "new and additional" funding.
Another crucial element is the encryption in donations and loans.
There is no rule over it, and everyone chooses his own accounting mode.
Some, such as France, find 1 borrowed € as equivalent to 1 spent €.
Obviously this is only difficult to bear: the effort is not comparable.
If it is possible to justify the use of loans for certain profitable investments (often projects linked to emission reduction based on more efficient technology) it is difficult to present the euro that is collected as an equivalent for a given euro... In addition, only the costs of lending for the capital country should be calculated as an undertaking (i.e. the equivalent of a interest rate).
But France has nothing other than the following consideration: it "respects" its commitment of EUR 420 million by taking 91.5% of the loan (EUR 389.8 million) and spending 8.5%) - see also the EU document to convince itself.
France is the only country in the EU that borrows to a large extent.
Germany calls for 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (including) to comply with their obligations to 100% with donations.
In other words, if the overwhelming majority of the European Union spends 1€ to fulfil its obligations, France will give just 10 cents and include a comparable use.
Nice hokuspocus!
All in all, France operates in its fast-start financing with a double swivel: in part with a further development of the action over time and in part with the reality of the financial use.
France manages to believe that it has issued 420 million "new and additional" million in accordance with its promises and saves 36.1 million euros.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (as it seems likely that it was Bercy who did the arbitration) could have a double negative effect; once EU internals (why do the other Member States continue with the donation if it is enough to borrow?) and then in the negotiations, because the developing countries are not completely deceived...
The chapter of the earlier funding is just a small question at a relatively short time compared to the whole of discussions on the climate.
But it could be too much of the drop in the incredible machinery of the UNFCCC.
Let's hope this won't be the case.
Whatever the case, it is imperative to learn his lesson from this first year of early financing.
First of all, France could announce a change in its type of booking for the years 2011 and 2012, in the spirit of respect for its obligations and equal justice with the other countries of the European Union.
But above all, France could bring forward the discussions on the subject of long-term financing (a different, decisive and currently discussed subject): there is no question of the "comprehensibility" or the nature of the bookkeeping of its loans.
France could change its position in order to be as progressive as it is in other matters.
The hope is therefore based on the new Minister of the Environment Koscisko-Moriset, which will be held next week in Cancun.
A surprising announcement about France's fast start and its vision of "reliability" as well as the use of loans would naturally be raised from the international base of trust, which is necessary for further discussions.
Alarm - Child Pesticide
A child of 10 years takes over the day 81 different chemical substances, a study published this Wednesday by the Association of Generations Futures (formerly movement to protect the rights and respect of future generations).
The association, which states that its results "in view of the low number of samples analysed, did not show a statistically significant value, but represent an illustration character of the problem dealt with", had usually bought a meal in the supermarkets in Oise and Paris, between July and September, within four, from a child about ten years of age, to the meals consumed.
These typical meals - including the official recommendations of five fresh fruit and fruit parts, three milk products and 1.5 liters of water per day - have been investigated as well as seams of laboratories looking for chemical substances, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The counterbalance is low: 81 chemical substances, including 42 as possible or likely cancerous and five as safe carcinogens classified, as well as 37 substances with endocrine disorder, according to studies of several institutions such as the International Cancer Research Centre.
"Even if, in the approximate whole of the cases, the legal limits for each chemical, individually absorbed substance are not exceeded, this survey is very well understood that the reality, in which the consumer may be exposed to cancerous substances or substances with endocrine disruptive factors, is of concern," notes the association.
Already during breakfast, the butter and the tea with milk already contain more than ten cancer-free residues and three safe as carcinogens, as well as more than twenty residues that can affect the hormone system.
The apple imported from Brazil, as a intermediate meal for the study, shows traces of six chemical substances, including a fungiid prohibited in France.
The same applies to the green beans from Kenya, which are included in the lunch, where the study has identified traces of a strictly prohibited insecticide in the EU.
In addition, the hackstick, the tuna fish from the buchse, even the baguade and the rubber rubber of pesticides and other chemical substances were spilt.
In the management water, the analyses revealed the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
At dinner, the salmon rod was found with 34 chemical residues at the "richest", and even the plastic tank used to heat the meal in the microwave was not unloaded.
The final risk of this "damaging cocktails" for consumers is "probably underestimated", says the study.
The Alliance Europe Ecology-Les Verts (EE-LV) has proposed "in view of the urgency of the situation" to introduce a moratorium on the use of pesticides in order to stop the increase in civilisation diseases.
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) identified the presence of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
