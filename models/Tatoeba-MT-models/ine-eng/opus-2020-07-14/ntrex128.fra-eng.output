Members of the Assembly of the country of Wales worried about "walking for puppets"
Galois electors are represented by a proposal to replace their title by the MWP seal (Member of the Welsh Parliament, Member of the Galois Parliament).
This proposal stems from the draft amendment of the name of the Assembly, which would become the Galois Parliament.
In the political sphere, members of the Assembly believe that this could be the subject of rails.
A worker's election indicated that his group is concerned that the label "Rhyme with Twp and Pwp".
For non-originating readers from Wales: in gallos, twp means stupid, and pwp means crotte.
According to one of its members, the Plaid Cymru (Party of Wales) is not "satisfied" and has proposed other formulas.
The conservative party would be "open" to a name change, but noted that between MWP and Muppet, the distance is narrow.
In this context, in Gallos, your letter speaks as the letter in English from the Yorkshire region.
The Committee of the Assembly, which is currently preparing the legislation introducing the change of name, stated that "the final decision on the appointment of members of the Assembly is to return to the latter".
The Law 2007 on the Government of Wales of Wales (2017) empowers the Galloise Assembly to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposal to appoint the Assembly as a Galois Parliament, which has been widely supported.
On the issue of membership, the Commission is thinking about Members of the Galois Parliament (or WMP), but a large majority of Gallois prefers MWP.
It seems that the members of the Assembly are making other suggestions, but the effort to reach consensus could be a real one for Elin Jones, the President of the Assembly, who should submit a draft Act on Name Change in the coming weeks.
Reform legislation will include other changes to the functioning of the assembly, including rules on the exclusion of members and the design of the committee system.
The members of the Assembly will take the final decision on the matter of name during the discussion on the draft law.
Macedonia: referendum on the change of country name
Macedonians will decide on Sunday if their country should now bear the name "North Macedonian Republic".
The popular vote was organized in an attempt to resolve a happy old age of several decades between the country and its Greek neighbour, for whom Macedonia is the name of one of its provinces.
For a long time, Athens has insisted on the fact that Macedonia's name is a claim on its territory and has repeatedly imposed its veto on its neighboring country's accession to the European Union and NATO.
The Macedonian President, Gjorge Ivanov, opposed the referendum, indicated that he would not take the results into account.
However, participants such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev maintain that the change of name is only a small price to pay to join the EU and NATO.
Harlem: churches in difficulty, St. Martin's bells reduced to silence
"The elderly people I discussed with say that traditionally there was a bar and a church at each corner of the street," says Mr. Adams.
"There is no more of it today."
According to him, it's normal for bars to be refurbished.
Today, "we don't get any more of the same, he explains.
"Before, we went to the bar like his neighbor, but that's no longer the case."
As for the churches, the funds coming from the sale of buildings will go well before the owners imagine themselves, and this concerns him: "Before or later, they will return to the home".
He added that the churches could be replaced by condominium complexes, inhabited by individuals who would not help maintain the last shrines in the neighborhood.
"The people who buy condominiums in these buildings will be most of the Whites who will hasten the closure of all churches, because they are unlikely to become members of them," he is concerned.
Before Harlem became a black metropolis, white congregations built the two churches: Metropolitan Community in 1870, and Saint Martin 10 years later.
The initial White Methodist Congregation leaves places in the 1930s.
A black congregation, preaching all around, took possession of the building.
The church of Saint Martin was resumed by a black community under the direction of the Reverend John Howard Johnson, who initiated a boycott of the 125th Street stores, one of the main commercial streets in Harlem, where the Blacks were punished for using or obtaining promotion.
In 1939, a fire destroyed the building, but the Parisians of Father Johnson were ready to rebuild and command a new carillon,
that the son and successor of the Father Johnson to the direction of the church of Saint Martin, the Reverend David Johnson, proudly called the "the bells of the poor."
Tiffany Ng, the professional who played it in July, gave him another name: "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
She also mentions that this is the first carillon in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who, 18 years ago, took place in front of the largest carillon of the Riverside church.
Mr. Merriweather says Saint Martin didn't replace it.
Over the past few months, there have been many questions about the remuneration of architects and entrepreneurs, caused by the secular elite of the church on the one hand, and the episcopal diocese on the other.
In July, the Parisian Council, a governing body composed of lay officials, informed the diocese that he was concerned that the latter wanted to impose the costs incurred, although he did not participate in the recruitment of professionals.
Some Parisians have regretted the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
California: A 13-year-old girl injured by a shark in a lobster fishing party
According to the authorities, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old last Saturday while practicing lobster fishing in California on the day of the opening of the season.
The attack occurred just before 7 o'clock in the morning near the beach of Beacon in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV, the San Diego television channel, that he had been swimming with friends since a half-hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and had to pay up to him to get him out of the water.
In the first time, Chad thought that the young boy was crying out for joy that he had taken, and then he realized that in reality he
had been bitten.
As he approached the young man, Hammel noticed that he had an open fracture of the clavicle.
"I cried for everyone to get out of the water: There's a shark!" explains Chad.
The boy was evacuated to the Children's Council Hospital in San Diego, where he is still in a critical state.
The species of shark at the origin of the attack is unknown.
At a press conference, the rescue chief Larry Giles reported that a shark had been spotted a few weeks earlier, but that it was not a dangerous species.
He added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries on the upper part of the torso.
The authorities closed access to the Ponto Beach beach in Casablanca to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours, to conduct an investigation as well as for security reasons.
Giles indicated that there are more than 135 species of sharks, but that most are considered harmless.
Sainsbury's offensive plans in the British aesthetic market
Sainsbury's hands down on Boots, SuperDrug and Debenhams and the yarns similar to those of supermarkets, filled with aesthetic and cosmetic products and managed by field specialists.
As a result of a major increase in the British aesthetic market of 2.8 billion sterling books, which continues to grow while sales of fashion and home items are falling, more beautiful products will be tested in 11 stores and applied to others if the experience is concluded.
The supermarkets today invest in the beauty market in order to re-use the space previously occupied by TV, microwave and other household items.
Sainsbury's indicated that it would increase the volume of its offers to 3,000 cosmetics items, which will for the first time include brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybellline and Burt's Bees will also have more space in similar sectors to shops such as Boots.
The supermarket also recycles its Boutique makeup line to offer a majority of products not tested on animals, which is increasingly important among young consumers.
In addition, the Fragrance Shop perfume seller will try concessions in two Sansbury's shops, the first opening last week in Croydon, in southern London, and a second of which is scheduled to open in the current year in Sely Oak (Birmingham).
Supermarket leaders have to raise their heads to attract consumers, who increasingly tend to make their online purchases and go to nearby shops for daily food products.
Mike Coupe, Director General of Sainsbury's, said that the sales points would increasingly look like large surfaces, as the supermarket chain tries to counter Aldi and Lidl discount stores by offering more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has set up Argos sales points in hundreds of shops and has also opened the doors of several Habitat stores since the purchase of the two chains 2 years ago, which, according to the group, has allowed the sale of current consumer goods to be moved and the acquisitions to be profitable.
The previous attempts to restructure the pharmaceutical and cosmetic sections of the British chain have been unsuccessful.
In the early 2000s, Sainsbury's is seeking a partnership with Boots, but it ends up following a controversy regarding the distribution of the benefits from the pharmaceuticals in the supermarkets.
It was after he sold his 281 pharmacies 3 years ago for an amount of 125 million pounds in Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds pharmaceutical chain, that the new strategy was implemented.
Lloyds had to play a role in introducing a wide range of high-quality skin care brands in 4 stores, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, trade director of Sainsbury's, announced that the appearance of beauty product rays has been modified to improve the customer framework.
"We have also invested in training so that our staff can offer advice.
Our range of brands is designed to respond to all kinds of needs and, thanks to the attractiveness of our radios and the ideal situation of our institutions, our domination of the cosmetic market is now incontrovertible and changes the purchasing habits," added Mills-Hicks.
Peter Jones' anger after the withdrawal of Holly Willoughby from an agreement of £11 million
The star's mail from Dragon's Den, Peter Jones, after the announcement of the withdrawal of the Holly Willoughby an 11 million-pound contract related to its home decoration brand, to devote itself to its new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time to deal with the brand of interior decoration and True accessories.
The activity of the two protagonists was compared to the Goop brand Gwyneth Paltrow.
By the age of 37, this Morning animator announced on Instagram that she would withdraw.
Holly Willoughby made Peter Jones angry, the Dragon's Den star, withdrawing from their fruitful textile activity and interior decoration in the last minute, to devote himself to his new exclusive contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources have stated that Jones was angry when the child loved the TV revealed, at a meeting that took place under stress at the seat of the Dragon's Den Star commercial empire in Marlow (Buckinghamshire), that his new contracts, up to 1.5 million sterling books, no longer allowed him to take care of Truly, their brand of decoration and interior accessories.
The True brand was assimilated to that of the actress Gwyneth Paltrow, Goop, and could have doubled the value of the animator's fortune estimated at £11 million.
When Willoughby, age 37, announced on Instagram that she was leaving True, Jones jumped into his private jet to join one of his secondary residences outside Britain.
According to one source, "Truly was far away one of Holly's priorities
and in turn to ensure its future for the next two decades.
His decision left everyone without a voice.
No one could imagine what was going to happen on Tuesday, the launch was so close.
Marlow's seat is filled with products ready to be sold."
Experts believe that the departure of this Morning animator, which is one of the most "bankable" celebrations in Britain, could cause millions to lose their company, due to important investments in products that go from cousins or boutiques, to interior clothing or articles, and the risk of delayed launch.
Furthermore, it could end a long friendship.
Willoughby and his husband Dan Baldwin, parents of 3 children, have been friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for 10 years.
Holly Willoughby created True with Capp in 2016; Jones, 52 years old, joined the group as president in March of the same year.
Couples shared on vacation together and Peter Jones owned 40% of the parts in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby should become the brand ambassador for M&S and will take the place of Ant McPartlin as an animation of the I'm A Celebrity of ITV.
A source near Jones said last night that he did not want to comment on his business activities.
The debate was eye-opening, but at last we worship
Trump drowned from the media that criticized him because of his comment that some judge as "indignity of a president" and to prove so positive to the North Korean leader.
"Why did President Trump yield so much?"
It's a radio, by taking a voice from a TV journalist.
"I didn't give up at all."
He indicated that Kim Jong-one had proved to be in favour of a second meeting, after Trump qualified as the first one, which took place in Singapore in June, not far from the denuclearization of North Korea.
However, negotiations on this denuclearization are at a dead end.
More than 3 months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's head of diplomacy, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders in the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday, not to see any “corresponding response” from the United States to the first disarmament measures of North Korea.
On the contrary, he regretted that the United States continued to impose sanctions to maintain the pressure.
In his talk of the Trump assembly, it offers a much more optimistic perspective.
"Everything is going well with North Korea," says the North American President.
We have broken the armed conflict.
"Millions of people would have been killed.
We now have an excellent relationship."
According to Trump, his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim led to positive results: the end of the missile shooting tests, the release of hostages and the remains of North American soldiers to their families.
He also justified his little usual approach to the relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to play the President's role, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to access this full arena to crack, there's hardly 200 standing in front of me," he criticized it by pointing finger to the crowd.
Tsunami: a devastated island and hundreds of deaths in Indonesia
After the earthquake that devastated Lombok, the help of foreign NGOs was not necessarily necessary.
More than 10% of the population in Lombok have been separated, but no state of national disaster has been determined, a condition required for the launching of international aid.
"Unfortunately, they have many times clearly stated that they did not want international help, which complicates things a little," said Mrs. Sumbung.
While the Save the Children organization has set up a team to go to Palu, she still does not know if the field work will be allowed.
The spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency, Mr. Sutopo, indicated that the Indonesian authorities had assessed the situation in Palu to determine whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to humanitarian aid.
Despite the ongoing droughts, the country lacks the resources to cover its natural capricles.
There were shelters in Aceh, but they rarely take place in other coastal areas.
Although a warning has been issued, no alarm siren has been detained in Palu, which has undoubtedly contributed to human loss.
Even under ideal conditions, moving from one Indonesian island to another is not a simple thing.
Natural disasters make the use of transport more complex.
A hospital ship that had been sent to Lombok to care for the victims is now on its way to Palu, but it will need at least 3 days to reach the places of the new disaster.
The Indonesian President, Joko Widodo, placed the reform of the infrastructure at the centre of his electoral campaign and spent considerable sums to restore roads and railways.
The lack of funds, however, has led the government of Mr. Joko to represent itself before the voters next year.
The Indonesian head of state is also under pressure from the persistence of interethnic tensions in the country, where members of the Islamic majority exercise their faith more conservatively.
More than a thousand Indonesians have lost their lives and tens of thousands have been chased from their homes, on the basis of confrontations in the streets between Christians and Muslims, weapons of machetes, bows and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.

The balloon flew over the repair surface before heading to the upper right corner of the row.
The ball is finished by reaching Kepa Arrizabalaga and ends its path to the bottom of the cage.
"I was just trying to put myself in, get me out of the ball, but players like Shaq always take away as far as possible, so I tried to make a maximum of time," Sturridge confides in LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante approaching to control and without really much thought I decided to shoot."
Chelsea took 1 to 0 at mid-time after a target of the Belgian star Eden Hazard at 25 minutes.
The Blues attacker has scored a passage towards Mateo Kovacic, before heading towards the countryside and sprinting side of Liverpool.
Kovacic achieves a rapid going and coming in the middle of the field,
Then he made a magnificent shot in the depth that kind of Hazard in the surface.
Hazard passed the defense and finished his race in the row of the second pole, with a left foot arrow behind the Liverpool porter, Alison Becker.
Liverpool will face the Napolitians in the group phase of the League of Champions, Wednesday at 3 p.m. at the San Paolo de Naples Stadium, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europe League at 3:00 this Thursday in London.
Indonesia: the number of Tsunami victims rose to 832
The disaster management agency indicated on Sunday morning that the earthquake and tsunami account for 832 deaths.
Many inhabitants are trapped under the ruins of buildings destroyed by the earthquake of a magnitude of 7.5 that swept the country on Friday and triggered waves of 6 metres high, informed the spokesperson of Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at a press conference.
With more than 380,000 inhabitants, the city of Palu was surrounded by ruins of ruined buildings.
Police arrests a 32-year-old man suspected of arresting a woman
A murder investigation was opened after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead (Messeyside) this morning.
At 0755, the 44-year-old woman was discovered on John de Grayson Mews Street, and a 32-year-old man suspected of murder was arrested.
The police urge the inhabitants of the neighborhood who would have seen or heard something to give their testimony.
The captain of the police, Brian O'Hagan, made the following statements: "The investigation is just about to begin, but I would like to ask anyone who was around John Street in Birkenhead and who would have seen or heard whatever it was suspected of contacting us.
In particular, I call on taxi drivers, who could have caught something on their dashcam and asked them to provide us with any crucial information for our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the murdered woman was found in a Birkenhead property in which she lived.
This morning, people claiming to know the woman came to the crime scene and asked questions about where she was found.
The investigation is under way and the police have indicated that she informed the relatives of the victim.
A taxi driver just refused access to his apartment in Grayson Mews, the police not letting anyone in or out of the building.
The news left him without a voice.
The residents have just been informed that the building would be inaccessible for several hours.
A police officer trusted that the entire sector was considered a crime scene.
A woman in tears appeared on the spot,
saying, "It's too horrible."
At 2:00 a.m., two police vans were placed inside the cordon, and another outside.
Several officers were monitoring the building on the inner side of the cordon.
Anyone with information is requested to send a message to @MerPolCC, to call 101 or to contact the Echec crime organization anonymously at 0800 555 111, indicating the register 247 of 30 September.
Parliament: Cromwell's statue, the last victim of an attempt to rewrite history
His ban would be the just return of things, given the acts of destruction, of countless religious and cultural property in England, committed by his Puritan supporters, such as the fanatic Taliban.
However, the Cromwell Society considers Mr. Crick's proposal as "degradable" and called it a "revisionist attempt".
The president of the Cromwell Society, John Goldsmith, said that, "in view of the current debate about the withdrawal of statues, it was obvious that Oliver Cromwell's stand-up before the Westminster Palace was not to be spared.
Cromwell has neither ordered nor led the iconoclasm during English civil wars.
It is likely that his person was sacrificed for the actions of his father Thomas during the previous century.
The wonderful representation of Cromwell, sculpted by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, testifies to his consideration of the 19th century and belongs to the history of a personality that many of us still celebrate."
Mr. Goldsmith said the following to Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more by the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of Parliament against external pressure, I mean of course the monarchy.
The fact that this representation is accurate or not is a continuous historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict that erupted in the middle of the 17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a particularly recognizable figure that represents a side of the fracture.
Its fulfillment as Lord Protector also deserves to be highlighted and commemorated."
China: a cock kills a lift
According to local media, a farmer was attacked and killed by a cochon in a South-East China market.
Identifyed as Mr. Yuan, the man was found dead, the blood-thirsty and blood-covered artery close to a market pig in Liupanshui in the province of Guizhou, indicated on Sunday the South China Morning Post.
A pig breeder prepares to inject pigs vaccines into a pig farm, on May 30, 2005 in Xining in the Province of Qinghai (China).
He would have traveled with his cousin from Yunnan's neighbouring province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that a door to the neighborhood was open.
He claims that a huge male pig was inside and that blood was dripping from his neck.
A medical report confirms that the animal weighing 250 kg has mutated the child to death.
According to Guiyang Evening News, Mr. Wu, the cousin of the climber, said that "his legs were broken and covered with blood."
The security cameras show Mr. Yuan arriving on the market at 0440 on Thursday to feed his animals.
His body was discovered about an hour later.
The pig at the time of Mr. Yuan's death was not part of the lift or his cousin.
A market manager gave Evening News that the animal was sick to avoid any other incident and to allow police officers to collect evidence.
Mr. Yuan's family and market leaders would be negotiating compensation.
Although the facts are rare, pigs attacks against individuals have already been reported.
In 2016 in a Massachusetts farm, a pig assaulted a woman and her husband, seriously hurting the latter.
Ten years earlier, a 295 kg pig started a galloon lift on his tractor before his wife managed to get away from it.
In 2012, while a grower from Oregon had just been eaten by his cocoons, a Manitoba farmer said to CBC News that it is not basically an aggressive animal, but that the taste of blood can cause this type of behavior.
"These are animals rather than players,
Very curious guys... they have no intention of doing anything wrong.
It is enough to show them the respect they deserve," he assures.
The remains of the Rosa hurricane should cause severe precipitation in the South-East of the United States
According to forecasts, the Rosa hurricane is weakened as it moves above the coldest waters on the north-east coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will provide warnings in the north-east of Mexico and the south-west of the United States during the coming days.
The winds were blowing at 135 km/h (oruragan category 1) since 5 o'clock in the morning, hours of the East Sunday, while Rosa was 620 km south-west of Punta Eugenia (Mexico).
The hurricane should move north on Sunday.
During this time, depression begins to form above the Pacific Ocean and circle to the east, to the west coast of the United States. As it approaches the Basse-California Peninsula in the form of storm, the hurricane Rosa will cause intense tropical humidity to the North, in the south-west of the United States.
It will fall to 25 cm of rain in regions of Mexico this Monday.
Then, the tropical humidity combined with the approaching depression will create torrential rains in the south-west during the coming days.
At the local level, precipitations reaching between 2.5 and 10 cm will result in sudden roughness, debriefings and potential landslides in the desert.
The arses will reach a rate of 5 to 7.5 cm per hour per place, especially in the south of Nevada and Arizona, due to the intensity of tropical humidity.
It should fall between 5 and 10 cm of rain in regions of the south-west, including a large part of Arizona.
Dispersed tropical rains may cause sudden floods and rapid deterioration of the conditions.
It is strongly discouraged to enter the desert on foot because of the threat of tropical precipitation.
Heavy rains could turn the canyons into depleted rivers and hurricanes will produce winds and dust turbines by location.
The approaching depression will result in abundant local rains in some southern regions of the country, on the California coast.
The rainy totals can reach more than 1.3 cm, which could give rise to low-cooled debris and make the shoe smooth.
This could be the first rains of the dry season in the region.
Dispersed tropical storms will reach Arizona on Sunday at the end of the day and early Monday morning, then intensify later Monday and Tuesday.
Strong precipitation will reach the four corners of the country on Tuesday and last until Wednesday.
Major changes in temperature are expected for the month of October through the United States due to the cooling of the Arctic, but the tropical climate will remain warm,
which sometimes causes a radical change of time over short distances.
The central region of the United States, which will be subject to significant temperature differences on Sunday, is a perfect example.
Between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, or between Saint Louis and Des Moines (Iowa), the difference is almost 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, a persistent summer heat will try to infiltrate and intensify again.
A major part of the centre and east of the United States should be at the beginning of October hot months, with temperatures around 26 degrees covering the plains of the south and other parts of the north-east.
The mercury could reach 26 degrees in New York on Tuesday, about 10 degrees above the average season.
Estimates over several days indicate that temperatures should be higher than the average in the east of the United States during the first 15th of October.
Brett Kavanaugh's trial attracts more than 20 million viewers
Transmitted on 6 television channels on Thursday, Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused her of having sexually assaulted her in the 1980s, were followed by more than 20 million people.
While the lost political impasse, the broadcasting services interrupted their usual Friday program to announce a coup of theatre: an agreement by Jeff Flake, the Senator of Arizona, to allow the FBI to conduct an investigation into the charges for a week.
In front of the Senate Judicial Commission, Christine Ford made sure that Kavanaugh, under the influence of alcohol, had been exposed to attacks on her person and had tried to remove her clothes during a night between high school students.
Kavanaugh, in a passionate stroke, also claimed to be certain to 100 % that it had never happened.
According to a Nielsen report, the trial probably reached an audience of more than 20.4 million.
The company calculated the number of TV viewers from CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers of other channels spreading the trial, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
Moreover, Nielsen is not always able to estimate the number of people watching the TV at the office.
As a comparison, the trial has attracted as many people as a football match or Oscars.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, whose animators have widely supported the appointment of Kavanaugh, was the most watched channel on the day of the hearing, with an average of 5.69 million viewers.
ABC held second place with an audience of 3.26 million.
CBS (3.1 million), NBC (2.94 million), MSNBC (2.89 million) and CNN (2.52 million), always according to Nielsen.
The interest did not weaken once the hearing was completed.
Flake was at the center of the drama that was playing on Friday.
After the Office of the moderate Republican published a communiqué that he would vote for Kavanaugh, the CNN and CBS cameras staged a scene in which the senator was taking part by demonstrators while he was trying to take the elevator to the hearing of the judicial commission.
Flake lowers his eyes for several minutes, while CNN retransmits the sequence of intruder live.
"Don't look elsewhere, look at me," launches one of the women.
"Do you really believe he's telling the truth?
You hold power while so many women are demonized. ”
Before the elevator's doors were referred to, Flake indicated that his office had issued a statement and that it would be more appropriate at the committee meeting.
All cabled and broadcast network chains would cover the meeting a few hours later, while the Judicial Committee was preparing to vote on the procedure to advance the appointment of Kavanaugh throughout the Senate.
Flake indicated, however, that a one-week investigation should first be conducted by the FBI on charges against the candidate, as minority democrats claimed.
Flake left in part convinced by discussing with his friend, the Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
He made his decision after being held with Coons and several other senators later.
His choice weighed heavily on the balance, as the Republicans would not have actually obtained the votes to approve the appointment of Kavanaugh without a preliminary investigation.
President Trump authorized the FBI to investigate Brett Kavanaugh's sexual assault charges.
Great Britain: May accuses opponents in Brexit of making the "small policy"
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused the detractors of his project to leave the European Union, to make the "small policy" to the detriment of the future of Great Britain and national interest.
May arrived at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham on 29 September 2018.
In another trade with the newspaper, which published a photo of Theresa May in cover, his former Foreign Minister, Boris Johnson continued his attacks on Chequers' plans, claiming that the proposal for free trade between Great Britain and the European Union was "resolutely ridiculous".
Wade Sims: The police arrested Dyteon Simpson, suspected of being the origin of the LSU player's death
The police arrested a suspect from the fatal shooting that led to the death of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, a 20-year-old, was also beaten and charged with murder at the second level, reported Baton Rouge's police service.
The authorities published a video of Sims and Simpson's confrontation, and the police indicated that Sims had lost his glasses during the altercation.
Found at the scene of the crime, the glasses wore Simpson's DNA, according to WAFB, a subsidiary of the CBS group.
During his interrogation, Simpson admitted to the police being responsible for Wade's death.
According to his lawyer, his bail was set at $350,000.
The law firm in Baton-Rouge parish issued a preliminary report on Friday, which determines that death was caused by a wound by a bullet that crossed the head and settled in the neck.
The police service recognizes the assistance received by the Fugitive Task Force of Louisiana State, the medical laboratory of the state police, the South University police and citizens in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU's sports director, Joe Alleva, thanked the forces of the order for their "commitment and demand for justice".
It was only 20 years old.
1.98 m for 98 kg, the player grew up in Baton-Red, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at LSU.
On average, it scored 5.6 points and performed 2.6 rounds per match during the last season.
Friday morning, Will Wade, LSU basketball coach said the team was "damaged and under shock" after Wade's death news.
“We’re always going back on this kind of event,” Wade lamented.
Mexico : a volcano crack of the ashes
From the ashes away from the Volcano Popocatepetl reached the southern quarters of the capital of Mexico.
On Saturday, the National Disaster Prevention Centre recommended that Mexicans withdraw from the volcano after recording a peak of activity in the crater, with 183 gas and ashes emissions within 24 hours.
The center was monitoring several earthquakes and earthquakes from Popocatepetl.
On social networks, the images showed fine layers of ash covering car bristles in Mexico City districts, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in the activity at the level of the volcano at 72 km from the capital, since an earthquake of a magnitude of 7.1 swept the center of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, named Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Catalonia: Coping with separatists in the approach of the voting anniversary for independence
On Saturday, six arrests took place in Barcelona after clashes between independent protesters and the anti-emulsion police, while thousands of opponents joined protests to mark the first anniversary of the referendum that divided Catalonia.
Before being repulsed by anti-emetic policemen, masked separatists threw eggs and colored powder, creating dust clouds in the streets, which usually do not meet tourists.
Swallows also exploded later in the day, while the police used mattresses to contain the confrontations.
For several hours, groups in favour of independence that were "forgetting, and forbearance" faced unionist parties calling "long life in Spain".
14 demonstrators who had minor injuries were treated according to the local press.
One year after the referendum on 1 October, held illegal by Madrid, but celebrated by Catalans that favour separation, tensions remain in the independent region.
A overwhelming majority of voters chose independence, despite a low rate of participation, the opponents of the section having largely boycotted the referendum.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to prevent Catalans from accessing poll offices in the region.
Independent groups had camped on Friday night to block a demonstration of support for the national police.
It was all the same place, but it was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who participated with his wife in the separatist demonstration, said he no longer had any hope for Catalonia's independence.
"We were witnesses last year of a great time.
My parents would be happy to be able to vote, but now we are in an impasse," he laments.
Despite their capital victory, although small, regional elections last December, the independent Catalan parties have had a hard time maintaining their membership this year, with many popular leaders being exiled or detained waiting to be judged to have organized the referendum and declared the independence of Catalonia.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who films the police demonstration on her phone, believes that politicians are responsible for blocking the situation, on the one hand, and on the other.
"Tension only makes you up," he regrets.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the 9 Catalan leaders in prison, announced his intention to present his candidacy to the European Parliament's elections next year.
"This is the best way for me to denounce the regression of democratic values and the repression that the Spanish government has done," he added.
Arrest in Londonderry : Men hit a house in the car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after several hours on a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 19:30 a.m. local time.
Police Captain Bob Blemmings indicated that the doors and walls were damaged.
The car would also have received arrow shots.
Livingston wins the match 1 to 0 against Rangers thanks to Menga
Dolly Menga's first goal ensures Livingston's victory
Recently upgraded, the Livingstone team surprised the Rangers by imposing a second victory in 18 matches in Steven Gerrard, the current coach of the Ibrox Club.
The purpose of Menga made the difference and allowed Gary Holt's team to place itself in 2nd position of the ranking, equal to Hibernate.
Gerrard's men are deprived of victory outside of Primership this season, and must confront the Hearts team on Sunday, which has 8 points.
But first, the Rangers will meet the Rapid of Vienna on the occasion of the League of Europe this Thursday.
With regard to the Livingston team, it has extended its course of 6 matches in the division, and its main coach Holt, who has been replacing Kenny Miller since last month, may be concerned with not having lost the least meeting yet.
Livingston missed an opportunity to face angry opponents
Holt's team could have made progress well before marking, as their direct approach put the Rangers in trouble.
Scott Robinson tried to hunt, but was stuck in front of the opponent's goal; followed a late intervention by Alan Lithgow, on a head pass by Craig Halkett.
The Livingston team allowed the Rangers to own the balloon, knowing that it could generate them by working tactics.
That's where the decisive goal is.
The Rangers gave a free shot and Livingstone tried to open up; Declan Gallagher and Robinson allied themselves to conjure Menga, who took a touch and entered a target of the ground.
At this stage, Rangers dominated the game, but they faced an impenetrable defense and target guard Liam Kelly was rarely concerned.
The second half recognizes the same rhythm, although Alfredo Morelos has forced Kelly to stop.
The Rangers' Guardian Allan McGregor stopped a hit by Scott Pittman, while Lithgov managed to play one of Livingstone's plans.
The Guardian of Livingston rejected all attempts and protected his cadre, while two sentences were refused by the arbitrator, one for the provocation of Halket directed against Glenn Middleton and the other for a mistake of hand.
Livingston’s “Penome ” Analysis
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland, Tony Macaroni Arena
A performance and results maturing for Livingstone.
They have all been excellent and continue to surpass expectations on this rising slope.
Their style and composition of the team have practically not changed since their return to the summit, but merit largely returns to Holt for having motivated a team since their arrival
who has many big players.
The defense of Captain Halkett was grand and wonderfully organized, and Menga was able to hold Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall in a hall during the game.
Unfortunately, the Rangers were not inspired.
Despite a good level achieved with Gerrard, they were not at the height of their past talent.
They missed a last chance and failed to lose the opposite side only once; this is a warning for the Rangers, who are in the middle of the table.
Mitigated home of President Erdogan in Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, Turkish and German leaders met around a breakfast in Berlin in a relaxed atmosphere.
This was the last day of the controversial visit by President Erdogan to Germany to improve relations between NATO allies.
Several issues have been addressed, such as human rights, freedom of the press or Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then headed for Cologne for the inauguration of one of the largest mosques.
One of the most important Turkish communities abroad lives in this city.
Invoking security reasons, the police prevented 25,000 protesters from meeting in front of the building, while many participants were able to approach to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, mostly Kurdish, made their voices heard, condemning both the policies of Erdogan and the German government's decision to host it in its country.
The clavage that emerges from protests reflects this double vision of Erdogan: a visitor welcomed in heroes by some Germans of Turkish origin and qualified as autocratic by others.
Road accident in Deptford: a cyclist dies following a collision with a car
In London, a cyclist died in a collision involving a car.
The accident occurred around 10:00 a.m., near the junction between Beswod Street and Evelyn Street, a frequent route from Deptford to the south-east of the city.
The driver of the vehicle stopped, the rescues arrived on site, but the man died at the site of the accident.
This accident occurred several months after the death of a cyclist on Chiders Street, about 1.5 km from the accident that took place on Saturday.
The London police said that the officers were implementing everything to identify the individual and prevent his or her loved ones.
Roads have been closed and bus deviations have been introduced. Car drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Prison Long Lartin: 6 agents injured in an emergency
The prison officer for high-security men stated that six prison officers had been injured in an emergency.
The escape began in the HMP Long Lartin prison, located in Worcestershire, about 09:30 a.m. local this Sunday. It is still not under control.
Anti-emulsion officers were sent to unlock the situation, involving 8 detainees and contained in a prison wing.
On the spot, the agents were treated for minor facial injuries.
A prison management spokesperson stated: "The specially trained personnel were deployed to restore the order in the HMP Long Lartin prison.
Six officers were taken care of for injuries.
We will not tolerate violence in our prisons, and those responsible will have to respond to the police authorities and be able to see their sentences prolonged."
More than 500 prisoners, including criminals considered to be the most dangerous in the country, are imprisoned in the HM Long Lartin prison.
In June, the prison manager was hospitalized as a result of an assault by a prisoner.
In October last year, anti-emulsion agents were sent to prison to cause a serious disturbance: prisoners attacked staff with billiard balls.
Uuragan Rosa: Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City threatened by sudden cruelness (which could be beneficial for drought-affected areas)
It is rare that tropical depression affects Arizona, but that is what is likely to happen at the beginning of next week. Oragan Rosa is heading towards the desert of the southwest with what remains of energy. This region could be affected by sudden cruelness.
The National Weather Service has already issued a flood warning for Monday and Tuesday for the west of Arizona, south and east of Nevada, south-east of California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa should head directly to Phoenix Tuesday, with an ad from Monday night.
The National Weather Service based in Phoenix said in a tweet that "only ten tropical cyclones have preserved the stage of depression or tropical storm in a 300 km perimeter around Phoenix since 1950!
The Hurricane Katrina (1967) was stopped at 64 km from the Arizona border."
The latest estimates of the National Hurricane Center include 5 to 10 cm of precipitation, and up to 15 cm by place in the Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
Other regions of the south-west desert including the central area of the Rocheuses and the Grand Bassin should record from 2.5 to 5 cm of precipitation, with total isolated measures up to 10 cm.
Rosa's rains could be life-saving for drought-affected regions that are not exposed to sudden crude risks.
Although the risk of flooding should not be taken lightly, the rain could be beneficial for the south-west region, given the current drought situation.
According to the United States drought monitoring system, a little more than 40% of Arizona experienced at least one extreme drought, the second most serious category," says weather.com.
The Bear Rosa begins her way on the coast, in the peninsula of Lower California.
Always with a great power Sunday morning and generating winds that can reach 135 km/h, Rosa was located 620 km from Punta Eugenia (Mexico) and moved north at 20 km/h.
The storm meets the cold waters of the Pacific and therefore loses its strength.
It should reach the Mexican coast with the force of a hurricane Monday afternoon or Monday night.
In some regions of Mexico, precipitation could be massive and lead to a risk of flooding.
"In total, between 7.5 and 15 cm of precipitations are expected from the Low California to the north-west of Sonora and can reach up to 25 cm," said weather.com.
Rosa will then cross North Mexico, with the strength of a tropical storm, and reach the border of Arizona Tuesday, early in the morning, as a tropical depression. She will cross Arizona and south Utah in the evening of Tuesday.
"Torrent rains are expected in Lower California, north-west of Sonora and in the south-west desert and constitute the main danger," explained the National Hurricane Center.
It is estimated that these precipitations will result in potentially deadly storms and floods in the arid areas, as well as in landslides in the mountainous areas.
Attack at Midsomer Norton: four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested for attempted murder, after a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed in the Somerset.
The teenager was found in the Excelsior Terrace District of Midsomer Norton, Saturday at 4 a.m. local time.
He was sent to the hospital, and his condition is still stable.
The Avon and Sommerset police reported that they had arrested the four young people (aged 17, 18 and 20) on the night of Radstock.
The agents called on people who could have filmed the scene with their phone.
Trump declares that Kavanaugh has been the victim of the wickedness and the wrath of the Democrats
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the impotent and scandalous methods of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a meeting in Wheeling in West Virginia.
Trump stated that Kavanaugh had been the victim of the wickedness and the wrath of the Democrats throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh expressed himself on Thursday before Congress, renouncing with energy and emotion the allegations of Christine Blasey Ford, who accused her of having sexually assaulted her several decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified during the hearing.
The president said on Saturday that "the American people were witnesses of Kavanaugh's intelligence and courage" today.
"A vote in the sense of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote in the sense of one of the most accomplished lawyers, with a brilliant career in the public service," he explained to the crowds of participants gathered in West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to the appointment of Kavanaugh when he referred to the importance of Republicans' participation in the mid-term elections.
"We are five weeks from one of the most important elections in our lives.
I'm not a candidate, but I'm more involved than ever," he said.
"That's why I fight on all fronts for formidable candidates."
Trump stated that the Democrats were in the mission of "resistance and obstruction".
The first decision-making vote in the Senate for the appointment of Kavanaugh should take place by Friday, following the declaration of a collaborator of the Republican Party to CNN.
Indonesia: a earthquake and tsunami are killing hundreds of victims, the balance sheet continues to collapse
On Saturday, the authorities stated that at least 384 people had died, most of whom were carried by huge waves that hit the beaches while an earthquake followed by a tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Celebes.
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in Palu, when waves of six meters high submerged the beach at nightfall. They took many lives and destroyed everything on their journey.
The earthquake, of a magnitude of 7.5, preceded the tsunami.
"When the threat of the tsunami came up yesterday, everyone was still on the beach. People did not run away immediately, it cost them their lives," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson of the National Disaster Management Agency (BNPB), said at a press conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't happen alone. It brought cars, wooden pieces, rooms, everything carried with it," Nugroho explained, explaining that the tsunami had moved in the sea at 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
Some people were able to save their lives by climbing to the trees, he added.
Nearly 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
The air images published by the disaster management agency show destroyed buildings and shops, deformed and cremated bridges, as well as a water mask.
The replicas continued to drain the coastal city on Saturday.
Earthquakes were felt by 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Implementation Agency (BPPT) said that energy released by the Friday earthquake was 200 times higher than the power of the nuclear bomb launched on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geographical location of the city, which is bordering a long narrow bay, could have expanded the size of the tsunami, she explained.
According to Nugroho, damage is considerable; thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centres and hotels have collapsed.
Bodies were found trapped under the ruins of ruined buildings, he added, specifying that 540 people were injured and 29 were still missing.
Nugroho stated that human and material losses could be more important than 300 km north of Palu, a region called Dongala, the nearest of the earthquake.
Communications were “completely paralysed” since Dongala, Nugroho said.
More than 300,000 people live there," said La Croix Rouge in a communiqué, adding that his staff and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
"The situation is dramatic and could well be exacerbated," she added.
On Saturday, the agency was widely criticized for not disseminating the information that a tsunami had touched Palu, although agents said the waves had arrived at the time when the alert was issued.
An amateur video shared on social networks shows a man on the floor of a building that often creates the passersby in the street that a tsunami approaches.
A few minutes later, a water wall lay on the coast, carrying with it buildings and cars.
Reuters could not authenticate immediately to images.
Earthquake and tsunami caused a general electric panel that cut all communications in Palu, so it was difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue operations.
The army began to seek assistance by cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, but the evacuated people still have a great need for food and other basic needs.
The airport of the city has been robbed in the context of rescue operations, but will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was due to visit Palu's evacuation centres on Sunday.
Indonesia: Tsunami victims' balance has been lost, more than 800 deaths are reported.
It's a tragedy.
The members of the World Vision staff in Dongala arrived healthy and except for Palu, where they found refuge in the shelters established in the court of their offices. On the way, they discovered devastating scenes, explains Mr. Doseba.
"They told me they saw many destroyed houses," he explains.
It's a tragedy.
When relief groups began to bring relief to the victims, some complained that very experienced foreign humanitarian workers had not had the right to travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funds, supplies and foreign personnel may only enter the territory if the affected site is declared a national disaster zone.
And that's not the case yet.
"This disaster is always considered regional," explains Aulia Arriani, spokesperson of La Croix Red Indonesia.
"As soon as the government declares that this is a national disaster, international assistance will be able to intervene, but we are still waiting."
When the second night after the earthquake and the Friday tsunami fell on Palu, the loved ones who had disappeared were still waiting for a miracle.
Saturday, a little boy was found in the sheds.
On Sunday, the saviors released a woman ensemble under the demise for two days, near her mother's body.
The coach of the Indonesian national parachute team, Gendon Subandano, had prepared two of the missing athletes for the Asian Games, which took place a few days earlier in Indonesia.
Other of his students found themselves trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel, Mr. Mandadi added.
"As an old man in the discipline of the parapet, I have lived my own dramas," he explains.
In the hours that followed the announcement of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel in the parish community, Mr. Gendon reported that he had desperately sent whatsApp messages to athletes in Palu who participated in the festival on the beach.
His messages were left unanswered.
"I think they've never received my messages."
At Newport on the Levee, thieves subtilize $26,750 when reloading an automatic distributor
On Friday morning, the burglars had robbed 26 750 dollars to an agent from Brink's who recharged an automatic distributor in Newport on the Levee, according to a news release from the Newport police service.
The vehicle driver lived a distributor in the entertainment complex and prepared to feed it, explains Inspector Dennis McCarthy in the communiqué.
While he was busy, a man appeared behind the Brink's employee and stole a bag of money for the distributor.
Witnesses would have seen many suspects leave places, but the police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Any person with information on their identities is requested to contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: the rapper changes his name and becomes Ye
The Kanye West rapper is now called Ye.
To announce the news on Twitter Saturday, he wrote: "Old known as Kanye West."
At the age of 41, West, who has been called Ye for some time, used this nickname as a title for his eighth album, came out in June.
The rapper made this change just before he went to the Saturday Night Live show, where he should present his new album, Yandhi.
His participation replaces that of Ariana Grande, who cancelled his arrival for "emotional reasons," explained the emission creator.
In addition to the abbreviation of his current professional pseudo, this nickname also has a religious meaning for West.
"I think "Ye" is the most used word in the Bible, where it means "you," explained West earlier this year, mentioning the title of his album with his guest Big Boy.
"So I am you, I am us.
I have passed from Kanye, which means “one, ” to Ye - reflects good, evil, confusion, and everything.
This album is a reflection of who we are."
West is not the only known rapper to change his name.
Sean Combs called himself Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who collaborated with the West in the past, also played on the union and the capitals.
In Mexico, AMLO states that he will never resort to military force against civilians.
The elected Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador promised never to use the military force against civilians, almost fifty years after bloodthirsty retaliation of the forces of the order against the students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at the place of Tlatelolco "never use military force to suppress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, the troops opened fire during a peaceful demonstration, killing 300 people when the student movements took root throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has committed himself to supporting Mexican youth by granting monthly grants to students and by opening more free public universities.
According to him, unemployment and lack of educational opportunities lead young people to join criminal gangs.
The United States should double funding in the field of artificial intelligence
While China is increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double its research funding in this sector, according to the artificial intelligence investor Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These statements occur after a number of U.S. government actors have made announcements about IA, while an official IA strategy has failed in the United States.
In parallel, China presented its road map last year: it plans to become the IA innovation leader by 2030.
"To double the IA research funds would be a good start, because all other countries have a long way ahead of the United States, and we are looking for the next major IA discovery," Lee explains.
Double funds could double the chances that the next key step in the field of IA comes from the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book "AI SuperPowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the PDG of Synovation Ventures, which invested in one of China's most important IA companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an IA system that beat the U.S. Othello player best-class. He then integrated Microsoft Reasearch's management team and became president of Google's Chinese branch.
Lee has already participated in technological competitions organized by the American government, such as the Robotics Challenge of the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked when the next competition would be held to identify visionaries.
According to Lee, American researchers often have to work hard to obtain funding from the government.
"It's not China that suits university leaders, it's companies," says Lee.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have recruited large university names to work on the IA.
Lee added that the changes in immigration policies could also support the efforts of the United States in the field of IA.
"I think green cards should be automatically granted to IA researchers," he said.
The State Affairs Council of China launched its artificial intelligence development plan for a new generation in July 2017.
The National Foundation for Natural Sciences of China grants funding to members of academic institutions, as well as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower," Lee explained.
Earlier this year, the Department of Defence of the United States has established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which must involve industrial partners and the Academy. The House-Blanche announced the formation of a Selection Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
The NSF is currently investing more than $100 million a year for research in the IA.
At the same time, American legislation working to establish a National Security Commission on artificial intelligence has taken no action for several months.
Macedonians participate in the referendum on the name of their country
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia heard their voice at a referendum on the change of name for the Republic of North Macedonia. This change would resolve an old dispute over decades with Greece, which had blocked Macedonia's application for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece, one of the provinces known as Macedonia, maintains that the name of its neighbor in the north represents a right in its territory and has opposed its veto to its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, the two governments signed an agreement based on the new name proposed, but the nationalist opponents claim that the change would affect the ethical identity of the slave population of Macedonia, majority.
President Gjorge Ivanov announced that he would not vote at the referendum and that a boycotting campaign had raised doubts about obtaining a minimum participation of 50% required to validate the referendum.
The question of the referendum was: "Are you in favour of joining NATO and the EU under the terms of the agreement signed with Greece?"
According to the name change participants, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, this is the price to be paid to join organizations such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, saved from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I have come today to vote for the future of my country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that it can live freely under the auspices of the European Union. This means a safer life for each of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the vote is not legally binding, enough Members of Parliament have stated that they would follow the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
The change of name would require a majority of the two thirds of Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission announced that no irregularity had been detected at 1 p.m.
However, the participation was only 16%, while it reached 34% at the same time during the last parliamentary elections in 2016, which had mobilized 66% of the voters registered after the vote.
"I came to vote for my children. Our place is in Europe," says Gjose Tanevski, 62, who voted in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko took part in the referendum and voted for the change of name in order to open the voice to join NATO and the European Union, Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
At the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54 years old, prepares a small scene and has seats in front of tents installed by those who will boycott the referendum.
"We want to enter the EU and NATO, but we want to enter it through the big door," Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they do not want us as Macedonia, we can turn to China and Russia and participate in the Eurasian integration."
According to Prime Minister Zaev, NATO membership will allow Macedonia to receive the necessary investments. The unemployment rate in the country exceeds 20%.
"I think that a large majority will be favourable, as more than 80% of our citizens want to join the EU and NATO," said Zaev after submitting his bulletin.
He added that a "yes" would be a "confirmation of our future".
According to a poll published on Monday by the Institute for Policy Research in Macedonia, between 30 and 43 per cent of voters would have the intention to participate in the referendum, which is lower than the expected participation rate.
Another survey, organized by the Macedonian chain Telma, estimated participation to be 57%.
70% of the voting participants stated that they would vote "yes".
In order for the referendum to be valid, 50 per cent more votes must be cast.
The failure of the referendum would be the first hard time in the policy of the pro-Western government since it took power in May last year.
Decisive Action: Sergio Aguero, Manchester City, takes a path through Brighton's defense to mark
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling defeated the defenders of Brighton in Manchester and won the match 2-0 Saturday, at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
The aim of Aguero, at the 65th minute, seemed to be the simplest action of the world for the player.
Argentinian butter received the balloon in the middle of the field, at the beginning of the action.
He ran between three Brighton defenders, before drowning on the ground.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green spots.
He turned on a defender before avoiding the others near Brighton's goal.
Then he passed the balloon to Sterling, on his left.
The previous Englishman took advantage of this to send the balloon back to Aguero, who used his right foot to cheat the Guardian of Brighton, Mathew Ryan, with a shot on the right side of the string.
"Aguero has some problems with his feet," explained Pep Guardiola, team coach, to journalists.
"We said he would play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We've had the chance that he's marked right now."
But it was Sterling who had given the original advantage to Skyblues at the First League game,
in 29 minutes.
Aguero received the balloon directly on Brighton's ground.
He sent it on the left to Leroy Sane.
Sane made a few touches before taking Sterling to the second floor.
The front of the Skyblues sent the balloon into the rows just before sliding out of the field.
City will face Hopenheim in the Champions League group at 12.55 a.m. on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play the rockies trouble.
As the Nationals team was eliminated from the play-off race, there was no reason to start a new game.
But Scherzer, very competitive, hopes to play against the Rockies of Colorado on Sunday, but only in the event of an eliminater match for the Rockies, real legends against the Los Angeles Dodgers Division of the West League.
The Rockies brought it 5-2 against the Nationals on Friday night, but they still seek to secure their first division title.
"Even if this match is not a question, we want to dig the ground in Denver, with this atmosphere, with the crowd, and face a team that will probably play at the highest level I will have to deal with this year.
Why wouldn't I want to participate?"
Nationals still have to announce a launch on Sunday, but they would be inclined to leave the place in Scherzer, in this situation.
Scherzer, for whom it would be the 34th departure, will be training on Thursday and launch on his usual day of rest on Sunday.
Washington's right-hand side is 18-7 with an average score of 2,53 and 300 withdrawals on 220 marches and two thirds of this season.
Trump's interventions in West Virginia
The President referred to the situation that contributed to Brett Kavanaugh's support for the Supreme Court by discussing the importance of Republican participation in the mid-term elections.
“ All our actions will have an impact in November.
We are five weeks from one of the most important elections in our lives.
It's a major issue. I'm not a candidate, but I'm more involved than ever. That's why I fight on all fronts for formidable candidates," he said.
Trump went on "You see this terrible radical group, really horrible, democratic, you see it at work.
And they are determined to regain power by all means. See their wickedness.
They are against whom they hurt, against whom they burn to take power and control. That is what they want, power and control, and we are not going to give them."
Democrats are in the mission of "resistance and obstruction".
"You can see it in the last four days," he added, before qualifying the democrats of people "in anger, evil and lying."
He referred to the Judicial Committee of the United States Senate and the Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein, which was worth the effort.
“Do you remember his answer? ”
Have you published the document?
Ha ha, of course.
No, no, I'm waiting for one. It was a very bad body language, the worst I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer the great community.
It is not tolerant of those who express their ideas
When the Momentum activists of my local party voted to censor me, it was not a surprise.
After all, I am the last of a parliamentary line of the working party considered not to be welcome.
My colleague, Joan Ryan, received identical treatment because she was raised against anti-Semitism.
As far as I'm concerned, I was censored because I was in disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe. Ironically, it was topics for which Jeremy himself disagreed with the previous leaders.
The announcement for the Nottingham East Labour assembly said on Friday: "We want the assembly to be inclusive and productive."
That is exactly what the general assemblies of Friday night were during my eight years as a parliamentary member of the Labour Party.
Unfortunately, today it is not the case of many meetings and the promise of softer and more respectful policies has long been forgotten, if ever taken into account.
It has become clear that the contrary opinions are no longer tolerated within the party. Each opinion is judged on the basis of its acceptability by the party's leaders.
This began shortly after Jeremy took power. The colleagues with whom I thought to share the same political vision began to wait for me to return to my dress and to take positions against my convictions, whether in terms of national security or the EU's internal market.
Every time I spoke publicly, and no matter what I said, I was following an abusive shoot on social networks, calling for withdrawal, denouncing the policies of the centre, saying that I should not be a member of the party.
And that's not just my experience.
Moreover, I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments I had received were of a political nature.
I am admiring the professionalism and determination of these colleagues, who face a disparity of sexist or racist talk every day, but who do not lower their arms.
One of the most depressing things in the current policy is the normalization of various forms of abuse.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said that the working party should encourage a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer this great community and that the party is restricted by the motions of challenge and changes in the rules of selection.
I have been given a lot of advice these past two years: lowering my eyes, not expressing my ideas so strongly, and everything would be fine.
But it's not about acting like I'm doing politics.
I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student, because the neglect of Thatcher's government had caused the collapse of my classroom. Since then, I have wanted to work for better public services for those who need it, whether as a local adviser or a government minister.
I've never hidden my political ambitions even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been disturbed by my political positions and my disputes with the party's current leaders.
All I would like to say to those who have defended the Friday movement is that the country is going to a Brexit that will affect homes, businesses and public services.

Father 38 - 17 Melrose : Father remains incarnate
Two late exams may have faked the final result, but no doubt above: Ayr deserved this victory as a result of the hard day match of the Scotland Rugby Championship in XV.
The team now occupys the top of the ranking and becomes the only invincible team of the championship.
Finally, it is the superiority of their defense and the way in which they took the opportunities that allowed them to open the score. Coach Peter Murchie can congratulate himself on this match.
"So far, we have been tested, but we remain invaincus, so I must love me happy!" he said.
Robyn Christie, from Melrose, congratulated Ayr: “Bravo to them, they were more effective than we and were able to seize the opportunities. ”
Grant Anderson's trial, at the 14th minute, transformed by Frazier Climo, put Ayr in a good position, but a yellow card for the Scottish escort Rory Hughes, released for the Warriors match, allowed Melrose to make the figures speak. Jason Baggot got away from an unprocessed test.
Climo aggravated the situation for Ayr with a penalty, before, just in the mid-time. He marked and transformed a solo test to mount the score 17-5 for Ayr at break.
Melrose began the second half and Patrick Anderson's test, transformed by Baggot, reduced the gap to five points.
It was followed by a long wait due to a serious injury by Ruarid Knott, who left the ground on a cemetery. During the resumption, Ayr took the front with a trial by Stafford McDowall transformed by Climo.
Blair Macpherson, captain of Air, then received a yellow cardboard and, again, Melrose tried his chance with an unprocessed trial by Bruce Colvine, who created a palpable tension.
But the home team came back in hand and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card to touch Climo while he didn't have the balloon, since the stroke of the penalty, MacPherson touched the back of Ayr's nightmare, which progressed.
Climo turned the test, as almost every time since the resume, after Kyle Rowe gathered David Armstrong's kickbox and sent Gregor Henry's wing away for the fifth trial of the team at home.
The Styl Game star launches in the restoration
Ford Kieran, the Still Game star, has decided to become a career in the restaurant. The comedian has been appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old incarne Jack Jarvis in the famous BBC show, which he wrote and coanimates with his long-standing partner, Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the ninth show will be the end of the show, and Kiernan seems to prepare for the next Craiglang.
According to official records, he is Director of Atriugmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on this story, although a source of Scottish Sun revealed that Kiernan wanted to get involved in the "flowering environment of the restoration" in Glasgow.
"The Sea is for us": Bolivia, blocked, hopes the court will open the way to the Pacific
Marines patrol in a ship nested in the La Paz Naval District.
Public buildings drill a blue flag like the ocean.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the marine bases show the following motorcycle: "The sea is right back.
Recovery is a duty."
Throughout the blocked Bolivia, the memory of a lost coast to the benefit of Chile in a 19th-century bloody resource conflict is still well present. Just like the desire to sail on the Pacific Ocean, once again.
These hopes have not been so palpable for decades. Bolivia is in fact awaiting a decision of the International Court of Justice, which will be delivered on 1 October, after five years of deliberations.
"Bolivia has the will, a spirit of unity and serenity, and looks forward to a positive outcome," explains Roberto Calzadilla, Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will follow the decision of the International Court of Justice throughout the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will vote in favour of the Bolivian application. Bolivia wishes that, after decades of sporadic negotiations, Chile will be required to negotiate the agreement of a sovereign passage to the ocean in Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the indigenous charismatic president of Bolivia (who faces a fight disputed for the election next year), also has much to say about the decision to be made on Monday.
"We are so close to being able to return to the Pacific," he said at the end of August.
But some analysts believe there is little chance that the court will vote in favour of Chile, and that few things would change, even in the case of a positive decision.
The United Nations Office based in the Netherlands has no power to agree on a Chilean territory, and has stipulated that it would not determine the outcome of any talks.
The fact that the International Court of Justice makes its decision six months after the last arguments shows that the case "was not complicated", explains Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And far from favoring Bolivia's cause, the last four years may have hurt her even.
"The problem of access to the sea has been diverted by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
The fighting rhetoric of Morales has spared all the good Chilean will that remained, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to exchange, but after that, it will be very difficult to organize talks.
The last exchange of ambassadors between the two countries took place in 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, who represents Bolivia in Haye, rejected the idea that the Court's decision was abnormally rapid.
Monday will bring Bolivia "a great opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "end 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits", he said.
Calzadilla also challenged the fact that Morales - one of the most popular presidents in Latin America today - used the maritime problem as a political beak.
"Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific," he added.
"The Court's decision is an opportunity to see that we must abandon the past."
North Korea affirms that nuclear disarmament will take place only when it can trust the United States
Ri Yong Ho, Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea, said that his country would not defend itself from his nuclear weapons until he had confidence in Washington.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He asked the United States to respect the promises made at a summit in Singapore between the leaders of the two rivers.
He expressed himself when the Secretary of State of the United States, Mike Pompeo, appeared to be about to resume nuclear diplomacy over three months after Singapore's summit with Kim Jong One, current North Korea leader.
Ri states that it is "chemical" to think that the maintenance of United States sanctions and opposition to a declaration that will put an end to the Korean war will spread the North.
Washington is reluctant to accept the declaration in the absence of significant pre-disarming measures on the part of Pyongyang.
Kim and President of the United States Donald Trump want a second summit.
But Pyongyang's serious rejection of an arsenal that the country considers to be the only guarantee of its security is a debate.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion exhibits reveal the latest trends in cover, perhaps soon available in your shops
If you want to add XXL pieces to your hat collection or protect yourself from the sun by 100%, don't look any more.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented their oversized hat collections delicating at a PE19 show that honored the fashion of the Fashion Week in Paris.
More and more extravagant hats each other invaded Instagram this summer, and the creators decided to integrate their delicacy parts into the parades.
Valentino's pear was an eccentric beige hat decorated with a broad edge that evoked a pen, which swallowed the head of the mannequins.
The other oversize accessories included jewelry-shaped pastries, a sauce hat and even a pineapple. But these parts were not designed to keep you warm.
Thom Browne also presented a collection of original masks. Just in time for Halloween.
Most of the masks had the curly lips and referred to more Hannibal Lecter than the Haute-Couture.
One creation was like a swimming equipment, with tuba and glasses, while another was thinking of a deep-glazed cone.
And if you follow fashion trends, then you're lucky.
Depending on the style observers, the captivators could come to your shopping streets.
The XXL hats follow the silhouette of the "Bamba", the wide-spread deck hat that the stars are pulling, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand that commercializes this difficultly portable hat that flooded the social networks presented another of its pharaoh creations on the podium: a beach bag almost as large as the mannequin in the bathroom that carried it.
The burnt orange ruffia bag, decorated with raffia strips and a white leather bag, was the master of the PE19 exhibition La Riviera de Jacquemus at the Fashion Week in Paris.
The Stylist of the Celebrations Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: "I look forward to seeing the great hats and beach bags arriving in the trades for the next summer. The creator has so marked the minds that it is obvious that there will be a demand for surplus accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are essential to the people of the world
The independent schools of Scotland maintain a school excellence record. This trend continued in 2018 with new excellent results of examination strengthened by collective and individual success in sports, art, music and other community activities.
With more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) strive to provide the best level of service to students and their parents.
Independent schools work to prepare their students for higher education, the career they have chosen and their place as citizens of the world.
As an education sector capable of designing and implementing a major school programme, we find that contemporary languages remain popular and desirable materials in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to a man in a language he understands, you speak to his head.
If you speak his language, you speak his heart. ”
This reminds us that we cannot rely on English to create relationships and to establish a trust relationship with the people of other countries.
If you look at the excellent results of this year's exams, you can see that languages are high in ranking, with the most important success rates in independent schools.
In total, 68 per cent of students who have studied foreign languages have received the highest score, A.
The data collected from 74 SCIS schools show that 72% of students received the highest score, A, in Mandarin, as well as 72% of students who studied German, 69% of students who studied French and 63% of students who studied Spanish.
This shows that Scotland's independent schools support foreign languages as essential skills for children and young people in the future.
Now, languages as materials are organized as well as science, technology, engineering and mathematics in the programs of independent schools and other schools.
A UK Employment Commission survey and skills survey conducted in 2014 reveals that among the difficulties encountered by employers in recruiting candidates, 17% are related to skills in inadequate languages.
Language skills are therefore increasingly vital to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more job offers requiring languages, these skills are essential in our globalised world.
No matter what your choice of career, a person who speaks a second language will benefit from a real advantage in the future thanks to this lasting competence.
The ability to communicate directly with foreigners will automatically place the multilingual person in front of its competitors.
According to a YouGov survey conducted in 2013 with 4,000 adults living in the United Kingdom, 75% of them did not have enough foreign language to hold a conversation. French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage (15%).
That is why investing in language learning is important for children today.
By speaking several languages, including those of emerging economies, children will be given better opportunities to find a rewarding job.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
Several of them will focus on classical contemporary languages, while others will teach languages that are considered important for the United Kingdom in the perspective of 2020, including Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's preferences, several languages will be available in independent schools, with a specialist in the field.
The Scottish independent schools want to offer a learning environment that will prepare children and give them the skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future reserves them.
It is obvious that languages remain of major importance for the future of the country at the present time in a global commercial environment, and this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should be considered as "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to the Scottish youth.
It's a good thing to do.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
The Bron will begin with the Lakers on Saturday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans who watch LeBron James's debuts at the Los Angeles Lakers.
Luke Walton, the coach of the Lakers, announced that James would play Sunday at the opening of the season against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But we don't know how many minutes he'll play.
"More than one, less than 48", Walton said on the laker's official site.
The Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James would probably play for a few minutes.
After the training, early in the week, James was asked for his projects for the pre-season program, which includes six games.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need preseason games to be ready."
Trump campaign in Virginia-West (Canane YouTube)
President Donald Trump launches a series of campaign meetings tonight in Wheeling, Virginia-West.
Other steps, particularly in states such as Tennessee and Mississippi where the President is popular, are planned.
The vote for confirmation of the vacancy at the Supreme Court is reported, Trump seeks to collect support for the upcoming mid-term elections and to prevent Republicans from losing control of Congress during the November vote.
When did Trump's meeting in Virginia-West this evening take place and how to look at it online?
The Trump meeting in Wheeling, Virginia-West, is scheduled for 19:00 a.m. this evening, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can follow it online below, live on YouTube.
Trump should address the question of the candidate's hearings at the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh, accused of sexual assault, which took place this week. Kavanaugh's confirmation vote in the Senate should be postponed until one week during the FBI investigation.
But this series of meetings focuses on helping Republicans win the field for the November elections.
According to Reuters, the President of the United States said in his campaign that the five meetings were intended to "encourage volunteers and participants while the Republicans are trying to protect and extend the majority they hold in the Senate and in the House of Representatives".
"Congress control is so essential to its programme that the President will become as many States as possible at the beginning of this election campaign," Reuters said a spokesman for the Trump team, who refused to be appointed.
According to West Virginia Metro News, this evening's meeting, scheduled at the Wesbanco Arena of Wheeling, could bring together participants from "Ohio and Pennsylvania, and attract the attention of the Pittsburgh media."
Saturday, this will be the second visit in a month from Trump in West Virginia, a state that he won in 2016 by more than 40 percentage points.
Trump tries to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate at the Virginia-West Senate, who is on the train in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come to try to restart him in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a specialist in political science at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The US team is ready to fight to keep hope in the approach of the simple Sunday
After three simple, the Saturday afternoon fursoms could well represent what was missing from this Ryder Cup.
The lan's balancing movement is a sports concept invented of all parts but to which players sincerely believe, and more than ever in tournaments such as this.
So where would they put the candle, right now?
"They were handling six points in advance and now four, so this gives us some wings," said Jordan Spieth while he was leaving for the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, with four points of progress and twelve others to play.
The Americans, according to Spieth, feel a little wind in the bud and have every reason to be encouraged, especially by Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have played together all day and can bet on getting every three points on four.
Spieth proved to be extremely effective from tea to green and gave the example.
The energy joy crises intensified as his game progressed. A crucial pit enabled him to equal the fourth part while Thomas and he were led two down after two holes.
His dick, thanks to which they won the match at the 15th hole, caused a similar cry, of those who tell you he believes the American team is still in high school.
“You really need to stay determined and focus on his game,” Spieth said.
That's all there's left to each of these players right now.
18 holes to identify.
The only players who have marked more points than Speeth and Thomas during the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, as the witness to Ryder Cup's history.
The strange but adorable European couple won four games on four and did not have the right to go wrong.
Not only "Moliwood" were the only ones not to realize a crazy Saturday afternoon, but they also escaped Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and at the last nine holes Friday morning.
This series, the way in which their energy seems to circulate between them and the crowd by diverting them as players to fight Sunday, and there is no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari to win a potential European victory while the sun lies on the National Golf.
Instead, both at the same time to different holes.
But speaking of European glory remains premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly beat Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning's fourballs, while he was teaming with Alex Noren.
A crazy and double on the first nine hits sent Spain and Sweden into a hole that they had never experienced.
On the other hand, no one is here to help you.
The furballs and fursoms are so fascinating to observe closely because of the interactions between the peers, the advice they give and the advice they do not give, and how a strategy can be bask in an eyelid.
Europe has been better teamed up so far and has made considerable progress during the last day, but this forum session has also proved that the Americans have the courage to fight, some of which were suspected, especially in the country.
Europe runs 10-6 on the last day of Ryder Cup
Europe will benefit from a strong advantage in the last day of Ryder Cup after having won 10-6 on the United States during the Saturdays and Saturdays.
The inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari have carried the load with two victories on a Tiger Woods in distress, which has allowed them to mark four points so far.
It was well decided to maintain the title she had lost in Hazeltine two years ago, the European team of Thomas Bjorn made the difference by imposing 3-1 in the morning's furballs, facing a disorganized American team.
The United States has demonstrated greater resistance in the fursoms and has won two victories, but they have failed to overcome the gap.
Jim Fury's men must necessarily drop eight points on 12 Sundays in simple to preserve the trophe.
Fleetwood is the first European recruit to unwind four points, while Molinari and it, named Molliwood after a falling weekend, are only the second pair of Ryder Cup's history to get four points at their first four matches.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed at the furballs, they beat the pair made up of American beginner Bryson Dechambeau and a Woods already tired by 5 and 4 more categoricals.
Woods, who played during the two Saturday matches, shined on a few occasions, but now he lost 19 of his 29 matches in furballs and fursoms, and seven fans.
Justin Rose, well resting for the morning's furballs, teamed with Henrik Stenson in the fursoms, winning the 2-1 win against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, respectively, numbers one and three in the world ranking.
Europe was not spared during the tournament that took place in southwestern Paris, under a fresh but disembarked time.
The triple winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas drew up the reference for the Americans by marking two points on Saturday.
They won a well-deserved victory at 2-1 against the Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs and again have Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in the foursomes, those who lost the first two holes.
Twice in the history of Ryder Cup, a team recovered from a four-point gap in simple, although the Furyk team, who held the crown, had only to play a zero match to preserve its trophe.
After being second for two days, however, they could not return to a Sunday attack.
North Korea states that disarmament will not be "in any case" unilaterally untrustworthy.
On Saturday, the North Korean Minister for Foreign Affairs told the United Nations that the maintenance of sanctions would strengthen his confidence in the United States and that it would be impossible for his country to unilaterally renounce its nuclear weapons under those circumstances.
At the annual General Assembly of the World Organization, Ri Yong Ho stated that North Korea had last year taken "significant measures of good will" as those to put an end to nuclear and missile testing, the dismantling of the nuclear testing site and its commitment not to proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we see no corresponding response from the United States," he regretted.
In the absence of confidence in the United States, we will fear for our national security and, under such circumstances, it is excluded that we are the first to disarm ourselves unilaterally."
While reiterating the well-known claims of North Korea regarding Washington's opposition to a "step-by-step" approach of denuclearization, under which North Korea would be rewarded if it gradually took action, its statement proved important in that it did not reject the idea of unilateral denuclearization as had been done by the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong One and Donald Trump, made on 12 June in Singapore at the first summit between an American president in the exercise and a North Korean leader, when Kim undertook to work for a "denuclearization of the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised to ensure the security of North Korea.
North Korea is seeking to officially end the Korean war (1950-1953), but the United States has declared that Pyongyang should first abandon its nuclear weapons.
Washington also refused requests to mitigate severe international sanctions against North Korea.
the United States insists that North Korea first proceed to denuclearization and stress the pressure by imposing sanctions to achieve their goal in a coercive manner, even opposed to "the declaration of the end of war"".
“Those who think that these sanctions can make us suffer do not know us.
The problem is that maintaining sanctions increases our mistrust."
Ri made no comments on the second summit between Kim and Trump launched before the United Nations by the U.S. leader earlier this week.
Rather, the Minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and the South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, and added: "If the part concerned by the issue of denuclearization was South Korea and not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not be in such an impasse."
Nevertheless, the tone of Ri's speech was radically different from that of last year, when he had stated before the United Nations General Assembly that it was inevitable to target North Korean missiles in the North American territory after President Trump ' s 'malefic ' had qualified Kim as 'missile man ' in a suicide mission.
Trump, who had threatened the last year in front of the United Nations to "completely destroy" North Korea, did not boast this year of the courage with which Kim applied measures for disarmament, but added that there was still much to be done and that sanctions would not be lifted until North Korea disarmed.
Wednesday, Trump stated that no time had been set. "This can take two years, three years or five months; it doesn't matter," he said.
China and Russia maintain that the United Nations Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Thursday at the United Nations Security Council that: "The application of the sanctions of the Security Council must be firmly and systematically maintained until total, final and verified denuclearization. "
The Security Council has unanimously strengthened sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in order to strengthen the financing of the Pyongyang nuclear programmes and ballistic missiles.
Pompeo met Ri on the side of the United Nations General Assembly and then announced that he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare a second summit.
This year, Pompeo had already become North Korea three times, but his last trip was a bit disastrous.
In July, he left Pyongyang saying that progress had been made, but in the hours that followed, North Korea denounced its "gangster methods".
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea undertook to dismantle a missile site as well as a nuclear complex if the United States took "equivalent measures".
According to South Korean President Kim, he claims the security guarantees promised by Trump in Singapore, and efforts to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard: Students take rest courses
This year, Harvard University has set up a new course that enables all first-cycle students to sleep more and fight against the growing achist trend that is to study at the café all night.
One professor observed that most students in the best university in the world do not know how to take care of them.
This course, designed by Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, is the first of the kind in the United States.
It is after giving a conference on the effects of sleep deprivation on learning that the idea has come to it
Finally, a student approached me and said, "Why am I only told this in the last year?"
She said that no one had ever talked to her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," he entrusted The Telegraph.
For the first time this year, this course explains to students the need to adopt good sleep habits to improve their school and physical performance, as well as their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Director General of University Health Services, said that the university had decided to introduce the course after finding that students would suffer from a severe lack of sleep during the week.
The time of the course consists of different interactive exercises.
One of the sections presents the image of a dortoir containing various objects (cafe rates, dishes, basketball, books...) on which students click to know the effects of the café and the light, as well as the impact of the lack of sleep on their physical performances and the importance of integrating a routine before bedtime.
In another section, participants learn how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, AVC, depression and cancer.
A map of the campus with interactive icons then invites participants to reflect on their daily routine.
"We know that this will not immediately change the behaviour of students.
However, we believe that they have the right to know this information - the same way you have the right to know what the effects of smoking on health are," Professor Czeisler added.
According to him, the culture of the pride of having “a white night” still exists, and he adds that modern technology and constant increasing pressure on students make the lack of sleep a growing problem.
Having sufficient sleep and good quality should be the "secret weapon" of students to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety, has he said - even to avoid taking weight, because the lack of sleep puts the brain in the way of initiation, making them hungry constantly.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student in chemistry and physics, helped Professor Czeisler design this course after being one of his students last year, during his first year in Harvard.
He claimed that this course had opened his eyes and had moved him to insist that he be offered to the entire campus.
He hoped that the next step would be to propose to all third-cycle students to follow a similar study programme before joining the recognized institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students provide an alarm for both bedtime and wake-up hours, and be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED light, which may disrupt their circadian rhythm and cause sleep disturbances.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers : Menga's goal has led to the fall of Gerrard's men
The Rangers had a new blow outside, the attack by Dolly Menga, which led the disarray team from Steven Gerrard to Livingstone to a 1-0 defeat.
The Ibrox team was hoping to record its first victory in the move since its triumph 4-1 in February in St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team attacked Gerard's second defeat in 18 matches as a coach, leaving his team on the run, eight points behind the Hearts, managers of the Ladbroke Premiership.
Menga hit seven minutes before the mid-time and the Rangers team, short of inspiration, failed to equalize.
While the Rangers are now falling to the sixth place, Livingstone is in third position, just behind the Hibernian on the difference of goals.
And other difficulties could be felt for the Rangers, the arbitrator Calum Spence, who had to be cared for for for a head injury following the throw of an object from the opposite side.
Gerrard made eight changes in the team, which hit Ayr in the semi-final of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, as for him, chose the same Livi 11, who raised a point in the Hearts last week and would have been delighted to see his well-trained team kicking their opponents every turn.
The Rangers may have controlled the property of the balloon, but Livingstone has done more.
They were supposed to mark in two minutes, when the first shot of Menga sent Scott Pittman on the goal of Allan McGregor, but the ground environment left his chance.
Keaghan Jacobs then shot a powerful blow in the direction of Captain Craig Halkett, but his teammate Alan Lithgow could only reach the second floor.
The Rangers managed to take control, but there seemed to be more hope than faith in their game in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly believed that he would have had to be punished after the free blow when Steven Lawless and he got caught up in a collision, but Arbitrary Steven Thomson dismissed Colombia's applications.
The Rangers had only two shots in the first period, but the former guardian of Ibrox, Liam Kelly, was hardly disturbed by Lassana Coulibally and a hit by Ovie Ejaria.
If the opening of the score by Livi at the 34th minute went against the course of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it by their hard work.
Once again, the Rangers failed at Jacobs' arrest.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher gave the balloon to Scott Robinson, who kept his cold blood to choose Menga for a simple purpose.
Gerrard reacted in the mid-term by replacing Coulibally with Ryan Kent and the exchange failed to have an immediate impact when the eagle appeared before Morelos, but impressive Kelly rushed to block.
Livingstone has continued to push visitors to play exactly the type of game they like, with Lithgow and Halkett dancing long dances on long dances.
Holt's team could have taken advantage in the last few minutes, but McGregor got a good deal of work to give up Jacobs before Lithgov goes beyond the goal.
The Rangers' replacement, Glenn Middleton, once again claimed a penalty at the end of the game while he was in custody with Jacobs, but Thomson ignored it again.
German: The Inventor of Geiger Count
And now, a page by our German "Sunday Morning": On September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and THE COMPTEUR TOURNE... was born the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity; an invention that subsequently gave birth to the device known as Geiger Count.
Since then, the Geiger Count has also become fundamental in pop culture, as can be seen in the "Bells of Coronado" movie of 1950, with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, two unlikely scientists:
A man said, "What's that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, used to search for radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
Through these listeners, you can really hear the effects of atoms released in minerals by radioactivity."
Evans: "So, of course it does, there!"
“ Hans ” Geiger died in 1945 a few days before his 63rd anniversary.
But the invention that bears his name remains.
A new cancer vaccine allows the immune system to "detect" cancer cells
A new cancer vaccine allows the immune system to "develop" cancer cells and kill them
In the course of treatment, the vaccine indicates to the immune system how to recognise cancer cells
This technique is to extract and modify immune cells from a patient in the laboratory.
They can then "develop" a protein that is common to many cancers, and are then re-injected
An experimental vaccine shows encouraging results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who received the vaccine, whose aim is to learn the immune system to recognize cancer cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method is to extract and modify immune cells from a patient in the laboratory, so that they can detect HER2 protein, common to many cancers, and finally reinject it.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American National Institute for Cancer based in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
According to Professor Berzofsky, HER2 protein “receives an increase in several types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, pulmonary and colorectal cancer.
A similar approach, consisting of taking immune cells to "learn" them to target cancer cells, has shown evidence in the treatment of a type of leukaemia.
Coffee of a MAGA cassette, Kanye West launched in a Pro-Trump diarib after its passage into the SNL.
This didn't happen well.
Kanye West went to the platform after a failed performance during which he praised US President Donald Trump during a Saturday Night Live and announced that he would be presenting himself to the elections in 2020.
After his third piece, Ghost Town, which he sings by wearing a Make America Great Again, West took it to the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"I often talk to whites and they say, "How can you love Trump? He's racist!"
"Well, if racism were to bother me, I would have left America for a long time," he said.
The SNL issue began with a sketch by Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood Vette mocks Brett Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate's Judicial Committee on allegations of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the recording of West diarib was released on social media by the comedian Chris Rock.
We don't know if Rock meant to wet West with this publication.
In addition, West complained to the public that he had spent a bad quarter of an hour in the shells because of his helmet.
“They pressured me.
They told me not to come with this helmet on my head.
They pressured me!
And then they say I'm in a Düfre," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see him, Düfre?" and said he would wear his superman coat, because no one can dictate his actions to him. Do you want the world to progress?
Try to love."
His comments attracted holes at least twice on the part of the public and the members of the SNL appeared to be jammed, Variety report. A person on site said in the magazine: "A death silence has fallen all over the board."
West had been called to replace the singer Ariana Grande, whose former friend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days earlier.
West disassociated a lot of people by singing song I Love it in a Perrier bottle suit.
West received the support of the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who published the following tweet: "To one of the bravest spirits: Thank you for being a member of the crowd."
But Karen Hunter, the emission animator, tweeted that West was just "loyal to himself, and that it's absolutely wonderful."
"However, I chose not to reward someone (by buying his music, his clothes or by supporting his art) who, I believe, adopts and distorts a harmful ideology for my community.
He's free.
And so did we," she added.
Before the show, the rapper had announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and claimed that he was now "officially known as Kanye West".
He's not the first artist to change names and follows Diddy's tracks, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The rapper Snoop Dogg brought the name of Snoop Lion and of course the legendary Prince fire, who changed his name into a symbol, then the artist previously known as Prince.

Kit Harington, the star of the Game of Thrones series, takes it to the toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his final role in the Game of Thrones, the fantastic medieval series of HBO.
But the 31-year-old actor took it to the stereotype of the macho hero, claiming that this type of role on the screen often leads young boys to make themselves for leather hard to respect.
In an interview with Sunday Times Culture, Kit stated that according to him, "something is wrong" and addresses the question of toxic masculinity at the time of #MeToo.
Kit, who recently married Rose Leslie, a coward of Game of Thrones, also aged 31, admitted that he had “strongly” to address this issue.
“ Personally, I deeply believe that we have abused masculinity. ”
“What lessons have we learned from young men who are becoming adults, compared to the problem that is now facing them?”
According to Kit, television could be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to its very male characters.
He continued: "What behavior is inborn, what behavior was incised?
What is it that television and street teach young boys who encourage them to think that they should behave like this to be a man?
I think it's really one of the fundamental issues of our time - how can we change this?
There's obviously something that's ringing."
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not make prologues or suites when the series ends next summer, claiming that he ended with "the battlefields and horses".
As of November, Kit will be seeing a resumption of True West, Sam Shepard, who tells the story of a film producer and his brother, a thief.
Recently, the actor revealed that meeting with his wife Rose was for him the best thing that came to him in Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in this series, so she offered me my future family and my future life," he says.
Rose interpreted Ygritte, the lover of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in the fantastic series that won an Emmy.
The couple married in June 2018 in Scotland, in the family area of Leslie.
HIV / AIDS: China reports an increase of 14% of new cases
China reported an increase of 14 per cent of its HIV and AIDS populations.
According to the Chinese health authorities, more than 820,000 people are concerned.
Nearly 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the patients were infected during sexual intercourse, which is a new fact.
Historically, the virus spread rapidly in some regions of the country following contaminated blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been virtually reduced to zero, the Chinese health authorities said at a conference held in the province of Yunnan.
However, from one year to the next, the number of HIV-positive and AIDS-related persons in China has increased by 100,000.
In the Chinese LGBT community, transmission of HIV through sexual relations is a serious problem.
Homosexuality was depenalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT community remains widespread.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies estimate that 70% to 90% of homosexuals end up marrying a woman.
The number of transmission cases is due to inadequate sexual protection.
As part of its efforts to address this problem, the Chinese government has since 2003 promised universal access to HIV drugs.
Maxine Waters laments that an employee of the GOP has disclosed data on senators, and denounces "hazardous lies" and "theory of conspiracy".
On Saturday, U.S. Republican Maxine Waters denounced the allegations that a member of his team would have published personal information about three Republican senators on Wikipedia's legislative pages.
Los Angeles Democrat stated that these statements were supported by experts and "extremely right" websites.
"Flying, lying, and still inflamed lies" Waters responded in a Twitter statement.
It would seem that the information disclosed included the addresses and phone numbers of the American senators. Lindsey Graham, South Carolina, Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information was posted on Thursday by an unknown in Capitol Hill during the Senate meeting on allegations of sexual assault against the candidate at the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh.
The escape took place some time after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
According to Hill, conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState indicated that the IP address identifying the source of the messages was associated with the Waters office and disclosed the information of a Waters staff member.
According to Waters, “this unfounded claim is completely false and an absolute lie. ”
"The member of my team, whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised because of these false and false allegations, is in no way responsible for the leaking of this information."
“ This falsifying lie is completely false and a real lie. ”
Waters' statement quickly raised online criticisms, including on the part of Ari Fleischer, the former Maison-Blanche presswoman.
"This disgrace is anger," he wrote.
"This indicates that she does not have the temper necessary to be a member of the Congress.
When a person is accused of something she has not done, she must not be angry.
She must not be provocative.
It must not challenge the accused's motives.
She must remain calm and calm. ”
Fleischer seemed to compare the response of Waters to the criticisms of the Democrats against Judge Kavanaugh, accused of being too angry at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate at Waters headquarters during the mid-term elections, also shared his thoughts on Twitter.
"If it's true, it's huge," he wrote on Twitter.
In his statement, Waters indicated that his office had warned "the authorities and services responsible for the implementation of the laws concerned" about these fraudulent claims.
"We will ensure that the guilty are exposed," she added, "and that they are held responsible for all their destructive and dangerous acts for all members of my team."
Johnny English has yet to be hit. Parodie de Rowan Atkinson, subdued spy
It has now become a tradition to search for Brexit's scope in any new British film and it seems to apply to this resume of Johnny English's action comedy, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and resurfaced in 2011 with Johnny English, the return.
Will the irony self-satisfaction on the issue of the evidence of our insignificance represent the new chance of our country's export?
In all cases, the incompetent Johnny English, with her eye on her eye and her rubber face, saw her license renewed for the second time in a confused context - this name indicates first of all that it is a great comical creation designed for a non-englophone film audience.
Of course, he is the stupid secret agent who, despite his dubious attempts of glamorous charm, has a little Clouseau, a suspect of Mr. Bean and a good dose of the type who executes a small note in Les Chariots at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympic Games.
Originally, he is also inspired by the traveler and the man of international mystery that Atkinson once played in the Barclaycard television advertisements, now forgotten, leaving the chaos behind him.
The last Johnny English has one or two nice moments.
I liked Johnny English as he approached a helicopter while he wore a medieval armor and the rotor's pals hit his helmet in a short time.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is appreciated, although humor is rather inadequate and unusually superfluous, especially at a time when "serious" licenses such as 007 and Mission impossible make up themselves in all confidence with comedy.
Humour seems to be more focused on children than on adults and, for me, the dazzling adventures of Johnny English are less creative and less targeted than Atkinson's mut film gags in Bean's character.
The assumption of ever-presentity is that Britain has serious problems.
A computer pirate has infiltrated the British spy super-secret web network, revealing the identity of all British agents on the ground, to the great development of the agents in service - a small-scale hela role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the taste that causes the vase to be poured out for a prime minister who is a pumping character on the side of the crisis and who already suffers from a political impularity: Emma Thompson gives the best of himself with this almost Teresa-May character, but there is nothing great about putting his teeth under the scenario.
Its advisors are informed of the information that each active spy has been compromised, that it will have to release one of its retirements.
This means that Johnny English needs to be harassed by himself, who is now employed in a chic institution as a school master, but who secretly teaches lessons about how to become a secret agent: a few beautiful farces here, because English offers an academies such as Rock Academy.
English returned to Whitehall for an emergency information meeting and found Bough, his former long-haline partner, once again camped by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married, connected to a submarine commander, a fun hockey baton role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a bit wasted.
Thus, Batman and Robin, who create great troubles for His Majesty's secret services, go back to action and meet Olga Kurylenko, the beautiful fatal woman Ophelia Bulletin.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister is dangerously under the guise of the technological millennium charisma, which is said to be capable of solving the computer problems of Great Britain: the sadst Jason Volta, interpreted by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough launch their odyssy of falsified jokes: under the decoy of servers, they set fire to a french restaurant; they create chaos by flapping themselves on the luxurious volta veil; and English triggers a real anarchy when he tries, with a helmet of virtual reality, to familiarize himself with the inside of the Volta house.
All arrests are secured for this last sequence, but despite all this, there is nothing wrong with the children in all this.
A rather moderate movie.
I couldn't stop thinking, like for Johnny English's other films: can't the British cinematographic industry offer Rowan Atkinson a role that will really enhance his talent?
The Labour Party has not developed a plan to enable British people to work for four days but to be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn's working party must consider a radical plan that will allow the British to work four days a week - but to be paid for five.
Apparently, the party wants business leaders to benefit workers from the economies generated by artificial intelligence (IA) by giving them an extra day of leave.
This would allow employees to enjoy a three-day weekend, while continuing to reach the same salary.
According to some sources, the idea would be consistent with the party's economic programme and plans to guide the country in favour of workers.
The four-day transition was approved by the trade union congress as a means for workers to benefit from economic change.
An important source within the Labour Party stated in the Sunday Times: "A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year."
"This will not be done in one night, but a four-day work week is a goal that will be shared with the party's approach to rebalance the economy for workers as well as with its global industrial strategy."
The Working Party would not be the first to support this idea, since the Green Party was engaged in a four-day work week during its 2017 general election campaign.
However, this ambition is currently not supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A spokesperson of the Working Party said: "A four-day work week is not a party policy and is not envisaged by it."
The alternate chancellor John McDonnell took advantage of the worklist conference last week to give details of his vision of a socialist economic revolution.
Mr McDonnell stated that he was determined to regain the power of "anonymous administrators" and "winners" in public utility companies.
The additional chancellor plans also provide that the current shareholders of the water companies may not recover the whole of their deployment as the workers' government could operate "deductions" due to alleged misconduct.
It also confirmed its employee integration plan in corporate management boards as well as the creation of an inclusive shareholder fund that will pay 10% of the capital of private enterprises to employees, which will cover up to £500 per year dividends.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy rely on "60 minutes" if the FBI's investigation on Kavanaugh could change their opinion.
The final vote on the appointment of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court was postponed at least one week after the FBI's investigation of charges against him and raised the question of whether the findings of the Office could encourage Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In a broadcast Sunday interview, Scott Pelley, the corresponding program "60 minutes", asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find out what would lead them to change their mind.
Kennedy turned out to be more open than his South Carolina colleague.
“ Of course, ” says Kennedy.
"When I went to the hearing, I said I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, when these allegations were made, and I asked him, "Did you do that?"
He was resolved, determined, without any mistake."
However, Graham's vote seems to be recorded in the stone.
"I have made my decision about Brett Kavanaugh and an explosive charge should be made," he said.
"Dr Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett categorically rejected it," Graham added, making an allusion to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And the people she's appointed couldn't verify it.
It's a 36-year-old case.
I find nothing to change again. ”
What has the Global Citizen Festival done to reduce poverty?
On Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical event with a very impressive star palmmarese and an equally impressive mission: to end poverty in the world.
The Global Citizen Festival, now in its seventh edition, will see tens of thousands of people joining the Great Lawn in Central Park in order not only to benefit from the performance of artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the true objective of the festival, namely to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, the first edition of which took place in 2012, is a Global Poverty Project, an international defence group that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people who actively fight it.
In order to receive a free ticket for the event (unless you are willing to pay a VIP ticket), spectators had to perform a series of tasks, or "actions", such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, telephone or make any other useful effort to raise awareness of poverty.
But to what extent can the Global Citizen still achieve its objective in the twelve years remaining?
The idea of rewarding people with free concert really allows them to be persuaded to call for action, or is it just another example of "clickivism" - a situation in which people really think of making the difference by signing a petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has recorded more than 19 million "actions" on the part of its participants, who are fighting for many different goals.
According to the organization, these actions have contributed to encouraging global leaders to make commitments and to adopt policies that amount to more than $37 billion that should change the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group mentioned 390 commitments and announcements arising from its actions, including a tranche of at least $10 billion already disbursed or raised.
The group believes that the guaranteed funds have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Among the main commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a British partnership of investors and executives who are committed to "helping children to develop their full potential", while promising Rwanda 35 million books Sterling to end malnutrition in that country after receiving more than 4,700 messages from Global Citizens.
"Thanks to the support of the British government, donors, national governments and the Global Citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of denutrition a bottom note in history," said Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of the The Power of Nutrition program at a concert that took place in London in April 2018.
The group also stated that following more than 5,000 actions to seek to improve the nutrition of mothers and children in the United Kingdom, the Government announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will benefit 5 million women and children in nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the most frequently asked questions on its website, "What makes you think it is possible to end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen said: "The way to get there will be long and difficult, sometimes we will fall and fail.
However, like the great civil rights defence and the fight against apartheid before us, we will get there, because we are more powerful together.
Janet Jackson, The Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are among the artists that will take place this year in New York, where Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman will animated the show.
The United States could appeal to the Navy to create a "block" in order to prevent Russian energy exports - Secretary of the Interior
In order to avoid the arrival of Russian energy in the markets, including in the Middle East, Washington can "if necessary" appeal to the American Navy, Ryan Zinke, the U.S. Secretary of the Interior, quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke stated that Russia's presence in Syria - including where it operates at the request of the legitimate government - is a pretext that enables it to explore new energy markets.
"I believe that they are in the Middle East in order to negotiate energy as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern centre of Europe," he would have said.
According to the official representative, there are ways to remedy the situation.
"The United States, with our Marine, can ensure that maritime routes are open and, if necessary, obstruct in order to ensure that their energy is not placed on the market," he added.
Zinke addressed participants to the Energy Alliance Consumer event, a non-profit organization that defines itself as the "wordbook of energy consumers" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, stressing that they are in reality identical.
"As far as Iran and Russia are concerned, the economic option is more or less in the operation and replacement of fuels," he said, while referring to Russia, saying that it has "more than one string at its arc" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
These statements come at a time when the Trump administration has undertaken to speed up the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia with a much less expensive solution for European consumers.
To this end, representatives of the Trump administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to leave the "inappropriate" project of the Northern Stream 2, which, according to Trump, makes the city of Berlin a "prisoner" of Moscow.
On several occasions, Moscow stressed that the North Stream 2 pipeline of $11 billion, which should double the current capacity to reach 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
Kremlin claims that Washington's fierce opposition to the project is simply motivated by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
In a speech delivered in September in Moscow following a meeting with Rick Perry, the US Energy Secretary, Russian Energy Minister Alexandre Novak said, "I believe we share this opinion that energy cannot be a pressure tool and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers."
The position of the United States led to negative reactions from Germany, which reaffirmed its involvement in the project.
The main German industrial organization, the German Industry Federation (IDB), has called on the United States not to engage in European energy policy or bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a huge problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, director of the German Industry Federation (BI) following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will seriously consider presenting himself to the presidential elections of 2020, says Senator of Massachusetts
Senator Elizabeth Warren announced on Saturday that she would seriously consider presenting herself to the presidential elections following the mid-term elections.
At a public assembly in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was thinking of presenting herself.
"The time has come for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government, and for this, a woman will have to be at the top," she said, according to The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will seriously consider presenting my candidacy to the Presidents."
Warren said what she thought of President Donald Trump at the public meeting, saying he was "leading this country in the wrong direction".
"I am extremely concerned about what Donald Trump has done to our democracy," she said.
Warren was openly critical of Trump and of the candidate at the Supreme Court of the latter, Brett Kavanaugh.
Friday, in a Twitter message, Warren said, "Of course we need an FBI survey before we vote."
However, a survey published on Thursday showed that the majority of Warren's electors are not of the opinion that it should be presented in 2020.
According to a survey by the Political Research Centre of the University of Suffolk and Boston Globe, 58% of the "probably" electors of Massachusetts claimed that the senator should not appear.
32% were in favour of such a campaign.
The survey revealed that former Governor Deval Patrick was more supportive, with 38% in favour of a potential campaign and 48% against it.
Among the other names of very well-known democrats for a potential campaign in 2020 are those of former Vice-President Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden said he would make an official decision by January.
Sarah Palin mentions the PTSD of Track Palin during the gathering of Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26 years old, spent a year in Iraq after his roll in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and accused of domestic violence.
"What my own son is currently experiencing, what he feels when he comes back, I can relate it to other families that feel the consequences of the PTSD and some of the injuries our soldiers are returning with," she told the public at the meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin described his arrest as "the subject of taboo" and stated about his son and other former combatants that "they come back a little different, hard, wondering whether they were being respected by their friends and members of the air force, and each other, gave the country."
According to Dan Bennett, a spokesperson for the Wasilla Police Service, he was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of marital assault and violence on a woman, which interferes with a report of marital violence and possession of a weapon in a state of Hebrew.
18 States and the District of Columbia are in favour of a judicial challenge to the new asylum policy
18 States and the District of Columbia are in favour of a judicial challenge to the new American policy that refuses asylum to victims of gang or domestic violence.
On Friday in Washington, representatives of the 18 States and the district filed a memorandum in favour of an asylum-seeker who challenged this policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the complainant in Grace v. Sessions opened in August by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy has not been disclosed.
She stated that her partner "and his sons, violent gang members", had attacked her, but the US authorities decided to reject her asylum application on 20 July.
She was detained in Texas.
The prosecutors of States supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generated a large number of asylum applications in the United States, such as countries facing common problems of gang and marital violence.
The new US asylum policy cancelled a decision made in 2014 by the Immigration Appeals Council, which allowed clandestine immigrants to flee from marital violence to apply for asylum.
Karl Racine, District Attorney General of Columbia, stated on Friday in a statement that the new policy "is ignoring decades of state, federal and international law".
"The federal law stipulates that all asylum applications must be examined according to the particular facts and circumstances of the application, and such a prohibition violates this principle," said the curiae friend in his memory.
In addition, lawyers have supported in the memory that the policy of refusing to join immigrants at night in the US economy, claiming that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and to "provide the necessary work".
The Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered the immigration judges in June to no longer grant asylum to victims of marital violence and gang violence.
"Assil is granted to persons who leave their country of origin because of persecution or fear for reasons of race, belief, nationality, belonging to a particular social group or political convictions," Sessions said on 11 June in their announcement of that policy.
"Assile has never been designed to alleviate all problems -- even the most serious -- that people meet every day around the world."
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu while the number of double deaths in the race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation is increasingly dramatic.
"I feel very inclined," said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old family mother, comforting her little festive boy in Palu, in a rural evacuation center.
"At every moment, an ambulance brings back the bodies.
Clean water is rare."
Residents were being watched to return to their ruined homes, to collect stolen property, and to try to save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals damaged by magnitude 7.5 earthquake were submerged.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Haris, who suffered from a fracture of the back and shoulders, rested at the Palu military hospital, where the patients were treated outside because of strong persistent replicas.
The tears filled his eyes when he told how he had felt the violent earthquake that swept the hotel room on the fifth floor where he was staying with his wife and daughter.
"We didn't have time to save ourselves.
I was crushed in the ruins of the wall, I believe," Haris entrusted to Associated Press, stating that his family was in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife call for help, but after silence.
I don't know what happened to him or my child.
I hope they're safe."
The US ambassador accuses China of "intimidation" through "advertising advertising"
A week after a Chinese official newspaper went through a four-page advertising of the mutual advantages of trade between the United States and China in an American daily, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump mentioned last Wednesday the supplement paid by China Daily in Des Moines Register - the most sold newspaper in Iowa – after accusing China of trying to implicate itself in the US parliamentary elections of 6 November, an accusation that China rejects.
By accusing Beijing of wanting to join the U.S. elections, Trump noted what American officials told Reuters to be a new phase in a growing campaign carried out by Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to place advertising in order to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently paralyzed in a growing trade war that has led them to apply reciprocal tariffs to their imports.
At the beginning of the trade war, China's tariff measures were aimed at striking the exporters of States such as Iowa, which supported the Republican Trump, said Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, US Ambassador to China and former long-term governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said that Beijing had hurt workers, farmers and American businesses.
China, writes Branstad in an opinion article published in the De Moines Register on Sunday, "it is about to double its intimidation by publishing propaganda in our own free press."
"In the dissemination of its propaganda, the Chinese government serves the American tradition of freedom of expression and freedom of the press by inserting a paying advertising in the Des Moines Register," Branstad writes.
“On the other hand, in Beijing’s press directory, you will find few protests and you will not see the real reflection of the divergent views Chinese may have on China’s troubled economic path, because the media strictly obeys the Chinese Communist Party,” he writes.
He added that "one of China's most important newspapers has avoided publishing" his article, not to mention which newspaper.
Analysts warn that the Republicans are alienating the electorate from the mid-term elections because of the Kavanaugh debacle
While many high-ranking Republicans defend Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to the Supreme Court in a context of allegations of sexual assault, analysts warned that a negative reaction, especially in women, could occur during the next half-mandate elections.
The feelings surrounding this case have been extremely vivid, and most Republicans have already publicly shown that they wanted the vote to take place.
In an article published on September 29 in The Hill, Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Maxwell University of Syracuse, stated that "we cannot go back".
Reeher added that he suspected that the last-minute efforts made by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) in favour of an FBI investigation would be sufficient to calm the electorate's anger.
According to Karine Jean-Pierre, chief adviser and spokesperson of the Progressive Group MoveOn, "women will not forget what happened yesterday; they will not forget it tomorrow, and not in November," she said on 28 September, according to the Washington newspaper.
Friday morning, Mic's report, the protesters sang "The month of November comes!" in the corridor of the Senate, while the Republicans governing the Judicial Committee chose to advance the appointment of Kavanaugh despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
"Enthusiasm and democratic motivation will be demised," said Stu Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst.
"People say it's already high, it's true.
But this could be even higher, especially in the polling stations and young voters from 18 to 29 years of age who, even if they don't like the president, often do not vote."
Even before Ford's public statement explaining in detail the allegations of sexual assault against the appointment of the Supreme Court, analysts left it to believe that the reaction would be likely to be alive if the Republicans made the confirmation progress.
According to NBC News, former president of the National Committee of the Republican, Michael Steele, said at the beginning of last week that "It has become a confused disorder for the GOP".
"This is not only the vote of the committee or the final vote, nor the appointment of Kavanaugh. It is also the way in which the Republicans managed the situation and the way they dealt with it," noted Guy Cecil, director of the United States Priorities, a group that assists the elected Democrats in the television newspaper.
Following the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, however, the Americans appear to be divided about the credibility of the two parties, a small majority on the side of the latter.
A new survey by YouGov revealed that 41 per cent of the respondents believed in Ford's testimony in absolute or probable terms, while 35 per cent claimed to believe in absolute or probable Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% claimed that Kavanaugh had probably or absolutely lied during his testimony, while only 30% claimed the same thing about Ford.
According to The Guardian, the FBI investigates allegations made by Ford and at least another prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, following the pressure of Senator Flake.
Ford testified under oath last week before the Senate Judicial Committee that she had been assaulted by Kavanaugh while he was in a state of marriage at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that when they studied in Yale in the 1980s, the candidate in the Supreme Court would have shown him his genital parts during a festival.
The Inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a New Internet to Defer Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a new company that seeks to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technological legend, Inrupt, is a society that takes part in the Free Platform Solid de Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored, as well as persons authorised to access such information.
In an exclusive interview given to Fast Company, Berners-Lee said with pleasure that Inrupt was intended to "dominating the world".
"We have to do it now," he said about the launch.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own personal data store online or DPL.
It can contain contact lists, task lists, a calendar, a musical library as well as other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available at the same time on one browser.
The particularity of the online personal data store is that it belongs entirely to the user to decide which kind of information can be accessed.
The company calls this "personal responsibility through the data".
According to the company's PDG, John Bruce, the idea of Inrupt is that the company provides adequate resources, processes and skills to make Solid accessible to all.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some developers working on the project and a community of voluntary codes.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralised applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee has said that his team and he is not yet in discussion with " Facebook and Google" in order to know whether or not to make a complete change where all their business models are completely jammed in one moment.
“We do not ask for permission from them.”
In an article published on Saturday on Medium, Berners-Lee writes that the "mission [d'Inrupt] consists of providing commercial energy and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid".
In 1994, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by creating the World Wide Web Consortium.
Over the past few months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on the neutrality of the network.
Although he has launched Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely optimistic about this new era of the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of an ecclesiastical celebration of World War I decorated by the Cross of Victoria
The only ecclesiastical of the Church of England to have received the Cross of Victoria during World War I as a fighter was celebrated in its hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann won this distinction on September 29, 1918, during the attack in Bellenglie and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by an elite shooter four days later and was unaware that he had obtained the highest British military distinction.
His two grandsons discovered a memorial stone during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, last Saturday.
Michael Vann, one of his grandsons, said he was "symbolic brightness" to reveal the stone exactly 100 years after his grandfather's exploitation.
According to London Gazatte, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Vann headed his battalion on the Saint-Quentin canal "through a very thick brow and under the violent shooting of cannons of campaign and machine guns".
Later, he rushed on the shooting line and, with the "greatest bravoure", drove the line before making a canon of campaign to him alone and to sum up three soldiers from the detachment.
On October 4, 1918, a German elite shooter killed Lieutenant Colonel Vann, a little over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "a thing that I will never be, but that makes me humble."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also filed a crown after the demonstration led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann believed that he felt “very honored to be part of the parade” and added that “the courage of an authentic hero is reflected in the support he will receive from many people.”
The fans of mixed martial arts were awakened all night to watch Bellator 206. Instead, they had Peppa Pig
Imagine this, you spent the whole night looking at a well filled Bellator 206, but you couldn't see the main event.
In San José, the event had 13 matches, six on the main page, and was broadcast live throughout the night in the United Kingdom, on Channel 5.
At 6 o'clock in the morning, at a time when Gegard Mouusasi and Rory MacDonald were ready to face up, UK televisers were seated when the broadcast changed for Peppa Pig.
Some were not content to remain awake until the first hours of the morning, especially for the fight.
A Twitter supporter described the passage to animated drawing for children as "a kind of bad joke".
Regarding the transmission, the chief marketing and communications vice-president of Bellator, Dave Schwartz, said that "the government regulation has that at 6 o'clock in the morning, this content was not appropriate, so they had to go back to children's emissions."
"Peppa the Pig," yes.
Scott Coker, president of Bellator's company, said they were going to work on their programming in order to include future British TV viewers.
"I think that when I think about redistribution, I think we can probably find a solution," Coker said.
“However, it is six o’clock in the morning one Sunday and we will not be able to find a solution before Sunday, or Monday, their hour.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program went off, there were lots of messages in both directions and they weren't all friends.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't a problem, it was a government issue.
I can assure you this won't happen next time.
We will limit ourselves to five fights instead of six - as we do the usual - and we have tried to give more for the fans and we have lost everything.
It is a sad situation."
Desert Island Discs : Tom Daley felt "lower" on sexuality
The Olympic swimmer Tom Daley claims to have grown up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality - but this inflated him with the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old man said he didn't realize before going to high school that "everybody wasn't like me."
As part of the first broadcast of Radio 4 Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren Laverne, he said that he had talked about the issue of the rights of homosexuals to give others hope.
He also said that becoming a parent made him less interested in winning the Olympic Games.
The usual showcaser, Kirsty Young, took leave for several months because of her illness.
As a sailor in Laverne's first show, Daley believed that he felt "less than" all the other children growing up because "it was not socially acceptable to love boys and girls".
He said, "Today, these feelings of inferiority and differences are the real things that have given me the power and strength I need to succeed."
In order not to discover everyone when they finally learned the truth about his sexuality, he wanted to prove that he was "something," he continued.
The double medalist of Olympic bronze is now a renowned LGBT militant and has benefited from his participation this year in the Commonwealth Games in Australia in order to demand a larger number of countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he expressed himself because he felt that he was able to live openly without ramifications and that he wanted to give "hope" to others.
The world's triple champion claimed that he "did not expect" to fall in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, met in 2013
Daley married Oscar's 20-year-old son last year, but he said the age difference was never a problem.
"When you live so much at such a young age" - he participated in his first 14-year-old Olympics and his father died of cancer three years later - he said he trusted that it was difficult to find a person of the same age who had known the same high and low ages.
In June, they became the parents of a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that "all his perspective" had changed.
"If you asked me last year, I thought only to win a gold medal," he said.
"You know what, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 following a brain cancer.
Daley confessed that his father had not accepted that he was going to die and that one of the last things he had asked him was whether they had already their tickets for London in 2012, since he wanted to be seated in the first row.
"I couldn't tell him, "Dad, you won't be here anymore to be in the first row," he said.
"I held him by the hand when he stopped breathing and he had to stop breathing and he had to die so that I could finally recognize that he was not invincible," he added.
The following year, Daley participated in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"It was all I had dreamed of my whole life - filling a crowd at home in the Olympic Games, there's nothing better," he said.
In addition, it inspired her first choice of song - Proud of Heather Small - who had accompanied her during preparations for the Olympics and always gave her chicken meat.
Desert Island Disks is on BBC Radio 4 Sunday at 11.15, BST.
A Mikkelson out of shape on Ryder Cup bank Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will make a record this Sunday playing his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to re-enter to avoid a miserable step.
Mikkelson, who participated in the two-year competition for the 12th time, was removed by Captain Jim Furyk of the fourballs and foursomes of Saturday.
Instead of being at the heart of the action, as it has so often been for the United States, the fifth largest champion shared his day between the role of supporting and the promotion of his game to the stand in order to remedy his ills.
He has never been the biggest of the teenagers, even at the top of his career. At 48 years of age, he is not the most suitable for the difficult Golf National, where the long rough is systematically punishing the given blows.
And as if the tour wasn't quite reroubled in itself, Mikkelson, at the ninth Sunday match, faced Francesco Molinari, the winner of the British Open, who teamed up with Tommy Fleetwood this week to win their four matches.
If the Americans, four down at the beginning of the 12 simple games, take a good start, Mikkelson's match could be absolutely crucial.
Fury expressed his confidence in his man, but he couldn't say anything else.
"He fully understood the role he had to play today, gave me a tape in my back, put his arms around me and said that he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
“ He has great trust in him.
It's a legendary champion and he's added so much to these teams in the past, just like this week.
I probably didn't see him playing two games.
I was planning more, but that's what happened and that's what we thought we should do.
He wants to be there, like everyone else."
Sunday, Mikkelson will beat Nick Faldo's record of the biggest number of Ryder Cup meetings.
This could mark the end of a career at Ryder Cup that has never really reached the heights of his individual record.
Mikkelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven decades, although Fury has stated that his presence has brought concrete elements to the team.
He's funny, sarcastic, spiritual, he likes to mock people, and he's a formidable guy to have in the team room," he explained.
"I think the younger players had the pleasure of measuring themselves to him this week, which was fun to see.
It does much more than play. ”
The captain of the European elections Thomas Bjorn knows that the advance could soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows by experience that a non-neglectable advance before the last day of Ryder Cup can easily turn into a painful course.
The Danois fought his first match in 1997 in Valderrama, where a team with the captain Seven Ballesteros had five points of advance on the Americans, but finally stepped in the head of the ranking with the smallest possible gap on the line of arrival, carrying it 141 1⁄2-131⁄2.
"You don't stop remembering that we were taking a lot to Valderrama; we had a big advance in Brookline, where we failed, as well as Valderrama, where we won, but with justice," Bjorn said, after observing the 2018 Classing win 5-3 both Friday and yesterday at the National Golf to drive 10-6.
The story will prove to me and all the members of this team that this is not the end.
Get down there tomorrow.
Go in there and do whatever you need.
It's not over before you have the points on the table.
We have a goal, that is to try to win this trophies, and that's where we have to stay focused.
I have always said to focus on the 12 players in our camp, but we are very aware of what is happening on the other hand - these are the best players in the world."
Ravi of the performances of his players on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never advance on this point.
Tomorrow, it's another pair of sleeves.
Tomorrow, these are the individual performances that will be presented and it goes otherwise.
It's fantastic to be with a teammate when things go well, but when you're there alone, you're put to the test of your full capacity as a golfer.
Here's the message to get to the players, it's to get the best of you tomorrow.
When we leave his partner behind, he has to go get the best of himself, too."
Unlike Bjorn, his counterpart Jim Furyk will seek to ensure that his players get better results individually than as teammates, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points on four.
Fury himself knew the two extremes of these last-day revisions, after being part of the winning team in Brookline before losing to the end of the "Medinah Miracle", where Europe won the victory.
"I remember every word," he explained in answer to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had done to slow down his players the last day.
"We have 12 important meetings tomorrow, but you would like to take this quick departure as you saw it in Brookline, as you saw it in Medina.
This dynamic, when it goes in a sense, weighs a lot of pressure on the games in the middle.
We have established our training accordingly and put the men as we plan to do it, we try to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas has been assigned the task of conducting the counter-attack and will face Rory McIlroy in the first-class duel, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans in the highest half of the ranking.
"I accompanied this group of guys in this order because I think it covers the entire course," Bjorn said about his selections in simple.
Germany's new warship is still under way
According to local media, the new German Navy fleet had to be deployed in 2014 to replace the old warships dating from the cold war, but it will not be in service until at least next year due to defective systems and exponential expenditures.
According to Die Zeit, which cites a military spokesman, the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the amiral ship of all the new frogs of the Bade-Wurtemberg, was reported in the first half of 2019.
The ship had to integrate the Marine in 2014, but the worrying problems that arose after delivery compromised the purpose of this ambitious project.
The four vessels of the Bade-Wurtemberg class ordered by the Marine in 2007 will be replaced by the ageing frogs of the Breme class.
It is certain that they will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-Navir missiles, as well as some furtive technologies, such as a radar, infrared and acoustic signature.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to deploy the most recent frigates for a period of up to two years outside the dock ports.
According to Die Zeit, however, the incessant delays mean that warships - which should allow Germany to project its extra-sea power - will already be obsolete when they are put into service.
Last year, the Maudite F125 frigate made the big titles when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship in service and sent it back to the shipyard Blohm & Voss, Hamburg.
It was the first time Marine returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
The reasons for this return were not known, but the German media mentioned a number of “software and material defects” that made the warship useless in the event of deployment in combat missions.
Software defects were particularly important because the Bade-Wurtemberg ships will be operated by a crew composed of about 120 sailors, which corresponds to half of the crews of the old frigates of the Bremen class.
In addition, it appears that the ship is considerably overloaded, which reduces its performance and reduces the Marine's ability to make future improvements.
It is estimated that the "Greenland-Pfalz" of 7,000 tons weighs twice as much as the similar class ships used by the Germans during the Second World War.
In addition to the shortcomings of the computer system, the cost of the project as a whole - including the training of the crew - also becomes a problem.
It is said that it has reached the astronomical sum of 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion), compared with 2.2 billion in the beginning.
The problems associated with the new fregats are of particular importance in the light of recent warnings that the German naval force is reducing.
Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, earlier this year acknowledged that the Marine is in fact "short of ships capable of deploying".
The respondent stated that the situation had caused a snowstorm over time, as the old ships had been decommissioned but no replacement ships had been designated.
He regretted that none of the members of the Bade-Wurtemberg class could join the Navy.
The National Trust oversees the secret life of mice
New research carried out in an area of the Scottish Highlands is seeking to reveal how the mice use the landscape in their search for food.
It is hoped that the observations will shed new light on the behaviour of these single flying mammals and guide future conservation activities.
The study of the National Trust for Scotland researchers will follow common and soprano pipelines as well as long-eared brown and Daubenton sauves in the Inverewe garden in Western Ross.
Special recording devices will be placed in key locations around the property in order to monitor the activities of the sewers throughout the season.
NHS personnel and volunteers will also conduct mobile studies using portable detectors.
A professional analysis of its results will determine the frequency of the sluice crisis as well as the activities of the different species.
A map and a habitat report will be prepared to draw a detailed picture of their behaviour at the territorial level.
Rob Dewar, Nature Conservation Adviser for the NTS, hopes that the results will reveal the most important habitat areas for mice and how they are used by each species.
This information will determine the benefits of the habitat management work such as the creation of meadows and the best way to preserve forests for mice and other related species.
In Scotland and the United Kingdom, the slum population has decreased considerably over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development works that affect the perch and cause the loss of their habitat.
The windshields and lighting can also pose a risk, as can the deadly paper and certain chemical treatments of construction materials, as well as the attacks of company chats.
The mice are not really blind.
However, given their night hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use sophisticated echolocation techniques to detect insects and obstacles on their flight route.
Responsible for the protection of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, the NTS takes the tails very seriously.
He has ten trained experts, who carry out regular surveys, search inspections and sometimes rescues.
The organization has also established the first and only reserve of Scotland's foothills on the site of Thrave in Dumfries-and-Galloway, which covers eight of the 10 species of Scotland's foothills.
David Thompson, field manager, states that the site is the ideal territory for them.
"Here, in Treve, we have an ideal place for girls," he said.
"We have old buildings, many old trees and all the good habitat.
But there is still much to learn about the chauvies, so much so that the work we do here and elsewhere will help us to better understand what the chauvies need to prosper."
He stressed the importance of checking the presence of mice before the maintenance of the properties, because by destroying it without wanting to have a single motherhood nest, 400 women and children, or the disappearance of a whole local population can be killed.
The mice are protected and it is illegal to kill them, to disturb them, or to destroy their pathogens.
Elizabeth Ferrell, the Scotlandan maintainer of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our mice and many of our species, we don't know what's going on in their populations for now."
Ronaldo rejects charges of rape while his lawyers prepare to prosecute a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called charges of rape against him “false information ” and claimed that people“ want to be known ” by using his name.
His lawyers are prepared to continue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The attacker of Portugal and Youth was accused of violating an American named Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He would then have paid her $375 000 to keep silence on this incident, said Der Spiegel on Friday last.
By addressing his 142 million fans in a live video on Instagram, a few hours after the allegations were spread, Ronaldo, 33 years old, described this information as "false information".
“ No, no, no, no, and no.
What they have said today is a false information," the five-year winner of the Golden Ball told the camera.
“ They want to make themselves public by using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything's fine," added the player smiling.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are prepared to pursue Der Spiegel's allegations that they have qualified as "inadmissible denial of suspicion in the field of private life".
Lawyer Christian Schertz stated that the player would claim compensation for “moral damage to a amount proportionate to the severity of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious violations of the human rights of the past few years”.
The alleged incident would have taken place in June 2009 following the Palms Hotel in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a nightbox, Ronaldo and Mayorga apparently returned to the player's room, where an anal rape would occur, according to the documents filed with the Clark County Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo had kneeled after the alleged incident and had assured him to be a "good man" to "99%", but that he did not know what was going on with the remaining "1%".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sexual relations, but that they were agreed upon.
Mayorga also claimed that she had returned to the police and that photos of her injuries had been taken to a hospital, but that she had subsequently accepted a settlement to the friendly because she felt "feared by reprisals" and feared "to suffer a public humiliation".
This 34-year-old woman says she is now seeking to repeal this regulation, as she remains traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join the Royal Madrid by leaving Manchester United at the time of this alleged aggression, and this summer he joined the Italian giant Juve as part of a 100 million euros contract.
Brexit: The United Kingdom would "never regret" the departure of car manufacturers.
According to Greg Clark, the State Secretary for Commerce, the United Kingdom would "never regret it" if she had just lost her status as world leader of car construction after Brexit.
He added that it was "disquieting" that Toyota UK told the BBC that it would temporarily stop production in its factory in Burnaston, near Derby, if Britain withdrew from the EU without an agreement.
"We need an agreement," Clark said.
The Japanese automotive manufacturer indicated that the impact of delays at the border in the event of a Brexit without agreement could cost jobs.
The factory in Burnaston - which manufactures the Auris and Avensis vehicles in Toyota - built nearly 150 000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the other countries of the European Union.
"I consider that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production will stop in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other British car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, expressed their fear of leaving the EU without agreement on the functioning of cross-border trade.
For example, BMW indicates that it will stop its Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are that car manufacturers are at risk for the Brexit supply chain without agreement.
Toyota's production line is operated in 'tender flows', parts reach all 37 minutes of UK and EU suppliers for vehicles manufactured under control.
If, on 29 March, the United Kingdom leaves the EU without agreement, there could be disturbances at the frontier which, according to industry, could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep the inventory more than one day at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, and production would be stopped.
According to Clark, Theresa May's Chequers Plan aimed at future relations with the EU is "precisely calibrated to avoid these checks at the border".
"We need an agreement. We want the best agreement that will allow, as I said, not only to benefit from the current success, but also to seize this opportunity," he said in the BBC's Radio 4's Today.
"The evidence, not only of Toyota but of other builders, is that we must be absolutely able to maintain what has become an excellent set of supply chains."
If Toyota had not been able to specify how long the production would be stopped, however, it warned that in the longer term, additional costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and end up costing jobs.
Peter Tsovallaris, the coordinator of the U.S. trade union at the factory, who has been working for 24 years in Burnaston, said that his members were increasingly concerned: "After my experience, once these jobs are gone, they never come back."
A government spokesperson said: "We have proposed a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the EU."
The White House announces that Trump and Rosenstein's meeting could still be delayed
According to the announcement made on Sunday by the White House, the meeting, which presents important issues, between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "rested for a week", while the fight for the candidate at the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh continues.
Rosenstein oversees Robert Mueller's work, the Special Adviser responsible for investigating Russian interference in the elections, the links between Trump and Russia's collaborators and the possible obstacles to the justice exercised by the President.
The question is whether Trump will return to the Deputy Attorney General, and therefore endangers Mueller's independence, feeding the rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had spoken with a micro to record the talks with Trump and the possibility of eliminating the president by the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied those claims.
However, on the last Monday, he introduced himself to the White House, while he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, then in the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump indicated that he would prefer not to refer to Mr Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed in order to avoid confrontation with the hearing of the Senate's judicial commission before which Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford had testified, one of the women who accused him of sexual assault.
Friday, Trump asked the FBI to conduct a week's inquiry into complaints against Kavanaugh, delaying the Senate's vote.
On Sunday, Trump's press attaché, Sarah Sanders, made an appearance at Fox News.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "No date has been fixed for this, it could be this week, I could see if you're still resting for a week given all the other things that happen to the Supreme Court.
But we'll see and I like to keep the news."
The statement would be challenged by some journalists: Since 10 September, Sanders has held no press conference at the House-Blanche.
Animator Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders replied that the rareness of the conferences was not due to an adjournment for television "demagogic" reporters, although she said, "I have nothing against the fact that they are suffering from the gallery."
Then she let me know that the direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
Without quoting any evidence, she added that "the President participates in more than one question-response sessions than any other president before him": "We have checked the figures."
Press conferences will always take place, Sanders said, but "if the press is able to question the President of the United States directly, it is infinitely better than talking to me.
We are trying to do it frequently, you have seen it well in recent weeks, and this will take place at a press conference where you can talk to the President of the United States."
On a regular basis, Trump answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in public meetings or press conferences with dignitaries.
It is rare that there are press conferences on the ground.
This week, in New York, the President may have demonstrated why, by making a discontracted appearance and by making a strange appearance in front of the assembled journalists.
On the concerns about Brexit, the Secretary of Health wrote to EU workers in NHS Scotland
The Secretary of Health wrote to EU officials working within the Scottish NHS to express their gratitude for the country and to wish to remain in office after Brexit.
The Scottish MP Jeane Freeman sent a letter within a period of less than six months before the United Kingdom did not withdraw from the EU.
The Scottish government has already undertaken to cover the cost of status applications for European citizens working in its decentralised public services.
Freeman wrote in his letter: "In the summer, the withdrawal negotiations continued between the United Kingdom and the EU and should reach decisions this fall.
But the British government has also intensified its preparations in the event of a lack of agreement.
I understand that this period must be very disturbing for each one of you.
That is why I wanted to reiterate to what extent I believe the contribution of each member of staff, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from all over the EU and beyond provide valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is really your home and we really want you to stay here."
After having suffered a head injury, Christian Abercrombie undergoes an emergency surgery
According to Mike Organ of Tennessee State, Christian Abercrombie, the second of the Tennessee Tigers, was operated urgently after a head injury on Saturday during the Vanderbilt Commodores 31-27.
Rod Reed, the state chief coach of Tennessee, told reporters that the injury had occurred just before the mid-term.
"It came on the touch line and collapsed there," Reed said.
Trainers and medical personnel have administered oxygen in Abercrombie on the touch line before placing it on a cemetery and taking it to another exam.
A representative of the state of Tennessee told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was out of the Vanderbilt Medical Center operating room.
Harris pointed out that there was "not yet any explanation of the type or extent of the injury" and that the State of Tennessee was trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year athlete student, is in her first season with the state of Tennessee after her transfer from Illinois.
He had five posters in total on Saturday before he left the match, which brought his total from the season to 18 posters.
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher stamp right if they purchase a property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp rights if they purchase a property in the United Kingdom and additional money will be used to help the homeless under the new conservative regimes
This measure will cancel the success of the campaign by Corbyn to attract young voters
Increase in stamp duty will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The Treasury expects to collect up to 120 million Sterling books a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher stamp rate if they buy a property in the United Kingdom - the additional money will help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
This measure will be seen as an initiative to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters by undertaking to provide more affordable housing and target people with high incomes.
The increase in stamp duty will be imposed on individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and additional money will serve to strengthen government efforts to help homeless people.
This surplus - which is added to the current stamp right, including the higher levels introduced two years ago on secondary residences and purchases - could reach 3%.
The Treasury expects the project to collect up to 120 million Sterling books a year.
About 13% of London's new constructions are purchased by non-residents in the United Kingdom, which increases prices and prevents primary-accents from taking place on the housing market.
Many rich areas of the country - particularly in the capital - have become "phantom cities" because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
This new policy occurs only a few weeks after Boris Johnson demanded a reduction in the right to stamp in order to help more young people acquire a first house.
By charging the large construction companies to maintain the real estate prices at a high level by digging land without using them, he invited Ms. May to cancel the quotas on affordable housing in order to regulate the “indemnity” that is happening in the United Kingdom.
Mr. Corbyn presented an attractive series of reform proposals in the housing sector, including the control of rents and the removal of “free” evictions.
He also wants to give the councils more extensive power to build new housing.
Ms. May said, "Last year, I said that I would dedicate my position as prime minister to the rebirth of the British dream - that every new generation would have a better life.
To do so, we need to repair our damaged housing market.
Britain will always be open to all those who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is unfair that it is as easy for individuals who do not live in the United Kingdom, as well as for foreign companies, to buy a house as for British residents who work hard.
For many too many people, the dream of accessing the property has become distant and the misery of the homeless remains too real."
Jack Ross: My final ambition is to lead Scotland.
Sunderland's technician, Jack Ross, explains that his "last ambition" is to become the Scottish selector at a given time.
The 42-year-old Scotland is pleased to meet the challenge of re-launching the North East Club, which currently occupys the third place of League 1, at three points of the leader.
He joined the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St Mirren to the First League Scotland last season.
"I was going to play for my country as a player.
I was selected for Division B and that's all," Ross told the BBC Scotland Sports Sound.
"But I grew up after the Scottish games in Hampden with my father, and that's one thing I've never forgotten.
This opportunity would, on the other hand, only if I succeeded in managing the club."
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland's electors are Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Alloa Athletic's former technician states that he has not hesitated to get behind such emblematic names in such a big club, having already delineated Barnsley's and Ipswich Town's proposals.
"For me, the success of the moment will be measured in the light of the question "can I bring this club back to the First League?"
From the structure and infrastructure of this club, it certainly belongs to the First League," he added.
"It's not easy to get there, but I'd probably not consider myself a success here unless I get back to the club there."
Ross has only three years of career as a coach, after a period as a assistant in Dumbarton and 15 months in the heart coaches.
He then helped Alloa to re-establish a third-separate religion and transformed St. Mirren, who was on the side of the religion, into a major winner of the championship next season.
Ross is now more comfortable than in his career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
Alloa's taking care of "was no doubt a real caravan," he recalls.
"I really found that being a coach was better than playing.
That seems strange because I got good at it, that I made a good profit in my life, and that I took advantage of some valuable summits.
But playing is sometimes difficult.
There's a lot of details to sort out every week.
I continue to live this in terms of stress and stress at work, but being a coach is going very well.
I always wanted to lead, and now I do, I feel more comfortable in my skin than I have been in my adult life."

The summer cane has made British pub revenues more difficult, but has increased the pressure on the restaurant chains.
The figures indicate that bar groups and pubs recorded an increase of 2.7 per cent of their sales in July, but revenues in restaurants fell by 4.8 .
Peter Martin, of the CGA Council, who compiled the data, said: "The permanent ensemble and longer participation than planned by England at the World Cup made the month of July follow the June model, where bars had increased by 2.8%, except for restaurants, which had suffered even more significant shock.
The fall of 1.8 per cent recorded in June in the restoration sector only made it rain in July.
The pubs and bars where alcoholic beverages are served are the most in vogue, with more similar points than the lower restaurants.
Food pubs have also suffered effects from the sun, but not as much as restaurants.
It seems that people just wanted to go out for a glass.
In pubs and bars, the sales of drinks increased by 6,6 per cent per month and food decreased by 3 per cent. ”
Paul Newman, a specialist analyst at leisure and RSM hotel, said: "These results follow the trend observed since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the most important factors for domestic sales.
It is not surprising that the restoration groups continue to experience difficulties, however a decrease of 4.8 per cent on average per year is particularly painful, in addition to the continuing cost pressure.
The long and warm stay could not have been less convenient for food industry operators and time will tell us if the more moderate temperatures we have known in August will give us a well-deserved rep."
Total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7% in July, reflecting slowdown in the implantation.
Industry sales are monitored by the Peach Tracker Coffer for the UK pubs, bars and restaurants sector, which collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of more than 9 billion Sterling books and is the standard in the established industry.
On social media, a child in five has secret accounts he hides to his parents
According to one survey, a child in five - some of whom are only 11 - has secret accounts on social media that he hides to his parents and teachers
A survey conducted with 20,000 secondary students revealed an increase in the "false Insta" pages
The news emphasized concerns about the publication of content of a sexual nature
20% of students said to have a "main" account to show their parents
A child of five - some of whom are only 11 - opens an account on the social media that he keeps hidden to adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary students revealed a rapid growth of Insta false accounts - a reference to the Instagram photo sharing site.
The news highlighted concerns about the publication of content of a sexual nature.
20 per cent of students have declared managing a clean “main” account to show their parents, while having a private account.
A mother who accidentally fell on the secret site of her 13 - year - old daughter discovered a teenager who encouraged others to “violate me. ”
According to the study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headmasters Conference (HMC) of independent schools, 40% of young people between 11 and 18 years of age have a double profile, half of students recognizing having private accounts.
CSM head Mike Buchanan said: “It is worrying that so many teenagers are being tried to create online places where parents and teachers do not find them. ”
Elid Doyle will represent the athletes at the Scottish Athletics Board of Directors.
Elid Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Board as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most decorated Scottish athlete in athleticism, and President Ian Beattie described this choice as an excellent opportunity for the leaders of this sport to take advantage of its extensive international experience these ten years.
"Eilid is highly respected in the Scottish, British and World Athletic community and we are sure that Athleticism in Scotland would benefit greatly from its participation in the Council," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I really want to be the voice of athletes and I really want to be able to make my contribution and guide this sport in Scotland."

Online advertising on milk that compares mothers and cows divides opinions
An online advertising of a company that offers milk is compared to breast-feeding mothers in the course of trafficking.
In order to mark the launch of what is called "first silent milk to the world", Elvie, a large-scale public technology company, launched a bold advertisement inspired by a musical video clip to show the freedom its new milk offers to nursing women.
In a cow farm full of ovens, four real mothers dance at the rhythm of a song whose words are: "Yes, I betray myself, but you don't see a tail" and "In case you didn't notice it, these are my sons, not mothers."
The refrain continues: "Spring, pumping, feeding babies, pumping, pumping, pumping, helping women with milk."
However, advertising, which was published on the company's Facebook page, has created an online controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received conflicting reactions from the public, many of whom say it sheds light on the "greeds" of the dairy industry.
"A worse decision than to use cows to promote this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their babies are taken away in the days that follow their birth," one of them wrote.

Another commented: "It is understandable trauma for mother and baby.
But yes, why not use them to make the announcement of a milk shoot for mothers who keep their baby?"
Someone else added: "A advertisement so disconnected."
Others have defended advertising, such as a woman admitting that she found the song "hilarant".
"I think it's a genius idea.
I'd have bought one if I was still going to leave.
Pomper made me feel like a cow.
Advertising is a little bad, but I took it for what it was.
It's a great product," said someone.
Someone else commented: "It's a fun advertisement for mothers who take their milk (usually at their place of work or in the toilets) and feel like cows.
It is not advertising that makes the milk industry famous."
At the end of the video, women reveal that they have danced with the discrete milks dissimulated in their gorilla support.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the idea that many women who use milk are saying that they have the impression of being cows.
However, Elvie's milk is completely silent, without a son or a pipe, and is discreetly involved in a breast-feeding bra, which gives women the freedom to move, hold their baby, and even get out while milking their milk.
Ana Balarin, partner and DPE at Mother commented: "Elvie's milk is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By making a parallel between nursing mothers and dairy cows, we wanted to focus on the extraction of breast milk and all its challenges, while expressing in a fun and reliable way the incredible sense of freedom that this new milk will provide.
It's not the first time Elvie's milk takes one of the newspapers.
During the fashion week in London, a mother of two children appeared on the stage of designer Marta Jakubowski while using this product.
Hundreds of migrant children settled quietly in a camp on the coast of Texas
The number of migrant children detained has greatly increased, although the number of monthly border crossings remains relatively stable, partly due to the fact that the severe speeches and policies of the Trump administration have made it possible to complicate child placements among respondents.
Traditionally, most respondents were themselves immigrants without papers and were afraid to compromise their own ability to stay in the country by bringing about a child's rescue.
The risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that potential respondents and adult members of their home should submit their fingerprints and that these data would be transmitted to the immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, a senior official of the Immigration and Customs Service, testified last week to the Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had made an application for assistance from unaccompanied minors.
The Agency subsequently confirmed that 70 per cent of the detainees had no legal background.
"About 80% of the respondents or family members are illegal here, and many of them are foreign criminals.
Therefore, we continue to pursue these people," Albence said.
According to refugees, in order to treat the case of children more quickly, the authorities have introduced new rules that will force some of them to appear before the court in the month following their detention, rather than after 60 days, which was the previous standard.
Many of them will be compared by videoconference, rather than by anyone, to complain about their legal status before an immigration judge.
Non-electable persons will soon be expelled.
According to speakers and reports submitted over the past few months by the refugee network, the longer children remain in detention, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which may lead to outbreaks of violence or attempts to flee.
In a large establishment such as Tornillo, these concerns are exacerbated by the fact that the signs indicating that a child is in difficulty are more likely to be neglected because of its size, according to the rights defenders of the child.
They added that moving children to the camp without giving them time to prepare emotionally or say again to their friends could accentuate a trauma that many have trouble managing.
Syria asks the U.S., French and Turkish "occupational forces" to withdraw to the field.
In an address to the United Nations General Assembly, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Walid al-Moualem also called upon Syrian refugees to return to their homes, even though the war in that country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, also Deputy Prime Minister, stated that foreign forces were illegally on the Syrian ground, under the pretext of combating terrorism, and that they would "be treated accordingly".
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he said to the assembly.
Moualem argued that "war on terrorism is almost over" in Syria, while more than 360 000 people have been killed since 2011 and millions of others have been displaced from their homes.
He indicated that Damascus would continue to "run this sacred battle until all Syrian territories are cleansed" both of the two terrorist groups and of any "unlawful foreign presence".
The United States has some 2,000 soldiers in Syria, most of whom are trained and advised both the Kurdish forces and the Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bachar al-Assad.
In this war-damaged country, France has more than 1,000 soldiers in place.
Moualem said about refugees, that the conditions were favourable to their return, and accused “some Western countries” of “producing irrational concerns” that discouraged refugees from returning.
"We have called upon the international community and humanitarian organizations to make these returns easier," he said.
“They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have indicated that there would be no support for the reconstruction of Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end this war would not be concluded.
United Nations diplomats claim that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey for the creation of a buffer zone in the last rebel fortress of Idlib has made it possible to advance political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement has prevented a large-scale coup on the province where three million people live, by the Syrian forces supported by Russia.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement provided for "precise times" and hoped that military measures would target the jihadists, in particular the combatants of the Nusra Front, who are related to Al-Qaeda and who will "be eliminated".
Staffan de Mistura, representative of the United Nations, hopes to convene soon the first meetings of a new committee of government and opposition members to prepare a post-war constitution and prepare the way for elections in Syria.
Moualem defined the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, stating that the work of the group should be limited to "the revision of the articles of the current constitution", and called for a warning against any interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to this logic, Mr. Trump would be re-elected in 2020, except that, as many liberal television viewers are likely to expect, the resignation and scandal lead him to leave his presidency early.
What would certainly be "The most spectacular end of a presidency!"
At that time, the public showed no signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, scores at peak hours have more than doubled, reaching 1.05 million on CNN, and have virtually tripled, amounting to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at large listening hours, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and the MSNBC's Rachel Maddow Show, which reaches 3.5 million viewers during large evenings, is the first cable television channel.
"It's a matter that attracts people because it's not something we understand," said Neal Baer, presenter of the drama series of the ABC "Designed Survivor" who speaks of a minister who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
In Scovell, a coroned comic author and author of "Just the Funny Parts : And some irrefutable truths about how to slide into the Hollywood Boys' Club," he has another theory for his part.
She remembers taking a taxi in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told him he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? She asked him.
"He said, 'Because he makes me laugh,'" said Mrs. Scovell.
Chaos has a funny value.
Obviously, contrary to what is happening on television, Washington's scenarios could determine the future of the Roe v. Wade case, whether immigrant families can meet together and the health of the world economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the most fortunate viewers can afford.
And yet, it goes beyond being an informed citizen when we meet for six hours a panel of experts discussing how Bob Woodward served as a "deep know-how" for his book "Fear" on the Austrian leather jacket at $15,000 from Paul Manafort ("a clothing full of pride" according to Washington Post) and the consequences of the extravagant descriptions that Stormy Daniels delivered from, uh, Mr. Trump's anatomy.
On my side, I'll never see Super Mario the same way again.
"If a part of what he does seems to be seeing a television reality, it's because he makes you drop something every night," said Brent Montgomery, Director General of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", about changing teams and Trump's daily situation returns ( if you fight with the NFL, congratulate Kim Jong-un).
We can't afford to miss an episode unless we're on the train.
When I contacted Mr. Fleiss this week, he was 26 degrees at his home on the northern coast of Kauai, but he was on the inside to watch MSNBC while recording CNN.
He could not stand out, not with Brett Kavanaugh, who was preparing to face the Senate's judicial committee and the future of the Supreme Court at stake.
"I remember the time when we were animation all these crazy emissions and people were saying, "This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a kind of joke, but it turns out they were right."

The money from the outside invades the most closed elections of the half-mandate.
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th district is flooded with money, thanks to a re-adjustment of Congress's districts, which allowed two holders to argue in the same seat.
This district of Pittsburgh, which has recently been restructured, is the seat of Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who desecrated its seat in another district during special elections last spring.
Lamb is measured to another holder, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the former 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is heavily riding the new 17th district.
The cards were redesigned when the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled in January that the former roundabouts were unconstitutionally manipulated in favour of the Republicans.
The course of the new 17th district gave the opportunity to launch a confrontation with regard to the financing of electoral campaigns between the major financing sectors of the parties, the Democratic Campaign Congress Committee (CCCD) and the National Republic Campaign Committee (CNCR).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a victory of justice last March at a very popular special election in the 18th Congress of Pennsylvania .
This seat was held by a Republican for over a decade and President Donald Trump won the victory in the district by 20 points.
Politologists have given a slight advantage to the Democrats.
The United States planned to penalize Salvador for its support for China, and then withdrew
The diplomats found that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, which Washington did not oppose.
Mr. Trump had a friendly meeting with the Panamanian president Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until partners expelled the leadership of the Trump organization.
Representatives of the Department of State decided to convene the heads of US diplomatic missions in Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama to protest against "their recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan," said Heather Nauert, the department's spokesman, at the beginning of the month in a communiqué.
However, sanctions were only provided against Salvador, who received US aid estimated at $140 million in 2017, in particular to control drugs and provide development and economic support.
The penalties envisaged, which included reductions in financial assistance and visa restrictions, would have been painful for the country of Central America and its high rates of unemployment and homicide.
While the internal meetings continued, representatives of North America and Central America delayed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity to follow up on a similar meeting that took place last year, which was perceived as progress in efforts to prevent immigrants from moving to the United States.
But in mid-September, the senior officials of the administration clearly indicated that they wanted the conference to continue, thus ending any consideration of sanctions against Salvador.
The Vice-President, Mike Pence, now eight, expressed himself at the conference scheduled for mid-October, in order to demonstrate the importance that the administration attaches to the meeting, informed the diplomats.
And the three U.S. broadcasters returned quietly to Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without any new severe messages or punishments on the part of Washington.
A spokesperson from Mr. Bolton to the White House refused to comment on the details of the debate described by the three American dignitaries, two of whom diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal discussions under the cover of the anonymous.
Their speech was corroborated by an independent analyst near the administration, who also remained anonymous.
Study history
The next pillar could be the report of Special Counsel Robert Mueller on the possible impediment to Mr. Trump's justice. The public record is now based on substantial evidence.
Mr. Mueller would also direct his investigation into the issue of a convenient of Mr. Trump's campaign with Russia in his attack on our elections.
If Congress' control changes hand, Mr. Trump will find himself in the obligation to report to this body, at a time when he learns to represent himself before the electors and perhaps a jury composed of his peers.
There are many 'yes' there, and I do not claim Mr Trump's fall to be inevitable - nor that of his counterparts in Europe.
We all have decisions to take on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the potential duration of this struggle.
In 1938, German officers were about to organize a coup against Hitler, if only the West had held him head and left the Czechoslovakians in Munich.
We failed, and we missed an opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
The course of history revolves around these cleavages and the inevitable march of democracy accelerates or is delayed.
The Americans are currently faced with a number of these earthquakes.
What will we do if Mr. Trump refers the assistant to Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of the investigation conducted by Mr. Mueller?
Rosenstein has been in a delicate situation since this newspaper reported that, last year, he proposed to register the president in secret and issued assumptions about his inability to perform his duties.
Mr. Rosenstein said that the report of the Times was incorrect.
"What will we answer if the investigation recently requested by the FBI on Brett Kavanaugh is not exhaustive or impartial - or whether it is committed to the Supreme Court in spite of allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, are we going to vote in the mid-term elections for a Congress asking for Mr. Trump's accounts?
If we do not succeed in these trials, democracy will go through a long winter.
But I am convinced that we will not fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew deported to Auschwitz under the Nazi regime, who in the past occupied my embassy residence.
She survived, immigrated to America, and, sixty years later, sent me to light candles on the table of swastika.
With this heritage as an inheritance, I cannot be optimistic about our future."

Graham Dorrans des Rangers, trusting the Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will receive the Rapid Vienna on Thursday, while knowing that the victory against the Austrians, following the impressive zero match in Spain against Villarreal at the beginning of the month, will place them in a strong position to qualify for Group G in the League of Europe.
A knee injury has deprived Graham Dorrans of his first participation in the season until the match zero 2:2 against Villarreal, but he is convinced that the Rangers are able to draw the best of such a result to achieve exploits.
"It was a positive point for us, because Villarreal is a quality team," the 31-year-old attacker commented.
"We got into the game thinking we're getting something and we're dealing with it with a point.
We might have been able to take it to the end, but, overall, a match was probably a fair result.
They were probably better at the first half and we came back in the second half and we were the best team.
Thursday, this is another important European evening.
With a little chance, we can hope to get three points, but this will be a difficult match because they did a good result during their last match, but I'm sure we can continue and get a positive result with the crowd behind us.
Last year it was really difficult, between my injuries and the changes to the club as such, but there is a satisfaction factor about this place now.
The team is good and the guys are very good; training is good.
Let us hope to go ahead now, leave the last season behind us and triumph."
Women no longer find sleep because of this fear of their retirement
Even though participants in this survey knew clearly how they wanted to be cared for, few people raised the issue with their families.
Nearly half of those who participated in the national study said that they were talking to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 per cent said that they had spoken to their children.
"People want a member of their family to take care of them, but they don't do what they need to have this conversation," explained Holly Snyder, vice-president of the National Life Insurance Branch.
Here's where it starts.
Talk to your spouses and children: You cannot prepare your family to provide you with care if you do not communicate your wishes in advance.
Work with your advisor and your family to determine where and how you can receive care, as these options can be an important factor in determining the cost.
Call your financial advisor: Your advisor is also able to help you establish a way to pay these costs.
Your long-term financing decisions may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with value of purchase to help you cover these expenses or other insurance on your property - provided you have the means to secure it.
Prepare your legal documents: Avoid legal battles on the move.
Provide a health care service that will allow you to appoint a trusted person who will check your medical care and ensure that professionals respect your wishes if you are not able to communicate.
Consider also an inquiry into your financial resources.
You will choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions for you and ensure payment of your bills if you are incapacitated.
Think about the details: Suppose your elderly parent has a medical emergency and he goes to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
List these details in a written document to be well prepared.

Her injuries didn't threaten her life, and the police called a witness.
Seisms and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that devastated the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, announced the authorities, and the budget should be set aside.
As the communications were paralysed, the relief services were unable to receive any information from the Dongala Regency, a zone located in the north of Palu, which is closer to the epicenter of the magnitude earthquake 7.5.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated as a result of the disaster.
Some essential facts about Palu and Dongala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central province of Sulawesi, located at the point of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, whose population was estimated to be 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami took place.
Dongala is a regency that is over 300 km (180 miles) from the north-west coast of the island of Sulawesi.
The population of the regency, an administrative region below a province, was estimated to be 299 200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main pillars of the economy of the province of central Sulawesi, and especially of the coastal region of Dongala.
The extract of the nickel is also an important activity in the province, but it is mainly located in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Dongala have been affected by tsunamis for several times over a century, according to the Indonesian Agency for Disaster Reduction.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dongala.
A tsunami also struck the west of Dongala in 1996, causing nine deaths.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific Sismic Fire Circle and is regularly driven by seismic earthquakes.
Here are some of the main earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake, which occurred on 26 December on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh, triggered a tsunami that devastated 14 countries, killing 226,000 victims on the coast of the Indian Ocean, of which more than half in Aceh.
2005: Several violent earthquakes swept the west coast of Sumatra in late March at the beginning of April.
Several hundred people died on the island of Nias, along Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake hit south of Java, the most inhabited island of Indonesia, triggering a tsunami that hit the south coast and made nearly 700 victims.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake swept the city of Padang, capital of the province of Sumatra West.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake devastated one of Mentawai islands along Sumatra and triggered a tsunami of more than 10 metres that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A superficial earthquake has driven the regeneration of Pidie Jaya in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, reminding the inhabitants of the devastating earthquake and the deadly tsunami of 2004.
No tsunami has been triggered this time, but more than 100 people have been killed by the collapse of buildings.
2018: Important earthquakes have swept the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mainly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed several thousand buildings and left thousands of temporarily blocked tourists.
The aged son of Sarah Palin arrested for marital violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and candidate for the vice-president Sarah Palin, was arrested for aggression.
Palin, 29-year-old, from Wasilla, Alaska, was questioned for suspected marital violence, contrary to a report of marital violence and arrest resistance, to a communiqué published by Alaska State Troopers on Saturday.
According to the police report, he would have received a phone call from a woman who was trying to call the police to report the alleged crimes.
Palin is placed in temporary detention in the temporary detention centre of Mat-Su and is held under unsecured guarantee of $500, KTUU said.
He appeared before the court on Saturday, declaring himself "not guilty, of course" when his complainant was asked, announced the network.
Palin faces three Class A offences, which means that he could be sentenced to imprisonment for up to a year and is liable to a fine of $250,000.
He was also accused of having committed a minor class B offence, punishing a day of imprisonment and a fine of $2 000.
This is not the first time criminal charges are brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, contacted the police to report this alleged aggression.
The case is being brought before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of marital violence, interference in the report of a marital violence crime and possession of a weapon in relation to the incident.
His company had claimed he had hit him on the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after linking the violent behavior of her son with the PTSD from her service in Iraq.
Seism in Indonesia: several hundred deaths
At least 384 people died following the earthquake that devastated the Indonesian island of Sulawesi last Friday.
Magnitude 7.5 earthquake caused a tsunami and devastated thousands of houses.
The electricity and telecommunications networks are on board and the victim's balance should be updated in the coming days.
The earthquake was declared just outside the centre of Sulawesi, north-east of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos broadcast on social media show the impact point.
Several hundred people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami broke out on the coast.
Federal prosecutors claim a rare death penalty for a suspect of terrorist assassination in New York
The federal prosecutors of New York are asking for the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the alleged attacker of New York who has committed eight victims - a rare penalty that has not been applied in that State for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, aged 30, would be used by a truck hired at Home Depot to attack a cyclable track on the West Side Highway, in Lower Manhattan, on its pedestrian road and a cyclist last October.
In order to justify a death sentence, prosecutors will have to provide evidence that Saipov "intendedly" murdered the eight victims and "intendedly" inflicted serious bodily harm, according to the statement of intent to apply for the capital punishment filed with the South District of New York.
These two charges are likely to constitute the death penalty, according to the legal document.
A few weeks after this aggression, a large federal court sentenced Saipov to 22 prosecution heads, eight of whom were charged with murder for extermination of funds, usually used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases and one for crimes of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "a minute preparation and premedication", the prosecutors said, qualifying the method used by Saipov as "a cruel and derogatory."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," states the intent statement.
Five victims were Argentine tourists.
The South New York District did not claim the death penalty in the context of prosecutions for ten years.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug traffickers, but was subsequently sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was applied in a New York federal case, it was in 1953 in the case concerning Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed to be delivered to acts of conspiracy and espionage for the USSR during the two years following the cold war.
Both Rosenberg were executed by electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Saipov, originating in Uzbekistan, demonstrated a lack of remorse in the days and months that followed the tragedy, according to the courtrooms.
According to the police, he told the investigators that he was pleased with his actions.
Saipov told the authorities that he had been urged to commit the murder after watching Daesh videos on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also requested that Daesh's flag be displayed in his hospital room, which was specified by the police.
He complained not guilty to the 22 chiefs of charge.
David Patton, one of Saipov's federal public defenders, declared to be "evidently disappointed" of the decision to try to prosecute.
"We believe that the decision to apply for the death penalty rather than to accept his plea of guilt and to condemn him to life imprisonment without the possibility of release can only prolong the trauma related to these events for all concerned," Patton said.
The Saipov defence team had already asked prosecutors not to claim the death penalty.
A Conservative Member states that NIGEL FARAGE should be responsible for the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage today promised to "mobilize the popular army" during a demonstration at the conservative conference.
The former Party for Independence of the United Kingdom indicated that politicians should " feel the pressure" of Eurosceptics - as one of Theresa May's Members suggested, it should be responsible for negotiating with the EU.
The Conservative back-up MP Peter Bone said at Birmingham's march that the United Kingdom "would have already been released" if Mr. Farage had been secretary in Brexit.
But the dilemma that Mrs May is facing to reconcile her deeply divided troops was emphasized by the conservatives in favour of the idea of staying in the Union that joined an isolated demonstration against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister has the wrong to maintain his Chequers compromise plan despite the threats of those who want to leave and those who want to stay as well as the EU.
The Allies stressed that it would continue its efforts to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the hostilities - and would force Eurosceptics and workers to choose between its programme and chaos.
Mr. Bone pointed out to the Left Middle Leave Assembly in Solihull that he wanted to "get rid of Chequers".
He felt that Mr. Farage should have become a partner and that he was entrusted with the task of negotiating with Brussels.
"If he had been in charge, we would have already been out," he said.
The Commissioner of Wellingborough added: "I will defend Brexit, but we must get rid of Chequers."
Expressing his opposition to the EU, he continued: "We have not been delivered to world wars to submit us.
We want to make our own laws in our own country. ”
Mr. Bone rejected the suggestions that public opinion has evolved since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people have turned the page and want to remain is completely false."
The conservative Andrea Jenkyns, who was in favour of the exit, was also present at the march to tell reporters: "I just say: Madam Prime Minister, listen to people.
Cheques is not appreciated by the general public, the opposition will not vote for, it is also the case of our party and our militants who silence the streets and make us elected first and foremost.
Leave Chequers and start listening."
In a message addressed to Ms. May, she added: Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they honor their promises.
"Mr. Farage indicated to the assembly that politicians should be brought to " feel pressure" if they were on the point of betraying the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a question of trust between us - the people - and our political class," he said.
They're trying to fool Brexit, and we're telling them today, "We're not going to let you out like this."
He added in a message addressed to the enthusiastic crowd: "I want you to feel the pressure on our political class that is about to betray Brexit.
We mobilize the popular army of this country that has enabled us to win the Brexit and we will not stop until we become an independent, autonomous and proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, pro-European fans walked through Birmingham before organizing a two-hour rally in the city center.
A small number of militants were branding conservative banners against Brexit after the group was launched this weekend.
His workman counterpart, Lord Adonis, drowned conservatives because of the security issues related to the party's implementation at the beginning of the conference.
"These are the ones that assure us that they are able to put in place computer systems and all technology for Canada, more, for the free-trade border without friction, for free-trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
"It's a real farce.
A good Brexit, it doesn't exist," he added.
Warren intends to consider seriously the possibility of presenting himself to the presidential elections
On Saturday, Senator Elizabeth Warren said that she would seriously consider presenting herself to the presidential elections after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat discussed his future on Saturday at a public assembly in the west of Massachusetts.
Warren, a often critical voice with regard to President Donald Trump, is presented for the November re-election against Geoff Diehl, a representative of the GOP in the States, who was co-chaired in 2016 for the Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
It was located in the center of speculation that could deal with Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was its 36th meeting with the electors at a public assembly since Trump took office.
A participant asked if she intended to be present at the presidency.
Warren replied that the moment had come "for women to go to Washington to repair our broken government, which means having a woman at the head of the state."
Arrested at the death of Sims at the University of Louisiana State
On Saturday, Baton Rouge's police in Louisiana announced that a suspect had been arrested in connection with the death by the basketball player Wade Sims, a basketball player in the LSU on Friday.
Baton Rouge's police service participated in the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20 years old, at 11.00 H.E. Press conference.
Friday, they posted a video of the shooting, asking for help to identify a man who was on the images.
Sims, 20 years old, was killed by a ball Friday morning, near the campus at the Southern University.
“Wayde Sims received a head-to-head injury and suffered his injuries,” police chief Murphy J. Paul said to the media on Saturday at 247 sports.

Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton headed for the world title after the team's guidelines enabled him to win the victory against Sebastian Vettel
It became clear quickly as Valteri Bottas qualified to win Lewis Hamilton last Saturday that the instructions of the Mercedes team would play an important role in the competition.
From the pole position, Bottas took a good start and broke Hamilton on the flank while he defended his position in the first two rounds, and invited Vettel to attack his team partner.
Vettel entered the stands first and left Hamilton to throw himself into the tower at the platoon's tail, which should have been a decisive element.
Mercedes passed through the stands a later tour and found himself behind Vettel, but Hamilton took the advantage after a wheeling action that saw Ferrari's driver leave the inner part at a risk of resisting a double defence attempt in the third round.
Max Verstappen was part of the last line of the grid and was seventh at the end of the first round to celebrate his 21 years.
He then dominated a large part of the race, but now his tires to aim for a speedy arrival and advance Kimi Raikkonen to fourth place.
He finally arrived in the stands at the 44th round, but was not able to accelerate the rhythm in the remaining eight rounds, Raikkonen being the fourth.
It's a difficult day because Valteri did a tremendous job all weekend and was a real gentleman who let me pass.
The team did an exceptional job to get one," Hamilton said.
It was a very bad body language.
At a meeting on Saturday last Saturday, President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein, who stressed that she had not disclosed Christine Blasey Ford's letter that accused the candidate to the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the President did not directly address Ford's testimony before the Senate's judicial commission, but he argued that the events that took place in the Senate would show that people were "bad, disgusting and dishonest".
"The only thing that could happen and the beautiful thing that is happening in the Senate these last days, when we see anger, when we see people who are angry and wicked and disgusting and dishonest," he said.
"When they see the disclosures and leaks, they say, "Oh, I didn't.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Diane Feinstein, did you disclose any information?
Remember his answer... you revealed information - "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't reveal anything."
Well, wait a minute.
We have disclosed information... no, we have not disclosed information," he added, thinking about the senator's impression.
Feinstein received a letter from Ford last July detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh, and the disclosure took place early in September, but Feinstein refused to leave his office.
"I didn't dissipate Dr Ford's allegations, I didn't disclose his story," Feinstein told the committee, told The Hill.
"She told me to keep this confidential and I kept it confidential as she asked."
But his denial does not seem to be well received by the president, who commented on Saturday night at the assembly: "I'm going to tell you, it was a very bad body language.
Maybe she didn't do it, but it's the worst body language I've ever seen."
Following his defense of the candidate to the Supreme Court, accused of sexual assault by three women, the President made it clear that the Democrats used these allegations for their own purposes.
"They are determined to regain power by all means.
You see the wickedness, the misery, they get to know who they hurt, who they need to crush in order to get power and control," said the president in Mediaite.
Elite League : Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars have eliminated their defeat on Friday in Elite League against the giants of Belfast by decoding the game back 5-3 in Dundee, last Saturday.
The Giants opened the score with two goals of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie have brought home equality before Dwyer returns the advantage to the Giants.
François Bouchard equaled Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen entered two goals, ensuring their victory.
This was the third defeat of the season in Elite League for the players of Adam Keefe, who had fought Dundee 2-1 Friday night in Belfast after being arrested.
It was the fourth confrontation of the season between the two camps, the Giants having triumphed in the last three matches.
Dwyer gave the advantage to the fourth minute, at 3:35, thanks to a pass by Kendall McFaul, while David Rutherford served Beauvillier who doubled the launch four minutes later.
During the first well-charged period, Sullivan resumed the local team at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt went to Cownie's service at 15:16 with an equalization.
Dwyer ensured the advance of the Giants before the first break when he hit his second goal of the evening by the end of the first period.
The local team met and Bouchard once again equaled with a goal giving a digital advantage at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran worked to help Nielsen place Dundee in the head for the first time in the match at the end of the second period, thus ensuring the victory of his team by marking a fifth goal in the mid-term.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five matches, will welcome Milton Keynes during their next game Friday.
An air traffic controller was killed with the help of hundreds of people on board an aircraft to escape the earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller is hailed as a hero after his death by ensuring that an aircraft carrying hundreds of people can safely take off.
More than 800 people are dead and many others are missing after a major earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday last, causing a tsunami.
Strong replicas continue to destroy the region and a large number of people are trapped under the demise in the city of Palu.
But despite the flight of his colleagues, 21-year-old Anthony Gunavan Agung refused to give up his post in the violent drive to Mutiara Sis Al Jufri from Palu Airport.
It remained in place to ensure that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the track at that time, could safely be removed.
He then jumped out of the control tower when he felt it would collapse.
He died at the hospital later.
Yohannes Sirat, the spokesperson for Air Navigation Indonesia, said that this action could have saved hundreds of lives, according to the Australian news ABC.
We mobilized a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to transport it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost it this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
"Our heart is broken to learn this," he added.
The authorities are concerned that the number of deaths can reach thousands, the disaster prevention agency in the country indicating that access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The balance sheet would continue to fade because many bodies were still under the decobras and a large number could not be helped," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson of the agency.
Waves measuring up to six meters have ravaged Palu, which will celebrate a mass burial on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft provide assistance and food.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute, an ambulance brings bodies back.
Clean water is rare.
The mini-markets are pillaged everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, responsible for the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is short to help survivors, but we do not know what they will find.
This is already a tragedy, but it could be an empirical one."
Joko Widodo, the Indonesian President, arrived at Palu on Sunday and addressed the country's soldiers: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" said CNN.
Indonesia was killed earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Aviation accident in Micronesia: Air Niugini now states that a man has disappeared after the crash of a plane in the lagoon.
The airline managing the flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now claims that a man has been taken missing, after 47 passengers and crew members safely evacuated the flying plane.
Air Niugini stated in a communiqué that since Saturday afternoon, she was unable to find the trace of a male passenger.
The airline indicated that it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to locate the man in question.
The airline did not respond immediately to more specific requests for information regarding the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local vessels participated in the rescue of the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water trying to land at the airport of Chuuk Island.
The authorities stated on Friday that seven persons had been hospitalized.
The airline claimed on Saturday that six passengers were still at the hospital, and that they were all in stable condition.
The cause of the crash and the exact course of events remain uncertain.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane had landed in the lagoon near the landing track.
Witnesses thought the plane had crossed the track.
American passenger Bill Jaynes indicated that the plane was too low.
"It's a very good thing," says Jaynes.
Jaynes stated that he and the others had been able to slide into the water until the rescue of the plane was running.
he claimed that the officers had panicked and screamed, and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Marine stated that marines working nearby for the improvement of a quay also participated in the rescue using a pneumatic boat to transport people on the hard land before the plane sinks in about 30 metres (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Air Safety Network indicate that 111 people have died in accidents of air companies registered in Papua New Guinea in the last two decades, but none of them concerned Air Niugini.
The analyst presents the chronology of the night the woman was burned alive
The prosecution updated its case on Saturday during the trial of a man accused of burning a woman living in Mississippi in 2014.
The analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert in the field of information analysis.
He described to the jury how he used records of phone calls from a laptop to trace the movements of the 29-year-old accused, Quinton Tellis, and of the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night the latter died.
Rowlett pointed out that he had obtained location data from several mobile phones that indicated that Tellis was with Chambers on the night of his death, which contradicted his previous statements, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was at Chambers while he had pretended to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to Sanford.
Sanford compared it to the Saturday bar and testified he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis had told the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford replied that he was "because my truck was in Nashville".
Another inconsistency is that Tellis said that he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Phone records show that they've known each other for a week.
Rowlett claimed that some time after the death of Chambers, Tellis removed the SMS, calls and coordinates of Chambers from his phone.
"He took it away from his life," said Hale.
The defense must begin its protests on Sunday.
The judge stated that he expected the trial to be held before the court in the course of the day.
The High Breed: What is the hip political hop?
A trio hip hop wants to deduce the negative vision of the genre by impregnating its music of positive messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims that the hip hop has distanced itself from its origins of political messages and social problems.
The group wants to renew with its roots and make the hip political hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Commons have experienced a recent resurrection in the United Kingdom through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another Black? !
A New York bride pursues a couple in court for having licensed her after a "racist" text
A New York newscast continues a couple in court for discriminatory dismissal after having received a wrong message sent by the mother who complained that she was "one more black".
The couple refuse to be racist, and assimilates the persecution to an "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed her condolences by finding in 2016 that Giselle Maurice, the new noun, was Black at her arrival for her first day of work.
“NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON ENCORE ONE NOIRE”, wrote Ms. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text.
However, instead of sending her to her husband, she sent her to Maurice twice.
According to the New York Post, after understanding her pocket, "bad at ease", Plasco-Flaxman referred to Ms. Maurice, explaining that their former noun, who was African-American, had done a bad job and that she was waiting for a Philippines.
Ms. Maurice was paid for a working day, then returned to her by a Uber.
Now, Maurice continues the couple in court in order to obtain compensation for her resignation and claims a $350 per day allowance for the six-month household service for which she was initially hired but without contract.
"I want to make them understand, listen, we don't do this kind of thing," she explained at the Post Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple complained to the allegations of racism by saying that it was reasonable to put an end to Maurice's employment, fearing that he would not be able to trust her after she was wronged.
"My wife had sent her something she didn't want to say.
She's not racist.
We are not racists," Joel Plasco said at the Post.
"But do you trust your children to a person with whom you have been implicated, even if it was wrong?
Your new-born?
Let’s see! ”
Assembling the trial to an "extortion", Plasco said that his wife was only two months old when she had a baby and was in a "very delicate situation".
"Would you pursue someone like that?
This is not a very pleasant thing to do," the business banker added.
While the file is still under way, the public opinion court has not hesitated to denounce the couple on social media, slandering them for their behaviour and logic.
The editors of Paddington were afraid that readers would not identify themselves to a sound that spoke, revealing a new letter
Karen Jankel, Bond's daughter, born shortly after the book was accepted, said about this letter: "It's hard to put someone in place for the first time before her publication.
It's very funny, knowing what we know about the enormous success of Paddington."
She stated that her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before writing the book for children inspired by a small bear in battle, would remain optimistic in the face of his rejection of his work. She added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books had a "feel-amar" taste after his death last year.
She describes Paddington as a “very important member of our family” and adds that her father was very proud of her final success.
"He was a pretty calm man, and he wasn't a pretender," she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child who succeeded in something: we are proud of him, even though it is not really his own achievement.
I think he saw Paddington's success this way.
Although it is his creation and the fruit of his imagination, he has always attributed the merit to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
On the landing, his daughter had been taken by emergency to the hospital Louis Pasteur 2 of Nice, where doctors tried to save his life.
"Nad called regularly to explain to us how bad the situation was, we did not expect it to happen," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperous.
"Then Nad called me to warn me that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I should tell her goodbye.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, baby.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications the doctors had administered to maintain heart rate were slowly evaporating and getting out of his system.
She was dead a while ago and everything stopped.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing that all of this was happening.
I couldn't talk or cry or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to hold on to it."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperous, in mourning for her daughter, rode on the plane with the other passengers, without worrying about the test she was going through.
"No one was aware," she said.
"I had my head down, and I cried all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it's during the flight that I've experienced this great sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved him."
Women in mourning place postcards to prevent suicides on the bridges.
Two women who have lost loved ones by suicide try to prevent others from living away.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have displayed, on a galloon bridge, postcards containing inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for help.
Ms. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at age 18.
"I don't want any parents to feel what I'm forced to feel every day," she said.
Ms. Davis, aged 45 and living in Lydney, said that her son was a promising leader with a contagious smile.
“ Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said that his smile lit any room."
However, he left his job before he died, since he was “in a very dark place.”
In 2014, he was Tyler's brother, then 11 years old, who found his brother after he had committed suicide.
Ms. Davis said, "I am constantly afraid that there is an effect of training."
Ms. Davis created the cards "to let people know that there are people you can go see and to whom you can talk, even if it's a friend.
Don’t be silent - you have to talk. ”
Ms. Humphreys, a long-term friend of Ms. Davis, lost Mark, his partner for 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
"He did not say that he was being beaten, depressed or otherwise," she said.
"A few days before Christmas, we found his attitude change.
He was at the bottom of Christmas - when the children opened their presents, he had no visual contact with them or anything."
She pointed out that her death had represented an enormous trauma for them, but they had to leave: "It's disgusting for the family.
It destroys us.
But we must all go ahead and fight."

The future of Brett Kavanaugh is under way as the FBI begins its investigation.
"I thought that if we could get something like what he was asking - a limited investigation in time, limited in its scope - we might be able to bring some unity," said Mr. Flake Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee would not "fall" into a partial impasse.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republicans not want the FBI to investigate?
Their reticence is due to the choice of the moment.
The mid-term elections will take place only in five weeks, that is, on 6 November. If, as planned, the Republicans make a bad score, they will be seriously weakened in their attempts to elect the man they want to be at the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush called the senators and asked them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and met his wife Ashley, who was then his personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI presents its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
We do not yet know whether Mr. Kavanaugh will be able to obtain at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would enable Mike Pence, the vice-president, to leave the vote and confirm it before the Supreme Court.
North Korea: the number of "fall" deserters under Kim's direction
The number of North Korean deserters to South Korea has decreased since the accession to the power of Kim Jong-un, seven years ago, said a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, quoting data from the Department of Southern Unity, said that 1,127 desertions had taken place last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that strengthening border controls between North Korea and China and increasing passenger charges were key factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
The vast majority of North deserters will eventually be granted South Korean nationality.
Seoul claims that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most of them fled through China, which shares the longest border with North Korea and is easier to break than the highly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ), located between the two Koreas.
China views deserters as clandestine migrants rather than refugees and often raptures.
The relationship between the North and the South - which are technically still in war - has improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang in the framework of negotiations on denuclearization that had remained pending.
This took place after the historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-one in Singapore, during which they agreed to work for a denuclearized Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, the North Korean Minister for Foreign Affairs, Ri Yong-ho, charged US sanctions with the lack of progress ever since.
"In the absence of confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, under such circumstances, it is excluded that we are the first to operate unilateral disarmament," said Mr. Ri in a speech delivered before the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and claims that he is unworthy to sit at the Supreme Court
Pelosi, leader of the parliamentary minority, qualified the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh as "hysterical" and stated that he was unworthy to sit at the Supreme Court because of his temper.
Pelosi made these comments during an interview with Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas on Saturday.
I could not help but think that if a woman had acted in this way, they would have treated her as "hysterical," Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate committee of the judiciary last Thursday.
Kavanaugh was excited about the allegations that he would have sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, and sometimes he hesitated to scream and sneeze at his family and his years of high school.
In addition, he explicitly condemned the democratics sitting in the committee, qualifying the allegations of "gross murder and coordinated" organized by the liberals disappointed that Hillary Clinton had lost presidential elections in 2016.
Pelosi stated that according to it, Kavanaugh's testimony would show that he was unworthy to sit at the Supreme Court, since he showed that he was against the Democrats.
"I think he disagrees with these statements and how they were taken by Clinton and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi hesitated when he was asked whether she would try to replace Kavanaugh if it had been confirmed, and whether the Democrats obtained the majority in the House of Representatives.
"If he does not tell the truth in Congress or the FBI, he is not only unworthy to sit in the Supreme Court, but he is also unworthy to sit in the court where he is currently in the court," Pelosi said.
Currently, Kavanaugh is a judge of the DC Circuit Appeal Court.
Pelosi added that as a democrat, she was concerned about any decisions of Kavanaugh against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, since it is considered a conservative judge.
During his discharge confirmation hearings, Mr. Kavanaugh chose the question of the possible reversal of certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"It is not the time for a hysterical and partial person to go to court and wait for what we say: 'it is not wonderful'," Pelosi said.
And women should use it.
It is a legitimate diet, months and years of anger, and it can't get it out without crying.
"We cry when we fail," said Mrs. Steinem 45 years later.
"I don't think it's rare, and you?"
"I was greatly helped by a woman who was in the frame of some part, who told me that she would also cry when she was angry, but she developed a technique that allowed her to tell the person she was talking to, when she was angry and crying: "You can think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then she went on.
And I found it brilliant."
The tears are allowed as an excrement to anger, in part because they are basically misunderstood.
One of my most remarkable memories of a first job, in an office dominated by men, where I had one day found myself crying out of an inexplicable rage, was to have been caught by the skin of the neck by an old woman - a cold director who always had a bit of terror - who led me in a ladder.
"Don't let them see you cry in any way," she told me.
“ They don’t know that you’re angry.
They believe you are sad and they are rabid because they have had you."
Patricia Schroeder, then Democratic Member of Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential election.
In 1987, while Mr. Hart had been involved in an extra-conjugal case on board a boat called Monkey Business and had withdrawn from the campaign, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, said that there was no reason for her not to explore the idea of presenting herself to the presidency.
"It wasn't a very thoughty decision," she told me by laughing, 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in high school, and the last thing they missed was an extra person.
Someone called it "Blanche-Neige and the Seven Nains"".
As the campaign was very advanced, it had delayed the collection of funds, and therefore swore that it would not participate unless it had collected $2 million.
The battle was lost in advance.
She learned that some of her supporters who normally gave $1,000 to men had only $250.
"Do they believe I have the right to a rabbi?" she asked.
When she announced in her speech that she would not launch an official campaign, she was so upset by her emotions - the gratitude for the people who supported her, the frustration in the system that made it so difficult to collect funds and target voters rather than delegates, and the anger against sexism - that she felt it strange.
"You would have believed that I had a nervous depression," recalled Mrs. Schroeder about the reaction of the press to her.
“You would have believed that Kleinex was my sponsor.
I remember being asked what they were going to put on my tombstone.
"She'd cry?"
How trade between the United States and China could benefit from Beijing
The first escapes from the trade war between the United States and China were overwhelming, and although the battle was far from over, a dispute between the countries could benefit Beijing in the long term, according to experts.
US President Donald Trump launched the first warning earlier this year by taxing key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most important increase occurred this week with new customs duties affecting items worth $200 billion (150 billion sterling books), thus taxing half of all goods coming from China to the United States.
Every time, Beijing has resorted in nature, striking all recent customs duties from 5 to 10 per cent of US$60 billion.
China has committed itself to equalizing the United States, and it is unlikely that the second largest world economy will fail.
Making Washington back, it is to surrender to the demands, but to surrender publicly to the United States would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, China's president.
However, experts believe that if Beijing can play its role correctly, the pressures of the US trade war could have a positive effect on China in the long term by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can introduce conditions conducive to economic slowdown in one country or another is in fact much more dangerous than the observers had previously recognized," said Abigail Grace, a research partner focusing on Asia, to the Center for New American Security reflective group.
Syria is "prepared" for the return of refugees, according to the Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria is committed to the voluntary return of refugees and is seeking help to rebuild this country devastated by a war that has lasted for more than seven years.
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Walid al-Moualem, said that the situation in the country would improve.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safer because of the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The Government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normality.
All conditions are now being met for the voluntary repatriation of refugees in the country that they have been forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations believes that more than 5.5 million Syrians have devastated the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem stated that the Syrian regime would favour the reconstruction of that devastated country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept any conditional assistance or assistance from the countries in charge of the insurrection.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the Ryder Cup 2018 by beating the US team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 in the National Golf near Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six times on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the title when the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn team broke down the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who was in trouble during the major part of the tournament, drowned his starting point in the water at the 16th hole in per-3, leaving his duel in Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari has been excellent in all its rounds, becoming one of the four players who have never reached 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament, the first edition of which dates back to 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth has been separated from 5-4 by the least well placed player of the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen, from Denmark.
The world's best golfer, Dustin Johnson, turned 2 and 1 in front of the English Ian Poulter, who could have played his last Ryder Cup.
A veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spanish Sergio Garcia has become the European champion of all time with a total of 25.5 career points.
"In general, I don't cry, but today, it's stronger than me.
It was a moving year.
I'm so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to recover the cut.
What matters is that team, and I am happy to have been able to help it," Garcia was thrilled after the European victory.
He passes the flame to his compatriot John Ram who won the legend of American golf Tiger Woods 2-1 in simple, last Sunday.
"I feel incredible pride, having beaten Tiger Woods, I grew up looking at this guy," Rahm, 23 years old, said.
Woods lost its four matches in France and now holds a record of 13-21-3 careers in Ryder Cup.
A surprising statistics for one of the biggest golfers of all time, which has deciphered 14 major titles, just behind Jack Nicklus.
The U.S. team had a bad weekend to find fairways, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk commented after a depressing performance on his team: "I'm proud of these guys, they're beaten.
This morning, we had a moment when we put pressure on Europe.
We've left.
A hat for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
Its 12 players have all played very well.
We're going to group together, I'm going to work with the American PGA and our Ryder Cup committee, and we're going ahead.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be captain.
We need to move in.
We have been made to surpass."
