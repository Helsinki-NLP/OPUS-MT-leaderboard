What did you buy?
Is there any evidence?

That's exactly how it was.
I'm sorry, the connection's still busy.
What's wrong with you?
What are you supposed to do?

You promised to help me.
He was bare boobs and bos.
I don't know why my head hurts.

In this phase of world history, there is no such thing as an independent press in America. You know that and I know that. There is no one among you who dares to write his honest opinion, and if he writes it, but he would know in advance that it will never appear in the press. I have received my regular pay to keep my honest opinion out of the news for which I work. Many of you are also similarly paid for similar things, and any of you who would be so crazy to write what he thinks would be out on the street, in search of some other work. If I had allowed my right opinion to appear only in one edition of the news for which I work, I would have received a report with 24 hours of work.

So this is how it ends?
What's this?
Turn around.
Just close your eyes.

Do you want to learn something specific?
We're gonna have to go on a bus now.
The girl Pizza and Mr. Kasha walked in the woods.
Anyway, you're wrong.
Rijocos are driving me crazy!
A man has many desires that he doesn't really want to realize, and it would be wrong to assume otherwise. He wants them to remain only desires; they have value only in his imagination; their achievement would be a bitter disappointment to him. Such a desire is also a desire for eternal life. If it was fulfilled, man would become completely sick of endless life, and he would want death.

Are you sure?
Do you have a passport?
My brother's not home.
We're acting impartially.
They've been loving all night.
I can't either.
