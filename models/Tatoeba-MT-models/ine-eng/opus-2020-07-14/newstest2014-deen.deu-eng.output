Good: Even more safety for pedestrians
They do not stand 100 meters apart: On Tuesday, the new B 33-foot walkway was taken into operation at the village park - in view of the older town hall.
Two installations close to each other: intention or citizenship?
This question was clearly answered by Gutach's mayor yesterday.
"The Council's temple was installed at that time because it secured the school path," Eckert explained yesterday.
The Kluser lamp is safe for both bikers and bus guests and the Bergle residents.
The plant officially in operation yesterday is important for the crossing area Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße.
We have the museum, two churches, Kurpark, the bus stop, a doctor and a bank as well as the traffic flow from the residential area ›Grub€.
"In the case of high traffic and pedestrians, there was another light to their safety," said Eckert.
This is also confirmed by Peter Arnold of the Offenburg Landratsamt.
"At B 33, about 12,000 vehicles per day run through the municipality of Gutach, about 10 percent of which carry heavy loads," says Arnold.
Therefore, the construction of another lamp is more than necessary: "Security is just ahead," says Arnold.
A total of four traffic views were carried out, including a circular traffic was considered, however, because of the narrowness of the crossing area Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße.
According to Arnold, in the selection of the lamp masses, it was first of all tested: "The means of an extra for us with very long wooden bearings we have tested whether these vehicles can run from the Sulzbach road to the B 33 without switching the lamp masses".
Arnold explained: "The most modern thing on the market is what is currently in the market.
The installation is equipped with colourful LEDs that are so powerful that the lights of the car drivers are also good to recognize, for example, in the deep sun.
And it is also saving: The older light plants consume about 100 watts, the new one just eight watts.
There are three light systems per vehicle.
Arnold explained the technique of the new plant: it is equipped with two radar sensors.
If the pedestrian pushes the lamp button, the upper radar sensor tests the traffic impact.
If the road is free, immediately green will come for the pedestrian, if not, it will take about 15 seconds.
Another radar sensor checks whether the green phase for the pedestrian can be completed.
"If a group or disabled people go over the street, the green phase is extended, so everyone will come over the road safely," Arnold explained.
Of course, the driver should think here as a partner and observe the road.
This was not the case yesterday: barely showed the lamp for pedestrians green, a top-class vehicle blew through - at bright red.
Josef Winkler has written for more than 30 years the needs of his childhood and youth from the soul.
The catastrophes of his Catholic village childhood - the languagelessness, the attachment to raw violence and stupid sexuality, the anguish and frustration - have often been described by the Kärntner poet.
The bookkeeper is known primarily as prosa author, theatre texts are rare in his work.
Collage of Prosatexts Gerhard Fresacher presents for his performance "Consultation at the Zungspitze", which is now seen in the Garage X at Petersplatz, therefore a collage of prosatexts.
The theatremaker combines, for example, elements from the autobiographically marked novel "The Leibeigene" (1987) with prosams from "Leichnam, his family pays off" (2003).
On the vastly empty stage - important requirement: a sloppy sofa, on which the idea is accumulated and masturbated - the eight-headed ensemble hangs through the text material.
In this case, Director Frasacher seems to have little confidence in the text.
The 70-minute performance covers the template with a full range of line-ups, known from the repository of post-dramatic games.
In particular, the actors come to the bottom with a somewhat questionable scenario of implementation.
They are touched hard, with the head slammed under water, with their falling to the wall.
Enforced in cellophan or mider, they stick to dangerously high pieces by staging, either monologizing loud or lying completely on the stage floor.
However, the text is hardly in this effort.
The best moments have the evening when you sing - the bandwidth ranges from Deep Purple to folk music.
In the end, the transverse performance is a little calm, and Winkler's post-mortem humour shines out.
A blackbox in the car?
US-American road planners are looking for a source of money to repair the falling highway system, and believe to have found the solution in a small black box, which is located in the armature board of every car.
The devices that record every run-in kilometer and report the information to the authorities are the core of a controversial attempt by Washington and the planning offices of the states to revise the obsolete system for financing US streets.
The normally rather boring area of road planning has suddenly triggered an intense debate with colorful alliances.
Liberals have associated themselves with environmental groups and express themselves that the government can use the small boxes to record the dangerous kilometres – and possibly where they were driven – and then use the information for calculating tax returns.
The Tea Party is disappointed.
The U.S. Civilian Law Association (ACLU) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of data protection concerns.
However, while we cannot agree on a course at the Congress, several states are no longer waiting for it.
They are currently examining how they can switch to a system during the next ten years where the driver pays per run miles.
Thousands of drivers have already tested the drivers, some of which are equipped with GPS surveillance.
This is really a must for our country.
"It's nothing we're only going to use," said Hassan Ikhrata, Managing Director of Southern California Assn. of Government, who has been planning a record of the lost miles of all California drivers in the state since 2025.
The way we pay these taxes will change.
The technology is there.
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund, which is financed from the taxes that Americans create on the zipper, is graceful.
But in America, it's not as much thought as before.
Cars consume less gasoline.
The State mineral oil tax of 18.4 cents per gallon (less than 4 Eurocents per litre) has not increased for 20 years.
Politicians do not dare to raise the tax at high prices, even to raise a cent.
"The fuel tax is simply not future," says Lee Munnich, an expert on transport legislation at the University of Minnesota.
Its federal state has recently equipped 500 cars with drivers to test a mill-based payment system.
"This is the long-term most meaningful alternative," he said.
Bureaucrats refer to it as a brokered user fee.
It is not surprising that the idea is found in urban liberals, for example, because the tax had to be used to influence driving behaviour in such a way as to reduce dust and greenhouse gas emissions.
The California Planners focus on the system in the development of strategies to achieve the ambitious, legally anchored objectives of the state of the state for climate change.
However, the Republican Bill Shuster from Pennsylvania, Chairman of the House Transportation Committee, also stated that he saw the most affordable long-term alternatives.
The free marketers of the Reason Foundation are also encouraged by the idea of allowing drivers to pay for the abandoned route.
"This is not a tax that disappears in a black hole," explains Adrian Moore, Vice-President for Reasons.
People pay directly for what they get.
The movement is also supported by two former U.S. transport ministers, who in a 2011 report called on the Congress to move towards e-mail-based accounting.
Last year, the U.S. Senate approved a $90 million expensive pilot project involving 10,000 cars.
However, the majority in the House of Representatives prevented the strike and responded to the concerns of rural delegates who often have to leave many miles on their way to work or to the city.
Several states and major cities do not lose their own fortunes in this direction.
The most engaged is Oregon, which currently employs 5,000 drivers for the country's largest experiment.
These drivers will soon pay the mile charges instead of the mineral oil tax to the state.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City also thinks of such a thing.
Illinois tests it to a limited extent with lkws.
And the I-95 coalition, to which the transport ministers of 17 states belong on the east coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is currently examining how to introduce the change.
The concept is not a universal hit.
In Nevada, where 50 volunteers were recently equipped with the devices, drivers were skeptical of thinking that the government could pursue any of their movements.
"Remembering Big Brother and such things were a big problem," explains Alauddin Khan, head of strategic and results management in Nevada's Ministry of Transport.
The people didn't want it.
When the test occurred, the ACLU of Nevada warned on its website: “It would be relatively easy to turn the drivers into adult monitoring devices.”
There is no need to build a giant, blocked technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used to record data on the daily movements of individuals.
Nevada is one of a number of states that now look at affordable technology, with which the state can capture the traveled kilometres, but not exactly when and where.
In order to, like Khan, the public would also be calmer.
The hunt for this technology has led some authorities to a small startup company called True Mileage in California.
The company did not initially come to help the federal states in taxing car drivers.
Rather, it was its goal to take foot in an emerging market for Kfz insurance, where drivers should pay on the basis of the miles they have taken.
However, the devices tested by them are also interesting for road planners, because they do not work with GPS and provide only limited information that is regularly uploaded by modem.
"People are more willing to participate if their speed and locations are not recorded," said Ryan Morrison, Managing Director of True Mileage.
Some of these public pilots have made a big mistake.
There are significantly cheaper and less intrusive ways to implement this.
In Oregon, the planners are experimenting with giving car drivers a number of options.
You can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or they choose no device at all and instead pay a fee on the basis of the average miles of all residents of the Federal State.
Others hope to be able to sell the concept of a mistrous public by providing the devices with more functions than with less.
In New York City, traffic officials want to develop a taxing device with which parking fees can also be paid, insurance must be paid only for dangerous kilometres and speed data from other vehicles can be collected in real time, thanks to which drivers can avoid a break.
“Auto drivers would be motivated by the added value of the benefits offered by the system to participate,” says a city planning document.
However, some traffic planners wonder if the whole thing about paying per mile is not just a huge takeover.
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the San Francisco Bay area officials, the congress could simply solve the problem of the bankruptcy highway Trust Fund by increasing fuel tax.
An additional single fee or annual fee could be paid to car drivers with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that consume little fuel, so that they also pay a fair share.
"There is no reason for an operation if an aspirin is enough," explains Randy Rentschler, the head of the Commission's legislation and public affairs.
When we do this, hundreds of millions of car drivers take care of their privacy and many other things.
King's Field: Little team beats up
The Voluntary Firefire raped her herbicide sample despite lack of personnel with Bravour.
Only eleven men took part in the exercise.
Commander Hans Kammerer had chosen the estate of Feder in the Burgberger Street in his acceptance.
There should have been a brief conclusion in the sowing process.
Two people were injured by the fire and the development of smoking, one of which was able to send an emergency.
After the first review of the case by Hans Kammerer, two air carriers of the Wehr were prepared to enter the building.
After a short time it was possible to find the first person and lead to freedom.
The second person had to be worn.
This was not so easy, since it was also a close step to overcome.
The building, a workshop with an integrated stable for two horses, was not easy to secure.
There was a lot of wood and also strawballs in it.
There were also electrical machines for wood processing.
The first dissipation took place over the tank in the vehicle.
Another direction took place via an overflow hydrant in about 100 meters away.
Now three solvents could be formed.
A hole in the building was also used.
Hans Kammerer also went to show in the exercise what is to be done with the staff that is not available.
In the event of a serious accident, support will be given to the King's Group of the Day.
The commander was satisfied with the completion of the exercise.
Networking of universities and firms
On his visit to the district of Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald, Landtag President Guido Wolf also announced in Titisee-Neustadt where the workers come from tomorrow.
In the funding centre Hochschwarzwald, he worked with the managers of the vocational schools as well as the circuit board and the chairmen of this important issue.
"Education is an important location factor", stressed Claudia Stehle, director of the Hans-Thoma-Schole, who presented the networked school project Education Centre Hochschwarzwald.
Wolf was impressed by the model projects for training.
Since 2011, there has been a successful cooperation in the forest city between the funding centre, the circuit gymnasium and the vocational school centre.
He also praised family hospitality in the country.
"It is important to have not only the family phase in view, but also because of the demographic change the phase to care for the care of members of the family," Wolf explained.
He also indicated that more and more employees were caring for the care and care of their relatives.
"Without the support of employers, the resulting burden on employees can lead to an end to the employment relationship," Wolf said.
But no one could afford to lose qualified workers, he said.
Another particularly important factor is the networking of universities and businesses.
"Because he who has already learned the advantages of the region during his study, his acquired knowledge and skills are often gained by the regional economy, which contributes to strengthening the region," the President of the country said.
Because only if sufficient training places were offered can the needs of skilled workers be met.
In his opinion, the local advantage of the district is its beneficial location in the south-west of Germany, close to France and Switzerland.
He also experienced the efforts already made to develop public passenger transport from Titise-Neustadt to Freiburg.
"Continue to be hard on yourself and make public transport better," he explained to the address of the local politicians in question.
With music experience a entertaining afternoon
For 15 years now, the Kaul family has invited the dieting seniors to coffee, cakes and then to a Vesper.
Formerly, the older citizens were assessed at the Rastsstätte.
In the meantime, this afternoon will take place in the Pflegeheim St. Josef.
The inhabitants were happy with the delicious cakes and cakes.
Later, there was barley salad.
The usual melodies included Silvia Kimmich-Bantle and her father Karl Kimmich.
The over 100 years old natural stone wall is intended to be restored to the city of Brăunlingen by means of a plan for the rehabilitation of the old schoolyard prior to the renovation.
In the days before the Kilbig, a small corner wall was built in the first work of the restoration of the former schoolyard, to stabilise and static decommission the old natural stone wall with balustrade over a hundred years old.
The next step is to take Alexander Misok from the Brøunling City Building to involve the Landesdenkmalamt in the planning and to create a recovery concept for the old wall.
A cost calculation should then be made by experts who should then be placed on the table to the municipal council for the decision and determination of the further action.
A decision on this is expected to fall already in the coming year.
After the restoration, planting and planting of the old schoolyard within the two sides of the 1912 school built, the necessary walls must be repaired and refurbished in an apparent time.
The historical, hundreds of years old border walls of the old schoolyard to the Church Street are mainly due to water and frost damage, since there is no drainage, necessary healing and has a bookkeeping ahead.
Deep cracks in individual stones are evidence of weather damage, but the wall is not currently in danger.
A more stable wall is a prerequisite for a schoolyard used by students, which is done by the current fastening work.
Originally, the school training was planned even in 2008/2009, but high unplanned expenditures brought a shift.
An important word for the historical school wall construction, which has even been used for film recordings, will be addressed by the Landesdenkmalamt.
If the requirements of this page come from, then the city of Bräunlingen hopes for grants from the thinkers.
The students of the Bräunling primary school, who are now being taught again in a well-furnished old school building with a new aula, can soon use the old schoolyard.
Özdemir wants to receive jazz education in Stuttgart
In the ongoing discussions about the future of the music universities in Baden-Württemberg, Cem Özdemir, the Federal President of the Greens, has now become active.
"I think it's wrong to give up the universal education at the Stuttgart Music School," Özdemir said the "Stuttgart News".
Jazz and classics are part of the jazz site Stuttgart.
As a result, Özdemir, who is considered a favourite in Stuttgart for a direct mandate at the Federal elections on 22 September, is opposed to the Green-Red Government.
On the basis of an expert study, this forces a reorganization of the five music universities in Baden-Württemberg.
Then, among other things, Jazz and Pop from the Stuttgart Music School will be placed at the Mannheim Music School.
US limit: "Super Tunnel" discovered for drug smuggling
At the border between Mexico and the United States, investigators discovered and shut down a "Super Tunnel" for drug smuggling.
As the U.S. customs authorities reported, the more than 500 meters long pipe between Tijuana and San Diego was equipped with electricity, rail lines and a ventilation system.
Three suspects were arrested, eight tons of marijuana and nearly 150 kilograms of cocaine seized.
According to the data, the tunnel has not yet been used.
"These cartels are stupid, if they think they could dig beneath the radar," said U.S. Attorney General of Southern California, Laura Duffy, at a press conference in front of a warehouse in San Diego, where this was discovered at the end of the tunnel.
In turn, Duffy assured: "If you continue to build and try to use such tunnels, we are determined to make this a huge waste of your dirty money."
Both the US authorities and the Mexican security forces are in a long-term fight against drug cartels.
Since 2006, more than 77,000 people have been killed in Mexico in connection with drug crime.
Constructed by Experts
Due to the extensive equipment of the tunnel, the detectors assume that it was designed by architects and engineers and that the construction took about a year.
The rail system was so equipped that electrically operated vehicles could be used there.
On the Mexican side, access is located in a building 80 meters away from the border.
According to the authorities, a leader leads 20 metres into the depth to the actual tunnel entrance.
The tunnel has a cross section of 1.20 meters high and 90 centimeters wide.
It would also have been appropriate to promote illegal immigration towards the United States.
Two of the suspects were arrested in connection with the cocaine found.
The third, a Mexican, was arrested for the assaulted Marihuana.
All three are threatened as the highest penalty of lifelong freedom, as officials said.
Since 2006, eight such tunnels have been discovered, it continued at the press conference in San Diego.
But it was the first time that cocaine was found in such a tunnel construction.
Usually cocaine is mixed in smaller quantities rather than by tunnel.
This shows the "development" of drug gangs whose traditional routes have now been cut off," said Bill Sherman of the DEA drug gang in San Diego.
They would do anything to get to the United States.
No details were given to the prisoners, at least one six Mexicans, it was called.
You have to count on prison sentences for up to ten years.
2014 becomes Geisinger Festival
The anniversary of the city of Geisingen on the occasion of the 1250.
Returning to the first historical reference is increasingly coming closer.
When the year ends in good eight weeks, the anniversary begins.
Geisingen and church-houses were mentioned for the first time in writing.
In churches, a manuscript was produced in which the two places are mentioned.
On March 15th, there was an official opening for the anniversary year, and since Geisingen currently has no hall, this event takes place in the place where the two were first mentioned 1250 years ago, in church houses.
As part of the anniversary, several events are planned both in Geisingen and in church houses.
Church houses will be held in July at a weekend from 18 to 20 July 1250.
Celebrate again.
On Friday with a party, on Saturday and Sunday with a party around the church hall.
Also at this weekend is the church-house church feast.
City Music Director Rudolf Barth wrote a contract composition for the city on the occasion of the anniversary, which is listed on three dates.
On June 21 together with the Sunny Festival of Black Forests, on July 12 in the Arena with Fireworks and on December 13th as the first concert of city music in the new festival hall.
This is completed and entered in the anniversary year, the official date is the last week of September, 27 and 28 September.
On the occasion of Geising City Jubilee, a new chronicle is also issued.
"But it should be not only a chronicle of Geisingen itself, but a printed work on the Geisingen of today, which is also made up of Geisingen, Church-Houses, Leipzig, Aulfingen and Gutmadingen," said Mayor Walter Hengstler.
And also today's celebration celebrates 2014 birthday, 1974 the present space was completed with the communions.
The new chronicle will then be presented at the new festival hall in Geisingen on November 21 or 22.
But 2014 is also another year with many anniversarys.
The Narrenzft Strohglonki will begin on February 8th with a necessary evening on the occasion of its 60-year-old existence, the Harmony Gutmadingen will be 90 years old and on March 29th will have the feast and will then celebrate the district music festival from 1 to 4 May.
The old factory Leipzig will be 40 years old, the Geisinger School has been at the new location for 50 years and will celebrate on 10 May, the music association Polyhymnia Leipzig will be 150 years old and celebrates it in the framework of the Brunswick from 4 to 7 July.
The city of Geisingen was first mentioned in a gift ceremony, owned by the monastery of St. Gallen, in 764.
The work was produced in churches (houses), which was then a courthouse.
Both municipalities are thus mentioned in the same script.
Due to 2014 this 1250-year-old has to celebrate, in addition, the municipal reform remains 40 years.
Council adopts a visa-related system
Whether the "Owned" train crossing should be continually rebuilt to increase traffic security
Yes, the municipal authorities have decided.
Schiltach has to take over EUR 220,000 for this.
The Deutsche Bahn wants to improve the Kinzigtal railway route next year.
In particular, it is intended to increase the safety of rail crossings - regularly it comes to collisions of trains with other vehicles across the country.
If the municipalities agree to the conversion measures, they must participate with a third of the costs, the rest share the railway and the federation.
Schiltachs Stadtbameister Roland Grießhaber explained to the municipality the particulars of the pass "Am Hirschen".
There the city plans to build an expansion at the height of the tunnel munda in the west of the railway tracks.
There could also be larger vehicles, such as those transporting longwood, on opposite traffic without having to block the rails.
Greßholder therefore proposed to construct a necessary support wall so that the city could expand the road at a given time in order to ensure a smooth traffic flow.
This was debated in the municipality debated, as some councils questioned the need for road distribution: Thomas Kipp, in his statement, put the attitude of critics to the point: "Should we take so much money into our hands because of so few vehicles?"
Mayor Thomas Haas objected: The train crossing "Hirschen" is regularly used for long wooden transport.
Even wood from the "Kuhbach" area will be transported partly through this route because the vehicles up to 20 metres long could not use the track at the Haberles bridge because they could not turn to the main road there.
In addition, the route serves as a guide for those vehicles that may not use the tunnel when the main road is blocked, argumented Haas.
It should be noted that Kirchberg and Schlossberg tunnels need to be rebuilt and repaired, as is the case at present in the case of volcanos, it could also be important for a longer period of time for the crossing of the "Herschen" train.
The Council agreed to examine the costs of the alleged distribution of the road.
Notwithstanding this, the construction of the railway crossing was largely agreed with the measure that the necessary support walls would be built so that the city could expand the road direction "Bahnhofstraße" to approximately 5.5 metres, if necessary, for road transport.
On the other hand, the reconstruction of the railway crossing at the Gerberei Trautwein could lead to a completely different problem, which concerns the access to the highly rising "Geroltzhauser road".
The administration had let the refurbishments of the railway from the Breinlinger Engineering Office be examined, as it had doubts whether the planned connection of the Geroltzhaus road was still possible.
The investigation concluded that it was not to be excluded that the trend of the road could lead to longer driving.
In turn, the city is responsible for this.
Thus, the reconstruction could lead to a conflict of liability.
Since both the timber exports and the decoupling worked in the current state of development, it should not be agreed with the construction of the railway crossing, argumented Haas.
The risk of a collision of the train with a vehicle at the crossing is also significantly lower than that of the other train crossings, because there is also the centre of the centre to which a good view is attached.
Even trains from the main train station had to be so far removed that no collision was threatened.
Most of the time, the reconstruction of this railway crossing was refused because the city of Schiltach had to "exhaust" the problem with sitting vehicles, so the councils, as the railways could withdraw from responsibility after the completion of the construction works.
As unproblemous, the board considers the conversions to the railway crossings "Vor Heubach" and "Vor Kuhbach", for which cross-border agreements have already been concluded with the railway.
Esa decides on large space missions: missions for billions
Remote planets, gravitational waves or black holes - experts from European space agencies now have to agree on two major projects that they want to start in the coming years.
30 proposals were selected, five are still in the race.
Far from the world.
More than 1,000 planets in other stars have already found astronomers.
If there are at least some of them alive, nobody knows.
Selection is difficult to find: Search for gravitational waves
Or would you like to explore the origin of the cosmos?
Or do they go after such planets and thus perhaps discover extraterrestrial life?
These questions are just the responsibility of the European Space Agency Esa.
For their program "Cosmic Vision", they are looking for ideas for two large space projects that are crucial for research.
The state for such "L-missions" is approximately one billion euros each.
The start is expected to be 2028 and 2034.
At the beginning of September, the elite of European space research met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions.
30 ideas for the debate, five of which have now come to the closer elections.
Numerous bodies examined the proposals, looking for the researchers.
In the coming days, a final decision will be taken by the Scientific Programme Committee.
A total of four major questions has been selected by the Esa to find answers to the missions of the 2007 "Cosmic Vision" programme.
What are the conditions for the creation of planets and life?
The precise processes of the formation of stars from large gas clouds - and thus also the formation of planets that surround these stars - are still in the verbal darkness.
A large infrared telescope in all could penetrate this darkness.
And if a star has planets, under what circumstances can life arise there?
In order to address this question, in 2017 the space telescope "Cheops" will be launched, with which 500 already known planet systems will be examined in our closer surroundings.
The possibilities are limited, however, Cheops is a small mission with a budget of 150 million euros.
With larger instruments, astronomers could paint similar planets and even analyze the composition of their atmospheres and look for "biomarkers": gases that are considered to be an index of biological activity.
How does the solar system work?
Finally, this question should also clarify the conditions for the creation of life.
An important role is the magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field and its particle radiation with the planet system.
In our solar system, these processes can be examined in an exemplary way.
With the "Solar Orbiter", Esa has already approved a mission of the M-class (therefore the budget is at about half a billion euros) on this issue.
The probe will start in 2017 and observe the surface and activity of the sun.
Of great interest to the researchers are also Jupiter and its moon.
They want to find out what role the giant planet has played in the development of the solar system.
For this, the Esa is the first of the three L-missions of the "Cosmic Vision" program.
The Juice probe (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer) is expected to start its journey in 2022.
Eight years later she reaches Jupiter and is going to explore the atmosphere of the planet as well as the icy moon of Europe, Kallisto and Ganymed.
What are the basic physical laws of the universe?
The worldall offers many possibilities to study material under extreme conditions and to examine whether the laws of nature we know are still valid there.
Perhaps there are also deviations that could lead the physicists to a new theory, under which all known laws of nature are brought together.
How did the universe come to be, and where did it come from?
13.7 billion years ago our cosmos was created by the Urknal.
In addition to the ongoing matter, from the stars, planets and living things like us, there is dark matter, whose gravity holds galaxies and galaxies, and dark energy, through which the expansion of the universe accelerates.
So far, researchers do not know what physical laws were valid in the first seconds of the hurricane, nor why there are dark matter and dark energy.
With "Euclide", the Esa has already approved an M-mission, which is scheduled to start in 2020.
With a special telescope, the probe will examine the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time in the whole sky, thus enabling conclusions to be drawn on the supply of dark matter and dark energy.
Who could make the race?
Of the 30 proposals, only two will remain at the end of the selection procedure.
The best chance of a L-Mission authorization is, in the opinion of many experts, "E-LISA", a demanding concept to prove gravity waves.
Among these are physical changes in the structure of space time, which Albert Einstein predicted almost 100 years ago.
They have not been proved to date.
Elisa could do that, the scientists hope behind the project.
The mission provides one of two or three probes, which is stationed in all.
In contrast to plants on earth, he could also prove gravitational waves created by the urn, thus providing new insights into the origin of the cosmos.
Four further proposals are still competing for the second L-Mission: a large X-ray telescope called "Athena", which is to explore black holes, "Icy Planets", another mission to the outer planets of the solar system, "Prim", a mission to measure the cosmic background radiation, and the "Exoplanet Finder", which is to detect and investigate such planets.
Proposals are already being made for the transport of samples from Mars, for the exploration of moons, Venus and asteroids as well as for solar physics.
Snowden is ready to "cooperate" with Germany in relation to US surveillance
Edward Snowden, the whistleblower of the U.S. Secret Service, has stated that he is willing to travel to Berlin and speak before the German Federal Day if the American National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander do not provide answers about their activities.
The German MP Hans-Christian Ströbele met Snowden on Thursday in Russia, where he received this asylum to discuss the statement in Germany with him.
In a letter from Snowden, presented on Friday by Ströbele to the media in Berlin, she writes: “Even if the result of my efforts has proved positive, my government continues to treat a different opinion as a breach of trust and tries to criminalise political opinion with a threat of criminality where no defence is possible.”
But telling the truth is not a crime.
In the letter, Snowden writes that he is convinced that the support of the international community could convince the American government to drop charges against him.
The charges raised by the U.S. Ministry of Justice include espionage and theft of state property.
German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich said regarding time online: "If Mr. Snowden is willing to speak with German representatives, then we will find ways to do so."
The relationship between the USA and Germany is burdened by the claims that the NSA has stopped the phone from Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Thomas Oppermann, the member of the Parliamentary Committee responsible for the Secret Service, explained that the opportunity should be given to hear Snowden as a witness, if this is possible, "without endangering him and completely ruining relations with the United States".
Ströbele, a Green MP, published a picture of himself and Snowden in his Twitter feed.
He was accompanied by two German journalists during his visit to Russia.
Strabele explained that according to the lawyer of the former NSA employee Snowden could not return to Russia if he left the country.
If Snowden makes a statement in Germany, he needs a guarantee that he is "safe" there, so the honourable Member.
Snowden explains in his letter that he is exposed to a "relent and ongoing" persecution campaign that drove him out of his home.
However, he was affected by the global response to 'my act of political opinion'.
Citizens around the world as well as high-ranking politicians – also in the United States – have referred to the revelations of an uncontrolled system of comprehensive supervision as a merit to the general public.
In his letter, Snowden makes the German authorities an offer of cooperation "when the difficulties around the humanitarian situation have been solved".
Frontier Airlines collects fees for hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to require up to 100 US dollars of passengers who want to steal handbags on their flight.
Frontier Airlines intends to calculate up to 100 US dollars for a piece of hand luggage and 2 dollars for coffee or lemonade, even if in the announcement on Wednesday it was to read that passengers should keep the whole dose.
The new fee is for handbags in the bag over the seat, small bags under the seat are still free.
Frontier explained that it would cost 25 US dollars if the fee was paid in advance, and 100 US dollars for travellers who only paid on the flight path.
Frontier speaker Kate O'Malley said that the 100-dollar fee was intended to move travellers to take care of the payment in advance.
"We do not want to calculate this sum," she explained.
Air carriers started in 2008 to demand fees for the first and second items.
Passengers who tried to handle them have therefore stopped as much as possible into the hand luggage, resulting in the luggage bags being frequently filled over the seat.
Fees are an opportunity to move passengers to take less on board.
O'Malley said the new fee doesn't really make it to earn money.
It is about the most loyal customers of Frontier, who had made it clear that it would be increasingly difficult to find space in the box above the seat.
Passengers who buy your tickets on the airline's website do not have to pay.
This means that a passenger on the flight path from Frontier can take a luggage bag free of charge, but the next person has to pay $100 for a comparable luggage bag.
O'Malley explained that the website of Frontier and the check-in procedures would be changed, so passengers were informed about the fee before they arrived at the airport.
The new handbag fee of Frontier will only enter into force in the summer, a precise date is not yet available.
Passengers often ski about luggage and other charges, but airlines are happy to get back on it.
You argue that transporting the luggage costs money and passengers should pay this service if they want it.
Many on the Wall Street view the new luggage charges as a sign that airlines take enough money to cover the costs of flights after years of loss.
Most, however, still leave the fingers of fees for hand luggage.
Spirit Airlines Inc. claimed three years ago as the first fee for hand luggage and later followed Allegiant Air, also a cheap flighter.
The only other airline with such a fee was the Hungarian Wizz Air, explained Airline Consultant Jay Sorensen, who carefully followed the additional fees.
He estimated in a December 2011 report that the handbag fee was 50 million US dollars a year.
Sorensen, who previously held a leadership position at Midwest Airlines, recently flew with spirit and was curious what he would expect on the flight path if passengers faced the company's unusual luggage charges.
"The boarding process was one of the most smooth things I've ever experienced in my career on the air," he said.
I expected to see dentists and handcuff discussions on the flight path.
"The plane was full," he said, "and the boarding went like a smoldering."
Frontier also follows Spirit with the 2 dollars required for coffee, tea, lemonade or juice.
The company explained that passengers who bought lemonade or juice should keep the whole dose and be filled free of charge.
Water is still free.
US Airways had recently tried to demand money for refreshments in 2008, but it went back seven months later, after passengers had complained and no other large company had been pursued.
Frontier's step to raise fees for the hand luggage if passengers do not buy directly from the airline is the latest initiative to be brought to the customer's website.
Airlines pay online travel offices such as Orbitz 10 to 25 US dollars per ticket sold.
This gives all companies an incentive to move passengers to direct purchases with them instead of via an online travel agency.
However, borderier has gone the best way in this area.
In September, the company began to spend only half as many flyers as possible when booking an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, the miles were reduced to 25 per cent of the flight route.
A flight trip with a third-party provider with a border of more than 1000 miles will therefore only bring in 250 miles.
Passengers can also be booked only when buying directly on the website of Frontier places.
Frontier has a loyal customer tribe at his seat in Denver, but the business is ruined and the company loses money.
The recovery went back by 9 per cent and the flight capacity collapsed almost 13 per cent in the first quarter, as is the financial report published by the Republic Airways Holdings Inc. on Wednesday.
The Republic has tried to get the funds of Frontier in the hands of the company as part of its sale.
Words From the Bible
Good 40 women visited the last women's breakfast this year in the Evangelical Church of Bisingen.
The theme of the day in the community house was "Bible Words" and "Central Expressions".
Zita Köhler, the chairman of the church council, went after breakfast in a talk to the Bible proverbs.
"The words contain life guidance, regulations or warnings," she explained.
She compared several words with the corresponding Bible verses and explained the meaning.
She called words like: "Holzauge be watchful, like drops fall from the eyes, throw an eye on someone, His eyes are in the Lord's sleep, wash his hands in innocence."
On several occasions, the rapporteur also advised her listeners about what language it was.
The Middle Ages spokesperson Christel Dehner accepted: All good things are three, blue, something brown.
She explained the importance and origin of the speeches she called " Bridges to the Past".
A tombola has been released for completion.
The prices were covered on a table and were humourfully described before they were handed over to the winners.
Among the visitors of the breakfast round was the mayor's candidate Roman Waizenegger.
Learning instead of unemployed: pilot project for young people in tourism
A pilot project for the tourism industry was launched at the Mecklenburg Seeplate.
Under the leadership of the Federal Labour Agency, 49 women and men who are already working as an underage in the industry are expected to be qualified over three winters for professionals for hotels and hostels.
"It is new to end the six-month courses with conclusions," said Carmen Wiechert from the Neubrandenburg Labour Agency.
The benefits were diverse: the participants would not be unemployed, the companies would be struggling with skilled professionals who were increasingly lacking in hotels and guest places, and the agency would not have to finance unemployment.
The project also includes the Chambers of Industry and Commerce in Neubrandenburg and the Deutsche Hotel and Hospitality Association (Dehoga) Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
NSA explains that a "internal error" and not hacker is due to the crash of the website
The shadowy National Security Agency stated on the late Friday, an error has put its public website a few hours ago and not hacker, as it was claimed online.
“NSA.gov was not reachable for a few hours tonight, as an internal error occurred during a planned update,” explained the spy agency in an e-mail message.
The problem will be solved this evening.
The claim that the result was caused by a distributed Denial of Service attack (DDoS), is not true.
In the early hours of the evening, online server trackers discovered that the NSA website was not available for at least six hours and this is still not available for some users.
Previously, an NSA spokesperson told ABC News that the Authority's sensitive internal network was "in no way" compromised.
Secret information is not in danger, so the speaker.
At least one group of hacktivists claimed to have placed the NSA website with a DDoS attack.
In the event of such attacks, the target website will be overloaded with pagenecks until the servers are overloaded and the website collapses.
Cybertactics is relatively simple and attacks are not intended to interfere with the internal network of the target system.
The former super-secret NSA, whose top name once called No Search Agency (No such authority), is now in the light of the public and is looking after the discoveries made in recent months about its extensive monitoring program in the country and abroad – a result of the secret NSA data stolen and published by the disappointed former NSA employee Edward Snowden.
The growing controversy over the secret service led to initial speculation that the incident today was the result of a targeted Cyprus operation.
The number of people without jobs decreased slightly in October by 22 to 1,307.
Although the quota is 3.1 percent better than last year and also better than in September, "we would have hoped for more," says Monika Felder-Bauer, deputy director of the Agency for Labour in Sonthofen.
Because many businesses have responded to settings so far.
One reason for this is, according to Felder-Bauer, "We have hardly any experts in handwork, health care and care".
Annual times have also been in operation since September for staff at the hotel and in the hotel.
In mid-December, the winter season begins there.
The entire background report can be found in the Allgäuer advertigeblatt of 31.10.2013 (page 33).
Earnings at Bombardier after discount on delivery and orders
On Thursday, the Canadian aircraft and railway manufacturer Bombardier Inc reported a 15 percent decrease in net profit after having been pressured by late orders and deliveries to third-quarter aircraft as well as contractual problems in the railway party.
Bombardier, based in Montreal, also published no flight test data for his new CSeries aircraft and provided no further information on whether the aircraft could enter the commercial service in accordance with the ambitious timetable next September.
Up to now, only three further startups were followed on the jet flight of the test plane one and a half months ago, which makes it appear in question whether the test phase is going as planned.
The results remained behind the projections and led to a course crash of more than eight percent at the Toronto stock exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, analyst at National Bank Financial, outlined his assessment of "outperform" on "sector performance" on Thursday that the stock has a limited potential in the next one to two quarters.
"Although poorer delivery rates have been expected for aircraft as a whole, we are clearly disappointed by the marginal development in the transport sector," Duerksen said in a customer letter.
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries when the pilot program for the plane advances.
However, if new orders are not announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more sceptical about the programme.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries airline can catapult the company into the lower market segment, which is currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test plane was presented in March of the public and fled after months of delays for the first time in September.
However, binding orders for the CSeries with 177 are moderate, since potential buyers are waiting for the results of the flight tests to see whether the company's claims on fuel efficiency and cost savings of the new diesel vehicle are relevant.
Currently there are 403 orders and promises from 15 customers and companies.
Chairman Pierre Beaudoin is confident that Bombardier will reach its goal of 300 binding orders at the start of commercial use of the jet.
The company management also assured the analysts and the media on Thursday, and the program is in the timetable.
“The test aircraft is no longer on the ground than expected”, Beaudouin said at a telephone conference and added, while the aircraft’s stand-by time was tested and software updates were put in place.
Every manufacturer's plant is different.
We have decided to take the first flight and then attach a period of processing, as we have done.
This happens during the entire flight program.
The second of five test planes is expected to start in the next few weeks, the rest of them soon thereafter, was called from the company page.
Nevertheless, analysts remain skeptical whether they can operate a CS series aircraft twelve months after the first customer's flight.
Bombardier explained that it will review the implementation planning (EIS) and update it in the coming months.
“The slow advance of the flight test – even if it is clearly in line with Bombardi’s internal planning – reinforces our view that the launch is moving to the first quarter of 2015,” Derksen said.
In the third quarter with the end of September 30th, Bombardier's net profits fell to 147 million dollars or 8 cents per share of 172 million dollars or 9 cents per share a year earlier.
The adjusted profit per share is 9 cent unchanged.
The sales increased slightly from 4.2 to 4.1 billion dollars.
Analysts expected a profit of 10 cents per share and a turnover of $4.56 billion, says Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world's fourth largest aircraft manufacturer, he has delivered 45 aircraft in this quarter, a decrease of 57 last year.
Net orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26.
The mandate of the Air and Space Department amounted to $32.9 billion on 30 September and was thus unchanged against 31 December.
"In the area of air and space, the results were disappointing in terms of our standards, but the low order entry and the overall market conditions were disappointing," Beaudoin said.
The turnover in the air and space transport sector fell by 13 per cent to two billion dollars.
Bombardier, the world's largest railway manufacturer, announced that the turnover in this range has increased by almost eleven percent to $2.1 billion.
The ordering stock in the Transport Party amounted to $32.6 billion on September 30th and was thus slightly increased compared to December 31.
In some major contracts, the volume of profits in transport has been affected by settlement problems.
According to the management of the company, new standards will be provided for the fourth quarter.
In the afternoon trade on Thursday, the Bombardier stock accounted for 8.5 percent and was at 4.83 Canadian dollars after it was announced that the Google Finance Board Patrick Pichette will be transferred to the board.
The Brazilian Embraer SA, the world's third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and bombardier's strictest rival, reported a 10 percent decline in quarterly profits on Thursday.
USA: Shots at Los Angeles Airport
An unknown person fired shots on Friday morning (location time) at the LAX airport.
While the airport manager told Twitter that the gun was in custody, the "Los Angeles Times" reported, the man was dead.
A security man was killed, too.
The media also reported several injuries.
US President Barack Obama is constantly informed of the situation, said the speaker of the White House, Jay Carney.
The incident occurred in Terminal 3. Eyewitnesses reported having seen a shield with a weapon in one of the vents, as several media reported.
A traveler told the CNN sender, many people had been looking for panic protection.
Travelers had screamed and crying children.
Among the waiters, panic broke out, many had been hiding out of fear behind chairs.
He heard two shots, says a traveler of the Los Angeles Times.
An employee of the safety authority TSA has suffered a gunshot injury at the foot.
The scene was "like in a movie."
Then he himself was taken to a security area, the man reported.
The shots should be located near a security control area.
Evacuated airport building
On television images, there were numerous hospitals and police cars in front of a terminal.
Hundreds of people were taken out of the building.
Users posted photos of a special use command and a weapon lying on the ground.
As the airport manager announced on Twitter, the event began at 9.30 a.m. (Place time).
The access routes were blocked, which, according to CNN, resulted in a long return.
It was said until the air traffic was temporarily suspended on landings.
However, several flights were also to be observed on CNN at the start.
Terminal 3 is primarily operated by smaller US airlines.
Los Angeles airport is a major airport in the United States.
Cocaine Advisor, who warned the drug boss before police investigation, has to go to prison
Basharat Ditta, 42, continued information on underworld size Neil Scarborough
The lawyer was afraid his secret drug addiction could come to light
He was sentenced by Liverpool Crown Court to three years in prison
A well-known prosecutor who warned a drug baron before a major police investigation because he was afraid his secret drug search could be discovered, was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, provided underworld size Neil Scarborough with sensitive information about his drug-trafficking activities after being compromised by his own cocaine addiction.
The criminal lawyer named "Bash" was arrested in his home in 2011, after the Scarborough police had watched him represent him in an earlier drug procedure.
Officials observed how Scarborough (32) delivered three bags of cocaine at the lawyer's house in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he and his colleagues were at a meal of the lawyer's chamber.
The findings added that this drug of Class A was regularly consumed after testing traces of cocaine in his hair, on his pocket and credit cards.
Over a period of eight months between January and August 2011, he attempted to obtain information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his partners.
All four suspects were then monitored by the police as part of a major investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
Together with 32 others, they were later arrested after the police secured heroin and cocaine in a number of domestic searches worth 1.5 million pounds and 200,000 pounds in cash.
Ditta, 42, gave information to the criminals because he feared that his drug addiction could become public.
Today, Ditta, who works for the office of Forbes Requestors in Blackburn, was found guilty and convicted at Liverpool Crown Court after a three-week trial in two counts because of the lack of justice.
He gave the cocaine possession in an earlier survey.
The lawyer was transferred after the police found out in their investigations against Scarborough that he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspect and saw him go to Dittas' house and lay the drugs there with a purity of 60 percent in a black golf shoe under the lawyer's mill tone.
Shortly after delivering the drugs, Scarborough regularly called with Ditta, who was at the Blackburn Rovers Football Stadium in Ewood Park at dinner.
The lawyer returned home, took the drugs and then nine communications were exchanged between the two.
It was announced before the Court that Ditta was a "regular consumer" of cocaine after testing the drugs of Class A in his hair, pocket and credit cards.
This was later arrested, but argued to take cocaine and said that he had spoken to the moderate dealer because this was his mandate, and claimed that his discussion was subject to the "secretity of the lawyer".
During his arrest, Ditta took his mailbox and tried to remove a number of credit cards, but they were secured and a hair sample was taken to him.
At the police hearing, he stated that he was operating both under his private address and at his workplace an office and an office would call him at home for legal matters.
It was announced before the Court that he had called for significant arrests and informed of what the drug dealer knew about them.
State attorney Anne Whyte said: “A criminal lawyer should know better than anyone else that you do not break the law.”
This is accused of abuse of his position as a defender, since he has become too involved with certain commanders.
The relationship in question is not simply that of a drug dealer, but of a drug dealer who provides his lawyer with drugs.
Some of his communications were undoubtedly legitimate, since he was the lawyer of these persons.
But this went far beyond the limits of a normal relationship between the lawyer and the mandant.
He acted against police investigations as far as possible so that they could continue to pursue their criminal activities.
Mr Ditta therefore brought his position of employment to a standstill.
He was too close to certain commanders, especially Scarborough, and he suggested that his independence was compromised.
This one showed every wrong behaviour and claimed: “If I were a corrupt lawyer, what I am not, and wanted to pass on information to Scarborough, I would not wait 15 hours, but do it immediately.”
But after the hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead of the Police in Lancashire said: "Mr. Ditta has taken the step of a criminal defender at the time he started to acquire drugs from organised criminals."
Its cocaine dependence led to a hopeless compromise and made it acceptable for the leaders of organised crime officers to collect valuable information on police investigations.
Lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and ensure public confidence and trust.
This trust has gone back and is trying to hide behind the facade of his profession.
The Serious and Organized Crime Unit of Lancashire led the investigations against Ditta, which also led to a three-case conviction due to the possession of cocaine and justice, which underlines our determination to bring criminals to justice.
This case should be a warning to criminals and shows that no one can take away the arm of the law.
We'll find you and bring you to court.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after he had declared himself guilty of the conspiracy against heroin, cocaine and cannabis trafficking.
Fifty others involved in drug trafficking were sentenced to 153 years' imprisonment for drug trafficking.
On his website Ditta published an area with questions and answers about himself, in which he indicated that his dream job was to represent as a lawyer for execution warrants in America, his ultimate guest at dinner was Mohammed Ali and equal opportunities was the motivation for his work.
Revolutionary work of church music
To complete the celebrations due to its 160-year-old existence, the song crane Dunningen is framed by two services with the "German fair" by Franz Schubert.
After the great success of the musical "Rock my Life", which thrilled the audience this year in the spring, the songplay will enrich the completion of the anniversary year with the performance of the German fair by Franz Schubert.
On Saturday, October 26, this extraordinary fair will be heard from 19 during the evening fair in St. Martinuskirche Dunningen and on Sunday, 27 October, from 10.15 a.m. in the service of God in St. Johannes Baptist Church in Lackendorf.
The so-called Deutsche Messe with the original title "Songs to the celebration of the Holy Victim of the Messe", D 872, is a spiritual music by composer Franz Schubert from 1826 and was almost revolutionary at the time of the birth.
The fair is presented in the framework of God’s services, as was the case with the contractor Johann Philipp Neumann.
Under the direction of Hermann Schneider, the choir is accompanied by the band of the band of the music association Frohsinn Tannenbronn and Noemi Lokodi at the organ.
Haslach: Skepsy tends to look suspicious
With the elections to the parish municipality in 2015, for example, the soul care unit Haslach (SE) will change fundamentally.
There is then only one common parish municipality for all six parishes.
At a joint meeting on Saturday, the bodies from Haslach, Hofstetten, Mühlenbach, Fischerbach, Steinach and Welchensteinach prepared for the changes.
Because the basic decisions of the diocese are no longer to be changed and it is for the parish authorities to implement them as satisfactorily as possible.
In the course of the day, it became particularly clear: the skeps against the new are waving, however, in the face of trust.
From the ideas and expectations of the 2015 innovations to concrete proposals on the future composition and size of the parish municipality, the extremely constructive talks of the six bodies with the main officials of the soul body team were held.
Regionaldekan Georg Schmitt explained the latest directives for mental care units in the Erzdiozese Freiburg by means of a presentation.
Then the SE Haslach as a church municipality will form a body of public law which has so far entered into the rights and obligations of the six individual church communities.
There will only be a common parish community and a founding council, in which the parish office is represented.
Each parish shall be represented by at least two elected members, six parishes being formed on-the-spot community items.
Their mission will be to promote church life in the place.
On the question of the finances of the individual parish community, there was a considerable need for discussion.
The innovations provide that collected goods are retained in the parishes for purpose.
On the other hand, the commitments go to the general community.
In particular with regard to the large planned investments, whose commitment then meets all the parishes, there was great concern.
"Even in the past, it was only invested in projects that could be managed by the individual parishes alone," said Mr. Bruno Prinzbach, president of the parish council.
Practical experience with a joint body for five parishes painted Barbara Ritter, the chairman of the body in the soul care unit Schutterwald-Neured.
They had made 2006 the task of becoming "one, five" and had to find that it was not that simple.
The bodies of the Haslacher soul care unit were then able to answer questions about the future composition and size of the common parish community and the practical work of the community teams.
Preparations will be made at further meetings and decided at another joint meeting of all six bodies in the coming spring.
At the end, Michael Schöner, from Steinach, presented the new logo of the soul care unit, which was agreed by a clear majority.
In Pfullendorf, the current becomes more expensive
Citizens of Pfullendorfs have to adjust to higher electricity costs.
As the manager of the city works, Jörg-Arne Bias, confirmed against the SÜDKURIER, adds to a four-headed Pfullendorfer family 70 to 90 Euros extra charge per year.
The main reason for the rising price increases is the increase in the EEC contribution from 5,277 to 6,3 cents per kilowatt hour.
This conversion is re-established every year in October by the four operators of the major power lines.
These give them the extra costs that come from the energy exchange that they can raise by a change over the electricity price.
The city works Pfullendorf form the last link in this chain.
The supervisory board of the energy company was even removed from a higher environment in its forecasts, as Jörg-Arne Bias reports.
Now the concrete payments had to be calculated before the city works could inform their customers about the exact price increase next week.
"We're going from a 1 cent plus x raise," says Bias, where the number is going to be closer to the 2 cent.
Light on permanent red: Watch on waiting time
Sometimes a lamp just won't be green.
The contact wire in the street does not react, or the light sign is defective.
What should you do - drive at Red?
If a person has waited long enough for a red lamp and the crossing is free, he can proceed, explained by the Stuttgart lawyer Ralf Becker in the magazine "Motorrad".
The waiting time, however, must be "accepted", which can be different from the case.
Becker advises to wait at least five minutes before a malfunction of the lamp has occurred.
However, if the journey continues despite red light, it must be clear that it bears the full blame for an accident caused by it.
If a patient for less than five minutes does not wait long under circumstances, Becker warns and refers to a decision by the Supreme Court of Hamm.
In the negotiated case, a driver had ignored the lamp after about three minutes of continuous red and had to respond to a sudden red light loss.
The lamp was not defective, but only a little later on to green.
A ban on driving was spared because of the special situation - but not the money penalty.
The community is happy about a solid budget
Always when it comes to the budget in municipal meetings, Mayor Ralph Gerster has a good laugh.
The community decouple in Herdwangen-Schönach is well filled and debts are no longer known by the administration since 2005.
The 2012 financial year can also be seen as a full success in this regard.
This was evident in the presentation of the 2012 annual accounts.
As Andrea Rothmund explained, the administrative budget of around 7.6 million euros was higher than planned.
The surplus of the administrative budget is also around EUR 1.8 million over the approach.
Thanks to the surplus, above all, to higher turnover and to the share of income tax.
The wealth budget was also back on the planned values.
Instead of the planned EUR 1.5 million, it amounted to EUR 2.5 million last year.
"This is essentially the higher contribution from the administrative budget," says Rothmund.
As less investment has been made than planned in the 2012 financial year, the back-up is also higher.
Overall, the overall return of around €2.1 million could now be increased to €4.9 million.
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and her team for their good work.
"It's not easy to shoot from the sleeve," Gerster praised with a look at the annual bill.
He and the municipal authorities are obviously excited about the good numbers.
It may sound paradox, but these good numbers could soon become more expensive for the citizens.
Because of the good financial situation, the congregation in the past was able to ignore high standards.
As a result, however, Gerster said that the country had already been cut off by a number of subsidies.
There are conditions for these subsidies from various compensatory units.
Among other things, the cities and communities applying for grants must have certain lifting rates.
"We need to look at the subject of austerity as investment for which we would like to make grants in the coming years," Gerster announced in this regard.
Nagold: Hugo Wermter for 60 years in the choir
With 60 years as a singer, Hubert Wermter's story at the Men's Singer Cácilia is almost twice as long as that of the Herb Festival, in which he was celebrated.
Hubert Wermter stood as usual in the colors of his male singership on stage.
Even after 60 years, the singing with the present will probably make him even more fun than a favorite choir.
Wermter was also active in the association, including for 28 years as a member of the Committee.
For his engagement and association he received several awards: Jörg Kohr, Pastoral Rapporteur on behalf of the Cecilian Association of Rottenburg-Stuttgart, handed him - since the choir is also a church choir - a copy of the association and a letter of honor signed by Bishop Gebhard Prince.
His collaborators handed him the copy of the German choir band as well as a engraved tin counter.
In addition to the honorary, the 31st autumn festival was held in usual tracks: with the MGV Betra, the song kranz Salzstätten, the singer department Baisingen and the local music club, the fullmaringer had loaded a colourful mix of different audiences and singing styles, which were held by about 400 visitors.
The MGV Fullmaringen opened with vocal songs such as "In Wine Paradies" and "Listen, your brothers".
To her honorary singer Hubert Wermter they prepared a small stand for honor - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's "Bundeslied".
The male singer Betra also sang classical choir songs like Julius Wengert's "Jegerwerben", "Wit, far away" of Hubert Goisern and the folk song "When You Go Through the Valley".
With his mixed choir and women's group - the "impulsory" - the women's rate of the festival, the song's song-stetten provided.
The mixed chorus, with the Neapolitan folk way "Santa Lucia" and "Eviva Espana" of Anton Gus in foreign countries, also returned to foreign languages: "Liberatio" and "Hey Jude" were part of their program.
The singing department of the Baisinger Sportverein came back to home with "What's wrong with Schwab?" by Hans Süssmuth and Robert Paperts "Bierlied" where the Fullmaringer Musicverein offered the crowning musical ending.
For the children, there was a small side program - "Oma Hanne" alias Hannole Stolltemer introduced a Kasperltheater and read a few stories that the children had worked well in the afternoon.
Children’s Dreams Become True
The children's gardens and children's places in the Zollernalbkreis receive post in these days.
In cooperation with Bauhaus and the Sparkasse Zollernalb, the Schwarzwälder Bote wishes to support the institutions in the realization of their construction and decoration desires.
Does the garden need a new sand box?
Participation in the action may include all childcare facilities, childcare facilities and childcare facilities from the entire Zollernal district.
If you have a construction or decoration wish for your installation, you can apply for this boat at the Black Forest.
Be creative with your children and surprise the jury of the action Children's Garden building.
A jury, consisting of representatives of Schwarzwälder Bote, Bauhaus and Sparkasse Zollernalb, selects three wishes from all shipments.
What are the conditions for participation?
The wish should be realized with construction material of a maximum value of EUR 2000 and on a (action-) day.
In addition, the winner himself has to provide for many flexible construction aids.
What about the day of action and the helpers?
Bauhaus provides the material with the support of the Sparkasse Zollernalb.
It will be delivered to the children's gardens on the agreed day and will then be processed directly by the helpers.
Helping parents, grandparents, friends, associations and, of course, the educators and children themselves can be helpful.
Kenyan Press Empresss Controversial Media Act
"We are in a fearful position and we can ask ourselves, what does Parliament want to do to simply eliminate the legal independence of tomorrow?" was read in the newspaper that does not respect the draft legislation.
"The law is draconic and very punishable and we reject it," said Cyrus Kamau, Managing Director of the Capital Group, who also belongs to CapitalFM, one of Kenya's most prominent independent radio stations and news sites.
He said that the new media tribunal "will always be taken forward because it is an extended arm of government", and restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya's position in the global economy.
"I hope that the President will listen to us and we appeal to him to reject this bill and send it back to Parliament," he said.
According to the newspaper The Star, the government took the new law "the media effectively into a sponsorship". On the other hand, The Standard, Democracy and Freedom of Speech in Kenya had suffered "a severe blow", and had adopted the draft as "draconic".
The adoption of the Law is part of a series of measures to strengthen national security in the aftermath of the attacks by armed Islamists at the Westgate Shopping Centre in September.
The Kenyan media drew on the anger of the authorities because they published recordings of security cameras, which were to be seen as the units sent to the Tator allegedly robbed the luxurious shopping centre.
Police officer David Kimaiyo responded to this by ordering two journalists and a leading media representative to be interviewed, even if the transmission was withdrawn after a press call.
Under the new law, media houses with a penalty of up to 20 million Kenyan Shillings can be imposed and individual journalists with up to one million as well as the other risk of losing their professional recognition or being excluded from official press accreditation.
The Court also has the right to seize the property of the persons concerned if a penalty is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, "only a single penalty can force most broadcasters into the bankyard".
In addition, the newspaper believes that these measures could have a devastating effect on Kenya's "living blogosphere".
If they take the media to silence, politicians could do without punishment whatever they want.
"No one will ever know," wrote Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist at the nation, who refers to Kenyan media as a decisive control factor in public life.
"If politicians are left behind, they lead the country to the Bankruptcy and we return to the time of hunters and collectors," he commented.
In the past, the Kenyan legislators have already raised public concerns.
In May, they agreed to withdraw the reductions scheduled by the National Compensation Commission and put in force their fines of about 532,000 shillings free of charge per month – they are among the highest in the world.
Bad-Dürrheim: A Dream Becomes True for the FC
In spite of the cold weather and rain, the official ceremony for the art race sports place was of no importance to the city and football club.
A more pleasant holiday was probably all wanted on Saturday, but Peter did not want to play with it.
Thus had all those who came without a rain screen or could not keep one for any reason.
It was the musicians who framed the feast, just like some redner.
Nass was therefore also the FC chairman of Albrecht Schlenker, who spoke of the fulfillment of a dream.
His thanks were to all the mayor Walter Klumpp, who was very committed to the implementation of the project, to the community, to the participating companies and to the members of the association who joined.
Here, especially Lothar Held, Paul Weizenegger, Heiner Gail and Peter Graf.
The rusty tenants placed 400 square meters of patchstones for the new roads.
This remarkable honourary commitment was also appreciated by the Landtag Agent Karl Rombach.
Other words spoke for the city sports committee Hubert Baier, the district president of the South-Badic Football Association, Kuno Kayan, and Friedrich Knorr from the planning office, who announced a donation to the club's youth department.
Mayor Klmpp recalled that repeated weather-related influences in the spring and autumn were so attached to the original place of harvest that he could not be played.
Already 15 years ago, there were the first discussions to solve the problem when it was thought of building a third place on the ground of the football club or on the real school at the Salinensee.
Both were rejected again.
Six years ago thoughts came up about the establishment of an art race sports space, which was generally seen as the ultimate solution.
Specific plans were taken two years ago when the FC took over the umbrella in Erbacht, said a cost-sharing of EUR 100,000 for the construction of the site and validated the country's funding of EUR 104 000.
In October 2012, the City Council decided to take over the remaining EUR 356,000 at the total cost of EUR 560,000, bringing together Klumpp.
The construction of the 68 times 108 meters of large artificial lawns took place on 4 June.
During the three-month construction phase, 3000 cubic metres of earth were taken down, half of which was used for the installation of a Dirt-bike track.
The Union and the SPD have continued their coalition negotiations on internal affairs and justice.
To this end, the responsible working group met in Berlin in the morning.
Among other things, it is direct democracy, parliamentary arrest and the federal police.
The Working Party on Migration and Integration also wanted to continue its consultations on the morning.
This should include the subject of dual citizenship, where both sides have conflicting views.
The SPD wants to put an end to the obligation for immigrant children born in Germany to decide - the Union rejects a double passport.
On the subject of transport, which is not on the agenda on Friday, the SPD undermined its no to a Pkw-mout required by the CSU.
A Vignette was a "platrate for multimodal transport and thus ecologically counterproductive", explained the SPD negotiator for the theme of transport, Florian Pronold, in a letter to his group.
There were threats of exchange on rural roads, which are already emergency points.
The introduction of a wall for all Pkw from the view of Pronolds would also be just a first step.
"There is a danger that the compensation for German will be abolished at a later time," he said.
Dieter Thomas Kuhn in Stuttgart: The Singing Föhnwelle on the outdoor stage
Stuttgart - "When will it be true again in the summer?" was not actually the question on Friday evening at the outdoor stage Killesberg.
It was really a tropical night in Stuttgart.
So the best conditions for the match star Dieter Thomas Kuhn and his band.

Car driver seriously injured in accident
In case of an accident on Thursday evening, a 37-year-old Pkw professional from Aachen was seriously injured.
According to the police, a 41-year-old from Müsch was on his way to Grefrath with her car on the Kempender Outerring.
When she wanted to turn left to St. Toniser Street, she passed over the next car of the 37th year.

The VW Passat running behind the BMW was also damaged by a 19-year-old.
A total of about 15,000 were injured, the police reported.
The road had to be blocked during the accident, it continued.
Vienna Airport Disengages Passenger Charges
Mr. Max Maier, please come to Gate 24.
By saying like this, there will no longer be any more Vienna-Swischat airport in the future.
A large part of the speech speakers are thus absent - the sound level is to be so clearly reduced.
To create a more relaxed atmosphere is the goal of this renewal.
As Airport speaker Peter Kleemann announced against Radio Wien, the Vienna Airport follows an international trend with the setting of cross-sections involving individuals.
Thus, among other things, the airports in Copenhagen, Frankfurt or Dubai are already refusing to attend the alarming calls.
Due to the passage of these statements - on average, on one day about 200 personal calls were made by the speakers - it is expected to enter the airport more quietly in the future.
"It has also been shown in the experience that these individual statements have been relatively little perceived, but at the same time all other information about modified flight paths or departure times is a bit down here," says Kleemann in the conversation with the radio broadcaster.
Highlander Games at the Kaltenhof
In addition to the train ride with tractors, there is a second match at the agricultural harvest festival at the Kaltenhof from 6 to 8 September.
On Saturday, 7 September, the Highlander Games begin at 13.30 a.m.
They have a Scottish tradition, but they are swivel at the Kaltenhof.
Teams and individual combatants are measured in the disciplines of tree stems, pits and water vessels.
Four-and-a-half meters is the tree trunk long and 25 to 30 kilograms hard.
"It doesn't come any further," says Organiser Peter Saile.
The tribe has to be rejected in a straight way, to be overcome once and then just lie down.
This is assessed with most points.
In the case of pituitary waste, the target is accurate.
From the distance of eight meters it is cast on a plock.
Efficientness and strength must be demonstrated by the participants in water intake over 50 metres.
Time and volume of water in a bottle will be measured at the end.
In the case of each "Clan" team, two may participate in the individual competition.
The winners of the team and individual competition will receive prizes.
It can be trained from 10 a.m.
Wishing is a suitable dress, for example, the fighters can enter the bulkhead.
But also Swedish wear is allowed.
For "Outfit", the jury gives a few more bonus points.
You can log in up to an hour before the start of the competition.
With the Scottish-Swedish Highlander Games and the Tractor Pulling, which begins one and a half hours earlier, a lot of action has been said on the site on Saturday.
In the evening, the music friends will come at their expense.
At 7:00 p.m., the evaporative blasphemous music from Schömberg forms the big entertainment evening.
The chapel plays beautiful Polkas and Mersche.
But their repertoire also includes sensitive rollers and a slender big band sound.
With this the Heinz Koch will be known as the singing host and black-haired baron from the cattle under the cattle.
In Dornhan, he has already appeared in the Christmas market and in the Narrenzft.
On Sunday, the Musikverein Leinstetten holds breakfast, from 14 o'clock, the Böffingen farmer's chapel is a guest, and the "Oldies" then let the party off.

Other agenda items include the old-time and leisure meetings on Saturday and Sunday, exhibitions by companies on the subject of agriculture and forestry.
Other attractions on Sunday are the Maislabyrinth, the Handicraft Market and the Schascheren.
There is a stretcher zoo, strehüpburg, tractor (under instructions) and tractor-surfing for children.
The organizers are the multi-purpose association, the ski club and the tractor friend "Zündkäpsele".
Milk and egg alternatives in the overview
Vegan food requires plant alternatives to eggs, milk and milk products.
Purified tofu with plant seed is, for example, a quartz set.
The Vegetarian Foundation is also known as the World Vegan Day on 1 November.
On 1 November, on the occasion of the World War I, the Vegetarian Federation of Germany proposes a series of alternatives to vegan:
Pure plant margarine is a good alternative to butter, let yoghurt be replaced by soja yoghurt.
Instead of milk, soya, hazelnut, almond or rice milk may be used.
Degradable plant seed replaces conventional seedlings.
There are also plant alternatives to eggs.
For example, a half straight, mature banana can replace an egg as a binder in a cake.
Also 50 grams of apple or a tablecloth muffled linen plus three tablespoons of water are suitable for this.
Locker is instead of eggs, for example, with a mixture of a teaspoon of back powder, a tablespoon of food strength and three tablespoons of mineral water.
But also 50 grams of sojayoghurt or seidentoufu can meet this purpose.
According to the Vebu, about 800 000 people are currently fed in Germany, so pure plant.
Sleepless in New York
On the way to their host families in Weymouth, Massachusetts, the students of the Black Forest Gymnasium met the American capital of New York.
After eight hours of flight, it immediately left for Brooklyn Bridge, which reached the heart of the city, Manhattan.
Here is already a fascinating view of the world-famous skyline, which in the evening is a special trip.
By the time shift, the students were almost 24 hours on their legs, but faithful to the motto "The city does not sleep" was decided on the day at Times Square.
Despite Shutdown, on the second day, the state of freedom was able to be reached with a ferry and be put on foot.
Then it went through the financial centre around the Wall Street to the memorial site of September 11.
On the third day, the students from the 373 meters high view platform of the Empire state building were able to gain an overview of the fascinating big city and enjoy the view.
Then it went through the hectic drive of the New York Streets through the Rockefeller Center to the Central Park, which offered an ideal opportunity for a short stay in the autumn sun.
After a short flight from New York to Boston, the students now arrived in their host families and experienced the day of school at Weymouth High School.
This year too, on the day of the name of Saint Hubertus in the parish church of St. Marie, on the Hülsbergstraße, a Hubertus fair is celebrated.
St. Hubertus was the case after a rather thoughtless hunter who was converted by a vision and was later appointed bishop of Lüttich.
The hunting hornblower group of the hunting dreier Westfalen under the leadership of Brigitte Kluth muzzles on Parforce horners (natural horn in the mood It) after an old, original French melodies.
Blossoms wear riding clothes because they primarily accompany riders, horses and dog girls on jogging hunting musically.
The festive fair takes place on Sunday, November 3, at 11.30 a.m.
The newly designed storage shines with a new café.
One that invites you to stay and return.
One that wants to make the name of the program.
As Déjà Vu, Lexicon is called a psychological phenomenon that is expressed in the feeling of having experienced or seen a new situation.
In the case of the visit of the same-name café at the strike in Kleve County in view of the Rhein-Waal High School, it must not remain in the pure Déjà Vu feeling.
Finally, the café with the beautiful name has the aim of making a real stay not only grateful, but always hand-holdable.
Because it's just fun and it's just nice.
A look into the inner life at the 8th floor gives the viewer a good feeling.
This high-modern, but not cool café environment looks like a place to feel well.
Here, the team with the founders Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Büttner at the top cheers the guest with different coffee or cocktail variants.
For this, there are delicious cakes or individually placed fresh baguattes.
The owners, both 33 years of age, have already made a name for themselves before the opening of the beautiful café as a gastronomy: in Kranenburg they led the "Art Lounge".
From the move to Kleve to the strike, the sympathetic Café lovers hope for more audience.
Not least by the high school.
"Where we have no specific target group," says Daniel Büttner.
Rather, the two young students here want to address the same thing as seniors and all ages.
About Café-Liebhaber.
The friendly owner couple is behind the coffee-genus.
Enjoys the scenting hot bread in the various variations itself.
Expressofan
Daniel Büttner is rather the expresso fan and Mirjam van der sets the cappuccino drinker.
"To do this, a baguate -- that's my thing," she betrays the NRZ.
Two events were already in the bright café.
I'd better say one thing.
Because the port festival took place outside - the Café Déjà Vu did not benefit from it.
But there was also the ring night.
"Beautiful, successful and funny," found the two 33-year-olds.
But not everyone's business.
Maybe Daniel Büttner is also not a prominent fan of events evenings: "You can't do it all right now."
And with an event, I always speak only to those who are interested in the special event.
That is why events will be the exception with us.
"We want to disrupt the very normal operation as little as possible".
If they say, "Déjà Vu also stands for reliability."
With regard to the quality of the products offered here, as well as the team and the beautiful environment at the stake in Kleve.
The road, which develops more and more into a gastronomy enamel.
To the delight of many climbers, the guests from close and far, and the students who discover the gastromiles and thus also the Café Déjà Vu for themselves.

A Day of Thanksgiving at MGV in Dinker
It was the 165th Foundation Festival to which the MGV "Friedrich Wilhelm Dinker" invited this year and 52 guests, active singers and their wives, were pleased to come.
In the conference hall of the "Whiteborg" guesthouse in Dinker, all enjoyed the harmonious unity in the sign of the music.
Traditionally, the foundation festival is always the right festivety to undertake funerals.
About the special award "Singer of the Year" this time, author Rolf Wagener was pleased.
"You have not only written down much for us, but you have also turned so many rounds for us, for our heartfelt gratitude," said the president of the Chores Erich Schlotmann.
This year, the awards for participation in the performances and choir samples were awarded to the choir leader Dieter Schulze with 44 participants, followed by the honorary president Horst Pier-Ribbert, the president himself, and the last year's "Songer of the Year" Friedrich Winkler with 42 participants.
Place five notenwarts founded Artur Brückner.
A special thank you the board directed to the team of Verinswirtin Ange Pier-Ribbert, who once again had a menu of the extra class and Gerda Pier-Ribbert for the table decoration.
The MGV "Friedrich-Wilhelm" meets with its regular chorus every day at 7.45 p.m. in the club hall.
"New singing voices are welcome to us at any time," says Schlotmann.
UN announces new objectives in the fight against poverty
The United Nations will begin immediately with the development of a series of new objectives to replace the Millennium Development Goals announced 12 years ago to combat poverty.
In front of the UN Summit on Sustainable Development, which began in Rio de Janeiro in the evening, Australian diplomats played a key role in replacing the Millennium Development Goals in 2015.
They were included in the final draft of the document adopted by world political leaders, including Mrs Gillard, at the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon stated on the summit at night that the time had come to "consider the national interests".
"I am pleased that the Member States have agreed to engage in a process to agree with the universal, sustainable development objectives," he said.
"These objectives will be built on our progress in the Millennium Development Goals and will form an integral part of the post-2015 Framework for Development.
I will not fail to implement this mandate given to me by the Member States in order to achieve our vision of sustainable development goals which build on the success of the Millennium Goals."
Even if the SG Achim/Baden has been out of the game for four days, the handball team still has a good mood.
There is no doubt about it, Coach Tomaz Malmon.
All are still fully motivated in the matter.
However, I hope that we will finally win again.
"Because I don't know how a victory tastes any more," Malmon expects a success from his team at VfL Fredenbeck II.
Even if the third-party reserve from Fredenbeck has not yet grown trees, Malmon has in advance warned the sign finger.
I've trained many players myself in the A-youth.
Therefore, they will certainly be particularly motivated against their ex-Coach.
"In addition, it is to be expected whether there is a reinforcement from the first," explains the SG coach.
To finally return to the track of success, the Malmon team needs to increase in any case compared to the past performances.
But in the last few days, it was violent in all things in the coverwork and in the switch game.
The use of opportunities must definitely be improved as well.
That's why I hope my players have finally got their head off during the short break.
Security concerns in Mozambique are growing in view of conflicts between influential individuals
Thousands of people gathered in the center of Maputos under the growing eyes of the statue of Samora Machel, the founder of the state and the first president of Mozambique to agree to a rare public demonstration of peace.
"We want peace again, we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, managing director of an investment company.
In fear of the future of the country, she exchanged her business clothes against a T-shirt with the label "We Request Security" in Portuguese and joined the majority on Thursday on the capital's independence site.
For two weeks there have been reports of conflicts between government forces and Renamo, which have been among the worst fights since the Peace Agreement over 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement, which was initially supported by the white Rhodesia and later by the South Africa apartheid government in its efforts to destabilise the independent government of the country.
After the 1992 Peace Treaty, she became an opposition party.
Analysts consider it unlikely that the country will return to an adult conflict, but the latest events have troubled foreign investors and domestics.
For the fast-growing economy, much is at stake, because the discovery of huge gas deposits from the coast and coal warehouses in the north-west could bring investment of over 50 billion US dollars from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the United States in the coming years.
The ruling Frelimo party, since 1975 the dominant force, and Renamo, each other, blame themselves for the tensions.
Renamo claims that the government has provoked the recent conflicts by attacking its members in the province of Sofala on 17 October, a traditional Hochburg Renamos.
The attacks on the previous rebels were escalated, as government troops attacked and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the group's leader, Renamos spoke against the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for the clashes and accuses the organization of having attacked soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has tried to raise concerns about instability.
Against the AFP, the French news agency, he said on Wednesday that Dhlakama considered himself a "lost" who wants to use "all his remaining forces to prove that he can enforce his decisions on the government".
Both Frelimo and Renamo stress that they want to avoid war.
But the concerns have increased since Mazanga was quoted with the words, Renamo came up with the 1992 Peace Agreement.
Against the FT, he explained that he felt that Frelimo no longer respected the agreement.
"Our vision is to resume negotiations, but seriously," Mazanga said.
Previous discussions between the parties have only contributed to the continuation of the tensions caused by a number of conflicts this year.
"We have two grown men here (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who are meeting their heads," says Joseph Hanlon, a professor at the Open University and Mozambique-Expert.
None of them is good at trading, and none is ready to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, who insists on electoral reforms, has already explained that they will boycott the municipal elections in November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of violence as an attempt to disrupt the movement to obtain concessions and financial benefits from the government.
Renamos elections have collapsed since 1992, while a new party, founded by a former Renamo member, Movimento Democratico de Mozambique (MDM), is likely to improve in the elections.
Mazanga claims that Guebuza – his resignation, when his second term of office ends next year – wants to destroy the country's democracy.
"He does not want multi-party democracy, he does not want transparent elections, he does not want peace because he does not want to give up the presidency," said Mazanga.
It is unclear which capacity Renamo has, but it has undertaken unrestful attacks on police stations and vehicles on an important North-South link.
Most of the battles took place in the province of Sofala, which is a few hundred kilometres north of Maputo, but where Beira is located, the port, the mining companies such as Rio Tinto and Vale used to export coal.
In June, Rio interrupted the use of the railway for a month after Renamo had announced an attack on the road.
Mazanga kept answering the question whether Renamo would repeat this threat.
Renamo wanted to "warn the international community that things in Mozambique are not good," Mazanga said.
The instability has increased frustration over the government, says Fernando Lima, head of Mediacoop, an independent media company, because many people have already taken care of themselves because of corruption, the declining progress in development and a recent wave of decommissioning.
"People think that the government and the president are responsible for the future of the country, and he should be the one who finds solutions to the problems," he explains.
Omar Sultane, a demonstrator, said the people just wanted stability.
"No one is interested in Renamo and Frelimo, they just want peace again and useful roads," he explained.
Children should receive myths and legends as "prescriptions for life", says one author.
Thor's stories showed that "brutal power has no chance against clevere tricks", and the Arthur legend demonstrates how important it is to have a dream.
Many of the myths, however, were "too wild, too aggressive and, in some cases, too dirty to be taught to schools", therefore Crossley-Holland boasted of a "careful selection" of older works.
"I find it wonderful that in America myths and folklore are already part of education," he said.
I have proposed this as a plan for the past twenty years.
He added, in the case of authors and teachers who are "over-distantly didactic", children would be "completely switched off", because in entertaining stories the messages would be "depressive".
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from the English language and was author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myths and the British Folk Tales, said: "You can pursue certain intentions, but you should keep them in the background as much as possible."
Perhaps the greatest difference between an adult author who writes for adults and an author who writes for children is the need to convey hope.
Not everything needs to be simplified or lead to the happy end, but there is an immanent sense of good and evil.
This must be subversive, revealed by history and not explained.
That's the old story of the show instead of telling.
Hansjab pulls again in Freihof
100 years ago, Heinrich Hansjab visited his old retirement home in Haslach, and on Sunday his last years were alive in the "Freihof".
Many spectators were thrilled by the very short-term scene.
From the arrival on the award of citizenship until his death, the spinbook author and Hansjaobobstor Alois Kraftzczyk had designed a entertaining piece that got a lot of hits under Cornelia Volk's control.
Marcus Zagermann took the audience as a speaker with the ten different scenes, explained relationships and interrupted time spans from the youth to the approaching retirement.
On October 22, 1913, Hansjab comes home to his children's sky, in his home.
And then the scene started, in which Alois Krafczyk once shined more in his parade than the great son of the city.
Stilächt introduced Erich Becherer from Mühlenbach with the twin arms and "Schwarzwälder Föchsen".
He was not only welcomed by the audience with a lot of applause, but also his sister, Philippine, welcomed him.
Billy Sum-Hermann understood it incredibly well to move into the sister's role and give her unhappily life in Mimik and Gestik.
The Mühlenbacher Farms played selected pieces of music and thus finished the performance.
For the award of the honorary rank, Haslachs Mayor Heinz Winkler was given the honor that he and a part of the City Council, in the presence of the then official Hattich.
Their expectation then led the Divegenig-singer who caused Hansjab to cry out: "But how beautiful, there will again be young women living at my own Divegenig time".
With their song "O Jesulein" they enjoyed the audience in the outdoors as well as the great day children with their famous "Heraus, Out".
His criticism at the office church had been just as well as his concerns about the growth in agriculture, the consequences of industrialization or the effects of the war.
In the homeyard, behind his tomb chapel on the fire at Hofstetten, he found his resting place.
"A restless spirit had finally found its rest and had gone home forever," it was said at the end of the scene.
There was a lot of applause and many praising words from the audience for the performance.
basketball: The hope of Neckar giants grows
The chances of the remaining leagues of the sport-deposited Ludwigsburger Bundesliga-Basketballer have increased.
Because there should be a Wildcard procedure, then there is now less a competitor for the Neckar giants.
The basketball project Hamburg Towers leaves on an application for a possible back seat.
"We are not going to participate in the Wildcard process," said former national player Pascal Roller, who has been designing the concept for a professional club in Hansestadt since 2012.
A first blow was still not to be understood from Ludwigsburg.
"We did not deal with the Wildcard procedure, so long as it has not been established that Düsseldorf is not licensed," said Neckar-Riesen-Boss Alexander Reil of our newspaper.
Until May 23rd, climber Düsseldorf Baskets may submit documents to the arbitration panel and prove its economic integrity.
Until now, however, the Rhine countries have been denied the license twice.
The divorce court is the last instance.
Haigerloch: The evening meal church returns to the point of view
As a contribution from the city to the 150th anniversary of the Evangelical Church in Haigerloch, the city’s cultural and tourism office devoted the last of its public theme tours on Sunday, October 27, the evening meal church.
After the visit of the Atomic Keller Museum, the Haigerlocher period after 1850 was considered when Haigerloch came under Prussian rule.
The final point is a visit to the evening meal church.
There the leaders learn the history of the building of the church and gain insight into the development of the evangelistic community in one through and through Catholic territory.
Not least in the church is the view of the evening meal created by Friedrich Schüz with the support of Walter Kröll and Georg Halbritter.
It's an organic-trusted reproduction of the famous Milanese model by Leonardo da Vinci.
The meeting point for the second half-hour tour is at 3 p.m. at the Atomic Keller Museum.
There are maps on the box of the Atomic Keller Museum.
For questions and information, the Tourist Office of the city of Haigerloch is available.
Snowden could also say in Russia
The former U.S. intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in his Russian asylum in the U.S. military affair.
Representatives of the Federal Public Prosecutor's Office could either ask questions in writing or meet in Russia personally at the age of 30.
This was reported by the Agency Interfax on a call to non-closely named circles that are familiar with the situation.
Such a question could be explained intergovernmentally, it was called.
A snow trip from Russia is practically excluded.
"In this case he loses his refugee status," the agency quoted her source.
Because Germany was the United States allies, threatened snowden there the delivery, it continued
Longer Spirit Pays
Six men's teams fought for the winner's title at the tennis tournament.
In the end, the duration of the Maier/Bronner team decided the last match.
A dream weather had received the tennis department of the sports friend Rohrdorf to the tournament of local associations and friends.
The fun of tennis was in the foreground of the tournament.
There were five games per team on the plan, each playing against everyone.
It was played in double mode with a long set of up to nine points or a maximum of 45 minutes duration.
Anja Schlichter leads the tournament
The tournament was in the right hands of Anja Schlichter, supported by Carmen Müller and Inga Kronemeyer.
After the first three games and a lunch break with Pasta, the tournament went into the decisive phase.
The favorites Andre Maier/Matthias Bronner were the same as Michael Klippel and Sadmin Osmicic (both teams of the SG tubeweiler), so the last two matches had to make the decision.
At the victory victory, Carmen Müller was finally able to deliver the hiking pool to Andre Maier/Matthias Bronner, who had the longest breath on the finish line.
The second place was the double Michael Klippel/Sadmin Osmicic.
The bronze stairs reached Rainer and Bernd Maier of the Asphaltriecher team.
At late afternoon sun and coffee and cakes the successful sound of the tournament took place.
On the last weekend of August, the Schwarzwälder Freilichtmuseum Vogtsbauerhof in Gutach is still in children's hand.
Traditionally, the museum welcomes visitors on Saturday and Sunday, 24 and 25 August, as part of the summer holiday program, to a colourful children's and family festival with numerous co-sponsorships and events.

In a New Zealand city, Burt Muro is regarded as a loving cauz because he took part in a race in America with his motorcycle, the 1920s.
Burt is not to be removed from his dream in spite of a heart error.
With his spare parts, a few donations and a mortgage on his old workshops, he transfers by ship to Los Angeles.
After the film there is coffee, tea and cakes.
Schrille's pipsen disturbs residents
Rhenus Midgard has also invested heavily in the country.
They distribute the coal coming from the ships to the shelf.
The company has just as many irons in the fire at the site.
In addition to the coal import, Rhenus Midgard places on wind power logistics among other things.
Black smears the coal on the storage site in front of the deck.
Two powerful blue holder and back-up devices distribute or download the coal here as required.
With each movement of the translucent devices, a sharp warning noise is blowing over the ground.
"The signals serve safety and are legally prescribed," says Matthias Schrell, Managing Director of the Rhine Midgard in Wilhelmhaven.
Unfortunately, in the case of an unfavourable wind, there were already some complaints from people from the north of the city.
He took the complaints very seriously and therefore contacted the affected, says the 40-year-old.
In close consultation with the authorities, it is now easier to keep the warning signals with technical measures.
In the future, he will also focus on the open dialogue with his neighbors.
Because Matthias Schrell has a few more in front of the site.
With the expansion of the Lower Saxony bridge, Rhenus Midgard continues to place coal imports for power plants and is in this sector one of the largest in Europe.
Thanks to the 18.5 meters-wide cable terminal, capesize-bulk carriers can be manufactured here for a long time.
"In this year we want to knock the 3 million-tonnes brand on the round," said Schrell.
In addition to the eon power plant on site, the import coal goes to power plants in the interior.
If the GDF-Suez power plant is still on the net, good 5 million tonnes of carbon imports per year are realistic.
The three shiploads on the bridge and the second transport band could create up to 10 million.
Bayern basketballer despite first defeat optimistic
Even the first defeat in the Euroleague was not able to silence the huge optimism among the basketball players in FC Bayern Munich.
"No one can forbid us from believing in it, even against the best team in Europe in the past two years," Bayern-Coach Svetislav Pesic balanced after the unfortunate 83:88 (39:47) on Thursday evening at the titled Olympiakos Piraeus.
We sent the message: Even in Munich basketball exists!
At their first third appearance in the European royal class, the Munichs sold very well for a long time, but in the decisive stages they simply did not explain enough.
The guests first created the art piece to turn a 15-point-back position 13 minutes before the end to a lead before Piraeus gave the game a turn again.
"We have fought incredibly back against the two-time Euroleague champion, but then made some minor mistakes again," said Bayern-Profi Yassin Idbihi.
We are proud of our performance, but we want to win every game.
Malcolm Delaney and Nihad Djedovic were the most successful broadcasters of the Munich, who had celebrated a significant victory in the first two parties against the Italian serial champion Montepaschi Siena and the Polish titler Zeliaona Góra.
Ben Greenman: Ten Years New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
It could be said that New York City is the birthplace of Stand-up Comedy in America: Almost a hundred years ago, the Variety Artist Frank Fay, who worked as a lecturer at the Palace Theatre on Broadway to tell the lot of jokes directly in the form of a conversation.
Over the years Fays Innovation has been expanded, just as it has recently been at the New York Comedy Festival.
In life, called and led by Caroline Hirsch, founder of the standing-up institution Carolines, this year the festival celebrates its ten-year anniversary with more than sixty shows in small clubs and large theaters.
“Most of these leaders started at Caroline’s and then became more and more successful until they were ever known to be in a club,” Hirsch said.
We have designed this festival so that we can continue working with them.
At this year's event, there are performances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher as well as by “Stand Up for Heroes”, an annual music and comedy well-being event for army veterans in Madison Square Garden, where Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby took place.
With the festival, the world of Comedy has also grown.
A series of comedians participating this year at the festival have become more unconventional, such as broadcasts on smaller television channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll was known with a seatcom on cable TV (the ironic-character fantasy football series "The League" on FXX) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was part of the crew at "Saturday Night Live" as well as at "Parks and Recreation", although she was the best known for her viral video series "Marcel the Shell with Shoes On".
Both Kroll and Slate and other young comedians with characteristic voices (the surreal pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic, focused on race themes) are products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
Among the greatest visitors to the festival is an interview: David Steinberg talks to Larry David.
Steinberg started as a stand-up comedian, but has developed into a prominent television and film director as well as an informal comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he moderated a television broadcast entitled "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg" on TV land.
The meeting will take place in the Town Hall in the middle of Manhattan.
"The city is definitely in the comedy DNA of Larry's entire work," said Steinberg.
He told me when he's here, then sometimes he goes through the gas between two buildings and thinks: hey, if I lose my whole money, maybe I live here.
Iran satisfied with the process of nuclear negotiations
Iran is satisfied with the negotiation process one week before the next nuclear meeting with the five UN and Germany.
"After years you now have an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Authority to clear the differences over the past few years," Foreign Minister Mohammed Dschawad Sarif wrote on his Facebook page.
It would be a long way to go, but the nuclear dealer would be satisfied with the negotiation process and also optimistic that at the end of the two sides would come to a solution.
Drama in Uruguay: Boys Killed Games with Machete
Two children have committed the murder of an 11-year-old in Uruguay.
The two 14 and 12-year-old boys had invited their victims to go on a bird hunt with them.
With Mackenzie and Messers armed, they surprised the 11-year-old on Tuesday and threw the corpse into a well, reported the newspaper "El País" on Thursday.
Then they would have played in a work district at football before their apartments.
The Leichnam was discovered the following night in the village of Cerro Pelado, 15 kilometres north of the exclusive beach Punta del Este.
As an alibi, a five - year - old half - year - old sister of the youth who had taken her was sexually assaulted by the boy.
But when the girl in front of the police described the tathering without mentioning an attack against them, the two boys added the intentional murder of the 11-year-old.
As a reason, the elders called, among other things, a rivalry in the football game.
He was temporarily delivered to a psychiatric juvenile hospital.
Containers must be in prison
Due to outsourced human trafficking, detention, threat, injury and dangerous bodily injury, the Landgericht Konstanz sentenced a 33-year-old man from St. Georgen to three and a half years in prison.
The former German defence soldier, who worked as a doorkeeper after two arrests in Afghanistan, filed a hearing during a trial hearing.
Then in five cases he met women about Internet or telephone contacts, which he sent to the strike after a few weeks against her will.
He resisted to break up with violence and threats.
The women's incomes, which were partly paid for for him for years, were retained.
By confiscating phones and SIM cards, he has been in contact with women to the outside world.
Together with a colleague from the women, he brought them to different Bordelles in the south-west.
There he partially monitored them to control their revenue.
First of all, the accused claimed that he suffered from a severe trauma after colleagues in Afghanistan had come to him in an explosion.
After a psychiatric expert raised serious doubts about the psychological restriction and thus reduced guilt, the 33-year-old left a wide range of opinions.
The Court no longer had to deal with the injured women.
As reported by a Krypo official, at least four further cases of outsourcing of human trafficking could be identified after a first display of telephone surveillance measures.
The discussions were marked by high aggression.
In later admissions, the injured had confirmed their martyrdom.
Another witness, where one of the women had discovered blue spots all over the body, has not made a statement to date.
It is "a completely broken personality", the violence and exploitation in this metary is viewed as normal.
The defendant regretted his conduct yesterday.
"He has rid himself of these circles and wants to lead a very normal life after the prison," he said.
Oil prices continue to be up to 96 USD per barrel
The oil price was also dropped on Friday, after worrying about a high offer, a report was passed, increasing the energy-intensive manufacturing sector in China.
The reference oil varieties for deliveries in December in Europe in the late morning in electronic commerce at the New York Mercantile Exchange fell by 14 cent to USD 96.24 per barrel.
The contract fell by 39 cents on Thursday, which meant a price drop of 5.8 percent in October.
The large supply of crude oil has weighed the prices in the past few weeks.
The US Ministry of Energy said on Wednesday that the US offer increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over five weeks, the offer increased by 25 million barrels.
However, on Friday there was evidence of increased demand by two reports on an increase in activity in Chinese production.
This indicates a continued recovery of the Chinese economy, whose growth rose to 7.8 per cent in the third quarter after it reached its lowest level in the previous quarter for two decades.
Raw oil from the kind of Brent, a reference value for international crude oil, also used by US refineries, fell at ICE Exchange in London at 26 cents to 108.58 USD per barrel.
Court Blocked Decision on the NYPD Stop-and-Frisk Directive
On Thursday, a U.S. Federal Court of Appeal blocked the order of a judge who had demanded changes in the Stop-and-Frisk Program (“Stop and Search”) of the New York Police Department, and removed the judge from the case.
The 2nd U.S. Court of Appeal stated that the decisions of Judge Shira Scheindlin would be suspended until a call was made to the city.
The judge had decided in August that the city would violate the Constitution in the manner in which the programme for the detention and questioning of persons would be implemented.
The city called against its assessment and the planned relief measures, including the decision to set up a monitoring centre to support the police in amending their directive and the relevant training programme.
On Tuesday, the Court of Appeal heard the arguments for the requested suspension.
The appeal report stated that the judge had to be removed from the case as it had violated the Code of Conduct for US judges by stating that a judge should avoid the view of the party; this was partly justified by a number of media interviews and public statements in which he had responded to the criticism of the court.
The judge had ruled that police officers violated the citizens' rights of tens of thousands of people, because they were targeted in an unmistakable way by black and Latin American men with the stop-and-risk program.
It appointed an external body to monitor the implementation of major changes, including reforms in directives, training and service supervision, and arranged a pilot programme with cameras worn by the body in quarters in which most controls were carried out.
In August, the city of New York was prepared to end the practice of storing names and addresses of persons released after a police check.
An oral debate on the occupation of the city is scheduled after 14 March 2014.
The Stop-and-Frisk tactics were criticised by a number of citizens' rights defenders.
Controls of this type have been in various forms for decades, but the number of controls recorded increased during the time of partial mayor Michael Bloomberg at an all-time high of 684.330 in 2011, most of them black and Latin American men.
In 2004, four men, who belonged to all minorities, filed a complaint that developed into a collective complaint.
Supporters of changes to the NYPD's Stop-and-F risk program say the changes will end unfair practices and create a more reliable and effective police and influence the way other police presidents use the regime.
They are opposed to the view that the changes would dampen the morale of the police, but not the crime; also, money would be wasted and the wider problem of a police officer, which, after the fall of thousands of places in the last decade, was under pressure.
The judge pointed out that it did not end the Stop-and-Frisk practice, which was constitutional, but only reform the way the controls were implemented by NYPD.
The Happiness of the Dreaming Camel
Good luck is an oasis that can only reach dreaming camels
With this concern, the first president, Wolfgang Henne, described the history and fascination of the association "Helping Hands".
On Saturday morning, the tenth birthday of the association was celebrated, which can already have remarkable success.
The first president, Henne, reported in detail on the work of the association.
He himself was the first in 2004 in Mauritania in the Cheijk-Zajed hospital in Nouakchott.
As a result, another cooperation developed, and Gynecologist Henne carried out numerous operations on the spot on several trips.
During the talks, pictures were shown from the posts on a large canvas so that the guests of the anniversary event could take a picture of the said actions.
The desert vehicle of the association was also shown.
It is a former federal border guard vehicle.
Rainer Prewo, the former OB of Nagold, had made the proposal to provide this vehicle with a photovoltaic plant and now plans, according to Henne, to become active at the association in advisory function.
In 2008, the Schleeh room from Baiersbronn created the hospital in Socogim, a district of distress on the edge of the capital, in the record time of almost one week.
She also mentioned a new mother child hospital in Nouakchott
Especially interesting in times in which birth clinics in Nagold are to be removed.
You learn a lot in Africa as a doctor, so is Henne, for example, deceleration against burn-out.
Because of the political unrest in the country, it was not possible to take as many trips as planned, but for this many doctors came to Germany to hospital in various areas.
In addition, containers with materials are regularly sent to Africa, so in March of this year medical devices, medications, association materials, hospital beds and glasses.
Mitinitator Hans-Joachim Fuchtel himself delivered a lot of local color by telling from Mauritania about Mercedes vehicles built on the mobile track and the experiences of the family musicians, who traditionally supported the association, during their Mauritanian journey.
As his personal motivation, he called his work in the field of auditing as a young MP.
When it became clear to him how much money was lost on the way, he decided to help Africans control a budget by the people.
Fuchtel also stressed that the global economy also requires global human love.
It should also not be forgotten that Africa is closer than some think.
It wasn't far from Gran Canaria to Africa.
Coulson set up phone hacking to check a tip
The previous news of the Word editor Andy Coulson allegedly introduced "telephone hacking, monitoring and confrontation" in an attempt to confirm a false tip about an affair of the then Interior Minister Charles Clarke.
State attorney Andrew Edis QC explained to the court in Old Bailey, news of the World in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with his "attractive special advisor" Hannah Pawlby.
The newspaper commissioned private detective Glenn Mulcaire to hack Pawlby's Voicemails, and persecuted them, but Coulson also called them and left them messages as the court experienced.
“In the opinion of the Public Prosecutor, Coulson, who is now the publisher of the NotW, is no one who stands before people’s apartment and hopes to meet them in a fresh way, but one who is willing to face a story to see their reaction,” Edis explained.
He said notW uses three methods to investigate stories: phone hacking, monitoring and confrontation.
The publisher is personally involved in the third method.
Obviously, he knows from the second, the surveillance, otherwise it can not be.
What about the first one?
Does he know about the phone hacking message?
He argues about it, but we say, "And if he knew about it."
Sounds about an affair Clarkes were first picked up by the feature editor of NotW, when a source that was sexually interested in Pawlby was said: "Don't waste your time, she's with Charles."
A band with voicemails from their phone from at least three occasions was secured in August 2006 in Mulcaires apartment.
The investigators also found entries on the computer of the detective, on whom Pawlby and her sister were saved as "projects".
At the time when the researchers lived, the grandparents of Pawlby received anonymous calls in which they were asked for information about them, Edis explained.
Meanwhile, former Chefreporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup supervised the monitoring of Pawlby's movements.
On June 18, 2005, Coulson left her a voicemail with the following content: “I have a story that we want to bring out tomorrow, which I want to talk to Charles about.”
Edis explained that Coulson's activities in this story followed the same pattern as in other important personalities, such as former Interior Minister David Blancett.
The swearers heard on Thursday that Coulson Blunkett had faced an affair with a married woman when he himself was engaged to the co-conspirator Rebekah Brooks who had been married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks argue to have sworn to hack telephones between 3 October 2000 and 9 August 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have added the phone hacking.
In protest against the planned tax, the French football will actually be the first strike since 1972.
A sneezing meeting is unavoidably over.
In the conflict with wealth tax, the government and the professional football in France have maneuvered themselves after a broken slurry meeting in a bag gas.
President François Hollande received their complaints on Thursday at the Paris-Elysée-Palast.
However, he refused to release the football from the planned 75-percent payment of more than one million euros per year to all companies in the country for two years from 2014.
The opposite also remained hearty.
The strike announced at the end of November will also be passed, the Chief of the Association of Professional Clubs (UCPF), Jean-Pierre Louvel, shared.
The game days set between 29 November and 2 December in the Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 therefore fall.
Gears: No absolute protection possible
"We want to involve the inhabitants early in planning," Mayor Jens Häßler opened the Citizens Information Event on the concept of high water protection in Gechingen.
About 80 participants came to the community hall to explain the measures planned, ask questions, raise concerns, and introduce ideas.
Hüßler made it clear: "The final decisions fall on the members of the municipality".
The high water, the gechingen on 15 May 2009, was unprepared, was an intrusive event that raised the question of protection measures for the future, as Häßler.
A river area survey was commissioned with the neighboring municipality Aidlingen, which is now the basis for the high water protection concept in Gechingen.
"The protection of many cultivated plots as much as possible is the goal," says Häustler.
For this reason, planning the protection against a German weather service is expected to be high water for every 100 years.
Climate change is accounted for by a 15-percent grant.
This is called "HQ 100aKlima".
The water masses that led to significant damage in 2009 in gechingen corresponded to a 1000-year-old high water.
"There is no absolute protection, but a relative improvement can be achieved," said Hüßler.
In order to achieve the protection of HQ 100aKlima, about four million euros must be invested in Gechingen, with the municipality with land grants of about 70 per cent.
However, the House pointed out that there is only support when a general concept is implemented.
For this reason, the community is focused on the involvement of the citizens.
An extensive planning and approval procedure should be completed.
In the best case, 2016 could be started with implementation.
Among other things, the concept of protection, which was already presented in the municipal council last week (we reported) provides for local measures in addition to the Irm River from the tribal valley.
Following the presentation of the concept of high water protection, the participants took advantage of the opportunity to raise their concerns.
Among other things, it was asked why no more dams and reservoirs were planned to protect the site.
Gregor Kühn, the master planner of the commissioned engineering office, Wood and Corbe from Hügelsheim, who presented the concept, stressed that the combination of all the measures presented is needed to achieve the desired goal in the sum.
In addition, it is kept to find the most economical solution, says Joachim Forest of Forest and Corbe.
Immortality prevailed among the people of the old place who, even in normal winter rains, have suffered again and again under an overload of the canal network.
The problem is known to the administration and the first measures have already been taken.
However, the House pointed out that the guidelines for channel systems should be different from those for water protection and should not be mixed.
The municipality is obliged to release the channel network so that two to three-year-old rainstorms can be exacerbated.
To scale the drain channels larger, millions would collapse.
Severely injured after collapse
On the early Friday morning, on the road 44 near Revensdorf, two drivers were seriously injured in a frontal collision.
The police immediately stopped the road completely, but could say little about the accident.
However, there are various witnesses that should be assessed first.
The 19-year-old Lenkerin of a VW Golf ran towards Revensdorf and the 38-year-old man from Gettorf opposed her with his Hyundai.
Both vehicles were going together, while the woman was so heavily stuck that the firefight took almost half an hour to free them from the vehicle wreck.
The real cause of the accident was not explained at first.
Both accidents occurred in nearby hospitals.
The route remained fully closed for about two hours.
You could call him Dostojewski, U.S.A.
Philip K. Dick was a searcher, a metaphysicist, his novels and stories also have something serious.
Fascinating the relationship on the outside: the piercing eyes, the bart, the high stars.
And just as Fjodor M. Dostojewski and his massive Oeuvre are to be understood as the founder and apologist of the Russian soul, Philip K. Dick is read as an American prophet, who is totally in his own country.
Some titles have appeared in the Heyne edition, the Haffmans case with the 118 stories distributes Second millenniums.
Dick explains America - the realm of amazing technical progress, accompanied by Paranoia, security guards and the faith, to be chosen.
Dick had divine experiences, his late books read as a mixture from the revelation of John and a computer manual.
Maybe he was crazy, he had drugs added to his brain.
He's got it, early on, that the computers are divinity.
He wrote a computer theology and asked what a person differs from a machine, the Creator from his Creator.
That's the "Blade Runner" problem.
Kill it.
A master of Science Fiction.
A fantastic writer.
His stories inspired film directors like Ridley Scott, Paul Verhoeven and Steven Spielberg.
This story is particularly significant now.
The "Minority Report" comes from 1956, it flows the smell of the Cold War and the McCarthy Tribunal.
The principle of "pre-crime" is developed here, "pre-crime", which is what is now more or less official doctrine of the White House.
In Dick's world, which is as scary as ours, the mutants look to the future - and the police.
"We include individuals who have violated no law," says the head of the authority.
"We'll catch them before they commit a crime of violence."
And, "There are no serious criminals in our society, so we have a criminal criminal who is full of people." You read the stream of time.
They assume that bad things happen, and prevent the criminal idea from being put into practice.
Dick's story works like the blue break for the anti-terror laws and the hearing of the NSA.
Anticipation of attack: Obama's Drone Philosophy and Practice also works.
But Dick's story isn't over yet.
The police officer complains that there is no more violence, the military controls daily - and what is left of the state.
Then the watchman himself will be monitored and a future crime will be committed.
The system's going through.
It's perfect, but it's lying.
It finds its own requirements.
Not only does he take wrong people and victims in purchases, but he builds on it.
The system creates the danger it fights.
Philip K. Dick says to get closer to the truth all the time.
Talking business about Merkel in Russia
The former U.S. intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in his Russian asylum case in the U.S. case about Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Representatives of the German Federal Court could either ask in writing questions or meet in person at the age of 30 in Russia, Interfax said.
Previously, the Greens-Bundagsagsagitt Hans-Christian Ströbele met yesterday as the first German politician Snowden in Moscow to talk to him about the affair.
NSA findings strengthen company paranoia due to state surveillance
On a mild day at the end of August, a German police raider flew deep over the US Consulate in Frankfurt am Main, Germany's capital.
At the request of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution and the fight against terrorism (BVT), the German Home Office, he should photograph the roof of the US external post, which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Federal Bank.
According to German media, the BVT wanted to prove the presence of surveillance antennas and the action led to a verbal exchange between the US and the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Berlin.
In September, James Clapper, U.S. Director of National Intelligence, reiterated that the United States did not use the possibility of foreign espionage "to steal the business secrets of foreign companies on behalf of US companies so that they could enhance their international competitiveness or their profits."
However, since Edward Snowden, who became a single employee of the Whistleblower, with the publication of his full horn in U.S. surveillance secrets, European governments and business leaders are no longer confident that they can take the Director by word.
Reports from which the American National Security Agency spyed on Brazilian oil company Petrobas and obtained data from American cloud providers including Google and Yahoo have brought company paranoia to a new peak due to state surveillance.
The fact that she had been on the phone for over ten years brought the revelation that Chancellor Angela Merkels had been on the phone.
If the most powerful person in Europe can become a visionary, then business leaders are certainly also potential targets.
Snowden has made the intensive cooperation between US web services and companies transparent.
I believe that this data is likely to be used for mutual benefit.
"Germany needs to wake up," explains Oliver Green, president of BITMI, who represents small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
German companies believe that the United States is now at almost as high a risk as China, when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, a survey published by the EY consultant company in July.
However, there has been no evidence in Snowden's documents that the US has disclosed the business secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians have expressed concern that the EU lacks certain IT and Internet opportunities and should reduce its dependence on the US.
The companies are skeptical about this.
In the Federal Day, we were proposed to build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly reopen them...
"That's not how it works," says Hasso Plattner, president of the German software manufacturer SAP.
If you wanted a strong European IT industry, you would not have let it die 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidized, from coal over cars to agriculture.
Everything until the IT industry.
However, rich and technical refineries have shocked the US spy authorities that have previously seen the biggest spy risk in China.
The cloud computing is undergoing a major change because European corporate leaders are now aware that data stored in the US are subject to legal proceedings and are therefore potentially at risk.
According to one survey carried out by the Cloud Security Alliance, a trading institution, after the US-American data mining activities with Prism, about 10 percent of the non-U.S. members' plans to use an American provider.
Jim Snabe, Deputy Managing Director of SAP, says: “We see a new question from customers who haven’t been there a year ago – she says: Where will my data be stored and you can guarantee that these are physically staying in this area?”
Many German business leaders represent the view that the latest reports simply confirm what they already knew, namely that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and therefore have to be watched at any price.
Economic espionage is not surprising.
It's always been like that.
"It has been a topic for many years and has not changed fundamentally through the current discussion," says Kurt Bock, president of the chemical company BASF.
The Americans spy on us at a commercial and industrial level, as we do, because it is in the national interest to defend our companies.
The company's management usually does not care about the countermeasures that have been taken, because it benefits attackers.
In large companies, employees have long been inspired to say that taking a free USB stick on a fair or the unguarded location of a laptop in the hotel room is not advisable.
Ulrich Hackenberk, a board member of the Audi automaker, says that it has been a standard practice for years to collect the phones before a board meeting so that they cannot be used as hearing aids.
The German BVT advises executives to use simple prepaid hands when traveling abroad because smartphones may be compromised.
The prepaid hands were then discarded.
However, there is concern that small and medium-sized enterprises remain vulnerable to hacking and monitoring.
In Germany many of these companies are global market leaders in the respective niches.
"Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect business secrets from unauthorised access," the BVT warns in a report.
The US warns its own companies against economic espionage by other countries.
According to Washington Post, in February France, Russia and Israel behind China, two of the countries that served to obtain the economic data of the hacking were classified in the US National Intelligence Estimates.
A member of the board of a German blue-chip company agreed when it comes to economic espionage, then "the French are the worst".
Bernard Squarcini, former head of the French Interior Service DCRL, was quoted this month in an interview with the following words: “The secret services know very well that all countries, even if they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, are spying out their allies.”
Hechingen: The fair provides an answer to wedding questions
"The marriage is the most important discovery that man can undertake," said philosopher Sören Kierkegaard.
Tips, as at least the wedding feast reached, now gave a special show in the domain in Hechingen.
Representatives were important providers around a wedding.
A trend: The retro-look has kept in touch again.
This starts with wedding dressers.
White is must, best covered or in cream.
Before they are often torn and covered with embroidery, often with a veil, on the back they go down their backs and often end up in a trap.
However, the spirits differ, as Stefanie Koch points out from the fashion clothing miller.
In men the suit is dominated by West and Plastron, but it can also be chosen creamy or brown combinations.
Importantly, the selection of the location was explained.
Non-pregnant rooms are not optimal, the environment should be special.
Here the domain paid attention to its own offer in the remix.
Whoever wants to go ahead with the Kutsche, for which Uwe Link has an offer.
"Cusches are also popular for juvenile decisions," he says.
Romantics is also asked for invitation cards, flower arrangements and wedding pictures.
More and more in fashion comes the "After-Wedding-Photo" - that is, series of recordings in special places, preferably such as waterfalls, some days after the feast, but in wedding dress, Elizabeth Keidel explained.
Many more details of a successful wedding were presented in the domain on Sunday.
Flower arrangements, rings, wedding table, cakes and also a charmer, such as Marko Ripperger, the guests can enjoy stylishly.
Don't forget the right cosmetics and nail care.
Everything for an unforgettable party.
Dog friend successfully
Repeatedly, the athletes of the dog friend bitz were successful on a rally-obligence tournament.
Achim Scherrenbacher started in Candel with two dogs; with his dog Sandy, he scored 94 points in the class and secured his fifth place, and with the 15-month-old Marley he brought it to place twelve with 87 points.
Susi Höpp presented himself with her Woody in Class 1 with the critical views of the manager.
Parents of a Georgian teenager who died in a tragic accident believe in murder
The parents of the teenager, whose body was found in a combined ring mat in the tournament of his high school, are convinced that her son was murdered, explained the family's lawyer on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson from Valdosta in the US state of Georgia was found in a matte set up on January 11, which stood behind the tribune in the school hall.
The investigation officers of the sheriff of Lowdes County concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident, but the family of the 17-year-old hesitated.
"They are convinced that their son was murdered," said Benjamin Crump, lawyer of Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, against FoxNews.com.
They never believed he died as the sheriff had concluded.
"They are the view that it removes any logic, violates the laws of physics as well as against the healthy human mind," said Crump.
Rather, they are convinced that the truth will be changed to protect the person or persons responsible for the death of their son.
"Your son went to school and came back in the body bag," he commented.
US attorney Michael Moore said on Thursday that there will be a formal investigation into Johnson's death, as a number of important questions are still unclear.
What was the cause of death?
Is his death due to a crime?
Moore explained this at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I follow the facts in which they lead.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I believe that there is a sufficient basis for formal investigation," he said.
Moore explained to reporters that the initial autopsy indicated that Johnson had died as a result of a "position-conditioned suffocation".
A second autopsy, however, has given rise to another cause of death, such as Moore.
"There are a number of questions that need to be answered or confirmed," he said.
Moore added, if there is sufficient evidence for a criminal or civil investigation into Johnson's death, he will be commissioned by the FBI in carrying out the investigations.
A representative of the county sheriff's authority was not immediately prepared to comment on our request on Thursday.
A court in South Georgia ordered on Wednesday that the authorities should release all surveillance videos that the investigators have checked.
The parents of the teenager said they hoped that the video recordings would indicate how he died.
CDC publishes school allergy guidelines
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a series of guidelines for the treatment of food allergies from children in schools.
These are the first such directives issued by the U.S. government since the number of children with food allergies is increasing.
One of 20 children in the United States currently has a food allergy.
The distribution of food allergies among children has increased by 18 percent, according to CDC between 1997 and 2007.
The guidelines contain information on schools that should raise awareness of food allergies in the body of teachers and employees and how to deal with children showing allergic reactions.
It is also recommended that schools have epinephrine predominate – the auto-injection of the EpiPen brand is used most often – in order to meet a potentially fatal hypersensitivity reaction.
The legislators in the Federal States have recently amended the rules so that schools can keep Epinephrin more easily.
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms called children who have an allergic reaction.
Children may say, "It feels like something pushes on my tongue," "My tongue feels like a hair is on it" or "My tongue crawls".
Parents of intersexual children can choose "unspecified sex"
Germany is the first European nation in which a third generation is recognized for children born with unexplained genitalia.
Newborns are no longer given strong male or female.
According to the new law, parents no longer have to explain sex to such children, but they may indicate "undefined" or "not specified" on birth certificate.
The purpose of the law is to make the pressure of parents so that they do not have to make abandoned decisions regarding operations for a sex assignment in newborns and to combat discrimination against intersexual people.
According to BBC years later, an intersexual person said, "I am neither a man nor a woman."
I remain the girlwork created by doctors, stuttered and full of horrors.
It is estimated that one of 2,000 children comes to the world every year, neither as a boy nor as a girl.
They are among the intersexuals, a group that fall under the diagnosis of "sexual differentiation disorder" (DSD), a collective concept for people with atypical chromosomes, keimdrums (eggs or heads) or unusually developed genitals.
Wallis Simpson may have been intersexual.
The understanding of gender identification is still not very well developed, but most experts in the United States advise that the best available information for gender identification should be used if a provision is not possible, and not waiting for the child's psychological and physical development before deciding, if at all, for an operation.
The New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in the problem of gender identification, said the new German law "sling for a good thing".
Intersexual children represent an ethical dilemma.
"Many people have life-threatening diseases that require surgery, but for most children this is not true," he said.
You can do a sex assignment without surgery and then wait for how the identity develops.
The scientific data on how a child develops its sexual identity are not very accurate.
Nobody knows why it's happening.
It's like the secret, so people are gay.
In a 2011 report to the European Commission, intersexuals are to be distinguished from transsexual or transgender persons, because their status is not sex, but by their biological constitution, which is not only male or female, but typically both at the same time or not clearly defined as one of them.
These characteristics were shown in the following sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, nutrition, breasts and stamina, priority sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals or in chromosome structures and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of the discrimination suffered by intersexual and transgender persons in their working life, as well as the extent of harassment, violence and pre-criminality.
Not according to the gender picture, boys now have a special camp.
In the meantime, it is possible in Australia and Nepal for adults to indicate male, female or "third sex" on official documents.
In June, Australian Norrie May-Welby (52) was recognized as the world's first "unlawful" person after a court had granted the life-long maintenance of a "unestablished" gender status.
In addition to M and W, German exhibits have a third allocation, X for intersexual, so the Ministry of the Interior.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are still controversial, so a message on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of French members of the strict Catholic country signed a petition to remove the "disagreement theory" from school books.
The U.S. Catholic Online has also spoken against the German law, on the grounds: “If the world is destroyed in a new state where the sex represents a decision, but not sexual activity, then we turn two further pillars of civilization.”
The mother of a newborn from Maryland explained to Baby Zone that she would find it better if babies were assigned a gender at birth.
“The parenting system is also stressful enough without any further restrictions, especially if you do not know the family of your own child”, she said to the parent’s website.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children born with both male and female genders were referred to as hermaphrodites, according to the attractive Greek God who had both sexes.
Ten years ago, medicine looked at the sex as something that could be erased and then rebuilt.
In the meantime, however, the ethical foundations of an operation are weakened, once it is now known how complex the sexual identity is, and that doctors can also lie wrong because they do not know how the child feels when growing up with the sex assigned by them.
“In the middle of the 20th century, it was called a “psychiatric emergency”, Drescher said.
When such a child was born, you didn't call the psychiatrist but the surgeons.
The ruling theory about the treatment of children with unexplained genitalia goes back to Dr. John Money from John's Hopkins University, which presents the view that sex can be formed.
He marked the term "sexual identity" and argued, social and environmental attacks – as parents raise a child – interacted with the genes and hormones of a child and expressed whether a person viewed himself as male or female.
However, in a case known as "John/John" from 1966, his theories became controversial.
He screams at the parents of a boy whose penis had been separated by a twisted cutting, to cast the child completely and also to remove his head and then to raise him as a girl.
"Money presented this case as a successful example of a change, but it was not," says Drescher.
When the boy was about 15, he moved back to the male and married a woman.
With 38 but he started suicide.
According to Drescher, there are still doctors who would practice this model.
But in the 1990s, with the introduction of the Internet, survivors of these sex operations have become public, which are "not happy with the result".
For example, at Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old author from Montana, who was born with XY-man chromosomes, but two-dimensional genitals.
The doctors were not aware whether he had a great clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never lead a "satisfying life" as a man.
So his external organ and the hooves were surgically removed shortly after the birth of 1976 and he was raised as a girl.
At the age of 12, he received female hormones.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," he explained to ABCNews.com
I was unhappy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he should receive a vaginal patch.
But since he was depressed and knew that something was wrong, he demanded his medical records.
What he found out was shocking.
I was sterilized at my birth – and no one ever told me that.
Bruce was born with a DSD that did not allow his body to produce enough testosterone to develop the genitals.
After learning the truth, he returned to the male identity, received testosterone injections and allowed his breasts to be removed.
Because of the operation he has become fruitless.
Today, he fights for others in an organization called Interface Project to ensure that intersexual people are perceived as normal.
However, Anne Tamar-Mattis, managing director of the legal group Advocates for Informed Choice based in California, ensures that the German law "can encourage stamping and stigmatization".
“Many activists are concerned that the German decision could encourage parents to make quick decisions and to assign a ‘no’ to the child,” she explained.
We fear that will benefit from the intervention.
We think it would be better to assign the male or female sex and then wait.
But we still don't know how the law works, so we can just speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said that her organization supported the Australian law, because "it allows adults to recognize as third-party".
" Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal sex," she explained.
The German law deals with the allocation at birth.
This is not a fight to which young children should be forced at this time.
When they are grown, they can decide their own body.
However, Dr. Arlene Baratz, a Pittsburgh Brustradiologist, who has a daughter with a sexual differentiation disorder and supports hundreds of others in a self-help group, says the German law "compulsory" both parents and children.
Katie, the daughter of Baratz, was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD called complete androgen resistance.
Due to the receptor deficiency of the target cells for testosterone, Katie developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterine and no egg stick.
Today Katie is 29 and married; she works at the University of Pennsylvania as an employee in child psychiatry.
Although barren, however, she hopes to be able to have a child through adoption or a nursing mother.
"The law gives parents space, so they don't have to make decisions too quickly," Baratz said.
It gives them time to do various tests and clarify things and gives them time before they write "man" or "woman".
In this way everything is fine – you draw the child big and love it.
You have a wonderful baby and enjoy the parental happiness.
And you don't have to do an operation that can't go back.
"This includes children in the decision and eliminates the fear that the parents are driving because they think they would not do the right thing," she explained.
Finally, the child decides on the gender that best suits him – and that is wonderful.
This enables children to make their own decisions.
Unknown injured girls by shooting from car
Unknown ones have injured a 12-year-old in a car shooting in Saxony tank.
On Thursday evening in Genthin, the perpetrators had probably fired an air-pressure weapon on a group of children.
This was shared by the police in Burg.
The girl was easily injured in the left wave.
Rescue forces brought the girl to the hospital.
The shot came from a small car that was passing by on a group of six children and had suddenly stopped.
Witnesses saw two people sitting in the car.
The workers also shot at a bus stop.
A disc broke.
Then they ran away from it.
The criminal police found out, it was called on Friday.
Until now, the police inspection can look back on a quiet Halloween night.
The officials were only called twice to ovulating children, who threw them against the housewives.
Since the houseowners recognized this in time and the eggs were removed immediately, no damage should also be caused.
In addition, some Sylvester beads have been painted in the city area, but also here no damage has occurred.
A resident in the Bishop-Freundorfer road reported that his pkw was mixed with paper and his radio waves were removed.
Until the police arrived, however, the man found his radar blinds in the immediate vicinity of all of them again, so the police did not have to continue to operate.
Living with a future perspective
In fact, Waltraud Ries lives in a dream.
Your house is located in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with a lot of green, an old tree stock, nice neighbors and not much traffic.
In the city there are only a few minutes with public transport.
"Do you hope not to be afraid of spins?" asks Waltrud Ries and shows on a fat spin on the door frame.
I've been looking for a new apartment for my husband and me for a while.
But you know how hard it is in Stuttgart.
However, the reason is not spinnenphobia, but the concern, at age, that the many steps to the house and apartment can no longer be managed, explains it.
In addition: Since a Meniccus operation, the mid-fifty woman in her own body has had to learn what it means to move with the Handicap from Stockwerk to Stockwerk.
Recently, a book from her appeared on the topic 'Happy to live in the age - What kind of housing is the best for me?'.
'Our apartment is the best example of what is not going on at age', she begins to tell.
When she took her husband to the Maisonette apartment more than 20 years ago, it was just a beautiful apartment in the middle of the green.
Today, in mid-50s, Waltraud Ries thinks otherwise.
But she also knows that she belongs to the few people who are at all involved with the theme 'Living in the Age'.
Most people force it as long as it goes.
They'll always be just the others', she says smug.
Only if the pressure of suffering is really great will you think about it.
'But then it can be too late,' says Ries.
In her book, the interior architect presents 17 living models for a self-determinationed living at the age of.
'What form of living you choose, however, is always an individual decision', she explains.
D i e solution does not exist for the age.
Even those who can afford the age-supply in Tuscany or Brittany should always assume that they can also become ill.
And, 'Without good knowledge of the country language, you also join in the Dolce Vita,' gives the book author the pleasure to consider.
Among their models are classic care models, alternative housing forms or the often quoted Rentner-WG.
At the age of everyone has their ticks and hooks
'I don't think so, 'but I don't think so,' she says with a eyebrow.
Not as much as in a student WG with a shared bathroom and a kitchen.
'When you're old, you just need his back spaces', Ries.
However, the author does not want to exclude the fact that a senior housing community can work.
However, this has to go differently than in the classic student WG.
And sometimes you just want his rest, you think.
In this opinion, at least it is not alone in the capital city.
'Most old people in Stuttgart want to stay in their own apartment for so long,' is also the experience of Theresa Rütten, the head of the civil service life at the age of the capital.
Its service advises people around the topic 'Be Older'.
Therefore, just older people would often also purchase discomforts and restrictions just to be able to stay in their usual surroundings, which is also the experience of the Varatest Foundation.
Today there are many ways to make the house or apartment accessible.
Ries recommends that all those who deal with the old-fashioned reconstruction of their home or home should be informed in a thorough manner and not be entrusted with the best crafts.
Today there are also for the old-fashioned conversion specialists.
Even in the apartment, one or the other can be realized, and if it's just the height of the toilet seat, the interior architecture clears up.
But the existing apartment is not always able to be redesigned in the right age and thus accessible, even if it is still so beautiful.
This experience had to be done by Waltrad Ries.
Even if you could install a stairs elevator inside the apartment, the path with stairs would also be a much larger obstacle.
She will continue her search until she has found the ideal object for herself and her husband.
Before the move, it is more rough than the spin on her apartment door.
USA wants to continue to prosecute Snowden
The United States has not changed its attitude towards the former U.S. intelligence officer Edward Snowden.
It will continue to be proposed that secret information should not be disclosed.
Therefore, he had to be a criminal in the United States, the speaker of the U.S. Foreign Ministry, Jennifer Psaki, said in Washington.
Nor would snowden's recent statements change anything.
Previously, the German Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele had appealed to the United States after a meeting with Snowden in Moscow, not to threaten him with punishment.
Psaki stressed that in the case of gruesome statements, it was about one of the parliamentarians and not about one of the German members of the government.
Secret Service Tüller Edward Snowden is generally available for a conversation with German authorities.
First, however, he wants to know his situation clearly.
This was made clear by the former NSA employee sought by the United States in an unaddressed letter published by the Green politician Hans-Christian Ströblee on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and forwarded to the Federal Government, the Federal Day and the Advocate General.
The text has the following wording after a translation of the scrolls:
To the competent authorities
I was asked to write to you about your survey for mass monitoring.
My name was Edward Joseph Snowden and was previously contractually or directly employed as a technical expert at the National Security Agency (NSA), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Defence Intelligence Agency (DIA) of the United States.
In the course of my employment in these institutions, I witnessed systematic violations of the laws of my government, which caused me to act out of a moral obligation.
As a result of the publication of these concerns, I saw myself exposed to a severe and persistent heat that forced me to leave my family and home.
I am currently living in exile and enjoying the long-term asylum granted to me by the Russian Federation in accordance with international law.
I am encouraged by the resonance on my political actions, both in the United States and elsewhere.
Citizens around the world and also high-ranking officials - including the United States - have assessed the findings as a system of comprehensive monitoring, which is not responsible to anyone, as a service to the public.
These espionage discoveries have made many proposals for new laws and directives aimed at the previously hidden abuse of public confidence.
The benefits for the company from these findings are becoming clearer and at the same time the risks incurred were reduced visually.
Although the outcome of my efforts has proved to be positive, my Government still treats this as a breach of trust and seeks to criminalise and prosecute political opinion.
However, to speak the truth is not a crime.
I am confident that the Government of the United States, with the support of the international community, will reject this derogatory attitude.
I hope that, if the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are involved, I will be able to take part in the responsible explanation of the facts regarding the statements made in the media, in particular with regard to the truth and authenticity of the reports, appropriate and lawfully.
I am pleased to have a conversation with you in your country as soon as the situation has been clarified and I thank you for your efforts to uphold international law that protects us all.
Edward Snowden testified by Hans-Christian Ströbele
Children's Gardens Found a Private Buyer
"The building is in good hands," says Mayor Michael Maier of Winterling.
The former kindergarten in the Gartenstraße has sold the municipality to a private person.
The municipal council agreed to the sale at its last meeting in the non-public part.
The building changed its owner to a "remarkable" price.
"The community is satisfied," says Maier.
The budget was EUR 100 000.
It is not yet clear how the new owner wants to use the former kindergarten.
The mayor is right that Winterlingen has handed over the responsibility for the building before winter to someone else, so he doesn't have to come up for the entertainment of the house, how to heat up, look at the garden and take the path.
"This effort is now gone," Maier rejoices.
Place concert at high temperature
The Musikverein Hammerereinbach offers a concert on the terrace of the guest house Hammer.
When conductor Bianca Willmann has the touchstock at 7.30 p.m., the thermometer still shows 25 degrees.
Some 50 listeners are delighted with the sounds of Hammrich musicians.
The chairman Manuela Honeck explains the music.
In this context, Honeck thanked all those who had helped successfully manage the first Musikerhock.
Report: Obama's campaign to replace bids by Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama's closest advisors secretly commissioned Vice-President Joe Biden to replace Hillary Clinton with the New York Times in the 2012 election struggle.
The revelation is the most remarkable surprise of Mark Halperin and John Heilemann's long-awaited work on the 2012 election struggle, "Double Down: Game Change 2012".
The Times provided a copy of the book that was recently published, and she reported on Thursday evening that the president's top advisors had carried out "extensive group meetings and interviews at the end of 2011" to find out whether it would be better to look forward to re-election for Obama if he dropped bids.
According to Jonathan Martin, a national political correspondent of the Times, the book fundamentally draws the history of the efforts of leading campaign and White House employees, namely the former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, to measure the effect it has on the survey values that former Foreign Minister Clinton has on the vice presidents.
The potential change was a strictly protected secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen of the president's closest advisers – including Daley, former campaign leader Obamas, Jim Messina, and former white house leader David Axelrod and David Plouffe – knew about the proposed change.
In 'Double Down' it is claimed that Dalley has stood at the top of the efforts to exchange his 'right, personal relationship' before a decision was finally taken against such a move, after the data showed that the Clinton candidate would not "make the odds of Obama significantly better".
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the government had actually committed to replacing biden by Clinton.
"I expressed a whole series of things that should be considered, and that was one of them," Daley told the magazine.
We must remember that the President had terrible questions at the time, so we thought, "For God's sake, what are we doing?"
While Daley referred to the investigations as "supply care", Martin told CNN’s Anderson Cooper that during the campaign for re-election, considerable effort had been made to find out whether such a train would pay for the elections.
"In campaigns, not so much money will be spent on surveys and focus groups if you don't seriously think about something," Martin told AC360.
However, it is not clear if Obama knew that his team was thinking about an exchange.
Martin told CNN that he had asked Daley whether his then boss would have known about the potential change of decision.
Although Daley said he did not believe that the President of the possible change was "conscious", the former chief of staff said that it was "possible" that Obama knew of it.
Martin added that "Double Down" did not provide a definitive answer to the question whether Obama's political surveys had reached the desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought that Obama knew nothing about the investigations about whether to let bites fall in the elections.
"Possible," said Martin.
What's going on with my e-mail?
E-mail is actually an electronic letter.
Was e-mail similar to that of the original post technically implemented in the design of the Internet service?
The concept of early Internet services was in the forefront of making communication possible.
Therefore, the basic technical protocols did not take into account the need to establish a stable basis for a more secure exchange of letters.
Therefore, a common e-mail is more like an open postcard than a sealed letter.
If the user "Anna" sends a mail to "Benni", are the computers of the two then connected directly?
In the first step, Anna's email program or browser sends the mail to the mail server of her service provider.
For example, if she has a GMail account, it would be Google.
This mail server sends the content to the provider that uses the Benni.
On the route, the mail can run over several other servers on the Internet.
Bennie can then call the content to his provider.
Do regular e-mails be shared on their way through the network?
Most mails are read over and over from software robots.
In the case of the consignor, it is usually checked whether the mail carries a damage program as an attachment.
A virus check is also carried out on the recipient systems.
In addition, the providers will check whether it is a despicable and unwanted spam mail that is deleted or at least sorted into a spam folder.
Do the robots still have another job?
For systems such as GMail, the robot also detects the information Google needs to place context advertising.
If Anna and Benni communicate via GMail about their upcoming holiday trip, Google can include corresponding links to holiday offers.
Do unknown people also read the e-mails with?
The probability that unauthorized people read a mail is extremely low.
Theoretically, however, this is possible.
In companies, administrators often have the opportunity to read e-mail.
Criminal prosecution authorities and secret services also have legal possibilities to capture or acknowledge e-mails.
This will include possible illegal expression actions.
Is it possible to protect e-mails from reading?
With an encryption based on the OpenPGP standard, an e-mail can be encrypted effectively against readers.
With high technical effort, it is also possible to obscure the metadata of an e-mail communication, so that it cannot even be recognized without further communication with whom.
How important are Yahoo and Google on the e-mail market in Germany?
Yahoo and Google play only a subordinate role in the mostly private postal sectors, according to a study of Convios Consulting from August 2013.
While the shares of Yahoo-Mail were recently lost, GMail was able to make a clear statement from Google.
Mother in the forest slammed and paid off
When his adoptive mother died, a man from Wolfsburg made a plan.
He buried the dead in a forest - and continued to cast their rent and maintenance money.
In order to continue paying rent and maintenance money, a 67-year-old Wolfsburger buried his dead mother after police investigation in the forest.
First he changed the death of 89 years, then he cut the money for more than half a year.
Now the 67-year-old has to answer for fraud, as one speaker said on Friday.
Then the man hid the woman in a forest near Helmstedt.
The man was already suspected in May: At that time, he found that no medication was needed for the mother in need.
The investigator told the tenant that his mother was traveling to Spain.
Because the officers were curious about this, they further discovered it.
It turned out that the two had lived in a common home for more than 15 years and he had treated them last.
The 67-year-old finally committed the death of his mother.
According to the police, an autopsy did not provide any points of reference for a capital crime.
Do you like ice cream that shines in the dark?
A British entrepreneur has developed the first bright ice in the dark – with the help of quails.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent characteristics of the sea stars and created a glowing lake.
The idea came to him after he had read a research work on whales and was able to convince Chinese scientists to produce the shiny protein artificially.
The ice cream reacts when consumed with the tongue, thereby raising the pH in the protein and triggering the light.
Chris explains that the diet reacts to the heat in the mouth and shines – the more you smell, the more it becomes.
Charlie, founder of the ice cream company "Lick Me I'm Delicious", says: "The product is incredible, but still in a very early production phase, and then you get two grams of it for 200 pounds."
The protein used in the ice cream reacts with the tongue at a neutral pH.
If the mouth warms the protein, the pH rises and the ice shines.
We have tried it in the last few months and it has appeared to us ideal to bring it to Halloween because it has this wonderful light effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever made, because the quail light is four times more expensive than gold.
Every ball costs me about 140 pounds.
But for that it tastes good.
Charlie's experimental company with seat in Bristol is famous for its unusual tastes, including beer, cheese, beef and leaf gold.
But his latest creation will be even more ambitious.
He says: "I would like to develop an invisible ice cream."
This is on and for itself impossible because of the light fraction produced by the ice crystals from which ice cream consists; but I suspect we will find a way to create it.
The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a whale produced by Chinese scientists artificially
The TSV Morsum is still without any point in the handball association league after six days.
It is now calculated for the Ingo Ehlers team tomorrow to Derby against the TSV Daverden, who celebrated his first victory last weekend.
With this game, the season begins again for us.
"I hope that we finally have the head free," says Ehler's behavior optimistic.
Finally, with the exception of the permanent injured Henry Blohme, he has his complete box available.
Daverden is also on time as we are.
That is why we need to keep our error rate low.
In the first line, however, there is an increase in coverage, which has recently left everything other than a safe impression.
Much more relaxing is the Daverdens Coach Thomas Panitz after the first season victory against Nordhorn.
Of course, the game was a house number.
But that's why we're not the favorite for a long time, because in Derby everything can always happen.
At the same time, Panitz wants to move back to Morsum to start a series.
Jan-Malte Jodat will be missing.
For this, the A-Young Joost Windsut, which is active in the A-Young Federalist HC Bremen, celebrates its seasonal debut.
Whoever's not in such a game should stay home.
Halloween 2013: In numbers
When I was little, Halloween had something magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat sweets, stay late and dress for the neighborhood.
Today I've become a Halloween muffler.
In the last two years, I have not been prepared to distribute from my apartment out of sweetness, and it will probably not be done this year.
But according to statistics, I am a black sheep, as regards Halloween.
The majority of Americans – 158 million to be precise – celebrate Halloween this year and spend a total of 6.9 billion US dollars for sweets, costumes and decorations, so the US-American Association of Retailers (NRF).
One thing I'm happy about every Halloween then again is the trend values.
The costumes will make up about 1.2 billion US dollars spent on 6.9 billion, so the NRF.
This year are exciting unbelieved objects of the last step.
Women don't have to wear sexy clothes anymore, they can now also engage in seductive food such as pizza, burgers or carrots.
As for men, I expect every amount of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead, and I'll bet the Dapht-Punk-Well Dreamsmen will make it into Instagram feeds this year.
According to Google, the most popular costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I guess it's nothing wrong with tradition.
Last year, we dressed our dogs, so we weren't alone with my surprise.
In fact, Americans spend $330 million this year on the costumes of their pets, so the NRF.
That's a lot of hot dogs.
As far as sweetness is concerned, we're not temperamental.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion this year, says The Nielsen Company.
These are about 270 million kilograms of chocolate gels, Lutschern, bonbons and rubber beads.
So good news for the U.S. Department of Commerce 41 million people who draw through the quarter with the word "sweet or sad".
In fact, we're going to buy over 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and – we're not doing anything to eat.
The only thing we don't want to consume is the sweet Candy Corn; yet 15 million kilograms of it are sold around Halloween, so the National Association of Sweets Manufacturers.
These are about nine billion corn grains.
It's a puzzle I haven't been able to solve yet.
Nothing belongs more to Halloween than houses where it smells.
They have great names such as "Terror Behind the Walls" (which, by the way, is in a real prison), "Howl-O-Screen" and "The House of Shock".
In fact, there are 1,200 officially recognized spook houses in the United States that earn 500 million dollars of income, so says America Haunts, and this includes the wonderful photos on which you just tap into your pocket and then put your friends on Facebook where you don't release them again, and then one of the type on which you stand leaves a comment like a "net face expression".
But let's finally get to the dolls.
Charlie Brown made us familiar with the Great Crow when we were kids, and the cutting of a claw is like the decoration of Christmas tree – something we made from small.
Luckily, last year's "Baby in Kürbis" trend started thanks to Pinterest, so most of us have grown up to cut the kürbis and not to sit there.
This year Americans will spend about 106 million dollars on dolls, so the US Census Bureau.
The worms, which slowly collapse in the front yard, are probably from Illinois, where 245 million kilograms of worms have been carved this year.
If you want to score correctly, then call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California, and cut something nice out of their 921 kilo heavy kurbis.
Apartment fire in Helmbrechts: Rescue forces mountains sold bodies
The firefight had to express itself in Helmbrechts on the late Thursday evening.
A three-dimensional house in the district of Hof starts in the night for Friday fire.
The rescue forces carry a stolen body out of the house.
Rescue forces have found a body in a fire in Hell Brechts in a trifamilial house.
Whether it's a resident is still unclear, as a police speaker in Bayreuth said.
On the late Thursday evening, it was burned in the ground floor of the house.
When the firefight came, the flames were already beating out of a window.
The forces of use went into the apartment and found the body in a room.
This room and another room were completely burned out.
The whole earth was damaged.
All the other residents were not at home during the fire, the police spokesperson continued.
First, the building is no longer inhabited.
The exact reason for the fire was not clear at first.
Germany's largest country church has launched an offensive to recruit for the profession of the pastor.
There is a possible lack of parishioner: The Evangelical-Lutherian Church of Hanover estimates that the number of its present number of some 1,800 pastors and pastors will be half by 2030.
For young people from today, the profession is very attractive and offers good prospects for the future, Pastor Mathis Burfien (43) said in the conversation with the Gospel Press Service.
It is attractive to be able to determine the work and day-to-day course itself.
With Burfien, the Church has for the first time commissioned a pastor in a full place to entertain young people for the theology study.
At present, fewer and fewer young people choose to study theology after the Abitur.
Burfien brings this back to the process of the ecclesiastical: "God's voice is silent, the world is loud".
The profession was marked by great freedom and diversity.
I am the Lord of my timetable and can put my priorities where it is important to me.
Pastors as a soul-career could be close to people.
They deserved as much as teachers and could live well of it.
There is certainly more to be paid in the free economy, but for this, theologians would have had a safe employer.
This is against young people from today, not just about careers, but about a very busy job.
According to the Church of the Land, which includes three quarters of Lower Saxony, about 60 pastors go to rest each year.
At the same time, about 40 graduates of a theology study begin their vicariat.
In thinly populated areas such as Harz, Emsland or Windland, it may be difficult to occupy places in the future.
Burfien, among other things, wants to organize study days for young people and also invite prominent people who have studied theology.
The theology study offers a wide range of training.
You can even become the President of the Federal Republic.
Land Rover Rally Series announced
In the interior there are race seats and six-point belts as well as a free lecture.
The options range from reinforced brakes, a service package with the support of Bowler-Works mechanics and logistical support to vehicle storage between events.
Drew Bowler, CEO of Bowler Motorsport, explains: "The Rally customers who come to Bowler have changed."
They are not all experienced runners, but people who are looking for excitement and adventures, as well as an accessible way to world-class events.
We are pleased to be able to open this path in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA and believe that the format opens up new opportunities to experience the various Rally disciplines in Britain and abroad and to prepare new people for Rally Raid's arrests and reality.
We really enjoyed developing the Defender Challenge cars – this is going to be a entertaining championship.
In addition, there is a training and testing day for the Defender Challenge in February as well as the option to participate in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
Firearm for the rescue of a gun, which was placed 15 metres above the ground on a dangerous rock spring in a stone break
Cockerspaniel-Hundin Ruby was hit by a smaller traffic accident
Three days later, she was discovered by a walker in a stone break in her bad position
Firefighters took off on a rock wall and saved the dog from the safe death
The firefight was able to secure a cannon, which set a 15-metre high lead in a rock wall.
The nine months old cockerspian dog Ruby was killed after a traffic accident on Sunday afternoon and survived alone three days before she was rescued from a stone break on Wednesday.
Scott Alderson, 25, and his friend Becky Hall, 20, of which the dog belongs, came to the stone break Flappit in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to receive Ruby again and to thank the firefighters of the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They were desperate to search for their missing Hundin and to publish relief services in social networks when it was due to the small traffic accident in the stone breach.
At about 2:15 p.m. on Wednesday, a walker saw his dog running, the beached Ruby on the 15-metre high section of the stone.
The technical rescue team of the Cleckheaton Fire Station drove to the scene and took off to rescue Rubys, which was then transported in a dogbox above.
Andy Clayton, a technical rescue team specialist, said: “She was in a dangerous position.
It was located in the middle of the rock wall – 15 meters from the top and the ground.
She did not move a muscle during her rescue – she was like frozen.
But now she's fine.
She then had a few dog cakes.
That was a pretty unusual use.
The fact that the dog was discovered is incredible.
Peter Lau, a specialist in the technical rescue team, said: "Ruby had a huge fortune."
There was the possibility that she was very badly injured or worse.
Ruby was brought to the animal doctor for examination, but he did not detect anything except extraction and dehydration.
Becky Hall from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said, "To see the rescue was scary."
I couldn't believe she was really up there.
It was wonderful to keep her in the arms again.
The veterinarian explained that if the invention had become too large and it would have been broken, it would probably have been crushed.
The firefighters have done great things.
It was really brave what they had done.
We are just so grateful and each of them was absolutely unbelievable.
Scott Alderson from Keighley added: “We were afraid that she would fall, but she stayed up.”
The firefighters were great.
I can't believe where she was.
Mick Jagger said he never made Katy Perry when she was 18.
In an interview with an Australian radio broadcaster this week, the Pop-Star said she worked as a background singer at Jagger's song "Old Habits Die Hard" from 2004.
Perry explained that she had eaten with the altrocker at night, and that “he had turned me on when I was 18”.
She added: "It's been a long time, and he was very nice to me."
In a statement, a representative of Jaggers, 70, said on Thursday that he “categorically denied that he had ever taken an approach to Katy Perry”.
The representative added: “Perhaps she has confused him with someone else.”
Perry was one of the singers who had a guest performance at the Rolling Stones tour this year.

George Kerevan: European Dissemination Gives the Shots the Choice
A new day, a new story of fear of independence.
This time we are warned that an independent country of Scotland is required to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership.
This provides the password for stories about passport checks in Berwick and a border secured with stacked wire along the Hadrian wall.
In fact, the Strathclyde template pointed to the possible economic advantages that would bring more freedom of travel to the rest of Europe, but this, as expected, did not play a role in the strikes.
No one has mentioned that EU Member States often enforce their strict rules when it is more favourable to them.
Since Scotland is currently not part of the Schengen area, the continued disregard for Brussels would be only a small compromise against what you really want from the Scouts.
So it's not really a story.
And one that has come so far in the years that it already equals a fossil: for the first time, I have heard the "independence means passport checks" note at least 40 years ago.
An interesting point is lost in the constant repetition of this ancient history.
Why should an independent Scotland expect it to dance according to European peppers?
Why does the London Joch trade against that from Brussels, especially now?
These are the real European news: the great plan for the unification of Europe, which has taken place since the war, has come to the fore.
The Euro crisis officially killed the European project.
EU-wide, EU-friendly, or EU-wide, parties will win the euro as a Community currency.
Even in Germany, the Euroskeptic party was able to make an alternate appearance for Germany – just this year’s foundation – with almost five million votes during the Federal Day elections in September and thus effectively deliver the Free Democrats (the equivalent to the British Liberal Democrats) from the Federal Day.
There has always been domestic resistance to the plan to create a federalist Europe.
However, the current economic crisis is a turning point.
Because of the strict savings policies imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank in connection with the mandatory gap in which the national economy is required by the consolidation of the single currency, many people feel that the European project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments causing excessive budget deficits – this was only in Greece.
Instead, the Eurosystem has set its members at exchange rates, which are beneficial to German exporters – and that is what German politicians would like to do.
Without the possibility of devalued the local currency, South Europe will again have an integrated productivity advantage vis-à-vis Germany.
The only option is to cut wages and public spending – sponsored by Berlin.
Behind the current state and currency problems is a deeper European productivity problem.
As a result of the "green" energy directives prescribed by Brussels – a code for the subsidisation of French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers – European industry pays double for electricity and four times for gas.
This is a ridiculous cost advantage, as we could see in Grangemouth already.
All of the world's wage-fixes do not protect the European petrochemical industry from being forced into the corner by cheap American skiing gas.
As a result, a rebellion is taking place, especially in France, the former EU cheerleader.
After the war, the political elite of France saw the EU as a vehicle with which to keep Germany in check and raise Paris to the eye height with Washington.
However, Berlin no longer needs Paris as a gateway to political legitimacy and Europe has set up its own economic policy to combat the French economy.
The result is that Marine Le Pens, the EU enemy front national, has just won a decisive reelection and, therefore, three of the ruling socialists are in place.
The Front National is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the vote – a timely warning for the British Labour Party that it cannot get out of it, a division in the right spectrum would automatically mean benefits for the left.
What does Le Pen do with its newly won popularity among the white French of the working class?
It would like to use the EU waves next year to destroy an anti-EU, anti-Community currency block in the European Parliament.
If the anti-EU parties cut well in these elections – and this is very well possible – then for the first time, such a block could dominate the European Parliament.
This is the point on which I want to go: not far from the future, the growing resistance to the EU and the single currency will be combined to abolish the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will become something like the 'Europe of the (supernational) nations' that favoured General de Gaulle.
Germany and a few of its satellite economies may hold fast to the euro, but France and South Europe will return to their own currencies.
I expect Britain to distance itself from this project in the hope of becoming involved in the US.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific is close to the fact that Britain will stand alone in the Atlantic rain.
Where does Scotland stay with all this?
We can decide to be a region of (in the last consequence) small England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – which is also part of what Berlin and Brussels can say.
I suppose Scotland could be very good in a more loose European union if we keep our own currency.
Cooperation with other similar countries is easier in an unfed Europe of the nations.
Otherwise, we should consider keeping Norway equal and our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is – notably – the most successful political movement against savings policy in Europe and has won a spectacular majority in 2011 due to the rejection of the proposed (and planned) cuts that the Labour Finance Minister Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory Lib Dem coalition had to respond to.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to decide now for independence, only to be forced to get a savings policy from Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: Grow faster
Afro-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white peers, as surveys show.
Physical changes do not yet necessarily mean puberty
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe that epidemic obesity is a trigger for early puberty
The trend towards early puberty is less pronounced among boys
The former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist who specializes in child health and family issues.
Should a mother care if her daughter grows breasts and shams at the age of seven or eight?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics, held this week in Orlando, Florida, the paediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these early physical changes were relatively normal among American girls and were a new standard.
“I spend a lot of time calming my parents – usually it’s not a sign that soon puberty is entering," Kaplowitz explained.
The obvious signs of development, such as growing breasts, sham and axel hair, as well as body smell, are shown earlier in girls.
However, there was only a slight shift at the age of Menarche (the first blood to be observed) in the last 40 years.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, somewhat less than 12.75 in 1970.
"When breast development begins, it takes at least two to three years to menarche," said Kaplowitz, also author of the book "Fresh Pubertät in Girls: The Essential Counselor for Dealing With This Common Problem".
Time is the most accurate test of how puberty advances.
It is controversial what actually represents the beginning of puberty, but it is 'early' if the breast enlargement is accompanied by a growth gap before an eight-year-old.
In most cases, the process slows down or stagnates – something that a child doctor can monitor.
When faster progress is made, tests may be shown by an endicronologist so that serious problems such as tumors or cysts can be excluded.
There are methods of treatment to delay an early menstrual period and to avoid another consequence: the early age of bones, which can ultimately lead to growth inhibition and thus small body growth in adults.
The recommendations for drug or hormonal therapy are oriented at the age of the child, the rate of development, the rate of growth and the emotional range.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is persistent about drugs, but he boasts: “The depression of puberty can alleviate the behavioral problems and the feelings of girls, other than their age-senses.”
The other big problem is understandable: parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have the period.
"They take care of the risk of pregnancy or how they maintain the hygiene side," said Kaplowitz.
"It was a shock," recalls a woman whose daughter had received ten days.
Even if there were first signs and we had talked about menstrual, she was not emotionally prepared.
She came fearful and excited from school to home because she was the first in her circle of friends.
There are many widely published theories about the causes of early puberty.
However, there is no conclusive evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media would be genuine.
Boys like girls get into puberty earlier.
Kaplowitz is the view that the most convincing prizes are the epidemic of obesity.
He supported the implementation of a study on girls aged six to nine in 2001 that creates a relationship between body fat and puberty.
Other studies support this conclusion, but there are many other factors that played a role.
In this country, African American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white peers.
There are various explanations for this.
Global seems to be influenced by an early puberty of all possible things, from economic conditions to climate to genes.
Another puzzle: Although young people are growing face and face-to-face, the trend to a full-fledged early puberty is not as strong as in girls.
Other doctors at the AAP conference emphasize the complexity of the topic.
The emergence of acne and shamhaar is spread even among babies and small children.
"We must be careful how to identify the true beginning of puberty," said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a paediatric endocrinologist at the Goryb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to consult their child’s doctor as they should speak to their child.
“This may mean that you have to conduct a conversation earlier than expected”, says Kalowitz.
If you stay calm, the child usually reacts well.
Girls who bloom early need insurance that the process is a normal part of life, even if it entered earlier than thought.
Jumbo manufacturers fight in the face of large orders over seat width
Among the leading aircraft manufacturers, there has been a conflict over the width of seats in the tourist class in long distance flights, indicating the tone for a bitter collision at Dubai Airshow this month.
The dispute revolves around the seating width offered by passengers on long flights in the tourist class – not always those who try to make the most of the airlines, but this demonstrated space represents the key to efficiency claims in the latest Airbus SAS and Boeing Co. aircraft.
Airbus this week demanded a industry standard that prescribes a seat width of at least 46 cm (18 inches) in the tourist class, but the U.S. Erzrivale Boeing said that the airlines should decide that.
The dispute comes at a time when the pilots are betting to sell even larger versions of their two-engine long-run aircraft and are expected to be held from 17 to 21 November.
As the rear part of the aircraft is designed – in particular if there are rows of nine or ten seats – it is crucial for the economic results indicated to provide the new mini-jumbo design.
Boeing claims that its modernized "777X" phases 406 people in the tourist class who are over 17 inches wide and thus allow ten per row.
Airbus explains that the competing version of the A350 transporter 350 people in 18 inches wide seats in the tourist class, with nine per row.
Air giants often share hives about technical details by advertising in the press.
Now Airbus calls in front of Dubai Airshow, where the 777X with over 100 orders is expected to run directly to the public.
Recently, the company presented an advertisement that could be the beginning of a new advertising war and showed donors a picture of three people sitting together in a restaurant, and the title: "Would you accept it?"
"Boeing proposes long-distance flights in seats that are closer than regional turbo-props," says Airbus Sales Manager John Leahy.
In view of changing eating habits, people are fatter, but aircraft seats have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when Boeing 747 defined the modern long distance journey, and by the end of the century, the weight of the average American male has increased by 10 percent between 40 and 49 years, so the data of the US Ministry of Health.
The size of the average American male in the 21st century, according to US health statistics, is 100.8 cm.
Airbus says that his rival held a seat concept from the 1950s, when the average body size of the newly baptized Jet Set was narrower.
Airbus, therefore, has been investigated that an additional duty (2.54 cm) per seat increases the quality of sleep by 53 per cent.
Boeing argues with Airbus numbers to the level of seats and says it is not up to the manufacturer to decide how airlines to balance air fares and facilities.
The company also explains, according to investigations, the experience in the aircraft depends on more than the seat width.
“It is really up to airlines to provide flexibility so that they can do what they have to do to be successful,” explains Flight Cabin expert Kent Craver of Boeing.
They don't want us to dictate to them what makes them profitable.
You know her business better than anyone else.
For passengers, it is about more freedom of elbows, but for manufacturers it will become increasingly an issue that can affect sales.
Behind the controversy is a race for aircraft orders with a estimated volume of at least 700 billion US dollars at list prices in the coming decades, which could have a sustainable impact on the US or Europe's export balance.
As Reuters first reported in July, the seat layout is the driving force behind the conflict around the new jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing claimed 20 percent more efficiency per seat in their latest two-engine long-range design than the market leader in this segment, the 365-sitting Boeing 77-300ER.
The Boeings statements are partly dependent on the fact that the 777X with its ten seats per row is compared to the original design of nine seats in the 777.
The increased costs per unit are still lower than those currently used with ten seats per row.
"Boeing therefore asks for more seats in its aircraft to make it more competitive for our products," says Kevin Kenston, head of passenger comfort at the European Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts, full cabins with ten seats per row at existing 777s pointed out that many passengers decided for the closer arrangement, which could result in cheaper air fares.
"The eighteen-inch seat width would be great for passengers, but the reality is: from an economic point of view, the Airbus offer is controlled by the threat by the 777," says Mary Kirby, expert for cabin facilities, founder and publisher of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing offer no seats, but a catalogue of suppliers from which the airlines can choose.
The world-renowned Jet sellers even carry band sizes to measure the installation at the competition.
Even if they offer the comfort, all manufacturers also offer Jets with highly covered design for cheap flights and regional flights.
Airbus offers an A350 with tens of rows, but according to its own statement, it has not yet sold.
Until recently Airbus has stressed how important the adaptability of the cabins is and for some jets has offered a wide range of seats on the corridors.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets, experts say that the call to a new industry standard is likely to be jammed, but could be linked to the wave of 777X sales.
A new anti-nicotinic agent could make the garage happy when smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotinic vaccine that could destroy the fun of smoking.
A single dose of the vaccine could protect the mouse for a long time from nicotine poisoning.
Before testing on the human body, further attempts are needed, which may take a few more years, but Professor Ronald Crystal from the Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the first results were good.
“We are very hopeful that this type of vaccination strategy can help once millions of smokers who have tried to stop and have tried all the methods available on the market, but had to experience that their nicotine search is stronger than these approaches,” said Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified to contain the genetic information for the production of nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells that then produce a constant stream of antibodies.
The antibodies hunt the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralise them before they reach the brain, so a smoker does not experience any nicotine high.
In a trial, vaccinated mice with nicotine were given their normal level of activity.
On the other hand, mouse without vaccination had taken a "outtime", the researchers explained, a sign that the nicotine had reached its brain.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they included antibodies.
The vaccines had to be given so often that they were expensive and impractical to maintain the antibodies.
However, the costs of the new vaccine are likely to be significantly lower, as it converts liver cells into antibodies.
As Professor Crystal said, a future vaccine for people could, if he is sure, be given children before they are tempted to try a cigarette and thus prevent nicotine.
But it's more likely that smokers would use it to stop.
“They know then: If they start smoking again, they no longer find pleasure in it because of the nicotine vaccine, and this helps them to relax the habit,” he explains.
British scientists said that the results were interesting, but at the same time warned that further research was needed.
Tripodi disputed to be influenced by Obeid
Against the former Minister of the Labor Party Joe Tripodi from New South Wales, an investigation is initiated by State corruption surveillance.
The former NSW Minister argues that the regulations on maritime pollution have been amended on the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who has had hidden participation in three land areas in a state-controlled country.
On Friday, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC Independent Commission against Corruption) expanded its investigations into whether Obeid had been affected by various government ministers there, to extend contracts at the Circular Quay, where the Obeids operated two restaurants and a café, without an invitation to tender after their departure in August 2005.
Now, because of the charge, Tripodi has been aware of Obeid's hidden interest in the plots, after Tripodis had said his former Deputy Chief of Staff Lynne Ashpole on Thursday accordingly.
In years of talks that began in 2005, the government had insisted on public tenders for the agreements.
The priests were on the other side and wanted longer periods of time.
In 2009, the contract contracts for the companies at the Circular Quay, which brought the Obeids $2.5 million each year, were extended without public tender.
Tripodi, who was the Minister of Harbour from February 2006 to November 2009, had originally spoken for public tenders.
However, he objected to having made the changes to be made by Obeid, who, as Tripodi confirmed, had forced the government's rules of procedure to be redesigned.
One of the IAC's telephone signatures showed talks from August to September 2007 between Obeid, Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a leading officer who was transferred to the Ministry of Harbour after working under Obeid in the Fisheries Authority.
"Where is the topic discussed in this telephone conversation the preparation of the commercial anti-fraud arrangements?" asked the representative of the Commission, Anthony Wheely Tripodi.
"No," Tripodi replied.
I can't remember what was discussed, but it was definitely not.
Definitely not between me and Mr Obeid.
Israeli warplanes reach target in Syria, so official sources
Israeli hunting aircraft had reached a target in the Syrian port of Latakia on Thursday, a leading government official confirmed against Fox News.
The officer did not explain what the goal was, but said it was at least one.
According to the Associated Press, it was the goal of the Russian SA-125 rockets.
At least twice this year, Israel has already made air strikes on missile supplies in Syria.
Foreign workers with 457 visas could be subjected to "Treaty Test"
In the context of extended measures, the Government is thinking about a "reality test" for foreign workers with 457 visas.
If the test is introduced, it will use a criterion to prevent 457 from being used to establish unqualified jobs or as a back door for family and friends to Australia.
Today, a government discussion proposal was published after the previous MPs of the Labor Party, Maxine McKew, condemned the government's comments on foreign workers because they could be taken up by the neighbours of Australia as an insult.
“Excellent statements such as ‘foreigns are to be set up’ and ‘Australia’ are a very unpleasant return in times in which trade unions called for a protected labour market,” she told Australia India Institute today.
Historically, it was said that white workers should be protected – and if some in the region were to ruin an echo of this historic artifact, I would not be surprised.
The proposal for a debate covers twelve measures once mentioned by former Minister of Immigration Chris Bowen.
Immigrant Minister Brendan O'Connor, who spoke yesterday about human smuggling in Sri Lanka, has implemented five of the recommended changes, the others will still be considered.
If the "realty criterion" is taken over, then a person applying for a visa may be examined in such a way as to whether "the application is true in cases where the applicant is related or personally connected to the holder or to a relevant person of the supporting company."
In addition, companies could be obliged to rely on the number of 457 Visumers after, in the past, companies that initially wanted to support only a small number of workers, finally set up hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylumer probably died on a heart attack after arriving this week with a refugee boat on the Christmas Island.
The destroyed nine-year-old son of the man who had come to Australia with him will be cared for by an adult cousin who was also on the boat after his father's death on Wednesday.
Australian authorities brought the man to the Christmas Island Hospital, where he died.
A study was announced by the British Government to increase the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland.
In the work of HS2 Ltd, it is proposed to implement high-speed connections between Scotland and Northern England at the beginning of Phase 1 in 2026.
Minister of Transport Baroness Kramer said that the project "will bring Britain closer together".
The Scottish Minister for Transport Keith Brown explained that he was very pleased to work with the British government on this plan.
Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed rail connection between London and the West Midlands.
After the completion of Phase 2 there will be connections to Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government adjusted the estimated cost of building the high-speed road between London and Northern England from 32.7 billion pounds to 42.6 billion pounds.
The British government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, has commissioned HS2 Ltd to seek further track capacities and travel time improvements for Northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of a travel period from last three hours or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
Baroness Kramer said: "Our goal for HS2 is a truly national network bringing Britain and its cities closer together."
We go ahead with HS2 because it brings enormous benefits to itself.
Without it, we are facing a capacity crisis in our railway network.
But it is also about the connection between 18 British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which is improved thanks to HS2.
The Scottish State Secretary Alistair Carmichael commented: "Today's announcement is a good news for Scotland."
In the name of the Scottish government, Keith Brown Carmichael called for "unintelligible" use of the Scottish integration into the HS2 network.
Brown said: “The high-speed rail connection is the potential of enormous economic advantages for Scotland, but also the economic power of Scotland provides an argument for fast rail connections across the UK.”
That is why we are pleased to work as a partner of the British government and to explore the options for a high-speed rail connection in Scotland, create the benefits for all, and complement the connection of Glasgow-Edinburgh, which the Scottish government already plans.
I am pleased to examine the investigation report with the British ministers next year and to decide together the next steps.
Rules on electronic devices in aircraft remain in force in Australia on a provisional basis
Australian passengers must also continue to switch off tablets and smartphones at start-up and landing, despite efforts in the United States to unlock the rules for such devices.
The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) allows US airlines to change their defaults so passengers can read e-books, see videos, or play on their devices during critical flight phases, provided they are in "flight mode".
While most of the flight is already allowed to fly, many people find it annoying that they should not read their e-books when they start and land.
However, Australian companies are not monitoring the decision to implement which US airlines have to do a lot of work, nor are they pursuing immediate plans to change their rules.
The CASA Air Safety Authority also explained that the announcement would be viewed, but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical phases of flight in Australia still apply.
“CASA currently has no specific regulations regarding the use of electronic devices in the aircraft”, it was said.
The subject is subject to provisions whereby air carriers maintain safety at all times and passengers must comply with the safety instructions provided by cabin crew.
Virgin has already led talks with the CASA about an extension of his Wi-Fi entertainment system on flights and explained that it is open to changes, but they should be initiated by the legislator.
"We would welcome a review of the approval of electronic devices by the CASA, because we are convinced that this would improve customer experience after we now offer (without any entertainment) during the flight," one speaker said.
Qantas explained that you will remain in the current rules until further notice.
"Our current directives provide that electronic devices should not be used when starting and landing, and we currently have no plans to change that," the company explained.
The FAA rules apply to US airlines.
However, we are always interested in developments in regulations that passengers can benefit from, and we will certainly see the FAA decision as well as the reasons behind it.
The decision is different in US companies depending on the age of the fleet.
They must prove that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference by mobile devices, and change manuals, training materials, hand luggage programs and customer instructions.
“After an airline has confirmed the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use more portable, easier electronic devices such as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones at all levels”, the FAA announced.
In rare cases, in poor vision, the crew will show the passengers while the landing will turn off the devices.
In addition, the group recommended that heavy-duty devices should be installed safely under the seat or in the boxes above the seats.
In front of the Verviederby vs. Schalke, accompanied BVB trailers with light rockets had taken care of violent scenes in the Veltins Arena.
Borussia Dortmund then announced serious consequences.
Before the free game of the football fedsliga against the VfB Stuttgart, the Ultras reacted with a swing - first.
It was an unusual, almost speculative acoustic that offered the viewer until shortly before the beginning of the Federal League game between the German Vizemeister Borussia Dortmund and the VfB Stuttgart in the signal Iduna Park.
Most of them were the guests with their songs.
On the south side, where the most faithful of the faithful - and the loudest - BVB fans are, at first, presented extremely quiet: no songs, no battles.
The podium of the Capo, which otherwise coordinates the joint fire, remained unoccupied.
And in front of the tribune, a large flag with a label "Stadion Prohibit".
Only as Torhüter Roman Weidenfeller as always as the first BVB players entered the place, a short-term anniversary burned on.
When his teammates followed, there was loud singing and weeping shals - but not all the time.
In the central blocks 12 and 13 of the south tribune, nothing was right.
Also that stadium speaker Norbert Dickel once again listed the positive experiences of the last days - Derbysig, victory over Arsenal, extension of the contract by Trainer Jürgen Klopp - did not provide for the holiday pay.
Only five minutes before the ampfiff the Capo broke his podium - and that until then the tension with the hands was in a loud cry, when the voice on the ranks in the stadium was questioned as usual.
As last as always, the southern tribune was on the row - and finally here was again as usual the most popular place in the stadium.
And at the latest, as with anpfiff from the south tribune, the loud call "Derbysier stands up" came again, everything was as always.
The silence was probably a reaction to the events of the past days.
In front of the FC Schalke 04, some of the accompanying BVB trailers had fired light rockets into the viewing range and on the spot - and almost torhüter Roman Weidenfelder.
The game was delayed due to chaotic scenes.
BVB-Boss Hans-Joachim Watzke had then received the peaks of Dortmund Ultras in his office - and believes that Watzke's words, this was a rather uncomfortable appointment for the fan representatives.
"There will be massive cuts for the entire ultra-movement," the BVB boss announced on Thursday evening at a podium discussion in Frankfurt.
As an immediate measure, Watzke told the Ultras a choreography for the home game against the VfB Stuttgart.
"That's what I forbid," he explained.
The zero tolerance policy in pyrotechnic matters we cannot give up.
In addition, the Ultras were shown various possibilities of punishment - up to Tuesday they now have time to decide for one.
Otherwise, so Watzke, the BVB will impose a penalty by the end of the week.
"It's going to collapse," insurance Watzke.
It may be tense how the reactions to the south tribune then turn out.
Pfandhauser tree in Singapore, as the crisis has come in the middle layer
Janani Amirthalinga, in a house in the Bendemeer shopping center in Singapore, exchanges a gold bracelet, a ring and a pair of earrings to pay the tuition fees for her daughters.
"My husband and I just bought a house, where my whole money is in there," says Amirhalinga.
Although she earns 3,000 Singapore dollars (about EUR 1,730) every month as an administrative employee and her husband also works, she does not have enough of the monthly family income, she explains.
In fact, the demand in parts of South-East Asia, where the debt of the households is increasing, is so large that ValueMax, where she has made her exchange, this week became the third Pfandhaus listed at the Singapore Stock Exchange.
The commitment of Jewelry is not only a quick way to get money – 1,300 Singapore dollars in the case of Janani Amirthalinga – but also almost as cheap as an unsecured bank loan.
Typically, Pfandhauser in Singapore requires an effective 17 percent annual rate, which is just over 15.4 percent that the United Overseas Bank requires, a local creditor with a branch in the same shopping center.
Houses, however, offer the advantage that there is no need for creditworthiness or income review here, so loans are faster than in banks.
For this reason, millions of people in the region turn to houses after families feel the pressure of rising living costs as well as increasing household and consumer debt.
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap loans due to a loose financial policy in the developed economic areas, families with smaller and medium-income households are seeking to compensate for the difference in the economy.
This week, the rating agency Standard & Poor's growing financial debt, mainly by increasing mortgages, was a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have, according to the Agency, the highest budgetary debt in Asia in relation to the gross domestic product.
Malaysia is 80 percent of GDP at the top of the list, an increase of 60 percent in 2008.
People's economies also take care of themselves because of high consumer debt in Thailand, which has come out of a technical recession this week.
On Thursday, the data showed a continuing export weakness and a legacy of consumer demand.
"In the end, this means that, in view of rising costs, people in the middle to the lower segment (the income scale) will try to supplement their income wherever possible," says Song Seng Wun, an economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historical peaks at the gold prices in the last two years have strengthened the trend to commit personal items, as people use the opportunity to turn the beauty of the family into cash.
In Singapore there are about 70 percent of the dedicated items in the 200 houses of the city of Gold.
People say, "The gold price looks good, let's get Grandmother's gold chain and get it back next month."
The largest Thai Pfandhaus operator, EasyMoney, has experienced a 20% customer growth in its branches over the last few months.
The growth in the retail business is so strong that ValueMax, the branch operator in Bendemeer and 15 more in Singapore, wants to expand not only to the neighbouring Malaysia – where the company operates four houses – but also outside Asia, so Yeah Lee Ching, Managing Director of ValueMax.
The company finances it with 60 percent of the 66 million Singapore dollars, which it took this week with the stock exchange in Singapore.
While some lenders have come to the crossfire due to high interest rates, Yaah explains that Pfandhausers not only killed cheaper interest than other lenders, but also not directly increased the debt.
"Customers rely on items they already own, and the fluctuation of personal values does not increase budgetary training," she explains.
The wage-loans business is increasingly accepted as short-term, secure financing.
Also, not all people who use fraud are in financial difficulties.
Rich people from Singapore also come to the branches of ValueMax to pledge gold bars and Rolex watches, for which they receive up to 60 percent of the purchase price in bar.
Customers come to us from every social layer.
"These include well-being, which are intended for a business or investment in the short term, or small companies that need to bridge the gap in cash flow," says Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
NSA saves data from Google and Yahoo - Snowden wants to help
The Secret Service Enthüller Edward Snowden has a primary interest in helping Germany to clarify the increasingly fragile NSA business.
Following the presentation of the Green Federation member Hans-Christian Ströbele, it was at his surprising meeting with Snowden in Russia under what conditions would the ex-Geheim Service employees speak in favour of a German public prosecutor or a committee of inquiry.
Snowden referred to his complicated legal situation, Ströbele said to the ARD magazine "Panorama".
Rescue package over 325 million Australian dollars for Tasmanian health care
The Australian government is under the harsh conditions associated with the rescue package of over 325 million Australian dollars for the Tasmanian health system to ensure that the government of the state cannot waste the money.
The Federal Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek announced that the Commonwealth will take "inadvertent measures" to eliminate a crisis caused by an ageing population of the island, a higher proportion of chronic diseases and systemic restrictions.
Funding for a period of four years was decided after government consultations with the independent Tasmanian deputy, Andrew Wilkie.
"The government has cut down a emergency rescue package, which we believe is addressing the unique challenges facing the state," Plibersek said today.
The 325 million-dollar package includes 31 million dollars immediate aid for election services.
Other 2600 operations, including orthopaedic interventions and treatments due to gray star, will eliminate residues.
In addition, there is money for day clinics in Hobart and Lanceston, better post-stational care, specialist training, mental health services and the introduction of a system for electronic record of health data in local hospitals.
"These investments are in line with the ideas that I have been told by the clinical staff concerned, they are the best way to improve the Tasmanian health system," Tanya Plibersek said.
The Ministry was under a strict reporting and accounting obligation of the Government of Tasmania.
The state must maintain the current level of funding in order to obtain money from the Commonwealth and report monthly where the additional funds were spent.
A three-headed Commission will be set up to ensure that the state provides health services as efficiently and efficiently as possible.
As Wilkie said today, the $325 million would only be of little use if "they are not accompanied by real reforms that bring the public health system to a more sustainable course."
In spite of this, he praised the government for responding to his urgent request for assistance, which he first expressed against the Prime Minister in the beginning of May.
"I am confident that the federal aid will make a great contribution to taking the public health system of the state from the list of concerns," Wilkie said.
According to the government of the state, these elections will largely eliminate the recent cuts.
But the health-political speaker of the opposition at the federal level, Peter Dutton, is the view that today's announcement is only a "plaster solution".
"We are therefore in a position today because the Labour Government has withdrawn $430 million from the health system," he said against ABC TV.
It can't be that a state government is spending almost half a billion dollars out of the system and the Commonwealth is investing 300 million and then doing the good news.
Dutton urged Plibersek to ensure that not a single dollar of the rescue package will be issued for additional bureaucracy.
Guillaume Niclux' adaptation of the novel by Denis Diderot convinces with exceptional production equipment and contemporary details, however, is also more expensive than necessary.
The action in France of the 1760s tells the exciting story of Suzanne, a young adjunct sent by her family to the monastery.
When she rebels, she is confronted with the extreme cruelty of an extremely sadistic superior and becomes the object of erotic fascination of another.
The film never moves away in silence or sensational listening – and its problem lies in it.
The festive seriousness with which the film is told also makes it for the public to be a quälerische büßerhemd.
Syria destroyed its ability to produce chemical weapons, so a monitoring group
Syria has destroyed important facilities for the production of chemical weapons and gas ammunition, the global Monitoring Group for Chemical Weapons said on Thursday, while in the north of the country there were serious conflicts near one of the sites where toxic substances are stored.
Also on Thursday, a Syrian activist group announced that more than 120,000 people have been killed since the beginning of the civil war before three years ago.
The announcement of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) arrived one day before the date
1 November, which was set up in the Hague by the Damascus organization to destroy or "inoperable" all facilities for the manufacture of chemical weapons, including all machinery for the mixing of chemicals into poison gas and the filling of ammunition.
The completion of this process, which basically represents the first stage of destruction, is an important milestone in an ambitious timetable aimed at the destruction of all Syrian chemical weapons by mid-2014.
The destruction of the facilities means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
Damascus must, however, begin to destroy existing weapons and supplies.
According to assumptions, there are about 1,000 tons of chemicals and weapons in the country, including Senfgas and the Nervegas Sarin.
The announcement came at a time when fighting in the city of Safira on Thursday, experts say that there is a production facility for chemical weapons as well as warehouses, as the Syrian observer for human rights in Britain reported.
The group of activists, following the number of deaths in Syria through a network of activists, declared on Thursday that 120,296 people were dead.
Of these 61,067 civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the part of the government, 29.954 of them belonged to the army of President Bashar Assad, 18.678 were government-friendly fighters and 187 Lebanese Hisbollah militias.
Also among the dead are 2,202 desert soldiers and 5,375 fighters of the opposition, many of them aliens.
On 25 July, the UN estimated the number of deaths in this conflict from March 2011 to 100,000.
This number has not been updated so far.
The conflict has forced some two million people to flee the country.
Assad's troops have been fighting in Safira for weeks against the rebels, many of whom have connections to al-Qaida groups.
The observatory said there were losses on both sides on Thursday, but did not call details.
The fights underline the danger posed by the chemical weapons inspectors, because their mission to free Syria from its toxic weaponry is a race against the time in the midst of an additional civil war.
According to the OPCW, which works closely with the United Nations, the team “is now convinced that it has seen all the important production and mixing/filling facilities mentioned by Syria and has suffered their destruction.”
Therefore, "there are currently no other inspection activities planned."
At the beginning of the week, the inspectors had declared that they had completed the first round of the checks and visited 21 of 23 of the sites identified by Damascus.
Due to security concerns, two facilities were not possible, the inspectors said.
On Thursday, the OPWC declared that the two locations were “disposed ... and that the existing objects of the chemical weapons programme were deposited with other so-called institutions that were inspected.”
It was not immediately clear whether the site in Safira was one of the two facilities that could not visit the OPCW inspectors.
Syria has submitted a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which must be approved by the Executive Committee of the OPWC next month.
"I draw the hat against the bravery and courage that you all have shown in meeting the most challenging mission that has been carried out by this organization," said Ahmed Uzumcu, the Director-General of the OPCW, in a comment published by OPCW.
For three years now, the mainly Sunni Muslim rebels have been fighting this civil war against the Assad government and its security forces, many of which are members of the Alavites, a break-up of the Shiite Islam.
With regard to further developments, observation group leader Rami Abdurrahman said on Wednesday there was a strong explosion in an air defence facility in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion was unknown, he explained.
Anger over judgment for bombers of Bali
The survivors and relatives of the 202 people who came to Bali during the bombing in 2002 were angry at the verdict of the last of the activists who were brought before the court, as Umar Patek should be shot in a standstill.
Patek, who was almost ten years old as one of the most wanted people in Southeast Asia, was sentenced to 20 years in prison for his role in the construction of explosives.
He could be released after 15 years.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of the mass murder because of the attack on two night clubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, where 202 people died, including 88 Australians, and many others were injured.
In addition, a statement of guilt was made in a number of terrorist-related charges, including a wave of explosives attacks on churches in Indonesia at Christmas in the year 2000.
The Public Prosecutor had demanded a lifelong penalty, even if it was for the man, who was also called "Demoliation Man" because of his reputation as a master bomber, who could have applied for the death penalty.
The decision raised painful memories of June Corteen, a mother from Perth who lost her 39-year-old twins Jane and Jenny in the horror set up by Patek and his co-sponsors almost ten years ago.
Fighting with tears, she said Patek would have been sentenced to death.
I really think he should follow in the footsteps of the other guy.
"You should put him in front of a firing command," Corteen said to AAP.
I have to live every day so that I won't get another uncle and I'll never see my daughter again.
The Sari Club was made equal to the ground when on October 12, 2002, shortly after 23 o'clock, a violent bomb exploded in a small truck parked in front of the night club.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's Bar, where only 20 seconds earlier a suicide bomber exploded a backpack filled with explosives.
He fell into the coma and "dead" three times after the attack, while he was hanging on a life-saving system.
Hughes said that Patek had earned the same fate as the three other members of the terrorist cell Jemah Islamiah – Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra – who were responsible for the bloodbath and were directed four years ago.
Really, this guy should get the death penalty first and foremost.
To leave him alive – no, there is no reason to leave him alive.
Getting 20 years after he killed 202 people and injured many hundreds is not much.
Patek is the last of the Bali bombers in court.
He took up almost a decade of arrest, but was finally arrested in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where US troops almost four months later killed the former al-Qaida chief Osama bin Laden.
During the negotiations, an FBI agent said that secret service reports had indicated that Patek was in Pakistan to meet my cargo with the goal of re-establishing the link between South-East Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaida.
"He didn't sit down," Corteen said.
Until recently, he has shown no regret about how much suffering he has added to other people.
The verdict came before the 10th anniversary of the attack this year, which will be held with memorials in Bali and Australia.
"There will be many tears this year," Corteen said.
Patek can make a call against his judgment.
FAA: Passengers can now use electronic devices in aircraft (but do not have mobile calls)
Flyers can now hear their electronic devices for reading, working, playing, music and using movies, but not phone calls, so the new guidelines issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the United States on Thursday.
However, passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately.
As soon as they would implement, on the other hand, from the airline concerned, FAA staffer Michael Huerta explained at a press conference.
Air carriers must demonstrate to the FAA that aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they have updated the flight crew training manuals as well as the arrangements for the disposal of equipment in accordance with the new rules.
The FAA explained that it has already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft.
These airlines included Delta and JetBlue.
"In the state of the plan, we could approve the extended use of electronic devices very soon," the FAA announced in a statement.
Currently passengers must switch off smartphones, tablets and other devices when the doors are closed.
They may only start again when the aircraft has reached an altitude of three kilometres and the captain has a green light.
On entry into the country flight, the passengers must turn them off again and they must not start again before the aircraft has landed.
According to the new guidelines, airlines whose aeroplanes are protected from electronic disturbances could allow their passengers to use the equipment also when starting, landing and rolling stock, the FAA explained.
Most new transport aircraft and other aircraft that have been converted to higher levels for the use of Wi-Fi should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Flights, welcomed the changes.
“If the new regulation is implemented safely – and we are working closely with the airline – both sides will benefit from it,” Glading commented.
We are truly sorry to have to feel like a guard on this issue.
However, Internet connections to surfing, exchanges of e-mails, text messages or downloading data under three kilometres remained prohibited, the Authority explained.
Passengers are asked to move smartphones, tablets and other devices in flight mode.
So there's still no "Words With Friends", the Scrabble-like online game that the actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011, when he had to leave a jet from American Airlines in public because he refused to turn off the device while the plane was parked at the airport.
And worse devices like laptops must continue to be corrupted, as there is a danger of injury if they fly through the cabin.
Mobile calls during the flight are also still prohibited.
The regulatory competence for telephone calls is with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), not with the FAA.
FAA may have a ban on certain electronic devices when starting and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker from the Transport Safety Authority National Transportation Safety Board, security experts for national transport issues on CBS News, phones would still be considered at risk.
"Handy really is a problem not only because they could cause potential disturbances on navigation devices, but because we know from the FCC that air transmission can also disrupt shipments," said Rosenker.
A advisory committee of the industry, called by the FAA to investigate this issue, recommended last month that the government allow a wider use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, the pressure on the FAA has increased to limit its use.
Critics like the democratic Senator Claire McCaskill from Missouri represented the view that there are no valid security reasons for the ban.
The restrictions are also increasingly difficult to implement because the use of the devices has become all-inclusive.
In some studies, the speech that up to one third of the passengers forgets or ignores the switch off of the device is one of these.
The FAA began in 1966 to restrict the use of electronic devices by air carriers after reports of disturbances of navigation and communication devices were made known to UKW radios carried by passengers, which were then the latest technical trend.
New aircraft are far more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also so designed and approved by the FAA that they do not have any electronic interference.
Flights have been offering passengers Wi-Fi for some years now when the altitude is reached.
Airplanes adapted to Wi-Fi systems are also more sensitive to interferences.
The vast majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for the increased use of electronic devices in accordance with the new directives, says Huerta.
Today’s electronic devices generally give much less radio radiation than previous generations.
For example, e-reader only emits minimal radiation when switched off.
However, when downloading or sending data, the transfer values are stronger.
For the impeding of a lockdown of the restrictions on the use of devices by passengers, Amazon.com is.
In 2011, company employees hired a passenger plane full of Kindle E-reader and made a test flight to detect problems, but could not find it.
Members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings about the risk of using devices.
Douglas Kidd of the Passenger Association National Association of Airline Passengers said he was the view that the interference through the devices is real, even if the risk is minimal.
Other committee members said that there are only isolated reports from pilots who speak to disrupt aircraft systems through the devices, and most of them are very old.
However, the Committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to order, in case of instrument landing under poor visual conditions, the suspension of the equipment by passengers.
A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes and described them as a reasonable adjustment for travellers who would be equipped with technology today.
"We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not in conflict with security," said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.
Re-released bird by the rescue service of the North Sea Bohrinsel
A flight rescue service on the coast of a flying bird, which was discovered on a North Sea drill island, was released into nature again.
The water raid was launched last month with a helicopter to Aberdeen, where it was picked up by the Scottish Animal Protection Organisation SPCA in their rescue centre in Alloa.
Colin Seddon, head of the centre, said: “This waterfall was probably a winter train bird from North Europe, which was stopped by the strong wind over the North Sea.”
Apparently the exhausted bird sought refuge on the drill island.
He added: "He could no longer fly, so we were contacted with the aid."
During her release, the waterwheel was fit and healthy again.
Is Europe's elite ready to do business with the UK?
Business for Britain was launched in April with the intention of bringing the economy to a table and defining what those who in Britain want to change our relations with the EU want to do.
To this end, we have commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey of British economic leaders and asked them what they think about Britain, the economy and the EU.
YouGov consulted over 1,000 leading forces from the economy, representing, for example, the British sizes, sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will be a surprise to many.
We have found that the vast majority of companies are currently exporting outside Europe and focusing on countries that are modernising and growing, while countries in the EU are stagnant.
They hope that new trade links with countries such as China, India and Brazil will be promoted by the government side rather than by the long and pressing process of reforming the hidden EU institutions.
The majority of the economic leaders of the view that the control over these key competences should be withdrawn to Westminster should be asked to refer to certain legal topics, from cartel law to product law.
There was general dissatisfaction over the internal market, as according to the statement of companies, the costs of the Brussels rules would in the meantime outweigh the advantages of being part of Europe's trading area – even 40 per cent of the large companies agreed to the most traditional of European-friendly.
Finally, and this is likely to be the case, our inquiry by economic leaders revealed that a significant majority of Britain wants to take a course towards the amendment of the Agreement and not a relationship with the EU based on trade.
This recognition, which is found in companies of all sizes and leading groups, shows that the economy is pushing for a "significant change", which brings the burden of action back to Britain.
It is a lot – a change in the agreement and better conditions for the United Kingdom would lead to 16% change in opinion in favour of the EU in a referendum.
The Prime Minister should have no doubt: this survey shows that the British economy is behind its plan for the renegotiation of British terms for EU membership.
It also shows that companies expect a significant shift in power from a new negotiation to Britain.
A better deal for the British economy is possible and increasingly necessary after the Eurozone is now moving towards a closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be jobs and growth in the UK, as the result of our survey shows, which means an increased focus on trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels approach to regulations.
Alexei Miller by Gazprom refers to Pipeline in Bulgaria as the beginning of a new gasera
The beginning of the construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria represents the start of one of the largest European energy projects, the Gazprom project explained.
"Today's event is a milestone: the construction of the Bulgarian section of the South Stream Gaspipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, has begun," said the Chairman of the Management Board of Gazprom, Alexei Miller, in a statement on Thursday.
The project is a key element for the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream is intended to ensure more diversity in Russia's export routes through Europe.
A dispute between Gazprom and its pendant in Ukraine, in which most of the Russian gas for Europe is stored, poses an increased risk to conventional routes, as can be heard from the official side.
Miller said the direct connection to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, meant that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries were "always".
Bulgarian consumers get gas from South Stream to benefit from tariffs when the entire 2015 project is in operation.
According to Gazprom, construction works in other subordinate countries will begin on the planned route to the end of the year.
The pipeline is designed at an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic metres of natural gas.

Hearing before the Royal Commission: Two YMCA employees accused of charges against Jonathan Lord for sexual misconduct
Two YMCA employees from New South Wales (NSW) were accused of sexual delinquency in relation to children, prior to 2011 proposals were raised against Child Caregiver Jonathan Lord from Caringbah, as the Royal Commission for Sexual Abuse of Children experienced.
However, in the opening statement before the Commission, the YMCA stated that the organisation had "never had to do with an incident of child sexual abuse".
Managing Director Phillip Hare was questioned about a case in which an YMCA employee was charged with child pornography and another in which a sports teacher at the YMCA Caringbah Hall 1991 was convicted for misusing his trusted children.
Here said Gail Furness, one of the Commission's assistant lawyers, that he knew of the first case, but did not know the second one.
He argued that the YMCA opening statement to the Commission was also unclear in the claim that "the YMCA has provided external checks in which YMCA has been recognised as the top priority for child safety".
Moreover, evidence from the Commission shows that YMCA was informed that it received the two-tier evaluation of four possible quality audits by the Department of Education and Communities (Ministry of Education) in August of the year.
Here, who started with 21 at YMCA, admitted that the management had failed to "from the bottom of my mind" in setting up Lord and did not ensure that employees were aware of their obligations to report violations of the child safety directives.
Lord was sentenced to 12 boys in the beginning of the year for sexual misconduct during his two-year activity for the YMCA.
He was sentenced to at least six years in prison.
Hare argues, however, that the YMCA would have a cultural problem that the employee had stopped reporting Lord's violations regarding the safety of children.
The employees said that they had observed violations, including that Lord was alone with children, she treated as a private babysitter, she sat on his shoe, to say he loved it, and let kids play with his phone.
Danielle Ockwell, whose predecessor was Lord and who had prayed for a child protection training because she was concerned about his behavior, said that the child service manager, Jacqui Barnat, who was the pre-appointed Lords at YMCA Caringbah, was “very intimidating and most of the time very unacceptable”.
The Managing Director stated that he would not accept the statements of employees who did not trust to return their message.
Instead, as he said, his friendship with Lord had undermined her judgmental powers, so they had not notified him.
Hare explained that he informed the board of the YMCA NSW that the lesson that the organization had to draw from the "Jonathan-Lord-Intermediate" was "not reporting" by employees, and the board agreed with him.
Hare said that the decision to force employees to sign secrecy obligations shortly after the charges were filed was made by the YMCA child services manager Liam Whitley.
He said that this should prevent contamination of the evidence, but that was "over-the-counter" and that was badly implemented.
Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University, an expert on sexual child abuse, explained that the YMCA NSW was not a safe organization for children when Jonathan Lord was involved between 2009 and 2011.
He explained that there had been “resolved problems” in the recruitment, verification, recruitment, training and supervision of employees.
The hearing was postponed until 20 December.
Tony Blair explained that he would take advantage of the opportunity to return as British Prime Minister – but argues that a comeback is unlikely.
In an interview this evening on the fifth day of the year of his separation from office, 59-year-olds announced his views on various domestic issues.
Since his resignation in June 2007 after a decade as Head of State, Blair has largely avoided speaking to British politics, and his comments on foreign policy and his role as envoy of the Quartet of the Peace Foundations in the Middle East are largely limited.
On the question of whether he would like to return to the Prime Minister's office, Blair was quoted as saying, "Yes, of course, but it is unlikely that this will happen, so ..."
When the horse-shoe experts found themselves in Scharen in Cardiff to choose the horse of the year, they were aware that a fierce competition was under way.
But no one was prepared for the three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
The Knirps, who was not even in the kindergarten and only a few months ago, took his first steps, and his Shetland-Pony Toffee went through the three rounds and got the first prize – leaving 30 adults behind.
The inseparable couple, both of them equally large, were praised for their performance, behaviour and style at the annual competition held by the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff.
At his appearance in competition with men and women with elegant melons, he had set up his counters in a free angle and led the two-year-old toffee through the ring.
Fenton was praised by the jury for his natural abilities in dealing with the pony, which are far above his age.
And Toffee received best notes for his appearance and personality.
Fenton had received Toffee last March as a gift on his third birthday and since then has been practicing with the Shetland-Pony.
His mother, Donna, 30, said: "Fenton and Toffee are a great bond."
They had to go against the entire field of participation and they went from place to place with gold pokal and rosette.
It was only the second time that he had participated in a competition with toffee, and we were all thrilled when he won.
Perfect strangers in the arena kept him so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.

Howells said: “The whole audience was as electrically lit and all inflamed and laughed at him.”
He lived on sand the entire length of the arena, and although he looked so young, he did fantastic work.
Fenton is crazy about animals – he loves horses, tractors and farmyards and has two chickens to take care of.
As it is started, it won't take long until it's on the "horse of the year" show – and I'm sure it'll cut well.
One speaker of the annual horseshow said: “Fenton is only three, but he knows how to deal with his pony.”
Together they're a great team.
The jury evaluated Fenton and Toffee after how well they had beaten themselves and presented themselves in the lead.
They looked out for good cooperation between Pony and the leader – and there were Fenton and Toffee the best in the ring.
I'm sure that Fentons' cute dress contributed to their part, which was really perfect for the occasion.
Chinese paper to be "recast" after a call
A Chinese newspaper, which had called for the release of a reporter who had been accused of defamation, was to be reformed, a press regulator explained.
The New Express in Guangzhou had printed a rare public call to release the journalist Chen Yongzhou.
However, Chen later stated on television that he had accepted bribery money to falsify reports about a foreign company.
Now the new expression will be subject to a "extensive rectification", the regulatory authority explained.
The rectification order was issued by the Press and Publications Authority, Radio, Film and Television in Guangdong.
Preliminary findings showed that the New Express, which belongs to the Yangcheng Evening News Group, had published several inappropriate reports between September 2012 and August 2013 about the listed company Zoomlion.
"The editorial management of the New Express was unordered," the regulatory authority announced in a statement.
She said it was decided to “enforce an administrative penalty for Chen Yongzhou and withdraw his reporter's license”.
In addition, the Yangcheng Evening News Group has been instructed to undertake a complete rectification of the New Express and to recommend that the relevant responsible persons be identified in the New Express and to review immediately the leadership team of the New Express."
Chen had written several articles for the New Express in which he reported on alleged financial irregularities in a manufacturer of construction machines called Zoomlion.
After he was arrested, the newspaper published two calls for his release on the title page and stood behind his journalistic work.
But then Chen came up on state television and reported that he had published false reports against payment.
"In this case, I have damaged Zoomlion as well as the entire news industry and its ability to gain public confidence," he explained against the CCTV.
I did it first because I was out of money and fame.
It has become clear to me that I have acted badly.
Following Chens' apology, the New Express issued an apology on the title page and explained that it was neglected to check the reports correctly.
Several well-known suspects have recently filed complaints on television.
Experts say that complaints are still routinely forced, despite a change in the law at the beginning of the year in which the authorities were prohibited from forcing others to accuse themselves.
Drug tunnels with their own railway between the USA and Mexico discovered
One of the most refined tunnels for drug smuggling between the United States and Mexico, which was fully equipped with lighting, ventilation and electric railway operations, has now been discovered.
The U.S. authorities described the 120 times 90 centimeter tunnel as one of the most flawed passages they have ever found.
The tunnel, which runs over a length of almost six football fields, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
In the area there are countless invisible warehouses, which makes it easier to hide LKWs loaded with drugs.
The tunnel was closed before drugs could be transported there, the authorities explained.
At the discovery of the tunnel, eight-and-a-half tons of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine were secured, so the Court's records were recorded.
Three men, who, according to the statement of the authorities, worked as a driver, were charged for the possession and intended sale of Marihuana and cocaine.
You are threatened with prison sentences between ten years and life.
In Nogales, Arizona, schmugglers place on an extensive underground network of drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eight large passage that has been discovered since 2006 in San Diego.
Some of the biggest tunnels were discovered after the Marihuana harvest in Central Mexico in October, which presents the drug cartels with the challenge of how they can quickly bring their product to consumers.
In 2010, authorities found a nearly 640 meters long passage with rails, which ran from a kitchen in a residential house in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr still love each other
Players Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr want to go separate ways in the future.
In an interview, however, Bloom said that he and Kerr still love each other.
Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom are parents of two years old Flynn.
Artist Orlando Bloom has expressed himself in separating himself from his wife, Top Model Miranda Kerr.
In an interview with U.S. journalist Katie Couric, who was supposed to be broadcast on Friday (location time), Bloom said, "Life sometimes does not go exactly as we plan or hope it".
Kerr and he still loved each other, stressed the 36-year-old.
"We will support each other and love each other as Flynn's parents."
Kerr and Bloom have been married since 2010, and her son Flynn was born in 2011.
Veganism, according to Lexika, is subject to Vegetarianism, but it is quite different from this.
Because while vegetarians allow the consumption of seeds, ice, or a strong edamer, these weeds are not on the food map of a veganer.
Milk, cheese, eggs, in addition to meat and fish, the vegan leaves off all consumption of animal products - also honey is destroyed.
What remains is to be asked, but in closer consideration, the vegan food world is characterized by a remarkable ability of influence.
"Brothers are very popular," explains Ute Henkelmann, the owner of the house of the reform house, who provides a variety of special products for Veganers.
Reuben Proctor also likes to visit the shop in the domgasse.
For 13 years, the native New Zealander vegan has lived, in Lampertheim he will find everything he needs to live. "In 1997 I changed my diet and became a vegetarian."
At the turn of the century, the next step took, and I became a Veganer.
"But the conviction came not only because of the diet, but because of the choice of shoes," says Proctor, the artist prefers normal leather.
He recognized that there are other daily concerns without animal products.
First of all, vegan is an ethics.
"I don't want animals to die for me," Proctor says the maximum of the Vegans, which extends to the whole consumer behaviour.
Instead of trusting in burgers, pipes or rubbers, the Veganer has quickly discovered new products, and the enthusiasm has increased.
"It's a double bonus," said Proctor today, "actually his vegan is no excuse, no ascetics, but it's an extension." The assumption that with the food exchange you reduce the selection of food options, Proctor takes back to the power of the habit.
And precisely these conditions also caused some to fail such well-meaning attempts.
"The search factor is a very decisive factor that allows many to give up quickly, like smoking," Proctor presents a comparison.
And say, "Some tasters are not to be found on the beast."
Often it is the spices or the type of preparation that make up the flavor.
"But you can also produce the same effect in other ways," explains the Veganer.
For example, Proctor brings Aubergines, Champignons and a few Vegan herbs to a barbecue.
He takes into account a balanced, varied diet, in which it should taste perfectly even once.
Of course you want something between the teeth, that's legitimate.
"It's supposed to taste, but it's not just to reduce animal food," said Proctor.
Health damage up to eating disorders, a further widespread acceptance, he has not suffered.
For me, conversion had a positive aspect.
I don't take any foreign cholesterol and I have an increased vitamin count.
There are high-performance athletes who only feed on vegan.
"My blood values are fine, I let myself be checked often," betrays Proctor.
Especially in the face of the lack of vitamin B12, many Vegansimos critics warn.
"When animals are fed with feed instead of grass on the grass, it is questionable whether in the meat that is bought in the refrigerator, the vitamin B12 is high," says Proctor.
For Veganer there is also the possibility to take Coenzyme in the form of tablets.
"My B12 values are fine," he explains.
A wide range of ways Proctor did not have to go for food purchase.
Finally, there is food everywhere and every supermarket now has sojamilch and other products.
I'll find everything I need.
I'm just buying something special.
"Many people ignore the fact that only the finished products are expensive, but so it is also known for "normal" finished products".
However, the preparation of vegan courts was far more favourable and less time-consuming than generally accepted.
"In the kitchen there is a lot to discover, with a few small knuckles you can do well if you don't get some better results," said Proctor.
Margarine instead of butter, slightly more powder and carbonic acid instead of egg, with his vegan cheese cake, Proctor could also bring his grandparents to the ground.
Family parties give the Veganer a new kiss.
It has dynamics, when you cook together, it has a new value.
"The situations that can arise in this are as different as the people themselves," said Proctor.
Of course, he was already faced with Skeps.
Don't you like my food anymore?
"If I feel bad now because I drink milk?" - in such questions, you have to act as a vegetarian with a touch of finger.
"I don't deny the people, I'm part of this society," Proctor doesn't want to delay an enclave.
And more precisely, the day-to-day world does not appear as vegan as likely - and the Vegan is not as limited in everyday life as generally accepted.
Fast food is also allowed.
There's apples everywhere!
"Many dolls offer falafel, or just a vegetarian yufka," said Proctor.
In a pizzeria he deviates to pasta dishes, or orders a pizza without cheese, all a question of the habit.
The restaurants are so slow about it.
"When I started feeding vegan 13 years ago, everything was even more difficult," the New Zealand can make a development: "You have to talk to the people, they pay attention to it."
"If enough requests come, they may be inclined to supplement the food card," he hopes.
Vegane restaurants develops, such as the Mannheim Kombüse or the Café Vogelfrei.
Proctor wishes that other restaurants also have at least one vegan court on the menu.
Basically vegan courts are for everyone there.
Everyone can eat it, so they're exactly the opposite of exclusive.
"The meat dishes are exclusive on the other hand, and in the true sense of the word, because they exclude others," Proctor states.
"If you want to avoid food scandals, Veganism is a safe way to make most of the above impossible," Proctor says.
The purchase of vegan products, however, may at first be somewhat difficult.
In particular, if one learns to understand that animal additives can also be included in earthnuts as colouring agents, it seems to leave the courage quickly to follow the ethics of so many horrors and falls.
Not only has Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen written a book: "Veganissimo - Animal Ingredients and their Alternatives" explains the many ingredients that are added to food but also cleaning products.
"After and after you develop a scanview and know what signs and logos you have to observe "Sometimes it's better to take small steps than to stand or stick," says Proctor.
Veganism, it is an important moral fingerprint that strikes the conscience.
He may not be able to completely abandon his habits, but at least he can teach consumers to question his habits critically.
The stock exchange operator Nasdaq OMX keeps its customers in breath.
Trade in the Nasdaq Options Market was interrupted on Friday morning in Germany.
The operator was responsible for technical problems in a communication.
The other eleven US option markets, including two of the Nasdaq OMX, continued their business uninterrupted.
The latest case continues a whole series of smaller and larger pans with the stock exchange operator.
Only on Tuesday, the Nasdaq indices were not calculated for an hour due to data transport errors.
In August this year, there were only two pans in one week.
First, the US Investment Bank Goldman Sachs sent massively defective purchase orders to the option markets due to technical problems.
After that, the stock exchangers needed almost a day to look through and stretch the orders.
Two days later, half of the total stock exchange in the United States came to an end because of a computer tape at the Nasdaq stock exchange for several hours.
Also, in the last year, Facebook's stock exchange had taken care of.
The Nasdaq systems had not grown the flow of purchases and sales orders, later established the stock exchange supervision SEC and sentenced the company to a record penalty of $10 million.
Constance: Wheeler carries 63-year-olds around
The accident was reported by the police when a 26-year-old man on Thursday night at 22 a.m. was on his way with a lady's bike in an orderly way on the left road from the station to the market place.
When a 63-year-old man came from a local on the road, the bike driver said he could no longer stop the police in time.
On the following collision, the pedestrian was pushed against the house wall, went to the ground in the further run and pulled a 15 centimeter long wall to the head.
A rescue team brought the injured to the clinic for medical treatment.
Assange is a British police officer who issued a letter of delivery
Today, the British police have issued an extradition order to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who sought refuge in the ecuadorian message in London and applied for asylum.
Scotland Yard explained that he had been assigned to Australia at the age of 40 a 'commission to face up to' which called for him to appear in a police station, and added that he should not comply with it, threatened him with the arrest.
Assange threatens the extradition to Sweden because of the charge in a sexual delicacy after its possibilities have been exhausted under British law, since the Supreme Court rejected its objection to the extradition at the beginning of the month.
Fearing that Stockholm would deliver him to the United States, he sought refuge in the ecuadorian message in London on June 19th and asked the South American country for political asylum.
Scotland Yard has given “a 40-year-old man an invitation to sit at a time chosen by us at a police station,” one speaker explained.
He continues to violate the conditions of his release on bail.
The message did not comment on the provision of the police call.
Assange is afraid that he will be delivered from Sweden to the United States and will be charged there for possible spyings after he has published over 250,000 diplomatic messages on the WikiLeaks entertainment website.
A driver with 210 km/h and a hot drink between the legs gets 1,000 pounds of punishment
A driver was sentenced to a fine of £1,000 because he had been riding up to 210 km/h and a hot drink between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, from Tiptree, Essex, was arrested on May 27th with his Mercedes Benz at the A120 at Braintree.
After he was arrested by the police, they discovered the drinking cup between his legs.
Before the Court of Justice Colchester, Howie was guilty of not having the necessary care and attention.
He received seven points and a six-month driving ban.
Howie was also sentenced to a cost of $90 and a bid of £100.
Tax on foreign real estate owners against London's speculative blow
The Ministry of Finance has provisionally calculated the CGT measure, but is still waiting for the final decision of Treasury Chancellor George Osborne, who in the 2012 budget had imposed a stamp tax of 7 % on apartments that cost more than two million pounds and annual fees for buyers who hold apartments as a firm and not as individuals.
Already, the income from the stamp tax for housing in the Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea districts, which were at 708 million pounds in the 2012/13 fiscal year, is already higher than the income for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the Northeast, Northwest, Yorkshire and the Humber region.
Cook said: “After the increase in stamp tax on high-priced flats and the introduction of the related legislation against circumvention, high-quality properties can be claimed to be too low, regardless of the impact of the old system of taxes.”
"But this step could make some foreign investors less restrained, as regards the purchase of properties in London, or the sale of owners from it," he added.
First-class properties – the top five to ten percent of the apartment market at price – in the well-being of Southwest London, which extends from Fulham to Wimbledon, have been estimated at 11.8% in the last year.
The prices in Central London showed an even annual growth of 5.6%, but were overestimated by an emerging 'inland market' on which the south-west part of the city, the north (7.4%) and the east (6.5%) experienced an upward trend, such as an investigation by Savillas.
Scientists were able to shed more light on the context in which a dog's whizzing is with his voice.
Previous research had shown that happy dogs with the tail were turning more to the right (from the dog's point of view), while it was the left side in the case of nervous dogs.
But now scientists say that other dogs can see and react to these subtle differences.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscience at the University of Trent, said: “People are well aware that the left and right brains are reacting differently to stimuli, causing positive or negative emotions."
Here we have tried to see this in other species.
He also noted that in dogs, just like in humans, the right brain is responsible for the movement of the left side and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played different roles in the emotions.
In order to learn more about how dogs react to the side swinging of their species, the researchers monitored the animals while these films came up with other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of the four bones and analyzed the behavior.
We'll probably understand why the tail moves one way or the other.
Professor Vallortigara said: “We have shown the dog films with dogs – either a naturally trusted version or a silhouette to eliminate derogating other aspects, and thus we were able to control the movement of the dog more to the left or the right.”
When the animals saw how another voiceless dog moved the tail to the right (seeed from the perspective of the waving dog), they remained completely relaxed.
However, the inclination was mainly to the left (from the perspective of the dog, who wanders) and their heart rate rose and they looked uneasy.
According to Professor Vallordigara, the dogs do not communicate deliberately through these movements.
Rather, he is convinced that the dogs have learned from experience in which movements they should worry and when not.
He said: “If you have different encounters with other dogs and the wiring is linked to a more friendly behavior and the right-hand side produces a less friendly behavior, then you react on the basis of these experiences.”
The researchers say that the findings could help dog owners, veterinarians and trainers to better understand the emotions of their animal.
John Bradshaw, an expert on dog behavior and guest scholarship at the Faculty of Animal Health at Bristol, explained that this was not the first study in which it was investigated whether left and right were important for dogs.
Last year a team at Lincoln University found out that dogs turn their heads left when they see an aggressive dog, and on the right when it's a satisfied dog.
In another research work at the University of Victoria, Canada, the following was: “Shungs go to a robot dog, if it is , swwanz’ to the left and not to the right, instead to become restless – just as different as in the Italian study.”
According to his statement, the differences could lead to the fact that the dogs in the various studies did not interpret the animals in the films or the robot dogs as dogs.
A study of how dogs react to real dogs could help, he explained.
“Although there are significant evidence for many different mammals that the two brains are used for different purposes, many of the details still need to be determined – and dogs are no exception,” says Bradshaw.
But since her behavior is easy to record, it probably won't take long until we understand why the cock sometimes moves in the one direction, sometimes in the other direction.
Arctic Monkeys moved to Glasgow because of Alex Turners' illness
The Arctic Monkeys rock band has moved a performance in Glasgow after her lead singer has been diagnosed with kehlkopfentzintung.
The band from Sheffield should play in the hydro on Friday.
Because of the disease of the lead singer Alex Turner, however, the concert must now be postponed.
The announcement of the band came after she had had to move a performance in the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on their official website, the Arctic Monkeys reported: “After the decision to cancel the show at the LG Arena in Birmingham tonight and on medical advice, the Arctic Monkeys also have to cancel the show at the Hydro in Glasgow on Friday, November 1st.”
"In Alex Turner, a keel kepfentsintung was diagnosed, so unfortunately he can't occur."
The show at the LG Arena in Birmingham will be held on 20 November, which was placed in the Hydro in Glasgow on 21 November.
All tickets remain valid for this show.
We apologize for the inconveniences caused by all the ticket owners.

Pope Francis appointed the first Cardinal in February
Pope Francis was first called a new cardinal of the Catholic Church on 22 February, as the Vatican announced on Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest clergy in the Catholic Church after the Pope, and they are also those who choose a Pope, so that Francis will name the first group of men who will finally be involved in the election of his successor.
Currently there are 201 Cardinals.
However, a cardinal who has reached the age of 80 can no longer participate in the pope’s chair – this is true of a group of 120 ‘elected cardinals’.
In a statement in which the message was announced, Father Federico Lombardi, a speaker of the Vatican, said that there will be a meeting of all cardinals before the ceremony to appoint the new cardinals, which is also known as the Consistorium, will be held.
"Dapst Franciskus has decided to announce his decision to convene the Consistency in February in advance so that other meetings, which require the participation of Cardinals from all over the world, can be planned," Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that the number of eligible cardinals would probably be reduced until February.
He explained that a Pope normally appoints as many cardinals as necessary in order for the number of eligible cardinals to be 120 again, and so many cardinals over 80 as he wishes.
The Consistorium is therefore important next year because it was the first since the election of Francis in March of this year, so Valero.
At present, there is a certain overhang on the side of Europe and in particular Italy.
"It will be interesting to see if the new Pope will remove Cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance," he said.
Forty percent of Catholics live in South America, but they only have a small number of cardinals.
The Cardinals will also be the first to be called after the formation of the Council of Cardinals founded by Francis, to find a group of eight cardinals from all over the world who have the task of finding ways to reform the Church.
In the past, the Pope decided everything on his own.
"Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him," said Valero.
He explained that it was "good possible", that Francis asked the Cardinals for advice.
But so far we haven't been in this situation – that's all new.
Valero said that the bishops would typically be called from great places to cardinals, but Francis was “full of surprises – so we don’t know who he is.
GM calls for new pickup trucks in the United States to repair the seats
General Motors calls back almost 19,000 of its brand new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra Pickup trucks with construction year 2014 to resolve a problem with the manually adjustable seat, so a communication from the US Regulatory Authority for Vehicle Safety on Friday.
In some of the cars, there may be a defect in the mechanism for restoring the front seats.
For this reason, they do not comply with the Federal Directive on vehicle safety in case of head restraints.
“If the head restraints are not properly protected, so there is an increased risk of injury”, the message was to be read on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) website.
The models recalled were produced between 1 August and 10 September.
The delivery of GM trucks began in June and represents the main start of the leading US car manufacturer since the insolvency restructuring in 2009.
GM informed the vehicle owners in the first half of October about the defect.
The NHTSA could not verify the notification letter due to the 16-day Shutdown government, which had a negative impact on car sales in October.
The sale of Silverado and Sierra Trucks, which were newly developed for the model year 2014, was increased by 20 percent in the first ten months of the year, GM explained on Friday.
In October, GM 42,660 sold Silverado and 16,503 Sierra Pickup trucks.
The GM stock rose at the New York stock exchange by 1.4 percent to $37.47 on Friday afternoon.

I have chosen President Obama twice in the hope that change will be possible
He says that Obama has made commendable efforts that have been avoided by the block-adeactivism of the Republicans
Blockage policy does not blame Obamacare's website problems, the drug attacks
Obama's memoirs about the 2008 election will be a sad reminder of what would have been possible
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second-year student at Harvard Medical School.
I'm now reading a terrible sad book.
It's a book that I've believed would raise me during the troubled second year of my medical study and give me hope again.
It is called "The Audacity to Win" and describes the memoirs Barack Obamas for the 2008 presidential election.
When I'm done with my patient subscriptions in the evening and go to bed, then the book brings me back to a time when politics inspired millions and for a reason could steal the breath.
The election was held as an earthly victory and as a news speaker in order to convey the historical significance of this hour in front of the eyes.
My classmates cried out for joy and my parents collected all the newspapers they could find.
A young team of visionaries was on their way to the White House and the nation was ready for change.
When Obama moved to the office in 2008, he had a voting rate of 82%.
And then I close the book.
Switching back to the present is a bad wake, as if you're getting kicked out of a dream.
It is hard to remember these optimistic times – they seem to be a vague memory, a sad opinion of missed opportunities.
In the years since I first gave my voice, something has really changed.
But it's just nothing I could have imagined.
I recognize the great and diverse things Obama has achieved, from the adoption of the Affordable Care Act for Disease Insurance to the military withdrawal from Iraq, the end of the forced denial of homosexuality in the army and the killing of Osama bin Ladens.
I also believe that the partial block adactics have made too many efforts with which our nation should be brought forward: immigration reform, a public option for health insurance and the closure of Guantanamo Bay to name only a few.
But once I have defended Obama's government against colleagues and acquaintances countless times, I am faced with my attempts to explain it at the end.
I have reached a point of political despair.
The Republican blockage policy cannot explain why it allows the hearing of foreign heads of state or the killing of innocent children by drones in overseas.
It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data on the privacy of Americans and why Whistleblower is punished to expose the state's misconduct.
It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki, a U.S. citizen, has been murdered without a procedure and why public funding and spending limits are being exceeded during the presidential elections.
It does not justify the results of a report, in which the efforts of the White House to calm the media are the most "aggressive" ... since the Nixon government.
And recently, it cannot excuse the inability to design a simple website in which more than three years after the adoption of the Affordable Care Act.
I don't know if that's what I should have expected.
I should have understood with 18 that government work could be contrary to its previous political campaigns.
Obviously, the honourable Member is not a predictable course, since an opposition party and random events such as the Newtown massacre mark the public debate.
But if I look at the examples mentioned above, they seem to be largely elected by the government itself.
And most of the time, that's what bothers me.
I re-elected Obama in 2012, not because I was excited about his candidacy.
In the midst of Romney, it was a confusing and unexplained alternative that he did not seem to be able to determine his direction and positions.
I had the impression that a second time for Obama, free of the pressure of future elections, would fulfill the hope that we had heard for so long.
However, with the decrease in Obama's voting rates to less than 45% this week, the return to 2008 has become so much harder by this book.
It awakens in me the desire to see the many promises that have been resolved in the air.
This week, I read a section in the book that describes how Obama had to incur a serious loss against Clinton in the Pennsylvania elections.
In a meeting with the electors after the decision, he told his employees that they should come back to the course and follow the purpose of their case.
"I want us to find our magic again," he said.
We need to remember who we are.
It's five years later, Mr. President, and I couldn't agree more.
The views expressed in this comment are exclusively those of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claims Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest in parental leave
The billionaire and MP Clive Palmer say Prime Minister Tony Abbott is standing in a conflict of interest in his plans for parental leave because his daughters are becoming pregnant and can therefore benefit from it.
The Bergbaumagnat, who was in a judicial dispute over the payment of $6 million in CO2 taxes, raised the claim that he wanted to erase questions from the table whether he was in a conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which are important for the decision whether to cut or cut the CO2 and mining taxes.
But Palmer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest and that the daughters of Abbott would benefit personally from the laws.
“He is in a big conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave, because when one of his daughters becomes pregnant, he has a direct interest in whether or not she receives a vacation,” Palmer said.
Two months after the election, the Palmer Election Commission officially declared that it had 53 votes in favour after the recalculation for the winner of the Sunshine Coast seat of Fairfax.
Palmer called for a review of the process of counting the vote so that these people would be better rewarded.
Tony Abbott's daughters Frances and Bridget.
Whether these elections should be decided two months after the end of the voting period.
"We need a better system," he said.
Why should we not have a system in which data is marched into a computer, picked immediately and then got the result at 6:30 p.m. in the evening?
Palmer also criticised the use of cheerleaders when marking the voting list.
Do you use it because you can radiate the results if you don't like one?
To vote with cheerleaders today is incredible.
The Election Commission has examined the options for an electronic election and recently published a joint legislative proposal with New Zealand.
Palmer, 59, explained that his policy is an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he will take his new office “very seriously”.
In the case of a public office, it is the service of the public.
"We strive for no reward except history, that is, that we can serve in a critical time of this community," he said.
RBS suspends two foreign exchange dealers
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two dealers from its foreign exchange office, so two people who are familiar with the situation; this is another indication that the global government investigation into the necessary manipulations in the currency market is rapidly taking place.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are cooperating with the authorities in the world's largest financial market investigations, at which USD 5.3 billion per day is exchanged.
The two dealers would be the first RBS employees to be suspended in the extensive investigation that the scandal is taking place around the Libor interbank business.
The Bank, which did not comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it had received information requests from the authorities.
"Our investigations on this issue continue and we cooperate fully with the FCA and other regulatory authorities," the Bank said two weeks ago.
Last month, the situation revealed that the RBS forwarded the records of e-mails and instant messages sent from and to an earlier dealer to the UK Supervisory Authority, which was the Financial Conduct Authority.
This dealer, Richard Usher, had left the RBS in 2010 and is currently supposed to be allowed from his current position as European leader of the Forex spot store at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of the European Spot Trading at Citi, was allowed this week and Matt Gardiner, former leading currency dealer at Barclays and UBS, was suspended this week at Standard Chartered.
No such trader was proposed for any misbehaviour.
To the instant message group of Usher, bankers at Barclays and the Citigroup, said the situation is close to people.
UBS announced this week that it had taken steps against some of its employees after the Swiss regulatory authority Finma had declared that it was investigating a moderate manipulation of the foreign exchange market in a number of Swiss banks.
At least six authorities worldwide – the European Commission, Finna, the Swiss Competition Authority Weko, the FCA, the US Ministry of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are currently dealing with proposals to which banks should agree on transactions in the currency market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse also started internal investigations or received information requests from authorities, said trusted persons.
Banks run instant messages and e-mails from several years looking for cases of misconduct.
The news of these investigations has raised concerns among traders in an area that has been one of the most profitable trading units of investment banks in recent years, but this year has been under pressure because low volatility in currencies limits the chances for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to downplay the deal and said it is almost impossible to manipulate the enlarged and highly liquid foreign exchange market, but leading traders believe that this is not necessarily true.
A leading trader noted that despite the enormous daily volume of foreign exchange trade, the fragmentation of liquidity between the different trading platforms and the increasing use of its own internal platforms by banks can lead to the fact that “the market can already be affected by very low ticket prices”.
The message came out the same day as Credit Suisse announced, she announced this week a dealer of her London Exchange Traded Fund offices after he had caused a loss of almost six million dollars in the last year.
The Bank promptly informed the competent authorities and cooperated with them.
"We are sure that the dealer has acted alone and that the matter has been raised," said Credit Suisse.
The building is painted on the Bechtle Foundation
A group of citizens' initiative "Schweizer Weise" has decorated the building on the Bechtle ground at the Kurpromenade in Bad Herrenalb.
She also cleaned up and spread the walk, which is in a press release.
The planned cover of the destroyed house in the back of the property was not allowed for safety reasons, as the site was threatened to be removed.
Alfred Abel, who is currently managing the property, had agreed with his colleague Reinhard Domke from the BI.
Before the operation of the BI, a transparency with the message "We are for it" was introduced.
However, the approximately 20 members of the citizens' initiative were not affected by their actions.
Her motto on the big poster was "We are against the Bauruins".
So she wanted to point to the danger of even bigger ruins on the Swiss meadow - the giant project should fail one day.
In a conversation with many passengers before the "Building" it was clear that some citizens believe that it will be much better to carry out the project of the city, although not few have the same questions about the dimension of the project presented as the BI.
But they start resigning because the city continues to raise these answers, it's on the side of the BI.
As was the case, the public statements of the mayor also appeared.
In May, at the municipal meeting, he had said that he feared the use of the thermal bath, the population should vote against the plans for a bathing and wellness complex in the Swiss meadow.
Some appear to be rather frightened, others feel "pumped pressure" in the population, that is to say, in the BI press release.
The BI thanked the donor for the color and all the helpers.
Ranknick's shell for Schiris: No Schwalbenking
Ralf Rangnick is also satisfied with the current high-level form of the Bundesliga table guide Red Bull Salzburg, and the sports director of the "bulls" was disappointed.
"There is currently a dangerous tendency for Mane and Alan to be forced into the category of Schwalbenkings," he took the two offensive virulents on Thursday at a press conference in Salzburg in protection.
The youngest occasion for Ranknick's criticism was Yellow for Man at 3:0 against Grodig on the last Sunday, when Senegalese became a supposed showcase for hanging - which was not freely as the TV images showed.
"A severe failure," said Ranknick, the judge Harkam as "completely overreached".
Harkam would also have contributed "his part" to the escalation between Salzburg-Coach Roger Schmidt and Grodig-trainer Adi Hütter after the party.
His German Landsmann protested: "I would have treated myself like Roger Schmidt in every situation."
Schmidt himself wants to have no contact with his colleague after the scarf with his hat.
I didn't know why.
"For I am the one who has been persecuted," stressed the 46-year-old.
In view of the success of the race, Ranknick agreed to a lobby.
"There are only two words for that," he noted.
There's not much to put off.
Especially the way the team plays is impressive.
It's supposed to go on like this.
There will be hardly any changes in the winter transfer time.
There are no great reasons to change something.
"Besides a player, it comes with the desire that he wants to leave the association," said Ranknick.
Supreme Court confirms Obama's Health Act
It is a great victory for the Obama government: The U.S. Supreme Court today decided that the health law closely linked to Barack Obama is constitutional.
With five to four votes, the judges decided that the individual member of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – it obliges US citizens to complete a health insurance or to pay a penalty – is constitutionally within the framework of the State's tax authority.
The Supreme Judge John Roberts fought on the side of the four more liberal members of the Chamber, while the Judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy decided against it.
The Court also confirmed the remaining sections of the 2700-page laws and also expressed the view that the health legislation provided by the Federal States should either extend the conditions for access to Medicaid or delete all State Medicaid claims, without prejudice to the Constitution.
The appeal procedure against the law was imposed by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The Act was rejected by all the leading Republican presidential candidates, including the last challenge in the Middle Romney race in 2012.
Norway: Norwegian place with giant mirrors Light
With huge mirrors, the inhabitants of a Norwegian village brought light to their dark valley.
Due to the low sunfall, the river Rjukan, located in the Vestfjord valley, usually falls from autumn to spring in the shadow of the surrounding mountains.
With three giant reflectors at 45 meters high, a century’s dream came true on Wednesday.
"Finally!", Mayor Steinar Bergsland heated at the opening ceremony in the broadcaster TV2.
Some of the inhabitants of Tallinn correctly stood up sunglasses, others set up safety half sunglasses.
So far, during the winter, the sun was going on a sailing trail on a nearby summit.
Ten years ago the local artist Martin Andersen presented the proposal to link the beams with mirrors into the valley.
But this basic idea has existed since 1913 in the place.
After several years of debate, the City Council finally approved the 5 million crowns (about EUR 615,000).
A similar construction has been providing the Italian Alps Viganella winter sunlight for several years.
Can not get message: %s %s
"Many citizens will not have noticed that the red points for the Sunday break are still on various mailboxes of the city and the city parts, but if you read the small printed on the yellow containers of Post AG, you will quickly find out that the break on Sundays and holidays is no longer taking place," the FDP tells.
A request from the FDP confirmed this.
On Sundays and holidays, only before the post building in Ernst-Ludwig Street 36 and in Jacob-Müller Street 1 will be taught in Hüttenfeld.
Whether in Hofheim and Rosengarten is also taught on Sundays, the answer to the FDP's request will not be answered.
The social and youth-political speaker of the FDP, Fritz Röhrenbeck, wants to talk about this.
The Sunday lecture is an important post office.
"This company is making radically and irreplaceable in spite of the increase in prices for letters in January 2013.
Thomas Bittner, president of the Liberals' Group and the City Association, supports his colleagues: "What I'm upset about is the fact that here the times of exile will be changed or also deleted.
From nearby citizens, the post is located in the heart of the city.
"At least the mailboxes in the districts of Neuschloß and Rosengarten must be taught again on Sunday," says Bittner and Röhrenbeck unisono.
For the city of Kern, particularly non-mobile citizens should also be able to reach a mailbox with sunscreening on a foot-and-mouth basis.
Röhrenbeck asked the city parliament if the city administration was planning talks with the post about this matter.
Mayor Erich Maier replied that the post did not communicate with Lampertheim.
His knowledge, however, also exists in Hofheim.
Your party has spoken of privatisations.
"Then decisions were made elsewhere," said Maier.
Frankfurter Park Fees to Increase Strongly
Parking in Frankfurt could soon become more expensive.
The city's magistrate advises this morning on a presentation by transport deserter Stefan Majer (Green).
The parking fee should therefore be increased by 50 per cent.
However, the prices should not be increased, but the time interval of parking hours and parking cars should be reduced from 30 to 20 minutes.
In December, the City Board of Governors will have to decide.
The retail committee of the IHK Frankfurt holds the "no good idea".
The possibility of parking immediately before the business is "a non-estimating advantage for smaller dealers".
The German transport club believes that an increase after two decades is "at once appropriate and actually longer overdue".
Public transport will also be more expensive.
Freudenstadt: Fast action surprise host
With a narrow cadre, the men of the TSV city of Feudenstadt in the Schiller-Sculturnhalle in Reutlingen had to enter against the TG Gönningen from the Swiss Alb.
The old men stood with an experienced team on the other side of the network.
Soon, however, it turned out that they, even under the age of, could not fully support the rapid actions of the friendly cities.
With the hard and well-placed attacks, the gönninger did very hard.
Again, they missed the tracks and attacks of Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz cleanly over the network center and were not in place in the block defense.
Two high first sentences clearly expressed the superiority of the city of pleasure in all interests.
In view of this impressive and decisive performance, the third sentence was then won a little lasciviously to 3:0 (25:13, 25:14, 25:22).
On 2 November, with the TV bayiersbronn, which was clearly able to carry out in Nagold, there will be a much stronger opponent in the field.
TSV Freudenstadt I: Dominik Bäuerle, Yannik Büchle, Sebastian Dölker, Felix Pälchen, Stefan Räller, Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz.
In the B-Class, the second teams from Baiersbronn and Freudenstadt were in the Murgtalhalle in Baiersbronn.
They delivered a hard fight two-hour match.
Nervousness on both sides caused mainly when taking the ball and giving points; also at the feet was precision due to lack of software and in some critical games, the superior prevented the view of possible score gains.
In this highly competitive encounter, Marcus Blasutto's TSV team agreed through the great physical use and a pleasant commitment of both teams.
Care day at the small English cabin
At the same time, a group of interested participants met in the small English cabin in Ibach, following the 2000 project of the Upper Hotzenwald.
As a result of suggestions from the population, this day in the area of the shelter of sight should be cut to the ground," said Mayor Helmut Kaiser.
Many hikers, so Kaiser, described this area as the glazing piece of the cliff on which the landscape offers the ideal framework for wonderful views.
He thanked the representatives for their willingness to cooperate and stressed that the day of care was an appropriate instrument to strengthen the connection of man and nature.
It offers every citizen the opportunity to put accents in nature itself.
At the same time as the tourist aspect, environmental considerations can also be found.
This ecological aspect explained Friederike Tribukait from the Department of Natural Protection of the Government of Freiburg following the greeting by Landrat Tilman Bollacher, who had taken over the Screening and wished the action a good success.
According to Tribukait, the tourist destination of the wide view is to obtain the long growing old Allmendweid field with its specific protected types of living space by opening and connecting to the existing pastures.
Certain species, such as rare smoldering and gray-haired, cannot overcome barriers in the form of forest surfaces.
They need these free connections to maintain species.
Tribukait said she didn't want to miss it in this place to break a gap for the planned biosphere area.
In this plan, the current measure does not only apply closely.
A biospheric area also offers the opportunity to sustain economic and environmental development on the basis of the internationally recognized Unesco status and thus a continuous addition to the life project as well as the previous maintenance days for the future.
After these various performances, Rivier Director Christoph Wehle and Life Project Manager Cornelia Bishop shared the help in groups.
The larger trees had already been hit in the foreground, the forstschler was ready to call, if necessary.
A group of helpers should take care of the release of Wacholder boxes and the maintenance of a dry stone line.
The goal was the free view at the point of view.
Runnings: Buyers still the only candidate
Information on the Internet: Although the Baarstädtchen Löffingen with its 7514 inhabitants, an intact infrastructure, a future-oriented school, child, youth and senior policy, as well as its own urban works as an attractive city, has not yet reported a second mayor candidate.
As the only candidate for the succession of the no longer running mayor Norbert Brugger for age reasons, the 46-year-old banker and the business manager Dieter Köpfler of Löffingen has so far been appointed.
The application period will expire on Monday 11 November at 6 p.m.
Google, Samsung, Huawei because of Nortel patents
The group, with thousands of previous Northel patents, made a firm appeal on Thursday for patent infringement against mobile manufacturers, including Google, the company that was banned from him during the insolvent increase of Northel.
Rockstar, the consortium that bought the Northel patents for $4.5 billion, announced Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies because of patent violations in front of the U.S. District Court in Texas.
Rockstar is located in the community of Apple, Microsoft, BlackBerry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is detected in seven cases of patent infringement.
The patents concern technology that brings terms of search on the Internet with relevant advertising, so the complaint that hits the core of Google's search engine business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not directly accessible.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC present phones that work with Google's Android operating system, which is in sharp competition for Apple and Microsoft's mobile products.
In 2011, Google issued an initial bid of over 900 million dollars for the nortel patents.
Google has increased its offer several times and recently offered 4.4 billion US dollars.
After being handed over to the Northel patents by Rockstar, Google Motorola Mobility acquired $12.5 billion, a business that was also motivated by patents as part of Motorola's library.
“Even though Google has failed to acquire the patents in the auction, Google has damaged the patents and continues to do so,” he wrote.
Rockstar claims a high amount of damage from Google, since it claims Google's patent infringement is intentional, so the charge.
Egypt's first freely elected president
Mohammed Mursi leaves the office, but his day of triumph must not mean the end of political disputes in Egypt.
Islamist Mohammed Mursi promised a “new Egypt” when he was banned as the first freely elected president of the country and the successor of Husni Mubarak, who had been expelled 16 months before.
With its establishment before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Mursi has also been the first freely elected Islamic president of the Arab world and Egypt's fifth head of state since the fall of the monarchy about 60 years ago.
He laid down the oath before the 18 judges dressed in black Roben, who had his seat at the Nile and found an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We are striving for a better future, a new Egypt and a second Republic," Mursi said at the celebration ceremony, which was broadcast live on public television.
"Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom, real democracy and stability," said 60-year-old Mursi, an engineer trained in the United States and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group, who has been taken to vision since its establishment 84 years ago as a banned organization from the respective government.
Hundreds of soldiers and police guard the building when Mursi arrived shortly after eleven hours of local time in a small car convoy.
Only a few hundred supporters had gathered in front of the court to cheer the new president, and, unlike the presidium punk from the Mubarak time, the traffic was stopped only for a short time so that the convoy could cross the normally inhabited street that connects the city centre to the southern suburbs.
As an uncharismatic "resurrection wheel" of the brotherhood, his personal prestige has increased since his victory and a free speech, in which he not only presented himself as a candidate for Islamists, but all those who wanted to target the rebellion of 2011 against the authoritarian Mubarak.
"Egypt is today a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," Mursi declared the judges in the wooden chamber in which he placed the seat in a blue suit with red tie.
Mursi later went to the University of Cairo, where he was to hold his interview.
He was officially welcomed by an army band that played the national anthem he heard in Habachtaposition.
The military leader Feldmarschall Hussein Tantawi was present.
On his arrival, he was welcomed by hundreds of residents in the largest auditorium of the university with talks by "The Army and the People are a Hand".
The University of Cairo, founded in 1908 as the foundation of secular education, has developed into a high school of Islamic students in the 1970s.
On Friday, Mursi dropped a symbolic oath on the Tahir Square, the birthplace of the rebellion, which led last year to the end of the authoritarian rule of Mubarak, and he promised to reclaim presidential powers that the military council had taken over from the head of state.
However, with the abolition of official oath before the court and not as usual before Parliament, he submits to the military's will, indicating that the struggle for power will continue.
Mursis spoke on the Tahir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
Falkenberger discothek provides for two great evenings
The new season in the Falkenberger discothek "Blue Velvet" has begun.
On today's Friday evening it's called "Pump this party", on the morning of Saturday it goes on with an O 25-party.
Fette Beats and cool sounds are naturally promised by the organizers on two days.
Workers were injured by managers: seriously injured
On Thursday, a 51-year-old worker in Eggelsberg was injured by a manager and injured.
The man from Lamprechthausen wanted to exchange a defective heat sensor at the outside facade of a guest house.
When he got up to the head of the roof, he pushed it away and the man crashed on the concrete floor.
He suffered serious injuries and was brought with the rescue screwer "Christophorus 6" to the Salzburg National Hospital.
Violent in South Africa: twice life imprisonment
Nine months after the brutal rape and rape of a 17-year-old girl in South Africa, the perpetrator was sentenced to life twice on Friday.
This was reported by the Messenger SABC.
The victim was later killed as a result of the serious injuries.
Johannes Kana had already been found guilty at the beginning of the week of the crime.
The fact had triggered national deployments.
The 21-year-old had raped Anne Boyysen in February in an industrial area in Bredasdorp near Cape Town.
The doctors fought for the survival of the victim for 14 hours, but were guilty.
The view of the young people was so intense that the caregivers and sisters needed psychological assistance.
Kana had admitted during the process to be in the evening with booys in a bar.
He was also able to beat them and raped them, but he argues to be responsible for the girl's death.
The police had first left several actors, but two suspects were released from prison because the evidence against them was not sufficient.
The Public Prosecutor also stressed during the procedure that Kana was alone at the time of the attack.
Violations in South Africa are almost daily: there are about 64 000 ads a year because of sexual violence.
This is almost ten times as much as in Germany, but with 82 million people, it has significantly more inhabitants than South Africa (50 million).
Police and women's associations in South Africa estimate the figure of darkness in sexual violence on the 10- to 25-fold.
Jumbo visits the Schinken Black Forest
Jumbo was looking for the "best ham of the world": for the TV broadcast "Galleo" the Pro7-Star Bondorf visited.
The speaker makes it clear right at the beginning: the most important for the ham are the pigs, Turbomast is not a good condition.
Can ham, which you get in every supermarket, be a quality product?
Uli as the head of the large ham factory in the Black Forest, Jumbo explains the way in which the company "Adler" works in Bonddorf.
"German's favorite hamken," as Jumbo announces the Black Forest hamken.
Only with hair protection and kittel he comes into the interior of the factory.
Jumbo also has to disinfect his hands for the first time before he can get to the micro.
Viewed Jumbo for strengthening fast limbs in foresthut
"Here I have a great deal of work to do here," said the Fernese-maker, Schinken Black Forest as a mass product.
16,000 cells per week speak for themselves.
Weight, Fat part, Color: Uli explains where it comes from the quality.
Most pigs are slaughtered for six months.
TV with level?
Details such as the ph-value of the meat also play a role.
The darker the meat, the higher the ph-value.
"I'm excited when you get Roberto Blanco, what happens then," says Jumbo cynically.
The private television level is presented here in pure culture.
But the look is worth it anyway.
The viewer sees that the secretion of the cells is still handwork.
Because: Black forest ham is traditionally found without bones in the regal.
The secret of the ham is the roasting with the salt.
Smoke tower and smoke fire remind Jumbo optically of a "U-boot".
The trick: Dance trails here provide the special taste of the black forest of Schinkens in smoke.
20 days of smoking make the ham almost black.
"Now the disc in the jumbo disappears," he announces the test feed.
"It's really nice," said the TV star's façade.
This will enable all stakeholders to live.
Did you think travel offices belong to the Internet of the past?
Flight Centre seems to resist the trend.
The company has increased its profit prospects for the whole year and expects recordings of vacationers in Australia and the United Kingdom.
The travel company now accounts for a fined annual tax profit of between $325 million and $340 million, compared with $305 to $315 million in its previous forecast.
If the current target values are reached, this means a growth of 12 to 17 percent compared to the record profit of $290.4 million over the period 2011/12.
As Managing Director Graham Turner announced, Flight Centre achieved eight percent of its profits in the first half of the year and booked a strong start in the second half of the year, especially in the Australian and British private business.
"Since the beginning of the year, our ten countries have been profitable and some of them are in a good way towards record-year revenue before interest and taxes," he said.
These include Australia and the United Kingdom, which typically belong to our strongest results.
In Australia, the leisure sector has recovered in the second half of the year, which is a slightly weaker market for business travel.
Similarly, it was good for the holiday business of Flight Centre in Great Britain, while here the business customers also spent less.
The US business recovered from the weakest first half of the season, so a profit for the whole year is expected for the third year as a result.
The shares of the Flight Centre increased by 3 cents yesterday to $38.20.
Schools are held to a greater focus on mathematics, spelling and grammar
In English literature courses, students need to treat at least one piece of Shakespeare, a 19th - century novel, romantic lyric and contemporary British novels since 1914.
The test also includes "invisible texts" entry to encourage wider reading.
The combined course of English literature and language is abolished.
Since 2015, students have to conduct a separate GCSE study for language, with strong incentives to choose English literature as a separate qualification.
The Ministry of Education will publish tomorrow the new curriculum for English and mathematics – the first areas that were radically transformed.
Other core areas will be amended next year.
In a separate initiative, Offqual, the supervisory authority for examinations, a new organisation of the GCSE structures, including a new system of use and less course work will be announced.
In a speech in the summer, Education Minister Michael Gove said that there is a "wide consensus that we need to reform our testing system in order to restore public confidence", stressing that the GCSEs would become "more challenging, ambitious and stringent".
Studies show that less time is spent in English schools for mathematics – 116 hours per year or three hours per school year – than in most other countries.
On the other hand, Australian schools teach on average 143 hours a year and students in Singapore receive 138 hours.
Although there will be no formal requirement to provide more time for mathematics in the hour plan, from coalition circles it means that the comprehensive math test – combined with a stronger weighting of the specialist in ranking lists – will probably encourage schools to set up more hours.
The teaching plan focuses more on "the problems of the right life", including financial issues.
Lovely animals and delicious cakes
The most beautiful rabbits of different breeds and colors presents the circle performance show this weekend in the citizen's house.
The evaluations were already carried out on Thursday
The local association W514 redesigns this large exhibition.
Here, breeders of the Soest Associations show their best animals as well as young Wickeder Hobby holders their rabbits.
On Thursday, six prize judges took stock of the evaluation of numerous rabbits and were able to score excellent animals.
The visitors of the show are best informed as the assessment of all animals is applied to the cages.
The official opening of the exhibition is scheduled by Mayor Hermann Arndt on Saturday at 2.30 p.m.
For all visitors, the rabbit show is already open on Saturday from 10 a.m. and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 3.30 p.m., where the victory takes place.
The guests are also invited to a Tombola and to a deliciously decorated café.

Salem: Johanna Rahner at the Ecumenical Forum
At the next Ecumenical Forum on Monday, 21 October, in the New Museum of the Castle, it is the theme "To Hell with Hell - Theological Discussions for Today's Behavior with the Last Things".
The rapporteur is Professor Johanna Rahner.
The Ecumenical Forum is an initiative of the Catholic and Evangelical Church of Salem, of the Salem Castle and of the Cultural Office.
Johanna Rahner wants to look into the forum of the question, how people today step up the "last things" after death.
If people had known too much of it in the past centuries and put on those pictures of heaven and hell, "which mark our ideas to this day", then the contemporary prophetic teaching of the hopes of fulfillment is more marked by a certain opportunity or even languagelessness.
"The greater hope has been driven out by the criticism of religion by Christians and Christians," says the rapporteur.
It has "provided us with so many questions that we seem to have the signs of extrudement."
Johanna Rahner continues: "But the crucial challenge remains the anxiety of death."
In this connection, the question of that desire is, "who dreams of having everything at the end may be good."
Johanna Rahner, born 1962 in Baden-Baden, studied Catholic Theology and Biology from 1982 to 1989 at the Albert-Ludwigs-Universität Freiburg.
She promoted Dr. Theol in 1997, also in Freiburg.
The qualification for fundamental theology and ecumenical theology followed in 2003 at the Westfälische Wilhelms University.
Since 2010, Johanna Rahner has been teaching a chair for systematic theology at the Institute for Catholic Theology of the University of Kassel.
Geislingen: More than 100 young Catholics from Little Heuberg confirm their faith at the firm
In two services, 101 15 and 16-year-old youths of the soul care unit were established at Littlen Heuberg.
The service accompanied the Laudato-Si group on the morning of the Youth Choir The Spirit.
With the acceptance of the firmament, the young men said yes to their baptism and absorbed the power of the Holy Spirit.
The firms had prepared themselves in the past months, under the leadership of Diakon Reiner Dehner and the support of numerous members of the community on the big day of the holiday.
In various projects, they met various tasks of Christian community life and shared their youth in sub - Saharan Africa.
Illmensee: Second Mountain Bike Race Enthusiastic Participants
At great weather, 214 riders came to Illmensee to manage the round course over the hills around the lake.
This is shared by Ulrich Knobel from the eventing sports association Illmensee.
The participants included, in particular at the short distance over 15 kilometres and 300 meters of height, also numerous cyclists who wanted to practice their hobby once in a competitive atmosphere.
Two junior riders of the German top class were also at the start of this race: Felix Bader from Bad Forestsee and Pascal Treubel from Aach-Linz came with the recommendation of good placements in the German championships.
Both of these could be expected to leave the field.
As in the previous year, Felix Bader was able to save a little time to the goal and defend his title as the total winner of the short distance.
In place two were able to place Pascal Truubel again.
Among the ladies was Theresa Duelli from the team Albtrum, who made it up on the top of the winning stage.
In place two and three came Anne Adel from Illmensee and Leonie drivers from Owingen.
A happy development is the increasing number of drivers who live or work in the community.
Not only as far as the power of performance is concerned, the whole band was represented by athletes.
The age structure also ranges from ten years in the youngest to more than 70 years in the oldest beginners.
In the main race this year there were even more absolute top teams at the beginning.
Four drivers were able to stay away from the regional top drivers.
Among them is Philipp Pangerl, a Mountainbike-Half profile from the Black Tusk-Racing team.
Pangerl was already a world champion in the 12-hour fair with a teammate.
This year he became a European champion in this special discipline.
This includes Roland Ballerstedt, who already calls himself two German masters in the Duathlon.
After 45 kilometres and 900 meters of height, it reached a firefighting finish in the finish line in front of the three-sea hill.
Pangerl was the first to cross the finish line.
Only a second later, the Routinier Ballerstedt was able to secure the second place in the overall evaluation.
At the same time, Hermann and Warthmann became the third party of the overall evaluation.
In the dam evaluation, Christiane Cohsmann was the fastest in the main race.
The second place was in front of Natasha Werner from Stuttgart.
Sportsmen and helpers were very pleased with the smooth and well-organized outcome of the event.
Roads through mud, rivers and jungles for free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle brings free medical help to remote villages in Cameroon
Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend treating hundreds of patients
In the West African country, there are not many doctors, only one for 5,000 people
Vote here or with your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 of the "CNN Heroes of 2013".
You can vote for him or one of the other heroes in the top 10 to choose him as "CNN Hero of the Year".
The winner receives $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years George's Bwelle watched his sick father lose consciousness and travel to hospitals that did not have the means to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in 1981 in a car accident near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
At first, he had only one broken arm, but then there was a inflammation that spread to his brain and caused a haematoma that should affect him for the rest of his life.
"There was no neurosurgeon in Cameroon," said Georges Bwelle.
We would have brought him out of Cameroon if we had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years accompanying his father in overcrowded clinics and hospitals to get the treatment they had to offer there.
“It’s not easy,” comments Bwelle.
You can leave the house at five o'clock in the morning and run to the hospital to be the first, and is not the first.
There are a lot of patients.
Some people even die because they have to wait.
The situation has barely changed since Bwell's father died in 2002.
In Cameroon, there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people, so the World Health Organization.
On the other hand, the relationship in the United States is with a doctor for 413 people.
But even if there was a doctor for them, most Cameroonis could not afford to visit.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line and almost three quarters of the health expenditure in the country are private.
"The only problem they have is poverty," Bwelle says.
And poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life.
His father and so many of his countrymen suffered to see in Bwelle the decision to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his volunteer team have carried out 700 free operations last year.
He became a doctor himself and worked as a nurse at the Central Hospital in Yaoundé.
He also established a non-profit organization called ASCOVIME, which travels on weekends in rural areas and offers free medical care there.
Since 2008, he and his volunteer group have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Nearly every Friday he forces up to 30 people in small buses and rides with the cutting medical equipment on the roof over unassembled terrain in the villages that need help.
It doesn't always go smoothly.
More than once, they had to move the vehicles through rivers and mud.
But when they arrive, they will receive them as heroes: a feast, singing and dancing, and the best accommodation to offer the place.
In these villages, free medical care is really a reason for celebrating and bwelling – with its broad smile and its limitless energy – is a pleasure at the happy celebration.
The next morning, the team starts investigating hundreds of patients.
“We treat 500 people per trip,” says Bwelle.
They come from a circumference of 60 kilometers around the village – and to the foot.
Each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a number of areas.
Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others receive hugs, scattered glasses or free birth certificates – a document that is needed for the school, but many poor families simply cannot afford.
In the evening, the team conducts simple operations with local pollination.
The operations usually take place in a school, in the home or in a home; after the intervention, the patients stand up and go to the rest area to make room for the next.
The lighting for the OP and the disinfection equipment is eaten by the group generator and thus Bwelle and his volunteers work until the early morning hours on Sunday.
It's an exciting pensum, but the village musicians usually help keep the team motivated.
"They have been dreaming all night so that we can stay awake and continue our work," Bwelle says.
On Sunday the team then returns to the city, tired, but proud of the work done.
The group – a mixture of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students – has carried out 700 free operations in the last year and knows that with its work it makes a huge difference for the people to whom it helps.
One man explained that the free operation of a profit break that he has received is now possible for him to work again.
"This changes the future of my family," the man said.
In addition to the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon in the hospital, Bwelle also works in private clinics in Yaoundé at night.
With this second job, he financed 60% of his non-profit activity, Bwelle; the rest came from private donations.
"I really don't know when he's asleep," says Katie O'Malley, who studies at the Drexel University in Philadelphia Medicine and volunteers in Bwelles Group.
He is always in the hospital or is trying to raise money for the organization so that he can go to these campaigns.
For medical and health care students such as O'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe and support Bwelle, this is an opportunity to collect practical experiences that they would never get home.
"We can be in operations where we help to shed blood or keep the instruments for Dr. Bwelle," O'Malley explains.
This would never be possible in America as a medical student in the second year.
Students pay their trip to Cameroon normally themselves and often bring donated health care.
But if they are only once in Yaoundé, Bwelle will take over the accommodation, transportation and instruction.
"He is certainly a hero," says O'Malley.
He dedicates his life to this organization and his desire to help the Cameroonian people, knows no limits.
For Bwelle, the almost permanent work is no burden.
To help others live a happier life and thus fulfill a promise that he has given to his father prepares him great joy.
"I'm so happy when I do this job," Bwelle says.
And I think of my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
I'm doing it to bring people back to laughing and to relieve the pain.

Excellently mastered the fight
The role of Santiago, the old man in Hemingway's Novelle "The old man and the sea", is cut to pieces by Horst Janson.
Janson himself is an old hare in his masterpiece, the art of acting.
The old man Santiago can't make anything when fishing.
This is how the two simply complement each other.
It is almost supposed to be able to see the flaws in the neck of the old man, of whom the fisherman boy Manolo speaks.
When Santiago is tired of his life sitting on the chair, it's real with Janson.
In addition, the role of the old fisherman is through and through a character role that Janson excels.
Hemingway told the story of a fighter, a courageous man who did not give up and finally won the fight against the fish by his knowledge and willpower.
Janson is on the stage as a single-manufacturer in many ways.
He manages to focus the public's attention on himself, so that his monologues are not a momentary moment.
His efforts to finally attract the fish to the surface of the water are so real that the viewers forget that the sea consists only of blue-lit bottles.
Director Jens Hasselmann let the old man act in the boat in front of the fishing village.
In the course of the performance, he puts the active scene into the light: the cottage of Santiago, the bar of the singer Marie-Luise Gunst, who with her songs and her wonderful voice fills the soul of Cuba.
The four musicians play Cuba's rhythm and are at the same time guests of the bar.
Tourism: Apathy to the Romans
At about 120 meters of length below Cologne, a sewer can be obtained from the Roman period.
Whoever visits Cologne will not pass through the Dom.
Around 157 meters the two towers reach the sky and make it the second largest church building in Europe.
But only a few visitors who admire the two Philippine church towers recognize that there is also a lot to discover under the dome.
Rainer Schulze is an expert in Cologne Underworld.
The meeting point for its guided tours is the service centre of Cologne-Tourism directly on the Dom.
The tour begins in an unspectacular way: "We start in the underground garage," says Schulze.
In the 1970s, the city fathers wanted a car - oriented city, so only the rest of the old city walls remained standing, which was not too big.
Most of the users of the park house are therefore also passing on to the Roman remains today and just drop off their car.
But who looks more closely, in the D2 park deck, discovers an archaeological site separated by metal cast iron rods.
There are about five meters of high ruins made of handlestones.
"There are remains of the Roman city walls built after Christ in the second half of the first century," says Schulze.
Before it goes back to the daylight, Schulze lets the participants on the top level of the park throw another look into a window, 15 meters deep.
This is the source of the old domain, which unfortunately is hardly perceived.
The next station of the roundabout is the Prefectory, and here the participants go down again into the depths.
We experience here the office of the once powerful man north of the Alps, the Prefect of the CCAA.
What CCAA means, a visitor wants to know.
"The abbreviation stands for "Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippapincium", which means as much to good German as "City of the Roman Right and City of the Agrippan, founded under Emperor Claudius at the site of the altar for the Kaiser culture".
And in the Prefecture it is the former palace of the State, the power centre of the Roman Empire at the Rhine.
From the premises of the exhibition, tunnel access leads to the Roman wastewater canal, which is found here at about 120 meters long.
"You can quietly take a piece along the so-called Cloaca Maxima if you want," the guests are assembled at school.
There's still a surprise.
After holding the key on the box, he leads the group to a 16-metre deep, accessible box.
"We are now in Mikwe, a ritual Jewish bath," he explains.
The Jewish community built its bath deep into the ground to reach the base water that was indispensable for the ritual washings.
To this day, at the bottom of the mikwe, whose origins go back to the eighth century, different water stands can be easily accessible through changing levels of the Rhine.
The Mikwe will be part of an archaeological zone in the town hall for which construction work will start in the near future.
Until the completion, however, a few more years will go by.
Almost broken leg: re-establishment of rocker process
A bloody attack in the rock environment is re-launched after more than four years.
A trial for attempted killing, dangerous bodily injury and damage to two 30-year-olds has begun before the Frankfurt (Order) Land Court.
It is accompanied by strict security arrangements.
The defendants swam to the ground.
They should have been active in the rock scene and had belonged to the bandidos at that time.
In June 2009, the Public Prosecutor proposes that three men in a car be hit and hit in a car, along with unknown complications in Finowfurt.
All the victims were severely injured, a man almost lost his leg.
The victims should have belonged to the competing Hells Angels group.
One should have been a high-ranking member from Berlin.
Precisely, it was a chase hunt with several cars.
According to the prosecution, it was a revolutionary struggle and a demonstration of power.
The two defendants were released in a first procedure in early 2012.
A judge at the time said that there was no evidence that the men were actually involved in the bloodstream.
The tattoos had worn masks and were not recognized.
The Bundesgerichtshof raised the judgment after the Court of Justice’s review and referred it back to the Land Court for a re-negotiation.
One of the defendants is currently in open custody because of another delinquent.
The start was mainly about the reconstruction of the events in the night.
As a witness, the investigating commissioner was then charged.
In the center, phone conversations were held by the defendants and others who had been arrested by the police.
It's hard for Rocker to keep himself before the court almost always on an honorable law for them - and not say it.
This also applies to the victims.
In the first process, only one of the victims had been unpacked.
State attorney Stefan Golfier from the Frankfurt (Oder) state attorney said that new traces have been discovered since the last procedure.
Eleven further negotiating days are set up for the process.
The rejecting company does not think
The night was long, the music was loud and the mood was good, but sometimes it goes home.
Only: In the trees of the people on the sidewalk and back seat, the hungry becomes noticeable.
Of course, one or another cocktail or sect may be responsible for that!
What's closer to driving the next drive-in to get a little something?
I admit, I'm happy to be with you when it comes to fast-food holes in the morning, or at night, or in the morning.
A couple of apples, a cola, a burger, and then nothing like home and in bed!
But on the way home, the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco walkers are noticeable.
Because what needs to be missing is that you regularly throw your fast food stuff out of the car window?!
In particular, on weekends, discarded paper bags are located on street corners and parking spaces.
"Yes?" I ask myself.
Are the people too deaf to take the shoes home, respectively, to the next miller?
It's not just that the paper is changing the landscape.
Kills have already covered transport facilities such as guideboards and thereby triggered accidents.
But what she thought was not what "weaving society" said, she probably doesn't even know what this word means.
If you are on your way in the evening, only with a few people in the car, you know how a backbank can look after spent nights: stickers, bottles and other mills are stuck there.
There would be a few shoes more or less, but nothing would make up - unlike the road, where no one wants to eat the rest of other belts.
I can see the day when the cities and communities will bleed the grass - and the fast food chains will have to demand for their aunts.
Obamas back in health policy
After intense criticism, President Obama made a frequent return to his day yesterday: “If you like your health insurance, you can keep it.”
After thousands of their insurers have received a letter of notice, the Republicans have proposed to the President in the last days that he has deceived the American public.
Yesterday Obama relativized his original promise.
"The overwhelming majority of citizens who have a functioning health insurance can keep them," he said in a speech in Boston.
In response to the numerous media reports about the announcements, Obama called on those Americans who received such messages to take care of themselves on the free market after a new insurance.
Most citizens could receive better comprehensive health insurance at the same price or more favourable than forecasted.
"They come up with a better offer," he said.
The government said it was a little surprising that the five percent of the population, who had themselves completed insurance, had to take care of at another rate, as their contract did not meet the new standards according to the Affordable Care Act.
"I would like to say directly to these Americans that they have earned better," said Sebelius at a hearing before the Energy and Trade Committee of the House of Representatives in Washington.
Sebelius, who is responsible for implementing the Affordable Care Act, explained that the launch of the online platform has been "missable" since October.
"I am as frustrated and angry as all the others," she said.
I'm determined to regain your trust.
This speech of a late Sebelius to a consultant sitting behind her at the hearing in the House of Representatives was taken after a discussion with the Republican MP Billy Long from Missouri, and it was about whether she should be obliged to participate in Obamacare.
After more than three hours of hearing, Long Sebelius repeated the question why the “architectin” of the Affordable Care Act did not voluntarily refuse a state-funded insurance in order to conclude itself a tariff at HealthCare.gov, which they now want to sell to millions of Americans.
Government in Jerusalem does not confirm attack on Syrian Air Force Base
An American government official, who wanted to remain anonymous, claimed on Thursday against the US news broadcaster CNN that Israeli warplanes had attacked an airfield in Syrian Latakia one day earlier.
The objective was "Rakets and related equipment", which the Israeli government feared, was intended for the Lebanese Hisbollah, according to CNN.
Syrian and Lebanese media, as well as the Arab envoy Al-Arabiya, had previously reported that the support point in the port city of Latakia was discussed in the night of Wednesday on Thursday, and Israel was responsible for it.
The Israeli TV channel 2 showed satellite images of the support point in Latakia, on which Russian rockets of type S-125 Newa and a battery of SA-3 rockets could be seen, according to the channel 2 have a range of 35 kilometres and can transport jump heads up to 70 kilograms.
Uncertain The government in Jerusalem has not officially confirmed the attack.
However, the news agency Reuters also cites an anonymous Israeli government official with the words he believes that Israel has carried out the attack, but is not sure.
One speaker of the Israeli Ministry of Defence said, "We do not comment on these reports."
The journalist Ron Ben-Yishai stressed in the daily Yedioth Ahronoth that the Syrian regime had already successfully tried to deliver ground-air rockets to Hisbollah earlier.
The Israeli government had repeatedly warned that any attempt by Syria to provide Hisbollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons would mean exceeding a "red line" that would follow a military response.
John Kerry explains in an unparalleled statement that the US spying has "extensively gone"
John Kerry pointed out with an unexpected understanding that the United States' dissatisfaction with its monitoring programmes was “not far off” in certain cases.
The Foreign Minister also stated that he and Barack Obama had the responsibility of switching to "Autopilot" when the explosive discoveries of the Whistleblower Edward Snowden on the spying activities of the NSA became public.
Through the information provided, the U.S. government has become a diplomatic storm of equipment on the part of its allies.
In a speech transmitted by video to the Open Government Conference in London, Kerry said: “The president and I, as well as others in the government, have experienced some things that are almost by autopilot, simply because the ability to go back to World War II and the difficult years of Cold War and of course on September 11th.”
He then admitted as the first high-ranking member of the U.S. government that the U.S. spying has exceeded a limit, but also stressed that no rights have been misused.
He said, "In some cases, this has gone too far."
The President is determined to create clarity and is therefore conducting a thorough investigation so that no one has to feel that abuse is taking place here.
I assure you that the rights of innocent persons in this process will not be affected.
Kerry, however, insisted that the NSA be a force of good and that many lives were saved through its monitoring procedures.
He added: “We have to do it with a new world in which people are willing to jump into the air themselves.”
There is a radical extremism in the world that is about to kill people, to jump into the air and attack governments.
So what if you were able to catch it and stop it before it happens?
In fact, we have prevented aircraft accidents, attacks on buildings and the killing of people because we have experienced such plans in advance.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislators will travel to Europe to resolve concerns about the alleged American espionage and convince Europeans of the need to continue to cooperate with the US in anti-terrorism efforts, as stated by the Chairman of the Senate Committee on European Affairs on Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy from Connecticut said he spoke to representatives of the European Parliament and others this week and was concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti-terrorism organisations due to frustration over monitoring by the National Security Agency.
"It is very important for the national security interests of the United States that Europeans remain on board in terms of our joint efforts against terrorism," Murphy, who for the first time sits in the Senate and is chaired by the Senate's Committee on External Relations and European Affairs, said in an interview in Washington.
I am also going to Europe to make it clear there that we must continue to work together in the fight against terrorism, regardless of their concern over NSA programmes.
Media reports that the NSA has collected millions of phone data in Europe have charged relations with some US allies, although the head of the secret service this week declared the reports to be inappropriate and based on a misunderstanding of the metadata collected by NATO allies and exchanged with the United States.
Other discoveries quoted from documents transmitted by Snowden, by which the NSA monitored the phone of Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 other heads of state worldwide.
The head of the national secret services, James Clapper, defended the spyage in the United States as necessary and explained that this was common on both sides.
In all the Tumult, Murphy, his authority was preparing for the congress to take place this year, and hoped that the delegation would include members from both parties and chambers.
The names of the other Members participating will be published in the coming days.
He said that the exact route will still be developed.
While Murphy stressed that the purpose of the trip was to improve relations, he also said that there would be some "north words".
He said that the European governments should be honest with their people about the type of spying programmes they have been using for years.
"Although we can change our monitoring programmes and better protect the rights of Europeans, they also have to find that we are not the only ones to spy on," said Murphy.
Meanwhile, John Kerry is on the weekend traveling to the Middle East and to Poland to get together with the crowd on the US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran as well as the US surveillance activities.
A heartbreaking injury to the jumpgelenk threatens to prevent the use of Nicolai Müller in the FSV Mainz 05 outside the FC Augsburg.
Mainz is concerned with the use of Nicolai Müller.
Tomorrow he will try to train with the team.
So far, he could only do this individually.
"We will decide briefly on his use," said Coach Thomas Tuchel.
The 40-year-old hopes to have his best tortoises with six hits.
Because the managers have already to ignore the injured drivers Niki Zimling, Julian Baumgartlinger and Niko Bungert.
Australia is calling for prison sentences in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney, who was sentenced to 15 days in Phuket prison because she had falsely claimed to be raped by a taxi driver, has been brought to trial and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was first found guilty by a provincial court in Phuket on June 15 for having made a false statement after she had told the Thai police, a local taxi driver raped her in the morning hours on Sunday, June 10th, while two other men arrested her.
Later, however, the footage of a video camera showed that she was sure to arrive at her hotel after she was separated from her Australian friend.
The police in Phuket interviewed Bamford for two days until she was able to think about the story.
Until the trial, she was on the scene in police custody.
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison sentence in a prison with a low level of security at the Phukets border, instead of a prison for adult women.
She is the daughter of Peter Tunks, a former player of the Australian Ruby League, who turned to the Foreign Ministry in Canberra with the request for help for his daughter.
Tunks explained to the Sunday Telegraph in Sydney that the whole family was "extremely concerned" about the welfare of his daughter and wanted to have her back in Australia.
"We are of course very worried, but we hope that she will be home as soon as possible," Tunks said.
Bamford has filed a summons against the verdict and is against a guarantee of 50,000 Baht on a free foot.
In Australian reports it was to read that in the meantime it was holidaying in Krabi, South Thailand.
The court's views were to be heard, Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket and was warned that the appeal could also lead to a higher penalty of up to two years in a prison for adults.
However, it is also possible that after the recent murder of the travel officer Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand could try to improve his recommended tourist image, and that is why it comes to a holiday.
