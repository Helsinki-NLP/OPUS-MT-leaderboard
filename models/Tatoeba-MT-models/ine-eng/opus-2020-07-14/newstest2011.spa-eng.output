What is it? ČSSD in Prague does not know Voldemort or the pastry
The new ČSSD councillors in the capital will seem to have to overcome the clear linguistic barriers for the members of the Prague Board and the Municipal Council to understand their renewed ODS partners.
The Aktuálně.cz period "examined" the members of the new ČSSD Council to check their knowledge of the slang-marked language that has emerged in recent years in the Council, when the current members of the coalition ruled in Prague.
The coded dictionary that used Prague's flower and political birth during the previous period, from Mayor Pavel Bém, includes some of the most well-known characters, situations and causes of the metropolis.
Surprisingly, it has been proved that the new councillors hardly understand these well-known concepts.
At least that's what they say.
"Who's Voldemort?"
"The truth is I don't know."
"I'm rather an innovation in Prague's politics," said during the "college" terminology review the cultural council of Lukaš Kaucký.
And with regard to the political veteran, he reacted equally to Karel Březina.
Maybe they know the concept of golf.
"Maybe the only expression of everyone you asked me to use from time to time."
"If not, usually not slang."
From the glossary, whose definitions were published in Aktuálně.cz last June prior to the ODS vote Congress, the editorial chose six examples, in particular those specifically related to the Prague municipal authorities.
The socialists had to explain the concepts "Voldemort", "larger golf hoo of Prague", "go to the pastry", "noble of bull", "traiting of the capital" and "blendar".
Three councillors agreed to submit to the test and a room, Antonín Weinert, who in the future will be responsible for education in Prague, at first came in, but did not pick up the phone again.
The fifth counsellor, Petr Dolínek, refused to do so directly.
"I don't put myself in these things, and I don't think I value how the democratic civics have fun."
"What I do care about is how we will understand ourselves in the implementation of our programmes," he said.
As has been seen, the councillor Lukaš Kaucký would not have realized that the previous title is an expression about an influential businessman and a friend of the former mayor Bem, Roman Janousek.
Kaucký's word "Voldemort" doesn't say anything; the only term he's pointed out in the exam is "the biggest golf club in Prague".
"It's about the Blanka tunnel," says Kaucký, who immediately adds: "But I know it for the news."
"I'm going to have to point to a language course," she jokes.
Karel Březina is not the only one who recognizes in the golf course the Blanka tunnel, but also the Environment Council Lukáš Plachý.
Then both socio-democratics know who Voldemort is and Lukaš Plachý even knows where to find that character; in addition, he suspects the meaning of "go to the pastry".
"I think it means going to a company in Prague"; it is soon revealed to Plachý that it is the headquarters of Janousek's companies.
Like Březina, it indicates that such knowledge was obtained from the news, but that it did not use such a vocabulary.
According to the participants in the trial, among the socio-democratics, there is no such familiar glossary of colloquial terms.
"I asked my companions, but it really doesn't seem like we have anything like it."
"Well, amongst us we use apodos, sometimes abbreviations or play word games with names," says the president of the ČSSD Prague, Petr Hulinský, whose party companions are called Hulda.
"In college they called me Bríza, but I don't know if my companions call me that, too," confesses her own apodo Karel Březina.
The newspaper Aktualně.cz put and tested the name and function.
For his party companions, Weinert is Děda (like "yayo") or, less friendly, Dědek ("old"), the representative of Miroslav Poche, who was associated with before the misleading elections during the party's sponsorship, receives the aposto of "Igraček" ("playmobil") by some of his companions.
The apods are also the only expressions that socio-democratics tolerate in speech within the party.
Hullínský does not like to call it Hulda, but the newspaper Aktualně.cz discovered even other apodos for this president Prague.
"The Doctor of the Rights of the Frogs" seems to recall that Petr Hulinský obtained his doctorate in Law at the Bratislava Police Academy.
The Government wants to limit the torture of "gross", as published in a leaflet
Women considered to be witches in Burkina Faso share certain characteristics.
They usually have an advanced age, they can't work, for example, for health reasons, they're single and they don't have children.
Women who "feel" witches are sent to an isolated area, so that they do not harm the rest of the people.
"Men rarely suffer like that."
"There is also no isolation for healthy young women because they help in work and have children," explains a nun who, in the capital of West Africa, deals with a special residence of more than one hundred women expelled from her communities.
The local government has decided to oppose this unusual "social measure".
He issued an information leaflet that should help to prevent witch hunts.
However, this has a grip.
"More than 70% of adults in Burkina Faso do not know how to read," warns Die Standard newspaper on the disadvantages of awareness in writing.
The accusations of witchcraft are also common in other African countries.
In Ghana, Burkina Faso's neighbor, Ammy Hemmah died 72 last week, when three women and two men tortured her, covered her with gasoline and burned her.
The news appeared on the BBC.
The authors claim that it was due to a bad set of circumstances.
According to her version, the woman was taken in the oil used for ritual appointments.
He was caught in flames when the group wanted to "evict the evil spirits" of the woman.
The isolation of the "bruges" supports people at all levels of education.
The newspaper Der Standard quoted a 42-year-old businessman from Burkina Faso: "Human soul devourers have always represented a danger," he said.
While in Burkina Faso, the government is trying to calm down the witch hunt, in Gambia last year the president still participated in it.
"The Gambian President Jammeh, after his aunt's death, launched a wide hunt of witches who allegedly had been related to his death and had tried to kill his own president through the black magic."
"In order to help you, it brought to the bells of the nearby Guinea that, protected by police, military and the President's personal hearing, were brought to the force of randomized men and women among the Gambian peoples to the property of the President in Kanilai," the International Amnesty Organization noted in its report.
In the camp, the arrested people had to drink a half of herb with aliquitous effects which, in addition, caused them intestinal and renal problems.
Two of the detainees did not survive the stay in the finca.
After international pressure, they finally released about a thousand detainees.
Bacala's rent: heats up with carbon stoves and sign a higher rental
The man, aged and young, crossed the doors of the centre of attention to the RPG Byty's client of the Zdeněk Bacala, the largest private owner of flats for rent in the Czech Republic.
Under his arm he wore documents with the new three-bed rental contracts: his, his daughter and his son, who is executing sentence.
The three of them have just lost the liberalization of the rents.
Instead of 3,500 Czech crowns a month, the child will pay 4.100 crowns from next year for a two-bedroom apartment with second category separate kitchen.
"In addition, there is no hot water and heating is based on a solid fuel boiler," he shows with his finger the man in his son's new contract, on which he has full powers.
"But I signed it," he explains, half angry, half disengaged.
The Civil Association BytyOKD.cz, which has qualified the new conditions for rent as "incorrect and indecent", recommends that tenants who do not sign the new contracts and wait until 7 December, date on which a guide will be published informing about how to proceed in these cases.
But, before this, man only makes a soul.
"Everybody says one thing," he says with a bad face.
Ostrava is becoming a large testing laboratory for liberalisation.
After New Year it will take place with the vast majority of the floors that, in the Czech Republic, were so far under a regulated rent.
Therefore, Aktualně.cz decided to visit the "laboratory" in person.
The RPG mine waiting room is one of the four of Ostrava and, Tuesday to nine, was already full.
Right next to the doors are the security guards and next to you a machine to get number.
"Render 2011", can be read on a bright button of your touch screen.
When you press it, go out of the machine a paper with a number.
Almost no time or read "157" and the number appears on the large screen at the top of the room.
In a second, you're in the queue.
Soon afterward, an older marriage comes to ask, but the plenty of room is not here for the new tenants.
Most people come to resolve common problems, such as old age: settlement requests, insurance issues and similar issues.
The letters with the new rental contracts will arrive in Ostrava in the pockets of the tenants of the majority of the 44,000 floors belonging to RPG around mid-November.
RPG Byty proposes an increase in the rental of between 15 and 38% in the cards.
A special window is opened on 18 November in the customer care centre for new rentals.
"He's been working for a week, so he's starting," they say, after short doubt, the workers who are in it when the customer presents himself as a journalist.
Liberalization and the former Bacala miners' floors are the most sensitive themes in the area.
Before the elections, the Vice-President of Parliament, from Ostrava, Lubomír Zaorálek, from ČSSD, has already treated them highly and clearly, and now they are constantly appearing in the area's newspapers.
"I want a new soil twenty years later."
"I didn't change the damn dish of the bathroom," the man mentioned in the introduction is disavowed.
According to the workers, for the time being, there are more than nothing retired to check if they receive a discount in the rental if they sign on time, as promised by the special offer of RPG.
They will also receive half of the discount on the rental of February the remaining tenants signing the new contract before 15 December.
However, the "freelization" mine window is certainly unable to unravel the range of doubts.
"Of the 360 customers who were here yesterday, only asked for the rental in 2011 about forty or fifty people," she says.
Meanwhile, RPG proposes on the web and in its tables individual meetings on contracts when necessary.
If the two parties do not reach an agreement on the rental, an independent judge shall resolve the matter.
"It is not a threat, but information about the only way to proceed and fully in accordance with the law," RPG warns on its pages.
"No one is going to be judged here," she says to one of RPG Byty's employees and a man who is on the street in front of the customer's attention center gives the reason, at least in part.
"I receive a pension of 13,000 and I have 5,000 left for food; I have no means to go to the courts," he says.
But immediately, the employee sows doubt.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaorálek warns you in the media that they don't sign, so maybe people are waiting," he says.
The rental regulation will cease to exist in most of the Czech Republic at the beginning of 2011 and, according to RPG Byty, its increase is an economic necessity.
"Current rentals still do not cover even the amounts necessary for the maintenance of the community fund," recalls Pavel Klimeš, director of the RPG Byty's residential portfolio, who adds that the careless state of the community fund that upsets the tenants is, for owners, the main reason for increasing the rent.
While during the five years that passed between 2005 and 2010 RPG was able to invest in apartments of four billion, the figure will increase to 5,200 million in the four years from 2011 to 2014.
The large screen that falls from the roof, in front of the sittings of the waiting room, now repeats some data highlighting in red.
"The increase in rent in 2011 in 15% and less applies to 31200 apartments, i.e. more than 90% of RPG properties."
"In addition, it will always be up to 7,50 check crowns per square metre monthly," is indicated on the screen.
Only an increase of 38% of the rent of 400 floors on the RPG portfolio.
"In such cases, it is an increase from an extremely low amount of 19,66 crowns per square metre," RPG says.
In 2,600 floors, the rental will remain invariable next year.
RPG Byty promises that liberalisation will not impact tenants, but will scale between four and eight years.
In addition, add the following commitment: the company will invest all the money from the rental lift (see graph) again on the floors, mainly in heating saving: new windows and heating.
People who sign the rental elevator agreement will be given priority.
Architects have understood that offices also need care
The administrative building Avriopoint in Brno is the new headquarters of Arch.Design.
No one would say that it also hides inside a small garden with all its own to such facilities: colour walls, creative furniture and even a miniature park on the outside terrace.
Since October last year, the children of Arch.Design employees can come to her.
Arch.Design, from which many well-known buildings from Brno came out, thought from the first boxes of the Avriopoint building to include a space for its mining.
In the company, about 90 people work, mainly at the age of the baby boom and wanted to allow architects and designers to return to work soon after maternity.
Along with the possibility of enjoying a reduced schedule, the guardianship is one of the benefits that Arch offers.Design your workers in the context of your social program.
Constructors and architects thus have the opportunity to combine a demanding profession with child care.
The mining industry was an idea of Arch.Designu's own employees and, with the support of the management, they managed to obtain funding from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The company's minority will be financed through the European Social Fund within the framework of the Operational Programme of Human Resources and Employment, as well as the State budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to the funding granted (a provision of more than 2.8 million Czech crowns), they were able to buy equipment and, after two years, to hire qualified staff and services.
When the funding is exhausted (two years), Arch.Design has the obligation to keep it running with its own funds for three years.
The preparation of the project lasted a year, and in the submission of the funding application, Economy Rating contributed.
The attention of children is in the hands of qualified staff; in addition, they are present all day long for their care by a nurse and a teacher of the Ministry of Education. The care currently welcomes children without age limits, although most of them are under three years of age.
Since it is a mini-guardery, it can only be accommodated at the same time to a maximum of five children, although with the tournaments more during the day.
The functioning of the care facility is flexible to adapt to the needs of parents and children of all workers have the same right to use the care facility, regardless of the hierarchy within the company.
Although it is individual education and care, the content of the minority programme is comparable to that of the regular pre-school education programme.
In it children not only play, but also receive quality education: from basic learning to preparation for school, they teach to English.
The class has not only toys and table games, but also a computer for children.
The presence of small children in the company itself creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can go to see their children at any time and avoid the stress of late pick-up when they are away from their place of work.
Thus, parents are more productive as they work.
It is not surprising that this naturally creates a relationship of loyalty between the worker and his employer.
Thus, Arch.Design is located among the companies sign that they offer a great advantage for the admission of new workers: they support the family and, ultimately, this program strengthened the marketing of staff.
The house of the bones continues to fascinate after 100 years. Observe the interiors of Gaudí
The roof looks like the loco of a prehistoric pond, the stairs remind the column of a dinosaur and the balconies look like the mouth of an open fish.
This is the Batlló House, in Barcelona, of the Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí.
Because of its similar shape to a skeleton, the locals seized it "the house of the bones".
Its organic forms, its appealing colours, the innovative use of the stone, the fragments of tiles and mosaics, a façade that resembles the smoothly curved scales and omnipresent lines, all of which is typical of Antoni Gaudí's secession.
The cover of the house plays with onyric lines, delicate colors and textures extracted from nature and fauna.
By giving more attention, a certain geometry, rhythm, and carefully thought order are observed.
At night, the whole façade of the house seems even more impressive, as it is illuminated in such a way that the brightness of the colors is improved.
Serpentia and the torsion of the shapes continues to surprise us also inside.
The wet wood copies the frames of the windows, the paddles, the curtains of the doors, the mirrors and the letters.
The Casa Batlló, located in the Eixample neighborhood in the number 43 of the animated commercial street of Passeig de Gràcia, emerged from the remodeling of a house in 1877 by architect Emilio Sala Cortés.
The reconstruction lasted two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, the industrial rich Josep Batlló, initially insisted on breaking down the former building and starting at zero, but soon accepted Gaudí's idea of a new and cheaper reconstruction.
However, the Batlló House, consisting of several apartments, did not design it alone, Antoni Gaudí.
The architect Josep María Jujol collaborated in the design.
In fact, in their plans of the project, ornaments arose for the representative apartment of the owner of the property and the mosaics used in the façade.
In the façade also workers other creators and artists.
The collaboration in the proposals of the Batlló House was the start of Jujol's successful collaboration with Gaudí.
Jujol participated in the construction of the Milá House and Güell Park in Gaudí, where there are other parts of it.
Because of its organic form, the locals soon after its completion seized it "the house of the bones".
Others, due to the specific mechanism of opening the windows, began calling it "the house of the boxes".
It is also said that, on top of the construction, the sword of San Jorge, patron of Catalonia appears.
Other sculptural elements of the building hide religious motives.
Gaudí designed a unique system in the house for the central heating era with ventilating respirators and typical fireplaces.
It may be strange to have your forty-five degree inclination.
During the construction, Gaudí did not comply at all with the construction rules of the time and was not influenced by them.
Still, the construction had been granted permission from the beginning, although clearly in it the data on the planned reconstruction were so vague that, two years later, at its conclusion, the town was so affected by the result that it was requested to be corrected.
For example, he was disturbed that the construction included columns even to the public steel.
The arrangements were never made, rather the contrary: only 15 days after the town's request, Joseph Batlló requested permission to rent the two tallest floors of the building.
The owner itself was installed on the lower floors.
In the gallery of the second floor there was the living room and in the third floor the bedrooms and the private part of the apartment.
The lower plant was rented to a jewelry store.
The house, of six floors, is completely crossed by a staircase that leads to the roof terrace.
The basic elements of the reform consisted of breaking all right angles and lines, covering them with curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with the modern concept of space connection.
The common part can be connected completely by opening the doors of the halls and a larger group can be communicated in this way without problems, without giving up the necessary privacy for more intimate conversations.
The house, with the reconstruction of Gaudí, not only obtained a new facade, but also an unusual roof and two additional floors.
It is also impressive how Gaudí plays with light, white blues and blues covering the inner courtyard and tragaluces.
The game with both colors brings the highest light on all the floors of the house.
It was simply based on the principle that white reflects more light than dark colors, which otherwise absorb the rays of the sun.
Anyone can visit the Batlló House, which in 2005 was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and recharged apartment available to the public.
The owners decided to open the doors to the public in 2002, on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
With the visits, they confirmed, or discovered, that it was a very beneficial business and extended the visits to the common area and to the boar, including the roof terrace.
The price of entry to the monument is not insignificant, it reaches EUR 16.50, although students, pensioners and holders of tourist cards get 20% discount.
The amount exceeds significantly the price of entry of other Gaudí buildings in the city.
If you want to enjoy the true atmosphere of the bed with its pond towers, you should quickly make friends with some of the residents of the nearby houses and visit them at home.
How to choose the necklace and the hat: women and men look for different things
Nothing of a pumping frame for the bed; what really gives its quality to a good bed is the surface to fall, i.e. the cot and somier.
First of all, they must be complemented by perfection in order to adapt to specific users.
During the election, many elements come into play, including weight, height, health status and gender of the owner.
It is also important for the type of interior in which the mattress and somier are located.
A typical example?
For example, in a weekend cabin that does not usually have heating, latex mattresses should not be used because they are "heated" more slowly.
In addition, there is much more regret than usual polyurethane colons.
It is therefore necessary to give them the most frequent return.
If the channels in the center are not properly flown and, above, they are on a firm basis, they remain in the humidity. Even the mojo may appear below.
When choosing a bed, they also influence the customs.
Those who have spent a lot of time abroad often use a very high cot with a soft layer and will have trouble feeling well on a lower and hard surface.
" Almost all hockey players who came back from the NHL complained that they didn't sleep well here."
"For their muffled shoulders, heels and chairs, they needed mattresses with a soft viscoelastic layer."
"This type of colchones is also recommended for people with diabetes that time problems in the nervous system, so they get misinformation about joints and skin," explains Sylva Hadamskiková, who specializes in the sheltered furniture.
Many hockey players, like other customers, take time preferring viscoelastic cochons.
"Today there is no problem, because they have these appropriate Tempur and the Italian Magniflex, but also the Czech Tropical brand."
You don't have to be a NHL player to appreciate viscoelastics anymore.
This "miracle" works in a very simple way.
Optimise your stiffness and shape depending on the absorbed heat or adapt to your body heat.
Nothing exerts pressure; during the night, it will not return as after a hard game.
Just, if I sleep better.
Viscoelastic also works as a protection against lashes.
When choosing the size of the mattress, add to its height the length of its feet, i.e., between 21 and 34 cm.
A man or woman with a height of about 180 cm will need a bed of between 210 and 220 cm.
The minimum width for a person should be, in a double room, 90 cm in total 180 cm.
In the case of individual rooms, for example single rooms, a minimum of 120 to 140 cm is recommended.
For a possible visit is also comfortable.
"If not, you can apply a simple standard to calculate the width: when you turn your mouth up, you should have your hands carefully picked up towards the codes," advises engineer Helena Prokopová, expert from Cechu chalouníků to decoratorů, who has been busy for many years with the problem of healthy sleep and the ergonomics of furniture, a theme taught in specialized schools.
In the double rooms, each needs its own sleeper and cot, so during the purchase you have to pay attention to combine the height of the cots.
Otherwise, it will be necessary to mount the bearings at different heights, which is not always possible in all beds.
The foam bearings should have a minimum height of 14 cm, the models inside the mills a minimum of 15 cm, of which at least three centimeters are for the layer adapted to the shapes and smoothness.
"When you touch it with your hand or when you settle in the mattress, you should certainly not notice the mules," warns Helena Prokopová.
Each bed requires a certain type of sleeper.
The fully hidden bedrooms, in which the mattress and base are like Siamese, have no sense in the bedroom.
The mattresses breathe badly and can't wash their bottom, which is often done today.
And since every night we pass between 0.2 and 0.75 l of sweat, it is clear that after about five or seven years the colchon will start to remember a large (and congested) Tamiz.
For this reason, experts reject slogans that speak of a life of up to 25 years of age or, even, of a life guarantee.
However, everything has a pen.
Therefore, the sellers give advice: in the mattresses with a width of 120 or 140 cm, carefully take care of the cleaning and washing of the floor, but better add a pillow protector that can be removed and washed easily.
Although carpets are currently made with cream closures throughout their perimeter, so when they are opened they remain in two parts (very important for washing and washing size!), their manipulation in the larger models (and for one person) when raising the mattress may seem to be a struggle between a muscle weight and a heavy weight.
In bed, instead of a dreamer, does he have a firm table?
Never!
As much for the beds thought to spend one night the visits.
However, you must do (if you don't already have them) ventilation orifices on the table and you should use a shell with balls inside and a minimum height of 15 cm with balls in bags (such as German Taschenfederkern) and a soft layer.
Polyurethane cocoons should not be used on such bases.
For non-articular blades and containing between 14 and 18 blades, latex or sandwich blades (e.g. a combination of latex and coconut fibre) may be used, although it is always better a sommer with a larger number of blades, 28 or more, in which the blades in the lumbar area are reinforced and their rigidity can be regulated.
Knitted blades should not be used with a shell of mussels, as they do not react to recycling.
In addition to adjusting the stiffness of the blades, shoulder protection can also be used.
It is a special fixation of the blades that allow to press or, even, to tilt the blades in such a way that they "wheel" perfectly to their shoulders during sleep.
For men with very broad shoulders, this is something very important.
Even they are remembered by the colchone manufacturers who, in the "males", began to use a softer area around their shoulders.
Women are also remembered, for which they place a softer area around the chairs.
For the most demanding customers, there are sommers with cross-structure or tables with the so-called multitortion amortization.
The pressure is distributed between different points and the tension is lowered.
It should also be taken into account that, although it uses the right spoon and sommer, if it uses a poor breakfast (large and "mullida"), most of the benefits will disappear.
The basic standard is simple: the pillow should support the head and the corners can only reach the shoulders, so that the muscles of the same are relaxed.
The recommended size is 50 x 60 cm, something normal for example in Scandinavia.
On falling sideways, the cushion should be at the same level (when combined with the shoulder with shoulder strength or the softest area of the thigh) than the shoulder height.
Modern mattresses have something to see, it seems, with the original mattresses filled with pajamas.
Manufacturers continue to use, increasingly, natural materials or, at least, mixtures.
In fact, biological colchons are fashionable.
Oil-based raw materials, with which polyurethane foam is made, are filled with natural oils, such as rice or soybean.
In fact, practically all known manufacturers use soy.
"Biologically, in the case of colchones, it means that the centre is only made of natural materials," explains Petr Vaszäček of Tropico Plus.
Natural substances are also used during the manufacture of the base of the colons, one of the first true aloe.
But you can also choose from the microcapsulas, which release a fresh aroma to wood or lavender.
There are also differences for men and women.
While men "refresh" with vegetable extracts of bristle, so that the bottom of the mattress absorbs heat and refreshes the body, women prefer "heat" the bottom.
Red pepper extract improves blood circulation, so that women feel warmer.
The favorites right now?
The cocoons made of cold foam, which are more porous, with a structure of adapted cells, make them more permeable than normal polyurethane and offer more permeability.
The combination of various cold and viscoelastic foam stiffs allows for the manufacture of mattresses from various areas that know perfectly where the head, shoulders and heel goes.
A good-quality cocoon will cost you seven thousand crowns to the top.
Those who perform a therapeutic function usually have a lower VAT, since they are considered health care.
The first one to gain this advantage in the Czech Republic was Gumotex.
It is difficult to save in the mattresses and somericans.
Sometimes the offers of manufacturers or sellers can be approved, which sometimes offer two cocoons at the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex brand offers Duofreze mattresses with a foam with memory memory attached to the bottom by 11,990 crowns.
The second one can be obtained free of charge.
The age of viscoelastic with an open cell structure and a great density began with Tempur's "cosmic" material.
Initially, it emerged as a material for NASA, because during the shootings, loathsome astronauts were subjected to a huge overload.
Tempur gets rid of the heat and gets tired of the cold.
Therefore, the human body, warm, exerts a perfect effect and adapts its pressure optimally.
Therefore, it is ideal to avoid the occurrence of strokes, although also to improve comfort during sleep.
The viscoelastic foam is used not only in the mattresses, but also in sanitary products, for example for pillows that are placed under the legs and relieve them, as well as their circulation.
National manufacturers, for example, use the Eucatherm C or Twinsaver foam and similar.
More and more parents use tracking devices to control their children
The fear of children leads more and more people to think about controlling them by GPS.
The system, initially intended for vehicle tracking, can also follow the movement of people and thus contribute, for example, in case of the disappearance of the nine-year-old Anička Janatková.
The device currently has the approximate size of a lock box, but it will soon be reduced to the size of a clock.
Many people were afraid of the missing Anička case and began to inform about the means available to better protect their children.
Even at the cost of invading your privacy.
"We all try to tell ourselves that it is not about spying, but about another way to reduce the possibility of a tragedy," says Petro Pilin of Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of tracking devices in the Czech market.
"I recognize that, in certain cases, such devices can be abused, for example if they are placed in someone's pocket without their knowledge, but we have not yet met such cases."
"Most customers actually buy it for security reasons," Pilin adds.
In their opinion, children should always know what "cajita" is for and how it is used in case of emergency.
Children's psychologist Dana Bočkova warns about the fact that if the child doesn't want to wear it, he'll just pull it off.
"Even younger children show great creativity when they deliberately lose certain things if they want to avoid being controlled."
"In the past, the parents relied enormously on the mobiles, but they could be turned off as easily as the tracking device," Bočkova says.
In his view, it is questionable whether such a device is really useful in the event of an attack.
"If it is a prepared kidnapping, the author will practically always check if the child carries some kind of electronic device that can reveal his location."
"Now it's the phone."
"As the use of tracking devices is expanding, you will also search for them, as their sale will undoubtedly be carried out with great publicity."
"In such cases, criminals always go ahead of the police," says the psychologist.
However, it adds that such devices can help in the case of an improvised attack by a pedophile.
According to Robert Čech of the RC Monitoring company, which provides tracking services for both vehicles and people, even if, after an attack, the tracking device is destroyed immediately, its presence can serve as aid.
"The device can be configured to send the position regularly after a certain period."
"If damage occurs, it will at least facilitate the last position of the person concerned."
"The most expensive devices have an inclination meter integrated, so if the person just goes off and remains mobile, the device will immediately issue a warning with the position in question," Čech says.
In your opinion, a service of this kind can be obtained even with smart mobile phones with navigation, in which only a special software should be installed.
The problem of current tracking units is that these are currently devices with a size similar to a lock box or smaller mobile phones.
Therefore, they can be lost.
According to Macro Weil Pilin, for that reason tests are currently being carried out with devices that look like a digital clock.
"In addition, they will have the added advantage that a potential attacker may not identify the device."
"Or identifying it after a certain time, which can make the police take time," he adds.
Although the tracking devices are carried in the mouth or hanging, they will continue to use the same technology used to track vehicles.
It is a check of position with a GPS system (which is used in the usual car navigation) combined with the function of a mobile phone that communicates the current position.
The army has enough bullets like to round all of the Czech Republic, but it only lasts two years.
The Czech army bought 445 kilometers of mecha to catch explosives.
Last year, the Ministry of Defence added 224 kilometres of mecha to its arsenal.
Therefore, they have stocks for 225 years.
The problem is that the mecha's useful life is two years, four to the sum.
The army bought the machine for explosives to the STV Group, a.s. per forty million crowns.
The General's staff responded to MF DNES justifying the purchase of such a huge amount of mecha, saying the soldiers need for training manoeuvres 60 kilometres of mecha per year.
According to the military pyrotechnic calculations, with which MF DNAS was contacted, it was decided, however, that, in such a case, these manoeuvres should be carried out with frequent use of explosives every year as well as all generals, senior officials, and even secretaries and cleaners.
They didn't want any exemptions, neither did the Minister of Defence Alexander Vondr and the captain of the Vlastimil Picek army.
Only in this way could it be justified that the army spends 60 kilometres of mecha.
This length is equal to 25,000 explosions.
Even so, the army would have sufficient stocks for more than ten years.
If, on the contrary, as experts say, for the initial training of each new professional arrives at a maximum of two metres, the army would have sufficient stocks with the new purchase (including the consumption of engineering or special units) for the 225 above.
The troops of the rapid intervention brigade complained personally to Minister Vondra a short time ago because they said they had only ammunition for several weapons, so even the money-providing practices were limited.
And let's not talk about the lack of inner clothing.
"I also can't understand that we're constantly getting these numbers of mecha."
"But it's their decision and they'll certainly know why they act like that."
"For us, the army is a good client to whom, as a company, we try to satisfy," admits the business director of STV Group, Jan Děcký.
The spokesman of the Ministry of Defence Jan Pejšek defends hundreds of miles of mecha saying he will also have stocks of this "munision" for at least ten years.
However, Jan Děcký, of the STV Group, indicates that the mecha only has a useful life of four years and, in the case of pyrotechnic products for the army or police, for two years.
"If it is stored in perfect conditions, it can last up to four," says one of the soldiers who, because of the possible criticisms of the army, does not want to give its name.
After the end of their useful life, each ammunition must be carefully checked to see if it remains reliable and will not harm the soldiers.
But these tests are not free and require an additional investment.
Another argument of the Ministry is that, when buying 445 kilometers of mecha, he got a discount.
"We were costing 60% less than the last year's 244 km application," says spokesman Pejšek from the Ministry of Defence shopping center.
Only to compare: the annual mass consumption of police pyrotechnics, which eliminates the ammunition of World War II or left by the Soviet army, does not exceed 1,500 metres for years.
In addition, the police always ask only the fair amount of ammunition to be exhausted before the end of their useful life.
They decided it for safety reasons for pyrotechnics and, in addition, as long as more modern and reliable mix types can be achieved.
The Ministry already has clear difficulties in ending tens of thousands of tons of munitions of the Warsaw Pact, when the Czechoslovakian army of two hundred thousand people was preparing for a campaign in the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnics with whom MF DNAS spoke, after a few years the following problem will arise with the present: it will have to be removed hundreds of miles of old mecha, which is now being purchased "bare".
So far, I'm still living from the contacts I got thanks to the competition
The fact that winning the "Employer of the Year" contest helped Lukaš Pytloun in the sale of the franchises of his hotel.
The last edition won the competition "Employer of the Year" the 28-year-old entrepreneur Lukaš Pytloun de Liberec.
His story of success seems to be taken out of a movie.
And Lucas Pytloun just loved traveling.
Foreigners realized that in Liberec there was a lack of quality accommodation at a good price.
With the savings he met with seasonal work abroad and a bank loan he bought a house that was half a broken five-bed house.
Considering that he was still studying his third year at the university, he was really brave.
"At present, the quality-price ratio of the accommodation in our area has moved me to do something about it," says Lukaš Pytloun.
He started renting the first refurbished floor for foreign workers.
All incomes received in return for investment in the building, which gradually turned into a pension of 54 rooms.
Since then, in seven years of business, he has managed to gradually open up four pensions in Liberec, two style restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of about 300 in all categories of accommodation.
The most comfortable of all was, until recently, the four-star Pytloun design hotel.
This year, however, opened up another of the same quality.
"We have just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov or Tísé, to which we have sold our concept of sincerity, and other people are showing interest in a Pytloun franchise," said the businessman number one last year.
"This sale of hotel opening licences has greatly helped to win the 'Employer of the Year' competition'," he adds grateful Pytloun.
The victory increased its fame and popularity both in Liberec and in the surrounding areas.
"People recognized me on the street, they still congratulated me often and, I must say, it was very nice," he recalls.
He certainly recommends to everyone that he wants to try out a company that participates in the competition.
But it does not think that it is necessary to win, but that participation is already beneficial.
He claims that, up to now, he still lives from contacts and acquaintances that, without the competition, he might not have obtained.
"With some people I've met thanks to the competition, I've started to work with people."
The fame associated with success, in its view, also included employees,
in total around seventy.
"I have seen that they show greater loyalty and are proud to participate in something that gained general recognition."
"It's not much less my own personal success, but it's the result of the hard work of the entire team."
"It's only my name that appears on the first level," says modestly today Lukaš Pytloun.
I wish my successor a more peaceful year than we had in Farmet.
The euphoria of victory was soon disbanded by the impact of the crisis.
Thanks to the hard work of the winner, it is possible that Farmet has already passed the worst.
The owner of the company Farmet, Karel Žjárský, received the first prize in the last edition of the Vodafone competition "Company of the Year", last year in the "Slave House" of Prague.
The jury appreciated its efforts, with which it managed to convert a small technical workshop to Česká Skalice into a firm with a volume of hundreds of millions of businesses.
"I can say that the award not only encouraged me, but all my colleagues and improved our confidence in fighting competition," says last year's winner.
The history of Farmet begins with the desire to do something useful.
Therefore, when the State proposed to Karel Žjárský's father to rent a small workshop as compensation for the property embargo during communism, he did not hesitate too much; he resigned to his position in the company where he worked and, with a couple of companions, founded the company with his father of plastic batteries.
Soon thereafter, they began to specialize in vegetable oil press.
Eight years later they became the largest automatic press manufacturer in the centre of Europe.
They also gained a greater presence among the unspecialized public after achieving success in the media contest.
"Not only did our customers start to view the Farmet brand as much better, but foreign partners also began to appreciate the collaboration with a company that gained greater success in their country," says Karel Žjárský.
Last year perhaps it wasn't just a sample of the euphoria of victory in Farmet.
It also received recognition for commercial results until 2008 and partly from 2009.
And just the year 2009 was the toughest year for the sale of machinery.
The deterioration of the crisis, which had not yet reached so many citizens, caused companies to stop their investment projects and to start limiting the purchase of new machinery or technologies.
"We obviously don't get rid of this situation either."
"The income was reduced by 40%, we had to limit production and we even had some discounts," says Karel Jjárský.
A viable company should, at times, take even unpopular measures.
However, they controlled the situation and maintained the company's profits, although at lower levels than before the crisis.
Nevertheless, where Farmet did not cut costs was research and development.
"With the grants we have built a research and training centre, strengthened the presence on the international market and obtained magnificent ratings at national fairs," Jjárský says.
Everything indicates they've already left the crisis behind.
Income increases again and, with them, the number of new employees.
"The new achievement hopes to bring a sense of victory, but in a calmer atmosphere," says Karel Jjárský.
A study that reveals ridiculous norms
The Absurdez survey of the year is part of the business tournament for the fourth time.
He has already managed to eliminate some ridiculous rules.
The unknown winner of the new edition of the Absurdez survey of the year was the obligation to bring to the administration documents to which officials can access online.
The decision was adopted by more than one-third of almost 4,000 voters.
For example, the administration of social security asked for an extract from the commercial register, although its officials could obtain it with two movements of the mouse.
Thanks to the survey, this has changed.
"The Czech social security administration will no longer ask for an extract from the trade register when it carries out a control of the insurance's taxes," ČSSZ spokesman Jana Buranová said.
The objective of the Absurdez survey of the year is to consult the rules and regulations that companies and entrepreneurs in Chequia should respect and try to eliminate those who are absurd.
This year forms for the fourth time part of the corporate tournament of the publication Hospodářské noviny and begins to create affection among the general public as well.
While last year's edition included the participation of three thousand voters, this year almost reached four thousand.
And it is not surprising, since we still have a number of remaining legal obligations that must be respected simply to trade.
"Perhaps in number of papers needed for the tax declaration we are in the world first," says Karel Havlíček of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Businesses of the Czech Republic.
For years, simplification of business standards has been a declared goal of all governments.
However, compared with the rest of the world, the situation of improvement especially in the Czech Republic.
According to the World Bank, from the point of view of the conditions for having a company, Chequia is located in position 74a, i.e. eight worse positions than last year.
The Absurdez contest of the year was held for the first time in 2006 and repeats the same way each year.
Anyone can indicate any administrative or bureaucratic absurdity each year between April and the end of September, when the competition is closed.
The proposals can be made on the website www.firmoroku.cz. The contest organizer then selects seven candidates for the “anti-prime” and, during October, allows the public to vote on the Internet via www.firmoroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
You win the absurdity you get more votes.
For this year's survey, more than a hundred were submitted, in particular 105 rules and regulations that did not make sense.
Examples were sent by both employers and professional associations and journalists.
Among the "finalists" of the competition, for example, was the requirement that vehicles for the maintenance of roads and highways pay the fee or that businessmen with twenty employees, two offices and two bathrooms paint the walls every two years.
The list of seventy proposals this year is published on the competition pages.
The announcement of the competition, which is always held in early November at Wenceslao Square in Prague, is part of an event in which people in the political and social world often participate.
This year, for example, they attended this event of the Eva Svobodová competition, director of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises and Businesses of the Czech Republic, or Petr Kužel, president of the Chamber of Commerce of the Republic.
"Economic prosperity cannot be maintained if the State constantly puts employers at work, so my goal is to eliminate every year a minimum of thirty paragraphs that currently make trade unnecessary," said Minister of Industry and Commerce Martin Kocourek.
Efforts to eliminate absurd regulations are not left to waste water.
In 2007, what bothered people most was the employer's obligation to communicate with a three-day advance to the business office of the permanent operating area, the intention to go with a place at a fair or exhibition.
This obligation was eliminated in the new industrial law.
The obligation that it ended in the second place in the number of votes in 2007, i.e. the communication to the working office by its foreign workers of working travel for up to 30 days, was eliminated by the so-called Green Card Act.
And the third one wins.
The 2009 Absurdez was the regulation for physiotherapists to have in their consultation a large mirror, a refrigerator and two ground bascules.
Therefore, this year the Ministry of Health issued a communication saying that it had removed the obligation to have a refrigerator.
A new category recognizes socially responsible companies
Environmental, humanitarian, educational or sporting projects are being evaluated.
The innovation in this fifth edition of the competition of Hospodářské noviny is the category called Corporate responsible for 2010.
The fact of this competition is to support the responsible and fair undertakings.
"This is how we want to support companies that deal with the environmental impact of their activities and that support socially responsible activities," says Patrick Bartholdy, regional director of the Vodafone mobile operator, organizer and sponsor of the competition, as in the case of the Rebelde of the year.
For this new special subcategory of this year's edition of Vodafone Company's 2010 main competition, companies for which commercial success is not the only long-term objective.
The story of each of them is inspiring and would allow us to write an independent article.
Although the type of activity varies completely between one and the other, the common denominator is the support and consideration they offer.
In one case, for example, they are persons with disabilities, in others those with personal or health problems of employees.
Among the 14 finalists in the whole of the Republic, for example, was the company Pragian Software et Netera, which supports the formation of informal sports teams among its workers, who then participate in tournaments of various sports.
Another example of a company in charge of the Pardubice area is the company Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main contributor of funds for sponsoring children with disabilities for seven years.
In Poděbrad, there is a paper that is particularly concerned about the health problems of its workers, as they represent more than 70 per cent of the model, which is why it received the title of the company responsible for the central area of Chequia and in the Vodafone Company competition of the year ended in third place in the region.
In Olomouc, the MiRyz Soft accounting company, which reduced the working hours, even below the average of 35 hours, did not reduce wages.
The title was also granted because it is primarily purchased by Czech manufacturers, supports Community activities in the area and respects the environment.
"We try to recycle as much as possible in order for our production and administration activities to have as little impact on the environment as possible," explains Entrepreneur Milosche Ryznarová.
The responsible IT Enlogit company in the Ústí region also thinks about the health of its employees and, with each laptop, offered them an ergonomic chair and keyboards; it also supports the work from home and in its business events uses the catering services of a local protected company.
"In addition, we support the person's scholarship, which specifically assists the local Roma community," said the representative of Ondřej Suchý.
They are also in the right place with a mention of the Praní cleaning company in the Karlovy Vary region, whose employees receive benefits in a special way that affects their pension funds.
"We give benefits in food, transport, improvement of qualifications and leisure," says Josef Strapáč, of Bruntál Czasch construction company, winner in the Moravia-Silesia region.
In the category of Company responsible for the year, it was automatically designated to all regional finalists of the Vodafone Company competition of the year who responded to the questions of the registration form and sent it to the organizers before 15 August.
Organizers removed from the evaluation the forms that were not complete or incorrect.
"If the representatives of the competing companies did not answer the questions, they could not participate in the year's corporate competition, but were not disqualified from the "principal" Vodafone Company of the year."
"The individual applications for this competition are not allowed, since it is a subcategory of the year's main Company competition," explains Karel Goldman of the Bison & Rose Advisory.
Police arrested during a public auction in the building of the Agricultural Fund, in Pilsen
The anti-corruption police have carried out various arrests in the agricultural fund building in the last few days.
The detectives married a local media businesser and the real estate businesser Lubosh G.
It seems that this attempt is to manipulate a public auction in progress for the refund of rights so that the auctioned land will receive a precise interest.
I should have paid Lubosh G. half a million crowns for that.
"For the moment, I can only say that the police are looking for a person by bribe during a public auction and public bid," Pávo said the chief general prosecutor of Pilsen Antonie Zelená, adding that he cannot now disclose any more details about the ongoing investigation.
After twenty-four hours, the police released the businessman for 46 years.
On the way he could influence the public auction, given the few official information, you can only speculate.
The spokesperson for the Lubomíra Černá Agricultural Fund responded to the questions of Pávo saying that the police had actually carried out the arrest at Pilsen headquarters and was during a public auction.
"It's a customer, not one of our employees," he said.
According to Černá, the public auction is called "Convocation for the submission of land transfer proposals in accordance with the land law" and takes place when several interested parties appear in relation to the land offered.
"These persons, during the call, offer a value higher than their refund, which must be transferred before the value of the land is announced."
"On the basis of the tenders, the order of the buyers is determined and then the Agricultural Fund transfers the land to the person offering the highest offer," the Fund spokesman explained.
Luboš G. had information on who was going to submit to the summons and, at the same time, was interested in the acquisition of various refund rights, proposed to the stakeholders on the ground that they would not participate in the auction.
Please, he was charging a commission.
This would explain that, at the time of the arrest, he had so much money above.
Lubosh G. had special contacts with the Pilsen Fund for a long time.
It was because of the former head of the PF Václav Sankot, who was accused of disposing of the replacement of land for which a construction decision had already been issued.
For example, Lubosh G. has just obtained some land from the Fund for the construction of public infrastructure, in particular where a large road to the industrial area of Borská Pole should be built.
Then he changed them very beneficially with the magistrate by a house in the historical center of the city with a very higher value.
In this case, the town had to intervene because, otherwise, the blocked land would avoid construction.
Families should pay extra expenses of several hundred crowns per month
Households will have to pay from January not only for all types of energy, but also for water and electricity, heating supplements and, in some cases, larger rents.
Therefore, families will have to get out of the wallet, starting in January, several hundred crowns a month more than now.
The price of electricity increases by 4.6%, the gas is about 2%, in some cities up to 10% more due to water supply, and many also increase the price of central heating.
The rise in electricity for families living in apartments should go up to about 100 crowns per year than now.
However, the main electricity suppliers have reduced prices, as support for renewable energy production has increased, in particular photovoltaic.
However, the gas is moderately close, especially at the time when heating is used more and therefore greater is consumption.
In this case, they should also have a few hundred crowns a year.
While electricity and gas are concentrated throughout the country, the price change of central heating varies from place to place.
The rise in prices is mainly planned by the largest municipality.
For example, the households of Pardubice or Hradec Králové will pay some 50 crowns a month since January due to central heating, while the Liberec families will pay more than 1,000 additional crowns a year.
The residents of Prague should also bear an increase of 9% of the water price and heating, especially if the city increases the rental of infrastructure.
If the rental does not vary, the Pragues will pay an additional 6.8 per cent.
Prices in Prague, however, will continue to be among the lowest in the country.
In northern Bohemia, where current prices are among the highest, both rates will be 7.4%.
The rental prices of 450,000 apartments rented in Prague can be significantly increased, where the regulation will end in January.
For example, the CPI Byty company, which has in Ústí nad Labem about 2,500 floors, will increase the rental from January to 100%.
The company will bring to the courts those who do not agree with the new tenant.
The regulated rentals, which benefit residents of about 300,000 flats, could increase the year that comes to 10%.
Young Czechs get drunk with Fernet and rum. The beer is no longer fashionable, because it makes a slow effect
Fernet, ron, vodka and even good whiskey stolen from their parents.
These are the drinks that cause them to end up in medical care for young drinkers under the age of 15.
The children who end up in the hospital constantly to overcome the breakup are no longer an exception.
This is due to the experience of doctors who experience such cases in hospital paediatric admissions.
"Drinking beer or wine is no longer fashionable, because they take a long time to get drunk."
"Now fashion is the strong alcoholic drinks," says Pravo, the head of the hospital's pediatrician Horůovice in the center of Bohemia, Ludzek Pelikán.
"When they can get a bottle to their father of the alacena, it can be whiskey, but it's usually Fernet and vodka."
"The vodka has the advantage of smoothing it down and not smelling so much," he explains.
It is also confirmed by the spokesperson of the University Hospital Motol, Eva Jurinová.
"Normally, it's usually Fernet or rum."
"These are modern alcoholic beverages, especially among schoolchildren."
"In some cases, they use the waiting time they took home," Jurinová adds.
According to Chief Pelikán, they are drinkers of thirteen and fourteen years who usually appear in hospitals.
Prior to Horóvice, where he has been working since this year, he has worked for a decade in the pediatrics in Motol, where the ambulances took young people from nearby areas.
"A girl had to enter maybe four times."
"He began at twelve years of age when he was brought with 3.5 alcohol in blood, plus a mixture with ecstasy," says the department doctor in this case.
"He was at the Holeshovice fair at a dance party."
"The interesting thing is that his mother didn't even surprise him that his daughter disappeared 48 hours," the boss is surprised.
It is precisely the lack of interest of parents or even their clear tolerance to drinking by their children, which is considered the main cause of increased consumption of alcohol among young people.
Experts point out that, in the case of children, it is not possible to speak of dependence.
"It is understood by alcohol to a person who has a chronic dependence on alcohol for several years, with all the phenomena associated with it, which does not occur in children."
"In those who drink alcohol repeatedly, rather it is due to a systematically failed social or family environment," explains Chief Pelikán.
According to spokesperson Jurinová, this year at the Pediatric Clinic of Motol hospital hospitalized up to mid-November forty Hebrew children.
However, statistics only show those with severe poisoning and must remain in the hospital.
Young drinkers who do not have a home with their parents or with the police after the medical checkup.
In addition to the cases in which children simply meet after school and drink in anticipation, there are three seasonal altitudes for Pelikan to mention: the day of witches, the end of the year and the end of the school course.
"In such a situation, they drink because of the bad notes or, on the contrary, they celebrate the start of the holidays."
"In the day of the witches I have come to see in admissions up to seven Hebrew children at the same time," Pelikán adds.
Drinkers who spend the night in detoxification under the supervision of doctors, paradoxically, have the advantage that the next day they do not suffer a terrible rest at home.
The morning headache, caused by dehydration and lack of glucose, is avoided by injecting a serum with glucose and the nutrients that the body lacks.
"These carry him much better, because after the busy night, they get up well and don't hurt them at all."
"There are only confusions about where they are," says Pelikán, adding that patients often lose their sense of humor at least when they see the costs they have generated.
The ambulance transfer and hospitalization in a room for severe patients comes to cost a tens of thousands of crowns.
"I have often used the cost as a means of educating them, when I visit them directly to tell the children how much their drunkenness has cost and that they would have to spend all summer in a job for young people to earn enough to pay that night," Pelikán adds.
Medical insurance, in its opinion, may be a regressive measure, which usually returns the costs of treatment to people, does not do so in the case of children who drink.
Two L-159 aircraft are for the first time in Spain
Two L-159 planes from a total of five, by which the Czech Ministry of Defence replaced the aircraft Casa C-295M, departed on Tuesday to Seville, where the manufacturer of the aircraft Casa - EADS is located.
This is the first time a device of this kind is in the hands of someone who is not the Czech army.
For the time being, they were only abroad for practical or demonstration flights.
It is the version L-159T1, which so far was used by the Czech army and was still able to fly.
The remaining three planes are L-159.
These are still stored in Aer Vodochody and the broker of the sale, Omnipol company, was already charged with them last week.
Jan Pešk, from the defense press department, indicates that it is not yet known when the planes will be physically withdrawn from Vodochody.
"The L-159, on the other hand, were separated from the aircraft repaired long ago, without investments or additional contributions by the Ministry."
"The L-159T1 Biplazas have changed into their current state," Pávo Pejšek said.
He added that the army did not remain without two-planes, since in May 2009 the army signed a contract with Air Vodochody for an amount of 200 million crowns for the construction of four L-159 non-necessary devices for two-pieces.
One of the new aircraft has already been received by the army in July, the other will be delivered at the end of the year.
According to Pejšek, EADS committed itself to adding aircraft to the equipment of some allied countries.
"The contract clearly states that EADS is the one that removes L-159 aircraft and will serve for NATO pilot practices."
"Therefore, it depends on the buyer to decide how to use them in this framework," says Pejšek.
The newspaper Hospodářské noviny published before time that, for example, the Spanish army is not interested in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159 by an aircraft Casa and the purchase of three other aircraft for 3,500 million crowns was approved last year by the government of Mirek Topolánek.
The Ministry of Defence did not call for an invitation to tender for the purchase and negotiate directly with EADS.
The current defence management claims that the exchange promotes future L-159 exports abroad.
The Czech army acquired Aer 72 aircraft and only uses 24, which is why it wants to sell the rest.
The purchase of aircraft is likely to have judicial consequences.
The European Commission has already appealed to the Czech Ministry of Defence before the European Court of Justice because it should choose the aircraft by making a European bid and not contacting a single manufacturer.
The army has already received three Casa planes and the last one should arrive at Kbely's Prague airport in fourteen days.
A longer index finger that the angular indicates a lower risk of suffering from cancer
Men who have the longest index that the anal are exposed to a lower risk of prostate cancer.
This is the surprising conclusion of a study published on Wednesday in a British journal on cancer.
It could depend on the testosterone level, the male hormone.
"Our results indicate that the relative length of the finger can be a simple test of the risk of prostate cancer, particularly for men up to 60 years of age," said the co-author of the Ros Eeles study, professor of the Institute for Cancer Research at Warwick University.
Therefore, the finger could help determine which men should undergo a prostate cancer test, in particular if this feature is associated with a genetic risk or other harmful factors, such as family health problems, as Eeles indicates.
During the period 1994-2009, he followed with a British counterpart of over 1,500 patients with prostate cancer and, at the same time, 3,000 healthy men.
More than half of the participants in the study had the indian finger of the right hand shorter than the abbreviation.
They had the same odds of suffering from prostate cancer as 19% of those whose fingers were of the same length.
In the case of men with a longer index than the finger, this risk was reduced by 33%; for men with less than 60%, the reduction reached 87%.
The relationship between the length of the two fingers in question, determined during the prenatal period, reflects different levels of hormones to which the fetus is exposed in the matrix.
A lower testosterone level corresponds to a longer index.
Previous studies indicated that testosterone affects the development of prostate cancer.
The great Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, Professor Václav Pačes, told ČTK that he knew the study, but that he did not feel that the relationship between the length of his fingers and cancer could "be fully demonstrated".
The Czech Republic under snow: D1 and D5 are closed
Chequia, like most of Europe, had a snow cover on Thursday.
The roads and steels are covered mainly by compact snow and the Quitanieve machines circled all night for many areas.
In the morning, the D5 road was closed between the miles 89 and 93 towards Rozvadov due to several accidents of industrial vehicles and tourism, as well as the D1 in Brno towards Prague.
The news was transmitted by the operator of the Central Automotoklubu (UAMK).
A truck was found in the mile 91, in 93 they hit two industrial vehicles that caused injuries.
Several tourists also ended up in the county.
There are also problems on the D1 motorway in the 185 km towards Prague.
There were two trucks in there.
Drivers must move slowly after Brno in the 190 km or cross Brno and incorporate in the 182 km in Kývalce.
There have been traps of several kilometers.
An accident has also occurred on the D11 road, right next to Prague.
Prague is covered by a snow layer of several centimeters and the thermometers indicate -7 oC.
They are forming traps for example in Prosek, although it is also congested Štěrboholská.
The safest means of transport is the metro.
Travías circulate with delay, for example in the line between Karlov namajestí and Namajestí Miru.
At eight o'clock in the morning, another crisis state will occur in Prague.
The problems also affect railways and the airport.
Because of the snow, the Czech railway company had to cancel seven connections at three speeds.
The problems, for example, affect the line between Prague and Kralupy or Prague and Beroun.
Travelers should check what is the current situation.
Ruzyně Airport closed from 11 a.m. to 5 a.m.
Currently, most roads in southern Moravia can already be crossed, but with extreme caution.
In Vyškovska there are closed to traffic three secondary roads, in Brnońska snow languages are being formed and in Blanenska there are chains needed to access certain access routes to the highest points.
One of the most affected places was Vyškovsko.
Until now, connections are closed: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and also Sharatice - Milesovice.
To clear them, sprayers will be required.
At the moment it cannot be said when they will be opened to the movement.
In Hodonníska, caution is required in the area of Bílé Karpaty (White Carpathies).
The roads in the region that, as it is a protected natural zone, should simply be left in an inert state, accumulate up to five centimeters of snow, as the ČTK indicates.
In Chequia they fell between two and ten centimeters of snow, more in the north of Bohemia, where the snow layer reaches 18 centimeters.
In the Moravia-Silesia region, about 15 centimeters of snow fell.
The brides gradually depart to Chequia.
American soldiers have a new "smart weapon"
The American army is using a new "smart" weapon in Afghanistan, known for the time being only by the coded name XM-25.
The generals hope that the new rifle will influence the local conflict with the Taliban and that "change the progress of the game" would win.
The new weapons are like a small gun and with an extremely precise puncture.
Its bullets are fired with a laser with a precision of several meters.
The special 25 mm calibre munition created for this rifle and the high load of explosives that contains causes it to actually work as a small grenade.
The projectiles can be programmed to exploit not only when they hit the target, but at any point in their ballistic trajectory.
They can be used against enemies hiding behind a barrier, a wall or a trench.
There is no doubt that normal protection can be used and, when it launches its deadly rain of metallic astilas, it can be essential in the battle.
According to Richard Audette, who spoke about the development of XM-25, the new rifle is the first weapon for childhood that uses a "smart" technology.
"The soldiers manipulate it in such a way that they find the target, point their laser beam, which determines the distance, then obtains a precise point of view and, depending on it, corrects the projection line and sprays the trigger."
"Let's say they've measured 543 meters."
"When the trigger is pressed, the gun is loaded and the projectile is launched at a distance of 543 meters, less than one, two or three meters," Audette points out.
400 jobs are transferred
The Fujitsu consortium moved its branch to Bad Homburg in Frankfurt.
In July next year, 400 employees will change their place of work of their former office building at the Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
The Japanese consortium Fujitsu moved its branch to Bad Homburg in Frankfurt.
As reported by the giant of the computerized sector and its maintenance on Wednesday, 400 men and women will move in July next year from their previous office building in Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, a large complex of offices on Lyoner Straße street in Niederrad district, Frankfurt.
A Fujitsu spokesman explained that, in the medium term, more than 100 employees from the consortium, who were previously disembarked by the region, would be staying there.
The offer is highly attractive, in addition to the collective office in Astro Park will favor the way employees work.
In addition, Fujitsu will be the only tenant in Bad Homburg.
Director Bernd Wagner said, "In Frankfurt-Niederrad we have found a central location with an excellent infrastructure".
The bright connection to the airport is very important at present for a global company like Fujitsu.
The new change of an important company in the region brought joy yesterday among those who were in favour and disappointment among those who were against it.
The head of the Frankfurt Economics Section, Markus Frank (CDU) said that a Global Player has been won.
This is a "magnificent recognition of location".
Fujitsu sits in the city, the settlement is a great boost for Niederrad.
Bod Hombruger, Michael Korwisi (Greens) complains about Fujitsu's decision.
The management first informed the city of its intention.
"Of course we have offered the company our help," Korwisi said.
However, the good contacts of the computer manufacturer with the owner of the property in Marienbader Platz have not been able to change the difficulties.
At the end of the day, the economic causes resulted in a fall.
Thus, there is now a great empty place to cover in the famous place.
"I hope the owner and tenant of the building are cooperative."
The furniture previously used by Fujitsu in the Rathausplatz and the "Kleine Verticale" neighborhood were part of the sovereign buildings of Marienbader Platz for ten years of a controversial project to build the city of the pool.
As a joint project of the city and a private project company between the station and the town, a new entrance to the city is being created, which is responsible for the criticism of the massive construction that previously used the holes as parking spaces and the level of the buildings.
In 2001 the investment council and charging companies, the software manufacturer for reservation systems, Start Amadeus, and then merged Siemens with the Fujitsu computer manufacturer house.
In 2006, the building used by Fujitsu was acquired by the real estate group of Frankfurt, Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Group together with Morgan Stanley Real Estate and a year later sold to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
The Fujitsu consortium, originating in Tokyo, is recognized as the third largest global IT supplier.
It has companies, such as computers and servers, and also provides accurate services.
The Rhein-Main-Gebiet branch is one of the largest in Germany, and Fujitsu has more businesses in Munich anyway.
The Fujitsu Technology Solutions branch is installed from Bad Homburg in Frankfurt-Niederrad, the following subsidiaries in this site will be Fujitsu Services and a company named TDS.
That's why 7,000 square meters have been rented in the Astro Park office building.
The old complex of the 20s, its name refers to its plan in the form of a star, among other things to the central electrical association and to the electronic industry.
Amazon Cancels Server - Threats to Assange
Anxiety gets more and more from Wikileaks.
Amazon Internet service provider has removed the disclosure platform from its server.
It is possible that political pressure is behind the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic documents.
Assange, the founder of Wikileaks, appears to be detained in England.
Wikileaks' revelation platform is always the white of criticisms, always stronger in the United States.
Internet activists have lost access to their former American server and are currently looking for an Internet homeland in Europe.
The well-known American senator, Joe Lieberman, calls other countries and companies to the Wikileaks boycott.
And the founder of Wikileaks, Julian Assange, who is on the list of people seeking Interpol, must remain detained in Britain, according to an article.
"Wikileaks expelled from the Amazon server."
"Speak freely in the country of freedom," the disclosure activists reported on Wednesday (local time) via the Twitter message service.
Shortly before, the Internet company, Amazon, had removed Wikileaks documents from your server.
Internet activists had used the publication of secret diplomatic documents to the Amazon service website to address high numbers of access to documents.
Through Twitter, Wikileaks explained the following: "Perfectly, we will target our dollars to hire people in Europe."
If Amazon has problems with freedom of expression, "they should stop selling books."
Amazon stopped using its server via Wikileaks, after a Senator Joe Lieberman employee had requested investigations, reported the CNN chain according to a call to Lieberman's office.
The presidency of the Senate Security Council had threatened Amazon with boycott, British "Guardian" reported.
"I had wished that Amazon would take these measures before, before previous publications of information classified by Wikileaks," said the senator.
Lieberman also requested that the platform also prohibit the use of the server in other countries.
"The illegal, monstrous and unconsidered process of Wikileaks puts our national security and threatens life in the world," said an independent senator statement.
"No company in charge, whether American or foreign, should help Wikileaks with their service to expand stolen material.
The founder of Wikileaks, Assange, who is sought in Sweden for suspected rape, is on the list of people sought for Interpol.
According to an article in the London newspaper "The Independent", the 39-year-old Australian is detained in Great Britain, Scotland Yard knows the exact place.
Internet activist has consistently qualified research in Sweden as a plot of his enemy.
Wikileaks spokesperson Kristinn Hraftsson said in London that threats have existed.
"There were even calls about a murder of Julian Assange."
That's why he's afraid of Assange's safety, Hraftsson said.
Therefore, the location of the founder of Wikileaks remains undiscovered.
Hraftsson clearly responded to the North American statements.
In America, the former governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, stated that the responsible for the revelations of Wikileaks should be tried for treason and executed.
In Canada, he said a chief of government, Stephen Harper, clearly ironically, on television, Assange should "be murdered" and Obama could "use a drone".
Between the White House and Assange there is a great dispute.
Robert Gibbs, the spokesperson of American President Barack Obama, called "ridicul and absurd" that Assange had requested the resignation of the state secretary, if she was responsible for ordering recently diplomats involved in espionage tasks.
"I'm not absolutely sure why we should care about the opinion of a guy with a website," Gibbs said.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are much stronger than your website."
The US government has to demonstrate the effectiveness of protecting its databases in general.
Russell Travers, Deputy Director of Distribution of the National Anti-Terrorism Centre, was appointed an exceptional officer, the White House announced.
So Travers is responsible for developing "the important structural reforms", which are necessary in the light of Wikileaks' filtering.
The White House also wants to inspect the roads, as well as to change the total information about the government and protect it.
In addition, the U.S. government announced that in order to deal with the safety of dissidents and activists, the publication of Wikileaks should be endangered.
"We have done our best to get in touch with them," said State Department spokesman Philip Crowley.
"We are prepared to help protect them if necessary."
The university of ice cream
At the "Gelato University" in Bologna, refrigerators are prepared in the best times of the year.
The three-day basic course for future refrigerators has the highest flow and visitors around the world.
Where does all the ice come from?
Ice cream and ice cream.
The ice cream is prepared according to all the rules of Italian art for the preparation of ice creams.
The ice cream extracts with a spatula the ice cream from the display, extends it over the boat and sells it.
To know this, you don't have to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But whoever wants to know more about ice cream should not visit the "Gelato University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The manufacturer has equipped the ice cream university with the freezer in 2003, so that the ice cream cream of its machines meets the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The three-day basic course for future refrigerators has the highest flow and visitors around the world.
There are also more special courses for more days on chocolate ice and practice in the ice cream shop of the house itself.
In these times of crisis, some dream of a new professional career, others risk in the mild ice, their vague desires.
This time 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents, from Brazil to Saudi Arabia passing through Hungary.
Jacky, professor of this art in California, loves the slow movement of food and in the future wants to offer a European product of quality in the land of industrial ice cream.
Anke, from Berlin, is a business advisor and wants to create something of his own within a few years of an energizing job.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening a refrigerator in Cairo.
A man from Malta and another from Brazil want to improve the quality of the ice creams of their bars, and a Canadian housewife, Julia, comes because her children love Italian ice creams.
The ice cream teacher Luciano Ferrari explains to the participants later the ideal qualities of the perfect ice cream.
It is not only its good taste but also its silky mildness and its good consistency.
Luciano does not forget his formation or the birth cover of the national top house and mainly of the south of the country: "Italian ice cream is just the best, and that's why each ball has something romantic."
The first step towards development seems to be easy.
Luciano emits the basic ingredients: milk, cream, powder, sugar and stabilizers in a large battery, which heats everything with an electronic program up to 85 degrees and at the moment freezes it up to four degrees.
Then open the machine grip and exit a pasteurized white basic cream, the basis for all types of milk ice cream.
Suddenly, the professor asks: Can ice cream be prepared only with natural elements or without stabilising?
How can you give your hands up to some desires to experience?
Luciano advises that the trends of the time be resolved.
What it speaks of as ice cream "not only of natural ingredients", has best used stabilizers, mainly a natural product, probably guar gum, of guar frijol.
Of course you can make ice cream without stabilizer, you only have to buy it one day, put it in a bag and the customer will bite a granite iced sound.
Certain variations in the basic mass are allowed.
The aromas are used.
With regard to the taste of ice cream, the Teacher Luciano distinguishes the ingredients that are bought in the fruit section or in the sweetness of the supermarket.
Besides, there are powders and pasta.
"All suppliers will try to collect flavoured ingredients in their goods."
"However, they must experience once."
Whether with fruit sorbates with sugar and fresh fruits.
Or even with the ice cream of the basic white mass, which with eggs will become a yellow cream and with powder cocoa as the basis for all possible chocolate delights.
Now the participants in the course can use the refrigerators.
Luciano lets them develop four different types of vanilla ice, chocolate, moca and vellana, with or without eggs in the basic mass, with more or less vanilla flavour or other natural ingredients.
They carry out the same experiment also with types of fruit ice.
What you know better does not necessarily depend on having more toffee or more pure fruit flavour.
It is not necessary that the ice cream of avellanas is dried, if it contains more avellanas.
The working group develops the ice-cream of kiwi, which uses more fruit, less water and somewhat less stabiliser.
First, a balanced mixture highlights the flavor of ice cream, says Luciano.
The preparation of ice creams is a problem of artimetics: The melocotone powder is used with a lot of sugar, the sugar ratio of the basic recipe needs to be lowered.
For lemon ice you need an extra portion of sugar.
Luciano brings out a tool that sets the amount of sugar of the types of fruit (measure of the winemaker for Oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately, the tables facilitate the account.
The preparation of ice cream requires no more than physical application, as before.
Not only helps the tool for the automatic development of the basic mass.
There is also a tool, which simultaneously beats the prepared ice mixture and cools at a temperature below zero.
Nevertheless, all automation remains out of place with regard to the small paste.
The Brazilian Gustavo spots himself and his companions from the top to the bottom with pure fruit, as if it were a giant minimier without control.
"In all courses," says Master Luciano, "it's just a matter of time that something like this happens."
Inspectors in a complicated situation
The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has been infiltrated into the transgenic plant industry.
This issue is currently formulated by the group of experts in Testbiotech, which is considered an institute for the independent assessment of the impact of biotechnology.
"It looks like a conspiracy theory but we haven't documented it well," said Christoph Then, director of Testbiotech, Wednesday in Munich.
Harry Kuiper, the director of the Efsa Group of Experts on Genetically Modified Plants, and another Efsa expert have also been hired in the Ilsi Association for years.
Consortiums like Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer cost him.
Kuiper has collaborated significantly in the Efsa testing standards of genetically modified plants, which puts him in a clear conflict of interest, critic Then.
The provisions of Efsa are in paragraphs with the same terms as the documentation of the situation of Ilsi and imitate the writing of the company, which is in fact controlled by its Italian authorities in Parma.
It's the second time Testbiotech criticises a collision of interests.
Thus, shortly ago, a high-ranking manager of Efsa was without support or the time of transition to the Swiss Agriarkonzern Syngenta, and has changed his band with that.
Recently, Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk (MDR) also revealed personal connections between the EU inspection authorities and industry, which were carried out by the General Environment Office as well as a clear parliamentary opinion of the EU.
However, Efsa cannot recognize any conflict of interest.
All formal data, including some of the industry, are used, provided that they are of high and technical quality, are ordered in a report.
Experts working in Efsa are not required to have no contact with the industry.
But you have to expose these contacts.
Kuiper accepts his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the United States.
It is called itself a neutral forum for experts and science, industry and politics, including for risk assessment for biotechnology without Lobby's responsibility.
Independent experts, such as Then, criticise that transgenic plants are currently allowed without investigating food for animals and that the influence of genetically modified plants in the environment is not verified.
"We want to know what, for example, makes the corn genetically modified in agriculture," says Then.
The current practice is to verify only isolated proteins, but not the entire transgenic plant, which does not offer reliable results.
"If the risks are not sought, how will they be found?", question, accuser, Then.
Angelina Hilbeck feels the same way.
Since 1994, scientists have been investigating the field of genetic engineering and are currently working at the Zurich Institute of Technology.
In this area, industry is increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists in the US and Europe.
So there are few scientists who are not influenced by consortia.
For companies, critical studies are not published as a general rule.
"The industry controls security investigation," Hilbeck maintains.
The trace of the stones
Uli Gsell has achieved some, in total, about 400 kilos.
On Monday he was in front of Stuttgart station, with the tube on his back.
There were demonstrations
The wedding.
The story is known: In September the excavators arrived and began to drop a large portion of the north wing.
Stuttgart's land has never been the same again: thousands and thousands have manifested themselves against the s21, the suspension of millions at the station.
As it was predicted, most of the wing was torn apart.
Rota in 6,000, 7,000 pieces.
Craigsheimer Muschelkalk, a rough mixed stone, raised between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfieldern, 43 years old.
A couple of pieces have been secured.
"These stones are remnants."
"They mustn't disappear."
He was excited: "A cheap and poor, simple and natural stone."
As he once said, he smelled the smoke of cigarettes.
He still doesn't know what to do with the pieces.
The stones have time.
Or Gsell, too.
The trace of Stuttgart's stones leads to a forest in Tubingen in a former munitions warehouse of the French Army, where Manuel Rongen erected his stone Stein-Reich.
The 44-year-old man deals with ancient stones.
He's bought everything that's going on in Stuttgart.
"It would have been a disgrace, they would torture the grave or send it to the trash," he says in his office, a wooden case that once was a guard case.
They insulted and threatened him, explained, when, in September, he appeared in the newspapers, who had bought the rest of the north wing to the waste company.
He spoke to the enemies of the 21S for several days.
And he explained to them that he couldn't do anything about the fall.
And when it happened, then it was the most reasonable, when the stones continued to be used.
About 200 enemies of the S21 took the 80-pound knife, with a price per piece of EUR 6,50 to 14.
Some took it as a memory but also with the hope of being able to return it to a reconstruction.
Rongen had bought 500 tons, a load of 25 trucks.
Nearly half is still in the forest, the rest of it has been sold.
Owner of gardens, landscaper garden, project manager.
They came from all sides and carried what they could carry in the suitcase and above.
Stuttgart's impulse stone has long since become "the wall" or the boundary of Kräuterbeeten.
"In fact, this stone is nothing special," says Rongen.
"If it wasn't for the political component."
He rides on his entire earth, he makes a tour of his great 20-hectare kingdom.
He studied law, interrupted his studies, and later biology, he was interested in computers and finally worked with stones.
And he's a stone lover.
He's staying at 4,000 tons of stone.
He transports his treasures throughout Germany.
He says he's the country's biggest stone dealer.
Frena.
In the snow there are artificial sandstones carved.
"They belonged to the Bridge of Dresden Marienbrücke," he explains.
White, yellow, warm, if you're excited.
"My dear stone."
The road crosses the forest.
Sign up a lot: Red Arena, an earlier section of Karlsruhe Station.
And go on.
"Bonito travertino."
Formerly, the maizes belonged to the Neckarstadion Tribe of Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow, stones and stories, I travertine yellow from the Stuttgart police chief, the red granite of the church of Saint Blasien, the tomb of the hospital of Heilbronner.
What a job, what an effort, what a sweat.
When Rongen thinks about how he first carved the stones and moved them with a simple apparatus and a cart, he feels very devoted.
"It would be a scandal if something was destroyed."
No wealth has been made, absolutely immensely rich.
But today 14 people have given it to the stone handler, as well as singers, a sculptor, a carpenter, a glasssmith and a gardener have installed themselves in the forest.
"We work hard, but it is satisfactory," says the man who is responsible for taking advantage of the remains.
In a little while, you have to go to Colonia.
There are also stones to rescue.
Fighting talent around great potentials
Queen an active stream in the buffet.
16 students hide around the pancakes, tomato soup and sweets.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the Vokswagen car manufacturer have invited to a workshop for mechanical engineering and design students.
In a kind of competition of ideas, they have to talk about the car of the future with the VW workers and also learn everything about Volkswagen.
By rivaling and in the same way, many companies, like VW, meet in a body-to-body struggle around the most privileged minds in collaboration with universities.
Your mission: To hire students as soon as possible with the most talented of universities, before they enter the labour market and are hired by others.
And since universities do not facilitate publications on the skills of their students, they try to attract exceptional talents in practical projects and capture them.
The second day of project at the Technical University of Braunscheig, the consortium is won by talent.
A lady in the staff department deals with bolígraphs, gomitas and folders with the VW logo.
He explains to the illusions of young talent the programs of practice and work for students and shows them their paths in the consortium.
Nico Selle from the Technical University of Braunschweig takes the project with VW.
See advantages for both sides: "Students come into contact with industry and acquire experience."
"In turn, VW can get to know students, look closer to interested candidates and consider them as possible future workers."
Some collaborations, says Selle, are not uncommon.
The novelty is that students are desired so directly.
"The main point was previously found in technical projects," Selle says.
The fight for fresh graduates is becoming harder.
In many branches, companies can no longer choose their employees from a large group of applicants.
Unless they have to announce and, above all, to obtain a highly qualified working hand.
All students in engineering disciplines are in an excellent negotiating situation.
According to the German Association of Engineers (VDI for its German-language stamps), in October there were 40,000 vacant engineers.
And, according to VDI forecasts, this vacuum of engineers will grow even more.
In the audit and advisory company, KPMG, Roman Dykta is responsible for the hunting of talent.
Organize expensive recruitment events, such as the KPMG race, a type of modern yincana, in which participants have to find their way through GPS coordinates.
The company wants to send eight very promising students to the US next year.
In addition, participants can observe KPMG subsidiaries and learn about the company.
It is decided who should go in two rounds of election on the exit.
Only the cream cream of many participants goes to the United States.
Universities are increasingly trying to choose and clean up the high potentials of universities, according to Dykta.
"With the race we want to highlight the mass."
"The simple journey by itself would only be short."
For the catatalents dykta the notes give results.
"To this day we have a similar action in the last year with all participants."
"Some are close to their end, and they want to ask to work with us," he says.
In addition to the direct approach in the campus, they are also hunting, especially, small and medium-sized enterprises, classic with their work fairs.
"We're trying to get students at specialized fairs."
"Something about Intersolar," says Sita Stübe, staff manager for Solarworld solar technology manufacturer.
Bonner has approximately 1,500 employees in Germany.
Stübe knows the problem of the new generation.
Currently, 35 vacancies appear on the company's website.
"It's being very difficult to fill the vacancies."
"It takes a lot of time and money," he says.
A shorter path is contact with university teachers.
Solarworld collaborates with several higher schools, such as the University of Freiberg.
"Teachers advise that practices can be done with us or to carry out their thesis.
No advertising campaigns are carried out for solar specialists.
This is why the company needs to promote with other advantages: personal environment, wool hierarchy and comfortable communication.
"A large consortium can't normally offer it," says Stübe, staff manager.
In the search for a job, money is no longer the most important.
Decisive factors are flexible working hours, child assistance or good promotion opportunities.
According to a study by the Great Place to Work Institutes, Solarworld offers 55th place among the top 100 employees in Germany.
The Institute shall draw up an annual list of the best German employment providers.
As far as the employee is concerned, I am satisfied that he is with the work and the environment in it and that he observes the employee's previous conditions.
Stübe, the staff member also expects extra points in his or her classification for his or her aspirations to work.
"I think that the applicant is particularly fixed in the external classifications of an employer potential," he says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the Deutsche Employer Branding Academy advises companies that want a long-term strategy that earns a good reputation as employers.
Advise your customers more authenticity.
And that means, according to Kriegler, in particular, internal measures.
"The best way to be attractive as an employer goes by the employees themselves," he assures.
In the sector's jeerga is called Employer Branding Internal, also promoting corporate identity within the template itself.
"A satisfied employee is the best ambassadors."
When people are treated well and are identified with the company, then promotion is obtained directly for the employer by friends and acquaintances.
"It's like a gang game," says Kriegler.
Obama holds new oil drillings
From the coast of the U.S. state of Florida to the Gulf of Mexico, no new oil drilling has occurred in these years.
The Washington government issued a decisive ban and thereby annulled its previous plans irrevocably.
New perforations currently being seen remain before the Atlantic coast.
This announced the Minister of the Interior, Ken Salazar, Wednesday.
What caused this strict ban, which will be at least in force over the next five years, is the explosion of the oil platform "Deepwater Horizon" in April.
Before the disaster that cost life to eleven workers and caused the largest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama had admitted new perforations in the western part of the Gulf of Mexico under pressure from opposition and industry.
The parties thus wanted to reduce the dependence of the US on new foreign oil supplies.
To date, it has not been fully clarified who is responsible for the irreparable black tide in the Gulf.
In the centre of the criticism is the British energy consortium BP, which is faced with millions of demands.
Obama's research commission will present its results in December.
In October, Ken Salazar, the interior minister, raised the perforation moratorium after the explosion.
Later, various petroleum consortia submitted applications for new drilling attempts.
Obama and Salazar want to remove a new catastrophe by using tougher controls and stricter security regulations.
Currently, the responsible control authority, who has been charged with corruption, has fallen into discredit, is reforming itself.
Obama announces in a parallel manner that the profit tax gaps for oil and gas consortia will be closed.
The industry publicly announces that the total extraction in the Gulf will be less thanks to more stringent regulation, to date.
"The government's plans are the biggest brake on the growth of oil and gas industries," says the result of the current survey carried out by the BDO consultant - before the ban on the extraction of Wednesday.
American Energy Alliance complains about insecurity in the sector: "No one knows exactly what changes with regulation."
Investments in new extraction projects will be extended as soon as possible, to the detriment of growth.
Ogoniland is ruined
The water of the rivers is a oil marron, smells like a gas station: Millions of gallons of raw waste have destroyed nature in Nigerian Ogoniland.
People live from stealing, corruption and illegal oil trade.
Celestine Akpobari feels good.
"Don't get tired," the environmental activist reassures journalists: "Today enough oil will pass before your eyes."
The 37-year-old Nigerian has been able to photograph boys walking in the water to the chest with the brightness of the lights reflected in turbulences on the surface: With the colourful brightness of the water, the scene seems almost beautiful.
There is no evidence that brown oil stains float on the surface.
He used to take his legs in his fists here, explains Esther Badom on the shore of the Bodo-Jetti River.
In the meantime, the liquid waters are completely dead.
Five years ago, an impressive amount of oil was poured into the huge wet environment by a rotary tube.
The fish of the surrounding small town of Bodo had to swim six hours to reach fish-filled waters: that, in the heart of the Niger Delta and located in Ogoniland, is considered one of the most austere regions of the world.
On the way to the river that passes through manglars, the extensive desolation is obvious.
Instead of clear water, the ship's engine removes a brown heat, which sinks its hand into the water, will take out a few oil fills.
The roots of manglar trees rise from the ground as dark poles of regaliz, sadly isolate the palm trees that shock and crush their palm trees.
In vain they search for bird gangs, as if they were in the humidal as always: As the outer barrier is quiet, a kind of fantastic calm of a previous paradise with smell of petrol.
"What is happening here is an ecological struggle," he says, Hurricane Celestine Akpobari. "We live in constant danger to health."
Here's the ball comparison.
The area of the ogoni settlement is a crowded battlefield for years: Here the first European explorers broke down more than 60 years ago, here the first resistance was organized in the 1980s with writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, later executed, here had to place his first factory the Shell consortium in 1993, because it would be too dangerous for oil employees.
Today, the return of companies to Ogoniland is still prohibited: While they were pumping more than two million black barrels daily from the whole delta region, three times the size of Switzerland, with more than 5,000 sources of extraction and 7,000 kilometres of pipelines, the oil fields in Ogoniland were quiet, the location is too unstable for the consortium.
Every two hundred meters highlighted steel platforms such as water sculptures: "Navigating Arbolites" kindly called on the heads of the perforators.
They're up to 50 years old, most of them have a total corrosion.
Every moment a head is missing, Akpobari says, then he holds a constant oil cry in the water.
According to experts' estimates, over two billion liters have been shed in 50 years in the delta ecosystem: year after year, the amount of oil penetration, as in the stock of the ship "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago in the Alaska Sea, one of the greatest ecological catastrophes in the history of mankind.
Anyone responsible for the long-term environmental region will deal with this.
While Shell's consortium and organized oil thefts are responsible for more than 90 percent of the pollution, environmentalists come to the heads to break up and to tuberies with leaks as the main causes.
In Nigeria, Shell mainly applies low standards of safety normally the conventionals in the world, scientist Richard Steiner told the consortium in 2008: Only tube defects indices are "more than multiples elsewhere".
In a place, which from far away seems forgotten, there appears a oil-filled workshop under the free sky, figures arise from among the mangroves: They are naked and oil-covered.
Among the many barrels, which are sometimes connected to perforations, sometimes arbitrarily scattered on the ground, fires a fire: a small illegal refinery.
In the barrel, the oil is heated in the fire for hours, explains Michael, the leader of the group.
First, the petrol penetrates through the pipelines in the container, later the oil pipeline drops and finally leaves diesel.
In this way, Michael and four employees produce up to four diesel barrels of 300 liters daily: "We bring 34,000 naira", about $22.
The inhabitants of the delta take advantage of the shortage of fuel in one of the largest oil states in black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
With the absurd and cheap price of diesel of only 40 euros per litre, illegal heaters can offer even less: This reduces the value of their raw material.
It comes from "the bunkers", which called the network of pipelines across Ogoniland: According to experts, at least 16 million litres of oil per day are lost throughout the Niger delta.
Only a small part of the provisional raw material stored is clearly illegally recovered: organized criminal networks, which also belong to politicians and high military officials, keep the best part in Aljibes and sell it cheap in the world market.
The Akpobari activist considers the debate purely academically on whether the environmental disaster is due to the management of the population or to the flood of production.
"If oilers did not behave as invaders and would not have completely destroyed the natural habitat of fish, there would be no sabotage, no theft, no illegal refineries."
While the conditions of the goons are mainly destroyed by Shell to the point that only a deduction of the consortium appears: "Perhaps it is better to present another nationality, such as China."

Researchers detect hazardous factory defects in A380 engines
A380 seems to have a major security problem.
In an investigation of a machine that made a forced landing, researchers found a possible factory defect, which could produce "a catastrophic failure in the engine".
The Qantas airline wants to ask the engine manufacturer.
Airbus passengers from Qantas who made an emergency landing in early November were much more fortunate than they could imagine: Australian air safety authorities, thanks to their investigations, experienced a major safety problem in the engines of some A380, and alerted of a possible factory defect.
The potential of the defect has complicated implications: In a connection of manufactures, fatigue or screaming may be caused, the ATSB authorities announced in a report published on Thursday.
This could have caused "a catastrophic failure in the engine".
This affected the engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce belonging to 20 A380 aircraft.
Among them is the Qantas-Airbus that had to make a forced landing on 4 November in Singapore.
The Australian airline launches legal media against the British turbine manufacturer.
He filed a request at the Sydney Federal Court which allowed for more legal measures against the company.
Alan Joyce, director of Qantas, stated that his airline would claim compensation for the November incident.
The engine brand has lost pieces and its wing is deteriorating.
Rolls Royce distinguishes the type of gas as the cause of the damage.
After the incident, up to 40 engines all over the world have to be removed.
The Australian researchers announced that they would carry out more safety tests on the superjubs equipped with the affected engines.
The security recommendation is the result of a collaboration with Rolls Royce, said Martin Dolan, ATSB spokesman.
The security problem has become important enough to inform all concerned.
After the emergency landing of the Qantas apparatus, the airline kept its A380 fleet on the ground for many weeks.
Singapore Airlines maintained approximately three of its 11 A380 temporarily on land.
Lufthansa retired the engine of an A380 as a precautionary measure.
This double-covered plane is the largest passenger plane in the world.
A Nevada across the country causes traffic chaos
Totally white Germany: From one day to another has snowed in almost all of the country.
In many streets chaos reigns, trains and planes fail.
At least three people have lost their lives in traffic accidents.
Winter ice Germany: In almost the whole country temperatures were reached during the night of Thursday, which has triggered chaos in traffic at many points.
In some parts of the north and east, there is a snow layer of 15 cm thick.
Traffic is very limited in most highways and in many streets.
At the A7 at Flensburg, the kitanives are in continuous operation, removing the new snow once and again, but it is not ready.
In addition, strong winds cross the coast of the Baltic Sea.
The Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency of Germany (BSH) awaits live tides with water level 1.2 metres above its usual level on the coast of the Baltic Sea Schleswig-Holsteins.
In Sajonia, snow accumulation caused considerable problems on highways and national roads.
According to the Meteomedia Weather Service, the red alert is called in Sächsische Schweiz, in fact the highest alert.
There are partially 30 centimeters of snow just fallen and cold and strong winds are responsible for remelling it.
There were many trucks and cars caught there during the night.
In Sajonia Anhalt, the police also reported major street riots.
At A2, the snow and the wind paralyze traffic and create traps.
In Turkey, the brides were affected by A4 and A9.
According to Deutscher Bahn, major disorders are expected in Sajonia, Sajonia Anhalt, Turingia and northern Bavaria.
The snow on the road, the fallen trees on the carts or the destroyed chain and the holes are the main problems.
The interurban service from Leipzig to Nuremberg is suspended in Sajonia.
In Saafeld, Turkey an ICE train had to stop its journey to Munich.
The firefighters and the rescue service served 165 passengers on the train with wool, food and drink.
The snowy winds cross the streets.
In the largest German airport, snow winds caused numerous flights suspensions.
According to a spokesman from the flight information center, some cancellations have already been announced in Munich.
In Frankfurt am Main, according to a spokesman for Fraport there are already 40 cancelled flights.
The kitanives are in continuous operation.
However, there are few passengers at the airport, although there are 400 camp beds prepared for them.
In many streets, on Wednesday afternoon there were many accidents.
In the evening a trucker fell into a collision with a train on a road crossing in Ostholstein.
The machinemaker suffered slight injuries.
In the vicinity of Nuremberg there was a similar accident due to snowy streets: here too a truck was reached on a road crossing because the vehicle was stuck.
The driver lost his life.
On the train four passengers were injured, Bayreuth's trip to Nuremberg was blocked for this reason in the morning.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died, after returning with her car near Ashharenburg on a resbaladis road.
Meteorologists have good news: the snow will be more and more soft and dusty and will therefore be cooled in soft sands.
But the wind will decline.
Only the Baltic Sea will be affected by strong and fast winds.
No doubt it will continue to be very cold, in some places up to 15 negative degrees.
Bosche Bank is looking for a buyer for its twin towers
Deutsche Bank wants to separate from its symbol: According to an article, the financial institution is looking for a buyer for its office towers at its headquarters in Frankfurt.
The property could provide up to EUR 500 million.
Recently, Deutsche Bank arranged its headquarters: The twin towers were modernized in Frankfurt's bank neighborhood; while the bankers returned to their old place of work.
But now the financial consortium seems to want to take advantage of the costs of renunciation, and looks for a buyer for the two scrappers, as the Financial Times Deutschland states, based on a spokesman.
The spokesman does not appoint the reasons for the sale in the project.
"We always check whether the property should be owned or sold and then rented again," he said.
That is why the largest credit institution in Germany is renouncing its company's headquarters after a short period of time.
The bank acquired the twin towers in mid-2007 by EUR 272 million from the investor of a home fund and then made the relevant arrangements.
Energy reforms have reached some EUR 200 million.
A sale would make a lot of money for the bank.
Experts in this area calculate the value of the towers of the newspaper renamed "Greenowers" in about EUR 500 million.
If the newly refurbished buildings are sold to a bank or to an independent investor it has not been currently disclosed, the spokesman said.
Thousands of mourning people for the missing miners
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people thought of buried miners, who were killed after many explosions in a mine.
The bodies have not been found, however, because the security measures remain precarious in the place of misfortune.
Almost two weeks ago there was an intense explosion in the Pike River mine near the city of Greymouth.
29 miners between the ages of 17 and 62 were buried in the mine.
A probe was introduced in the place of misfortune, but it did not discover any sign of survival.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and subsequent explosions, no rescue equipment could be lowered for safety reasons.
After the second intense detonation, the authorities and experts claimed that there was no possibility that the miners would have survived.
The bodies could not be recovered to date.
Family and friends now remember the deceased with a memorial act.
Ten thousand people have changed with the bright sunlight in Greymouth in the New Zealand island of the South.
They keep quiet for two minutes.
In honor of the miners buried, 29 tables were placed with the helmets, lamps and names of miners.
There were also photographs and personal objects, underneath clothes and surfboards.
The flags ran off on average even in the country's government buildings.
New Zealand hoped that miners would return to the surface "of the depths of the earth," said John Key, the president of the New Zealand government, to the participants in the commemorative act.
"But they never came home."
He cannot take the death of his son until he has seen his body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the mine.
Along with the president of the government and victims' families, many foreign diplomats participated in the commemorative act.
In the first explosion on 19 November, British and South African miners were also buried.
The rescue workers began to extinguish a fire inside the coal mine on the island of New Zealand South.
As soon as explosive gases have been extracted, the abrasive temperatures within the mine will begin to descend, Gary Knowles, the chief of the police, told reporters.
Damn it, warrior!
Does the gore fit in the art movie?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn again explores the boundaries of the gender with his "Wallalla Rising" battle epic.
What public would the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn have thought of when he was rounding Wallalla Rising?
A Viking warrior arrested with one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) is released from his torturers and kills his enemies with almost overhuman struggles, it sounds ideal for young spectators who seek bloodthirsty action, precisely because our hero likes to use brutal methods to kill and start his enemies with the triples of his body with life when he's in humour.
On the other hand, Unojo, as it is really called, does not say almost any word during the entire film and the other characters are left to be carried by as much one or two sentences or a couple of painful mortal screams.
On the contrary, they remain silent and enjoy the beautiful and terrorist landscapes of Scotland, which the builders offer to the Viking world about a thousand years ago.
More ideal for grown and interested filmmakers in existentialism and very calm camera movements.
When a movie has several groups of recipients, it is a pity that they cannot discard each other.
The Director Winding Refn considers his wildlings and trilogy about the "Pusher" drug-trafficking pain as a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, but it is staticly refuses to make his works for all the public with something more humor in the main stream or something less brutality of the artistic house.
A brain mass and threepence that explode cannot deter most of the followers of the art film.
Most of the fans of the action die of boredom, if Unojo takes a boat to Jerusalem with an army of violent Christian missionaries for interpretable reasons and is trapped an eternity in calm and cloud before his team reaches America and shuts up again.
It is a shame that Wallalla Rising has not found a cinematographic distributor in Germany and only published on DVD.
It is a calamity against the magnificent images, but also because, after the supposed and bloodthirsty façade, a piece of film is hidden sometimes exciting, which deserves some attention.
This film is not about dialogues or a logical action, everything is an atmosphere, a febrile dream transformed into a film.
And that's why there's no escape for the spectators.
Refn is only a moment of relaxation and its glacier images and the narrow sound band of trance make him a nude in his throat, especially the incredible hatred, which from the hearts of the characters goes towards him.
Only a small young ruby, who loyally supports Unojo, preserves something as innocent, all others are possessed by rage.
Above all, the hero of one eye, whose motives are never explained, turns at any time into a warrior out of hell for enemies and provisional allies, possibly in the ambassador of the same devil.
It represents the loss, but perhaps only for those who are lost in all ways.
Wallalla Rising is a mysterious film that can be hated and admired, to get angry, change and surprise.
An experience.
Mysterious Earth Movements
The IAEA nuclear energy organization has new indications of a secret nuclear programme in Syria.
The country refuses to comment on this issue until controls are allowed.
On the average night of 5-6 September 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 I combat aircraft attacked a mysterious cubic building in Syria.
It is located on the shore of the Euphrates; the nearest and largest city, 30 kilometres away is Dair as-Saur.
Its name appears in documents of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), it is about a reactor that the Syrians apparently built with the help of North Korea in the cube, hidden in a valley that emerges from the river.
According to information from the U.S. CIA International Intelligence Service of late April 2008, a current reactor is designed under the name of the nearby El Kibar very suitable for plutonium production, with which nuclear weapons are built.
In contrast, the technique serves only for purposes other than those of the 1950s.
The CIA showed a video presentation with blur satellite images.
They showed with a computer animation where the reactor components were before the destruction, which was a small copy of the Norwegian model of the Yongbyon nuclear power plant.
They also taught photographs showing the building from the vicinity or from the interior.
It was not long ago that the reactor was in operation, he says, but it was not yet equipped with fuel bars.
Today, three years later of the bombing, it is only known more than then, the enigmas grew over time.
The former U.S. President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memories that prior to the CIA attack, he was absolutely sure that the Syrians had built a reactor in the Kibar, but that he saw only indications that there would be "a nuclear weapon program" in the country.
In Europe, several secret service officers prefer to be even more cautious and only speak of a "responsible" though they consider the CIA's presentation to be "pleusable".
They lack solid evidence, as well as the IAEA.
When he was asked how certain he was to have a reactor, a senior U.N. diplomat answered in summer in a stone-cold way that the IAEA has "sufficient material to have questions".
The Syrians quickly disassociated themselves from the ruins of the alleged "unused military building" and spread the land to consciousness.
However, in June 2008, an IAEA team under the command of former Inspector Olli Heinonen found uranium traces in the Kibar, which had been manufactured by people.
In addition, the IAEA received satellite images about a member state, commercial sellers at the time of the attack, which must have a higher information value than the CIA presented.
However, these photographs did not reach the market because an unknown customer, perhaps Israel, bought them exclusively.
Therefore, the IAEA cannot verify its authenticity independently.
Syria always understood that it had never had a secret nuclear program or built any reactor.
The uranium came from the Israeli weapons, Damascus explained.
The IAEA rejected it as invertosimeil after particulate analysis.
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss this, as well as satellite images.
In addition, controllers are prohibited from a second inspection in the Kibar and entry into the ruins of the bombed building.
Israel also maintains a strict silence.
"Never will we comment," Ehud Olmert, Prime Minister in charge at the time of the attack, recently confirmed the official position.
Thus, the investigation of the case has not produced results since June 2008 and "has gradually become a serious credibility problem for the authorities", as a Western high-ranking diplomat corresponds to a place in the IAEA in Vienna, a serious violation of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Atomic Weapons, which the IAEA observes.
The IAEA considers three more teams as the key to progress in clarification, which must be "in functional connection" with the alleged reactor, and others like these still exist.
Inspectors have not made public known to the moment when teams are being treated, what functions they have, or whether they seem suspicious.
According to the newspaper Süddeutschen Zeitung, the IAEA has designated Marj as Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah as the interior of the nearby cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) identified these places and located a complex of buildings near Masyaf with satellite images, which is very likely to be one of the suspicious objects.
Probably located on or immediately next to a military base, Syria therefore prohibits entry to the three locations of the IAEA.
In Vienna it is said that the Syrians fear a record that the US has requested IAEA to spy on military plants.
The nuclear detectives were alerted to the equipment thanks to the U.S. secret service warnings.
Through satellite photographs, the IAEA has indications that material is transferred between the three places and the cube to the shore of the Euphrates.
A Western diplomat with a high office in Vienna said that at least one of the teams can be "related to fuel production".
But there is no "indication of sensitive activities", either of uranium enrichment or of reconditioning; processes that are necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The type of reactor acts with uranium that is not enriched.
Where the uranium should come from and where the plutonium should be subsequently separated for the bombs, for these central questions there are, in the best case, plausible assumptions.
There is no doubt as to whether the ruins, the valuable tracks that can be recovered, are in the three places.
As hundreds of trucks disappeared, no one has information on where the garbage remains.
The OIAE considers it unlikely that the al-Tibni salt mine, located in the few kilometres from Kibar to the other part of the Euphrates, was recognized by the Syrians in 1998 by their capacity as a radioactive waste area.
Recently, Robert Kelly, the former IAEA inspector, related it to the reactor in an analysis of satellite images for the prestigious Jane's Intelligence Review magazine.
But the photographs from the orbit show that the Syrians made land movements in the three suspected sites and removed large containers after the IAEA requested entry.
It may be a coincidence but it only helps to dissipate suspicion.
In addition, in the diplomatic sector, it is said that the IAEA has used a few months to develop an inspection plan there, which the Syrians will allow, in order to maintain the possible military secret, only the deployment shows the magnitude of the interest of the inspectors.
However, Damascus also criticises this proposal.
Western diplomats in Vienna calmed down a year ago that the reactor was already destroyed, so the matter is not very urgent, for a few months ago, Glyn Davies, a type of U.S. ambassador, scurried the so-called exceptional inspections, one of the most rigorous means that the Vienna nuclear authorities have to establish controls.
Yukiya Amano, the director of the IAEA, who should propose these inspections, has spoken of "an option I am open to in the future," but still hesitates.
This route is very risky: most of the IAEA governance board is needed, and some of the 35 countries represented there are not exactly anxious for a climb.
On the other hand, as a diplomat reflected: "And what if they finally find nothing?"
Love in the Times of War
There have been problems since Angelina Jolie started in summer with the direction of her debut yet unnamed.
She himself wrote the script, a story of love between a Bosnian and a Serb.
You don't know much more about it, but this is enough for the excitement.
The rumor is very persistent, the Muslim woman is in love with her Serbian rapist during the war in Yugoslavia.
Bosniak women's associations have protested quickly, with which they last moved some planned days of rounding in Sarajevo to Hungary.
The film has been filmed in Hungary and post-production, but there are still protests in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the women's war victims organization wrote to the United Nations High Commissioner, UNHCR, for Jolie and requested a meeting with the actress, reported to a Bosnian newspaper, Jolie is the ambassador of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
It's not diplomatic, the women offered him a meeting in Hungary last week that he refused.
The meeting took place in Bosnia, says Hasecic.
No history of love is given in the fields of rape, and Jolie's position in this respect is handed down to the victims enough on the script.
Its organization, in accordance with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, has recommended that Jolie be dismissed as an ambassador, reports the Guardian.
But what exactly did Jolie write for the scenes?
The Bosnian culture ministry that read the script, gave it after a shoot and blew a recording permit in Sarajevo, is not quite clear why Jolie was not at all.
The young author reiterates that he does not pursue political purposes with his film, that he is putting much effort into the Yugoslav conflict, that he wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and to give a voice to all the parties involved.
Its contents are still unclear.
On the network, a second symposia of the film that sounds quite different: Lovers were together before the beginning of the war and met again when she, a Muslim Bosnian, was deported to a Serbian field in which he works as a guard.
What seems to be quite different is the variant "Vitim of rape is in love with torture".
Jolie's film is sure to start really before the war.
The pressure on her, Jolie says, is "injustice and based on wrong information".
Currently they can achieve peace with Hollywood hackers: While the script continues on the network illegally, like many others before.
Nothing as far away from here
This afternoon is finally going to be good for the Irish.
No ill-fighting trail
On the other hand, the home team dominates its customers from Sweden, Finland and the United States.
Fans shout for joy as the music breaks down, they hit the ground with their feet.
The Bailey Club vibrates in the Southern Cork, because players launch, and find, pingpong balls to beer vessels from a distance of three meters
The strange show is called "Beerpong", and the prize for the winner is 500 euros more tickets to Las Vegas for the world championship of beerpong in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet guy, this extravagant drinking game and computer discreet actually don't make good money.
And the 26-year-old boy is trying to have fun with that, to get distracted from the question that's going to happen to him in the future.
The fun in Las Vegas is not in your plans, in January you will conduct a personal interview in New Zealand.
"I have a bad presence," he says.
"It's too far from home and I still don't have a job there."
At least: Her girlfriend is waiting for her in Auckland, "from a shot she got the job of her dreams as event manager, maybe it's a good sign," says the young man and smile.
Because of the bad prospects at home, two of Tanners' three brothers have already sought luck abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sidney, his brother Colin currently works as a IT consultant in London.
Young people go: In the island there are many families like the Tanners.
100,000 Irish will leave the country in the near future, predict economic experts and the social research institute ESRI in Dublin.
By 2015, there are 200,000 migrants.
A great loss for this small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants.
The forecasts confirm, a migration wave similar to that suffered by the island in the 1980s.
After a decade of progress that brought great prosperity to Irish people, melancholy is now being extended.
The economic crisis is mainly confusing to young, well-trained Irish people, for whom so far, everything is at stake.
The loss of employment and social decline seemed absurd in the years of the boom.
Everyone needs money in abundance.
But three out of every ten men and women under the age of 30 are on the stand.
In the Irish Times, there are letters to the director in the mass of young migrants, who complains that "in Ireland everything is sinking."
"There should be an upsurge against politicians and bankers, but whoever can, goes and loses our country and so on to an entire generation."
"The last one to close the door."
Leanne Caulfield, a law student and president of the association of Irish students, sees a dark future because the government only devotes itself to assembly and no longer offers prospects for the future to young people.
"They reduce minimum wages, but they have no strategies to achieve new jobs," says the 20-year-old girl.
Note how their companions come from unremembered practices to the following.
His greatest concern, he explains, is to have to migrate in four years.
"This idea is sad and depressing."
People like Stephen McLarnnon are trying to see this topic positively.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo", a fair that offers a service around the topic of working abroad.
"For those who start to work, doing so abroad is an excellent opportunity, the first steps to direct your career," says the manager.
On your website are photos of a boy practicing surf in Australia and of another practicing snowboard in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not like doing it in the galleries, unless it brings freedom and fun.
From the middle of the year, Seán O'Donovan knows how to build something elsewhere.
Since there was no longer anything to do for the 29-year-old engineer, he is currently working with 15 Irish companions in the construction in Germany.
Now they're raising a fashion store in Gelsenkirchen.
In January he goes to Hanover or Berlin, to the next project.
O'Donovan sees his homeland only a few times because he works extra hours to be able to pay a credit for his home in Ireland.
"The situation is a little crazy," he says, for a long time since the first time he walked the shadow of his house.
"A lot of money in Germany for a house in Ireland, where I'm never so good."
He laughs a little embarrassed and goes for iced rooms.
The small house is in an elegant residential area with garden care in front of the houses, large and expensive cars are parked in the entrance.
O'Donovan bought the house together with his sister four years ago for 380,000 euros, 100 per cent financed by a credit.
"It was crazy times, there was easy money without many questions," he says.
Are you afraid to fail with the credit?
O'Donovan thinks for a while, serves hotter tea and says, "I don't have kids to feed and I'm young; if everything goes wrong, I can start from scratch."
Civil engineer doesn't like the complaints he often listens to today.
"No one should go hungry, our situation is not, with much difference, as dramatic as in times past here on the island," he says.
"Working a season abroad is not the worst that can happen, perhaps with it we feel like Irish for the first time."
He laughs and realizes about his father, who in the last great economic crisis went to England.
"After seven years he returned and life continued in Ireland, very simple."
Cian Tanner likes these ideas.
Leave the future and just see what life is like elsewhere.
He's been working in London for a couple of years, and why wouldn't he and his girlfriend be doing well in New Zealand?
But in these days there is something that worries you: the celebration of your 27 birthday in Dublin.
I'm afraid I can degenerate at a farewell party.
"Only, not too much emotion," he says, and gives a big stroke to his beer.
"Excuse me, it sounds very distressing."
"We better call it a party to go, very relaxed, with a couple of friends, a couple of drinks, a couple of games."
The Democratic routine
It continues to increase support for democracy in Latin America, as well as support for private companies.
Crime causes more concern than unemployment.
In addition, in most of the region, Brazil is seen as a more influential country than the United States.
These are some of the conclusions of the latest Latinobarometer survey conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
Since the survey has been conducted regularly since 1995, it is possible to monitor changes in attitudes in the region.
The results of this year's survey, carried out in September and early October, highlight two related issues.
The first is the relatively animated humour reigning in Latin America.
The second is the growing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its main institutions.
Support for democracy has increased considerably in several countries on the coast of South America (see table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has reached an average of 6 per cent annually since 2002, support for democracy has increased from 40 per cent in 2005 to 61 per cent this year.
He also grew up in Mexico, where the economy has recovered after a great decline in production last year.
However, only half of the polls in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous countries in the area, are convinced Democrats, which lowers the regional average (see chart 2).
About 44 per cent of respondents in the region were satisfied with the way democracy works in practice in their country, the same figure as last year, but significantly higher than 25 per cent recorded in 2001 (Graph 3).
About 34 per cent said they trusted the Congress of their country and 45 per cent in their Government, the same amount as last year in both cases, but considerably higher in 2003 (17 per cent and 24 per cent, respectively).
A decade ago, economic turmoil in Latin America seriously affected support for democracy.
The fact that it has been maintained during the global financial crisis is likely due to the fact that many Latin American countries were affected only by a brief recession and enjoyed a strong recovery.
Moreover, the existence of a stronger social security network has helped to protect the poorest.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty is only marginally increased in 2009 and has been reduced again this year, up to 32 per cent.)
However, the mood varies considerably from country to country (see chart 4).
The good economic performance of Brazil and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, is reflected in a general sense of progress.
This feeling is less common in Mexico and Central America, where recession was more severe and has increased violent crimes.
For the second time since the beginning of the surveys, the most surveyed in Latin America mention crime, instead of unemployment, as the most serious problem facing their country (see chart 5).
About 31 per cent claim that, whether they or a close relative, they have been the victim of crime in the last year, a figure that has been reduced since 38 per cent last year and is the lowest recorded percentage since 1995.
The most positive economic performance is reflected in increased support for private enterprises and the market economy: around 71 per cent of respondents in the region claim that private enterprises are essential for development, while in 2007 only 56 per cent (see Figure 6).
Approximately 58 per cent of the market economy is the only system that will allow its country to develop, compared to 47 per cent last year.
It is interesting that 62% of respondents in Venezuela feel the same (and 80% support for private companies), although their left-wing president, Hugo Chávez, is expropriating many private companies.
Brazil is the country that has a higher leadership in the region, as indicated by 19% of respondents (18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, the same figure as last year) and Venezuela (9% compared to 11% a year ago).
However, the United States is the country considered most influential by the surveyed in Mexico and much of Central America, while Venezuela bears such a title in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
Rubbish Bin Selection
No one expected the general elections held on 28 November in Haiti to be perfect.
However, they went far worse than the foreigners who tried to help the country to cope with their problems.
Votes were entered in the polls, some people voted several times, papers shot in the polls, destroyed electoral colleges and intimidation.
The electoral colleges opened up with hours of delay.
Many Haitians, including groups displaced by the January earthquake, wandered around the area trying to find out where they had to vote.
Some of them, in the end, were defeated.
A dozen presidential candidates, including several of the most popular, reported fraud and requested the cancellation of the elections.
The protests, some of them violent, spread throughout the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, the senior United Nations official in Haiti, said that they were "a relatively good election in many ways."
The observers for the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community said with caution that "we do not believe that these irregularities, which are serious, necessarily invalidate the process".
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, which, according to its opponents, is committed to René Préval, the unpopular outgoing president, and with its candidate Jude Célestin, should announce the preliminary results on 7 December.
The discharge is expected to take place in January.
Not all hopes for elections have yet been lost.
The two main candidates for the opposition, Michel Martelly, a rapper, and Mirlande Manigat, a former first lady, have withdrawn their initial request for invalidity.
But problems can still arise if the electoral authority declares that Mr. Célestin, who only has support, if he has any, has gone to the second round.
In view of the fact that the cholera epidemic is dragging the country and more than one million earthquake survivors are still living in shops, a great abstention is expected.
At the moment, many Haitians wanted to vote, but they failed to do so because of a lack of organization.
About 250,000 identity papers, necessary for voting, had not yet been distributed shortly before the elections.
There's a lot at stake.
Aid donors believe that the choice of a popular and legitimate government is an essential step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And according to the patent, it is also thought by the Haitians themselves.
Moving points towards the center
In the weeks that have passed since she lost her husband, Cristina Fernández, the president of Argentina, has enjoyed a great deal of sympathy among the public that has increased its popularity rate by 20 points, up to 50%, the highest level that has been recorded since her election in 2007.
Nevertheless, which can turn it into a successful campaign for a second term in the coming year's elections will depend on whether the clearly affected Mrs Fernández leaves aside the intransigence of her husband's death, her predecessor and political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
And at this point, the indications are not conclusive.
Mr Kirchner, who was still in charge of economic policy even after his wife succeeded him as president, had the habit of drawing up budgets that were infra-red on tax income, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the presidential marriage to spend additional income on its discretion.
In theory, Mrs Fernández's government lost most of her in Congress last year.
However, the opposition is divided, a situation that has worsened since Kirchner's death due to a heart attack on 27 October.
Some disconcerting members of the Pernist movement have faced Mrs Fernández in power.
However, after a chaotic session in which a Member gave a punch to each other in the face and other Members accused the bribery government, Congress decided to reject the 2011 budget.
"I'm not going to argue," said the president.
The 2010 budget will therefore be applied next year, which will offer the President an even greater margin of action when spending it.
The economy is improving considerably: it is likely to grow to 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is currently at 11.1 per cent, but numerous private calculations, in addition to the wage requirements of trade unions, are about 30 per cent.
Mr. Kirchner, who assumed power in 2003 when Argentina was on the brink of economic collapse, made poverty growth and poverty reduction its priorities rather than inflation control.
He refused to negotiate with the IMF, pressured the private sector and made the statistical institute INDIC adapt to official inflation statistics.
Will President Fernández now fashion these policies?
He has convened meetings between the private sector and trade union leaders.
In addition, its staff say they want to limit wage increases to 18 per cent in the year.
The economy has been driven by the high prices of Argentine agricultural exports in the world.
However, inflation has limited the momentum to growth achieved with a high deevaluation in 2002.
Perhaps it is because Mrs Fernández is giving signs of wanting to restore Argentina's financial ties to the rest of the world.
At the beginning of the year, the government reached an agreement with the bond holders that had been denied a forced restructuring of the debt that Argentina had not paid in 2001.
At present, it seems that Ms. Fernández is about to conclude an agreement with the accredited governments grouped in the Paris Club, which is due about $6,700 million.
The Kirchners always insisted that this would not involve IMF supervision, as is usually customary.
Last month, however, Amado Boudou, the Minister of Economic Affairs, announced that the Fund would offer "technical assistance" to develop a new price index for national consumption, which seems to be the prelude to the cleaning of the INDIC.
It is not clear whether President Fernández wants to continue politics when he completes his term of office, taking into account that he no longer has his husband on his side.
If he does, he will need to earn the support of the middle class, much of which has become tired of the church.
When the Argentines return from their summer vacations in March, the wave of sympathy for her will have fallen.
If you want to win other elections, you will have to decide whether or not, in a calm manner, many of your husband's policies.
Average oaths per China
Taiwan's voters are slowly approaching a kind of closer union with the continent.
How does Taiwan feel about his big brother on the other side of the border?
More than 7.5 million voters, 70% of the electors, came on 27 November to elect mayors and councillors from five urban districts in what seems to be a broad assessment of the president, Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr. Ma himself has become a defender of the feelings of the continent, forming innovative business links, including a free trade pact, the biggest change in relations with China since 1949.
Mr. Ma passed the test, but little by little.
Although his Kuomintang party (KMT) finished winning three out of five elections to mayor, he failed to obtain most of the votes.
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (PDD), which has been inclined by Taiwan's total independence, has virtually received 50% of all votes against 45% of the KMT.
If they were the presidents, Mr. Ma would be in trouble.
Since its election two years ago, the proportion of votes of its party has decreased by about 8 per cent.
For the first time, the PPD was involved with the KMT in the municipalities.
In the elections, the typical elements of Taiwanese elections were seen, including loud bells and large rounds with banderites and light girls dancing clothes.
Nor did he fail the mysterious attempt to kill the rigor.
Sean Lien, Lien Chan's son, the honorary president of KMT, was campaigning for one of KMT's candidates the night before the election.
A man of the crowd shot the young man directly to the face, striking him and killing a transeon.
The curious thing is that it has not been possible to determine whether the man intended to harm Lien or avenge himself of the candidate.
In any case, Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the PPD, the shooting affected the elections, sowing suspicions about the PPD and causing voters to bow to the KMT.
Perhaps the only great winner of the campaign was China.
It turned out surprising that the issue of the continent was not addressed in itself.
Instead, the candidates talked about public housing plans and job creation.
Taiwan normally enjoys its de facto independence and hates China's military threat.
As a result, KMT often avoids advertising its links to the government in Beijing.
But this time the PPD also avoided encouraging the feeling against China.
It responds to the new awareness that Chinese trade is essential for Taiwan's economic survival.
Mr Ma said he had confirmed that his policy on China was acceptable to most Taiwanese people.
It is expected that the Government of Beijing will continue to subjugate them with trade, in accordance with its strategy to ensure that Taiwan returns to the line.
China did not waste time sending a negotiator to Taipei to prepare a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
He would certainly also like to achieve political integration, but the first is the first.
The best thing is to expect the 2012 presidential elections to do so.
In any case, the PPD has been reinvented.
Two years ago he was in a bad situation: his former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was imprisoned for corruption.
The President, between 2000 and 2008, openly encouraged explicit independence.
Under the leadership of Mrs Tsai, however, a new generation of moderates has emerged and the PPD is striving to attract professionals and young people.
Ms. Tsai has been welcomed as a candidate for the PPD for the presidency, as did Her Tseng-chang, who has fulfilled her mandate under Chen.
Now your party is doing everything possible to prove that it can also have relations with Beijing.
Ms. Tsai announced the plans for the creation of a group of experts acting as a point of contact between the PPD and China, provided that negotiations can be carried out without prior conditions.
Ms. Tsai tells the Taiwanese public that her party represents a "reliable alternative" to Mr. Ma's early approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems angry about the change.
In a statement issued from his cell, he stated that PPD candidates would have been better off if they had insisted that Taiwan is an independent country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatic, not to present the presidents.
Even without Mr Chen's request, the PPD will have difficulty choosing between its potential candidates.
KMT should also conduct a conscientious examination.
Mr. Ma's assessments have been poor, despite the impressive economic growth; KMT's candidates have not wanted to campaign with him.
Their lack of popularity seems mainly due to unemployment and the growing differences between rich and poor.
A KMT spokesman says he will restructure his office as well as local teams.
The large samples of the PPD suggest that Taiwan's support for an approach is limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese people believe that economic integration with China is inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a well-known columnist, "the point of no return has already been crossed."
Grammy nominations: jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is the surprising choice in the category of Artist revelation.
Act at the request of a president and possibly people will set themselves up on you.
Esperanza Spalding, the 26-year-old jazz player and singer personally selected by President Obama to act at his 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, submitted one of the Grammys surprises this year with a high-level nomination in the category of Best Artist Revelation.
Considering that Spalding has been a famous jazz figure since his 2008 album, "Experience", the nomination of what to think, but respects the Grammys rules that he must be an artist who has not placed more than three albums on the market before recording what "determines the public identity of that artist".
His ambitious 2010 album, "Chamber Music Society", was undoubtedly a great advance and, taking into account its light and pleasant vocal style, as well as a great skill with pop, funk and Latin rhythms, you can at least establish a distinction between Spalding and the way to Norah Jones' success in 2003, the closest equivalent for Grammys voters, who have recently concentrated in the field of jazz for this category.
In the remaining categories, Grammy voters honored Vijay Iyer Trio's "History", an exciting and magnificent record that was one of the favorites last year.
Among Iyer's competitors is the veteran saxophoneist James Moody with "Moody 4B" and the techologist John Beasley by "Positootly."
Trombone Shorty, a favorite stripper in New Orleans and a regular guest in "Treme", from the HBO, was honored in the contemporary jazz category, which in the rest tends considerably towards fusion as in Stanley Clarke's albums, John McLoughlin and Jeff Lorber.
The wild punk of Darcy James Argue's Secret Society received a worthy recognition in the category of large groups, competing against the great jazz camera of Billy Childs Ensemble and always risked Dave Holland, whose live album with his octopus, "Pathways", was a great example of the democratic leadership of the basilica in his band.
Grammy Awards nominations: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey in the best direction of classical albums
The nominations in the field of classical music for the 53rd edition of Grammy Awards include a mix of musicians and composers from around the world.
The main nominations were for Michael Daugherty by "Deus Ex Machine", by piano and orchestra, of five movements, and Steve Mackey with "Dreamhouse", a three-moved eclectic orchestra.
Among the nominees with links to southern California are the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt for his symphony No 4, "Los Angeles", a piece commissioned by the Philharmonic of Los Angeles and abroad at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The composer based in Los Angeles Avner Dorman is also nominated by his Mandolin Concerto.
Classic music nominations are distributed in thirteen categories covering orchestra, opera, coral and solo albums.
The category of classical producer of the year includes five nominees: Blancon Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin, and James Mallinson.
The nominees for the classical music album are Bruckner by the Symphonies 3 and 4 of the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty by "Deus Ex Machine" and "Metropolis Symphony" by the Symphony Orchestra of Nashville; Steven Mackey by "Dreamhouse" by the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati" by several artists; and the "Requiem" by Verdi by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
In the opera category, the nominees are Berg by "Luu" of the Royal Opera House orchestra; Adolf Hasse by "Marc Antonio and Cleopatra" of Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariaho by "L'Amour de Loin" of the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin by "The Enchanted Wanderer" of the orchestra and choir of the Mariinsky Theatre; and Arthur Sullivan by "Ivanhoe" of the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
The composers appointed to a Grammy by contemporary compositions include Pärt by Synphony No 4, Daugherty by "Deus Ex Machine", Hans Werner Henze by "Apphassionally Plus", Magnus Lindberg by "Graffiti" and Shchedrin by "The Enchanted Wanderer".
Pärt's 4th Symphony broke out at Disney Hall in January 2009 at a meeting recorded by the Los Angeles Philharmonic, headed by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The piece, about 30 minutes, is captured by "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the former magnate of the oil Mikhail Khodorkovsky, imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman's "Mandolin Concerto" is nominated for the solo instrumentist performance with orchestra.
The composer of Los Angeles wrote the 15-minute piece specifically to play it on Avi Avi Avi, who played the concert with the Metropolis Ensemble, based in New York.
"The composition with the sounds of the Middle East and numerous scales and rhythms of North Africa," Dorman said in a telephone interview.
The 85-year-old director Pierre Boulez was appointed to the orchestra function category, leading the Chicago Symphony Orchestra during a recording of works by Stravinsky.
Among the nominated instrumental soloists are pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; organizer Paul Jacobs; violinist Julia Fischer; and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
The nominated as vocal soloists are all women this year: Anne Sophie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the category of classic blend, soprano Jesse Norman was named for his recording of "Roots - My Life, My Song."
The proposed mesquity in Temecula is approved by the Management Committee
The draft mosque for Temecula has received unanimous support from the local management commission after more than five hours of public witnessing, often heated.
Critics attacked the project by saying that it fosters terrorism and traps.
However, the members of the committee decided on Wednesday night that the new religious centre respected local legislation and would be impressive from a aesthetic point of view.
"Many good people came to show their support, both Christians and Jews or Bahia, of all religions," said Hadi Nael, President of the Islamic centre of the Temecula Valley, on Thursday morning.
"The truth is, as an American citizen, I am proud."
"Protests that justice prevails."
"The opposition is really minimal," he adds.
"Only they speak very loud."
"There are wonderful people in this valley."
The meeting began at six o'clock in the afternoon and lasted almost until midnight; most of the time, it was dedicated to people who argued in favor or against the centre, almost the same amount on each side, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The discussion continued on the newspaper website.
"United States no longer exists", is read in one of the comments.
"This is another Planet of Seeds with Mrs. Libertad dead in the arena."
"America has fallen."
The plans for the construction of Islamic centres have also led to protests in other parts of the country, including near the zero zone, the New York area where the attacks of 11 September 2011 occurred.
In the Temecula Valley, the imam Mahmoud Harmoush has denounced acts of violence.
His congregation of about 135 families has been living for years without problems in the Riverside County, but he wanted a bigger and better space than the warehouse he rented in a shared property with a water filtration system manufacturer.
The new 24,943 square foot mixture, with a Mediterranean architectural style, would include two minarets and would rise to 43 feet.
It would occupy an area of 4.32 acres in Nicolas Road, about two miles east of the Chaparral Institute.
Opponents can still use the project to the municipal Council.
An arsenic-resistant microbe raises the possibility of new forms of life on Earth... or elsewhere.
The discovery of a strange bacteria that can use arsenic as one of its nutrients broadens the possibility of finding new forms of life on Earth and, possibly, on other planets.
Although researchers discovered the curious bacteria here on Earth, they say it is possible that there are forms of life without the main elements that they considered essential.
"This body has a double capacity."
"It can grow either with phosphorus or with arsenic."
"That makes it very peculiar, although it lacks little to be a real 'foreign' kind of life," said Paul C. W. Davies of Arizona State University, co-author of the report that appears in the online edition of Thursday's publication Science.
For a long time it has been considered that there are six major essential elements for life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulphur.
However, researchers have discovered that bacteria found in Mono Lake, California, can continue to grow after replacing phosphorus by arsenic.
"It makes you wonder what's more possible," said Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University, co-author of the report.
According to Anbar, finding is important for the search for life on different planets on Earth, as researchers need to be able to recognize life, to know what it has.
The study focuses on a microbe discovered on Earth.
However, the call for a press wheel to discuss it, in which details of the discovery were not disclosed, generated a large Internet speculation on the possibility that the report would indicate the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
He didn't.
What the discovery "is shown is that in other planetary environments, there might be organisms that use other elements to stimulate their biochemistry and that the set of "standard" elements that we consider essential for life may not be so fixed," commented Charles Cockell, the Cathedral of Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, Open University, in Milton Keynes, United Kingdom.
Cockell wasn't part of the research team.
"This work is innovative because it demonstrates the replacement of one element by another in the basic biochemical and biochemical structure," Cockell added.
The discovery was not carried out by chance.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of the NASA Astrology Institute, which conducted the study, focused on the Mono Lake because it has high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are similar from a chemical point of view, so he speculated that a microbe exposed to both could replace one another.
"Arsenic is toxic mainly because its chemical behavior is similar to phosphorus."
"As a result, it may be difficult for agencies to differentiate them."
"However, the arsenic is quite different than that it does not work as well as the phosphorus, so it comes in and, by some means, calls the biochemical machinery," Anbar explains.
The researchers collected the bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and exposed them to increasing arsenic concentrations, to which they managed to adapt and use to grow.
Microbio grows better with phosphorus, but the fact that it can live with arsenic instead raises the possibility that it can naturally exist a form of life that uses arsenic, either in other areas of the Earth or in another planet or moon where arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, an assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, pointed out that the idea of replacing arsenic with phosphorus is not new, but an example has never been found to prove that it works.
The arsenic was more common in the first eras of the Earth, he noted, so researchers speculated that the first forms of life could have used it.
"Yes, it suggests that there might be other means of generating life, not only the way life was formed on Earth in ancient times," said Foster, who was not part of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Institutes of Health.
The missing stolen dogs have been found in Compton
The two dogs that were missing from the four thieves in front of the Belllower motel have been found, according to the officers of the sheriff of Los Angeles County on Thursday.
The four competition dogs, two Akitas and two Welsh Corgi Pembroke, disappeared on Tuesday when someone stole the 2006 Chevrolet Express truck in which they were spending the night, in front of Bellflower Motel 6, according to the authorities.
Two of the canoes were recovered in the afternoon and the two others were found in the afternoon, late in the evening, as Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, reported.
"The good news is that dogs are well," Whitmore said.
"They're in good condition."
"They have returned with their legitimate owners."
Whitmore did not want to indicate exactly where the dogs were found, in which neighborhood, or the circumstances of the discovery.
"He's doing an investigation."
"We don't want to say anything," said Whitmore.
"We're following a few tracks."
The owners of the dogs, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, could not be found to comment on Thursday.
They met with their two Akitas in a county animal shelter in Downey on Wednesday afternoon.
The sheriff's assistants found the van and the two dogs separately in Compton.
According to the authorities, Akitas (Trace, a 3-year-old dog, and Didi, a 10-month-old dog) had no damage.
But Bunny and Peter, the Corgis that Rickard and Peek wanted to show in the area's competitions this week on behalf of the Japanese dog owners, continued to disappear until Wednesday night.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were in the city for the AKC/Eukauba national championship in Long Beach this weekend and were planning to show Trace.
The other dogs were going to show them in other scheduled competitions for the days prior to the AKC/Eukanuba Championship, as Peek told The Times on Wednesday.
South California is one of the stops in the two-month tour that the couple perform by participating in canine competitions.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked in the motel.
They usually stay in motels and park the van right in front of the window of their room.
They took three other dogs (a boxer cry, a Parson Russell terrier and a Brittany, who slept with them in the motel room.
But they left the Akitas and Corgis in the van because they have a very thick coat and they would be fresher.
They left the windows slightly open so that dogs could breathe fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported the van theft on Tuesday at six in the morning.
Peek had said that they would offer a reward to anyone who could lead them to the Corgis, equipped with microchips to identify them.
Thursday was not clear whether a reward would be given.
The lion is ready to roar again, while the restructuring of MGM achieves the final approval of the court
After 18 months of confusion and uncertainty, MGM finally got green light to start again.
On Thursday, a New York federal banker judge officially approved the "pre-armed" plan by creditors to delete about $5 billion, along the way so that the 86-year entertainment company will focus its efforts on the production and foreign production of films and television programs.
The failure of Thursday confirms that the plan meets the requirements of the US banking code, so there are no other legal obstacles to MGM being re-launched under the founders of Spyglass Entertainment, Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, which will become the main executives of what will be a reduced study.
Staff will be reduced from 400 to approximately 320 members.
In fact, MGM will not leave Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase closes a planned credit instrument of $500 million to finance operations and productions of the new MGM.
The investment bank is currently syndicating the loan, which on its behalf is contributing $75 million, and it is expected to be financed by mid-December.
The restructuring process of the study began in May 2009, when the Investment Bank Moelis and Co. was hired to advise on the management required to manage its finances, while struggling to make interest payments for $300 million a year.
In August, Director Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former President of Enron and expert in the recovery of companies in failure, known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper's attempts to solve the financial tribulations of MGM and satisfy the more than 140 creditors of the study required much more time than expected.
After several months of discussion, at the end of 2009, the parties agreed to place the company for sale.
However, the auction attracted few posters and no willingness to pay the more than $2 billion that creditors were looking for.
Before spring this year, he returned to the design table while the MGM team began working on a restructuring plan that, after months of discussion and internal disagreements, was finally supported by creditors at the end of October.
When MGM officially leaves the banknote in the next few weeks, Moelis and Cooper companies will receive multimillionaire bonuses for their work.
Moelis and Co., who has already received $1.2 million, will get $9.5 million.
Cooper's companies, which have been collecting $375.000 a month for their company's management services, will receive a 4 million “successful fees”.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production at MGM, which only took one film this year, and gathered an annual pizza of seven or eight films that will expire in 2012.
They also plan to co-finance two films based on "El Hobbit", along with Warner Bros.
The study needs to conclude a separate loan of $265 to $275 million to finance its part of the two films, which will be directed by Peter Jackson.
The investor Carl Icahn, who has approximately 18% of MGM's debt, had been trying to arrange a merger of the study with Lions Gate Entertainment, in which he is the largest shareholder.
However, the recent discussions between the two companies did not result in an agreement.
Tech Toys wants to keep his budget balance for gifts
While iPad is the main candidate to be the most wonderful toy this year, followed by, perhaps, the Microsoft Kinect video games system, both can mean a significant apple in your gift budget.
Consider that at the price of an iPad you can buy five 99-dollar BMX bikes each, and a Kinect game costs the same as 10 classic jump strings decorated with accounts, or approximately 48 pages of Play-Doh.
But there are ways to keep your budget in balance.
Recently I visited three national players, Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and BJ's Wolesale Club, to see that electronic toys could buy at least $80.
It was immediately clear that Moore's Law was working; this year's technological play will probably have more power, costing the same and even a little less compared to last year's.
In addition, while there are generally fewer new games with associated websites, two of the most famous of these, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more offers.
And the players powered by button stacks are increasing, as well as the players with rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys "R" Us, except that it is indicated otherwise).
The Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, 13 dollars, for 3 years and more) are football players of the size of a cobajo singing a note when their barrels are opened.
A sticker is equal to a note, and a second sticker begins to set up a song.
If you buy more than one, they will sing in harmony.
Warning: Once you start pressing, you cannot stop.
In addition to dancing, Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, $60, for 2 years and more) is the best option.
Taking advantage of the Elmo Live technology last year, the 14-inch animonic dome plays turnover games like Simóm Dice, and can take the monthly step, thanks to its innovative feet with wheels with locking device.
The kids who tried the toy used Mickey as a dance instructor, even though their parents complained about the lack of volume control.
If you are a child of the 1980s, you can remember Alphie, one of the first computerized educational toys.
He has returned (Hasbro/Playskool, $40, for 3 years and more), with a bag full of questions designed to convert a car ride into a meeting with a box of self-correction exercises.
If you are afraid to give your child your smart phone, here you will find three independent alternatives.
MobiGo from VTech (60 dollars, 3 to 8 years) is the cheapest and easiest to use, presenting a qwerty keyboard; although the games do not teach as effectively as Leapster Explorer (70 dollars, 3 to 12 years old), it is the first important point of the Leapster line, with a newer and brighter screen.
No version is compatible with old cartridges.
iXL by Fisher-Price (90 dollars, 3-7 years old) uses a iTunes-type system to present games and electronic books, and has a slot for SD cards that allows you to view family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash (30 dollars, Hasbro, for 8 years and more) is a five-block game larger than a lock box, each with its own LED screen.
The goal is to equip words by placing the blocks in line before the time is over; it is formidable for an improvised competition of armed words.
There are more and more players who have some kind of online connection.
Based only on their presence in toys, the two largest are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
To buy your child an online pet at the Penguin Club, for example, you can get a Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, ($5, 6 to 12) that includes a coin with a hidden code.
When you change the online code, your child gets enough credits at Club Penguin store for two items.
These could include belts on wheels or a puffle pet.
A little bigger than the breast of your toothbrush, Hexbug Nano ($10, for 5 years and more) is the last in a line of microbots powered by button stacks.
The false insect is moving rapidly over 12 pathes of silicone that vibrate, in random directions.
It's fun to do a labyrinth of blocks to see if you can find the exit.
It's also durable.

A more moderate side of order maintenance is being promoted in China
As a urban instructor sergeant, Tang Shenbin marked the step in a city square, severely inspecting the nervous people in charge, issuing low-voice orders with military authority.
He wanted the female members to reach out, the corrupt policemen of the city order of China, afraid and despised by their capricious energetic measures and their inclination to violence, to communicate a certain impression to a handful of spectators.
"Between!"
"Pay attention!"
Show them, he whispers, "How beautiful girls are!"
Four girls who just spent adolescence with white gloves and green olive jackets identical and adjusted pants to call attention.
Four pairs of perfectly aligned black shoes.
Four elegant hats perfectly placed above the hair tied with blue and white rays.
"Personally, I think they have a normal appearance," said Mr. Tang, regrettably.
"The models are beautiful."
More than one government has tried to clear the image of the city inspectors in China.
One city ordered all new recruits to have a degree.
The Guangdong Province changed the gray green color of the uniforms to a allegedly more attractive blue.
Wuhan, in central China, replaced the use of force for intimidation: in 2009, 50 officers, according to a report, circled around a snack cart, and observed it with the cement constantly for half an hour, until the traveling salesman picked up his stuff and left.
Xindu, a city district of 680,000 inhabitants in Chengdu, has chosen a radical image change.
Since 2003, the district has added 13 women to its urban police, specifically elected by its appearance, proportion and youth.
The idea is to give the cops a softer side, female.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson would have to fight to increase China's infinite respect for these city shields.
And for good reason, the critics would argue.
Unlike the police, these officers are only authorized to enforce city orders, imposing fines and other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese news media routinely portrays a different reality.
In January 2008, the Hubei Province inspectors killed a transeont after using their cell phone to film them while disbanding a protest against a waste dump.
Last year, a training manual for Beijing inspectors was stolen and published on the Internet, in which it described how to effectively assault criminals without bleeding them.
This year, a traveling salesman from Shanghai suffered brain damage after a kidney with five officers.
A video game full of violence, available to download online, presents inspectors trained by the Chinese who attack street vendors.
"Chengguuan has left a scar in the government," lamented China Daily, a national publication, last year after another discussion on tactics.
The newspaper demanded "a truly mitigous cleaning".
The skeptics say that the current approach is far from this.
After the district applied for a notice of eight new female recruits in October, an editorial in The Beijing Evening News was asked whether women had real duties or were simply a scenic distraction.
The answer seems to be a little bit of both.
The district's warning asked for female candidates from 18 to 22 years of age, with a good figure "and the five harmonious facial features".
They should have a height above the average, more than 1.6 meters or 5 feet, 2 1⁄2 inches.
Retirement at the age of 26 is compulsory.
Officials said that work was physically too hard for women over 25 years of age.
"Its image is the important thing," said an anonymous district official at Rednet.com, a quasi-government website.
"First, the external qualities of the candidates will determine whether they meet the requirements, such as height, weight, facial features, etc."
Then comes the temperament "and the inner qualities".
Women's coming are like flowers, he said, and added, "In addition to being flowers, they will have other responsibilities."
Zheng Lihua, deputy director of the city administration office of the district, is not anxious to support that description.
But he observed that the requirements of height were standard in many Chinese work notices for both sexes.
Then comes the demand for harmonious facial features.
If this means bet, it is a matter of debate among the Chinese.
Surely, the minor or defigured should not be presented.
"We can't let a coyote or a Yorko come to work here," said Mr. Zheng.
"His image wouldn't be good."
Liu Yi, who patrols the Baoguang Plaza near a monastery, is 22 years old, with her colorful cheeks and a subtlely curved mouth.
She doesn't think the accent in her aspect is sexy, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy with this uniform?" he asked with a sardonic look.
His 21-year-old workmate Xu Yang said, "Our work must present the image of the city".
They also did not oppose their work for a certain time, they said, because they cover more career ambitions than simply stalking sellers in the streets where they are supposed to circumscribe their business.
Every morning, the squadron faces more or less a dozen traveling salesmen who are thrown on foot or on a bicycle, trying to sell as many tofu pancakes or tazones as possible before being thrown out.
"Mr. Wang, you have to leave."
"We've told you many times!" said Miss Xu while a salesman escaped on foot, temporarily abandoning his car thrown by a bicycle with fiddles.
Officials describe their duties as more monotonous than exhausters.
"This is more or less the same every day," said 20-year-old Huang Jing, who studies marketing in his free time.
"Very routine."
One reason is that female officers lack the power of their male counterparts to confiscate the sellers' merchandise.
They can only threaten to report offenders to their male supervisors.
This tends to protect them from sudden public demonstrations of animity against bureaucracy, which are common in all parts of China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, Yunnan's provincial capital, were struck by the spread of the false rumor that some officers had come to kill a seller.
More than a dozen policemen or officers arrived were injured in the nighttime episode; 14 government vehicles were robbed or taken by fire.
For the time being Xindu has avoided such violence.
But calm is only guaranteed.
Only two streets of the peaceful Plaza Baoguang, where women's officers patrold that morning, more than 50 people met on a corner.
Officials had confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired in the steel instead of in a workshop, as the regulation requires.
The owner of the bike screamed violently.
The situation was halted for 15 minutes before the officers, with a bad face, opened their way to their vehicles and quickly went with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Juedong, 40-year-old, a coordinator assigned to the male squadron, remained behind, with his white badge returned to conceal his name.
Like female officers, coordinators, 40-year-olds or more, play a purely supportive role.
Unlike them, they are not taught to keep an elegant image.
"Sometimes we fight verbally."
"Sometimes we fight physically," said Mr. Li with total nature.
"Most of the time is the public who starts the fight."
Prosecutors will not raise charges against Senator Ensign
Senator's lawyers announced Wednesday that the prosecutors of the Department of Justice have excused Senator John Ensign from the criminal charges that arose from his affair with an former campaign assistant and his efforts to ensure work through lobby for the wife's husband.
The decision ends with the most serious legal threat faced by Ensign, the Republican of Nevada, who was considered as a possible presidential candidate for 2012, until the scandal on his business had national owners last year and damaged his career.
The Ensign office said it felt "surely happy" for the decision, which came after an investigation of a whole year.
The senator could still face a disciplinary measure of the Senate's ethics committee.
Ensign lawyers said that the Department of Justice had told us "that Senator Ensign is no longer an objective of his investigation and that he has no plan to raise charges against him on this issue."
The Department of Justice did not want to comment on the case.
The announcement was a surprise for many ethics lawyers outside the Department of Justice, who said there seemed to be significant evidence to indicate that Ensign might have been involved in violating a federal crime ban on lobbying.
The interviews, e-mails and other documents that were first published in October 2009 in the New York Times indicated that Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his assistants, to get a lucrative job through lobby, to achieve Hampton's silence and his wife, Cynthia, about the senator's business with her.
Mrs. Hampton once worked as the treasurer of a Ensign campaign.
Ensign contacted several political sponsors to find work for Mr. Hampton and advocated on behalf of them after they had hired Mr. Hampton to lobby for them, according to the documents and interviews.
As Hampton had recently been an assistant to Ensign, he was excluded under the law to make lobby for his former employer or the Senate for a year.
Ethics experts said that the unusual arrangement between Ensign and Hampton, who were close friends before the deal, appeared in disagreement with the so-called "revolving by lobbying ban", which seeks to restrict former state employees to use their connections to do personal business.
Of the evidence that has been made public, "it seemed to be a prima facie case of a conspiracy to substantially violate the revolving by status," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending government-researched clients.
While the officials of the Department of Justice refused to explain the reasoning behind the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers said that the department seemed cautious in accepting political proceedings after several important revisions for its section of public integrity, including the last year's decision to abandon proceedings against former Senator Ted Stevens, in the form of malpractice charges.
Federal prosecutors "are clearly cowards," said Melanie Sloan, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a group of defenses that brought several complaints against Ensign in the case.
"This basically means that high-ranking government officials can now assume that the laws do not apply to them," he added.
Paul Coggins, chief lawyer at Ensign, said in an interview that received a telephone call from a prosecutor from the Department of Justice on Monday and another call the next day, telling him that the department did not want to raise charges against his client.
Ensign's defence team had been cooperating with the prosecutors in trying to convince them that the senator, as his office reiterated in a statement Wednesday, "acted in accordance with the law".
Coggins refused to explain in detail the legal arguments he gave to the prosecutors.
"I don't feel comfortable entering into details about my discussions with the Department of Justice, I can only say that we think they made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Elections Commission decided to change an investigation into a complaint separated by the ethics group, claiming that a payment of $96,000 from Ensign's parents to Hamptons violated the federal electoral law.
The electoral commission said that it did not have enough evidence to prove that the money was only a gift.
NV Energy is an important Nevada company that had long supported the senator, who got a job through lobby thanks to the help Ensign gave Hampton.
An e-mail sent in December 2008 showed that after the company accepted Hampton as a lobbyist, Ensign's Chief of Staff, John Lopez, he communicated with Hampton and told him that he was "machining" the Ministry of the Interior on a controversial issue.
Ensign also attended a lunch with Hampton and another Nevada customer, Allegiant Air, and called the transport secretary to establish a meeting on behalf of the airline after he had hired Hampton to do lobbying.
When the news of the affair first appeared last year, Ensign apologized to his voters and resigned as the fourth Republican leader in the Senate.
After maintaining a low profile for many months, Ensign told reporters that he planned to post a third term in the Senate.
When Ensign's voice, Jennifer Cooper, announced that Ensign was no longer the subject of a criminal investigation, he said that the senator hoped that the ethics committee would follow the example of the Department of Justice quickly and conclude its investigation.
"Mr. Ensign wishes to continue his hard work on behalf of the people of Nevada," he said.
Cheshire's appeal will be on Twitter
There were half a dozen of them "hunting" in the courtroom's rows.
Just a minute, they sent reports of the terrible witness via Twitter.
Finally, the defense said, there were more than 140,000 Twitter messages about the process that approached the rape and the children attached to their beds in a house that was taken by fire.
On Thursday, the widely followed trial by Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of the murder of three members of a Cheshire family, Connecticut, is ready to reach an official conclusion, with the imposition of the death penalty by the jury.
But Mr Hayes' lawyers have submitted written statements in the court that outline the arguments of appeals that are likely to occupy the courts for years.
One of the most provocative claims that the intense reports on the process, including the widespread use of Twitter by media journalists, created "a circus atmosphere", and such widespread and immediate saturation with excellent details made public passions have an inappropriate influence on the jury.
The complaint could force appeals judges to deal with the question of whether new technology requires new rules in the courtroom.
"As I experienced during this process, I think there is a real danger that the inclusion of the new technology in the courtroom is affecting the individual's rights to have a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullmann, chief advocate of Mr. Hayes' defence.
The first court judge Jon C. Blue, of the Supreme State Court, laconically rejected the claims in a failure last week, saying that the news media were "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury had been led by passion.
But it probably won't be the last word on the subject.
For decades, appeals courts have recognized that the coverage of famous cases can generate questions about the impartiality of a trial.
In a historic failure in 1966, the U.S. Supreme Court withdrew the sentence of a Cleveland osteopath, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, in his decision, in the case of Sheppard vs. Maxwell, who had "an atmosphere of carnival in the process" due to the media.
It is believed that the crime had been inspired by the television program and the film "The Fugitive".
Some lawyers said that the appeals courts that examined Mr. Hayes' conviction half a century later might be intrigued by the argument that new rules might be necessary to control the form of communication from the courtrooms, something unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard's case.
"There is a general concern about the impact of the new media" in high profile processes, said John J. Donohue III, a professor at the Stanford School of Laws, who studied Connecticut's death penalty and wrote a report stating that it was arbitrarily imposed.
Professor Donohue said that some appeals judges might be intrigued by the idea that limiting immediate communication from courtrooms could make trials more just.
The issue of Twitter is just one of many of the themes outlined by Hayes lawyers, who will probably be discussed for years, delaying execution.
Defense lawyers also claim, for example, that Hayes could have been damaged when the Blue Judge refused to allow them to test the reactions of potential jury members, showing them speculative photographs of the crime scene during the jury selection.
Some of the jury have said that they were terrified by the victims' photographs, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48 years old, and their daughters, Hayley, 17 and Michaela, 11.
Defence lawyers say that they will also question the constitutionality of the death penalty and will argue that the judge wrongly removed a jury that had criticised the prosecutors, and that he wrongly pressed for a verdict for his strange decision to order the jury to deliberate for a week.
The jury was not kidnapped.
But their arguments about the effect of the intense coverage of the process can attract most of the interest.
They observed in a refusal to the verdict archived last month that the case dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed during the election campaign by candidates for governor and the United States Senate.
They argued that the media were constantly firing wood at the fire of the emotion on the case.
"The daily accumulation of tweets from the media, cameras and reporters outside the court," said lawyers, "was something never seen here in New Haven and perhaps throughout the state."
Your attention to Tweeter's coverage is controversial.
In some interviews, some journalists said that the complaint about the fact that the immediate news was more important than the reports submitted more slowly was a controversial vision that would make the court's policy on control of coverage weak in future processes.
But some lawyers said that the appeals courts were often attracted by the arguments on the adaptation required in the courts due to social and technological changes.
Hayes' lawyers are pressuring for that claim.
In his letter, he referred to the decision of 1966 of the Supreme Court, which revoked Dr. Sheppard's conviction because of the cover of the trial, and made it clear that they would require new means to require new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "represents the Sheppard vs. Maxwell case in the 21st century."
Can the civilian hold a bridge to join the divisions?
After a notable campaign for invectiveness and negativity, a bit of civilism has been launched this week in Washington.
Is it a prelude to a genuine future bilateral cooperation or an illusionary moment before a quick return to the party's fight in the capital?
The meeting of Tuesday between President Obama and Congress leaders did not make any progress on the major issues to be dealt with during the upcoming meeting.
But as everyone says, it was at least a brief discussion about the differences between the two sides, as well as a recognition of their shared responsibilities to govern, rather than being another empty episode to win party points.
The public meeting of the Chairman's deficit committee on Wednesday was also civilized, despite the political differences between the members.
It is clear that close interaction over a period of months has generated mutual respect that transcends the ideological gap that still separates members.
That is only enough to declare that a new era of cooperation has arrived.
Now both parties are in a trial period, each seeking to identify signs of cooperativeism and commitment, while trying to assess the limits of public opinion and the patience of voters for a renewed participatory war.
The reason why the Tuesday meeting and subsequent evaluations of the same were made by participants with a minimum of demands or charges.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too large and are very deeply rooted as to suggest any rapid change in the climate that existed over the past two years.
Whether it is taxes, expenses, health care or social assistance, both parties are in the opposite.
In any case, the November election has softened the mood in Washington, at least in the short term.
"There is no doubt that things have changed in terms of how to say things," said Pete Wehner, an officer of Bush's administration now at the Centre for Ethics and Public Policy.
"They are inevitable after the elections.
Elections wake up partial passions, which then disappear.
That's good."
In some issues, particularly those on the agenda of the meeting, Republicans and Democrats have no option but to find a solution.
Bush's tax reductions are won at the end of the year, and no one is in favour of this.
Both parties want to find a way to preserve some or all reductions, either permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, there is likely to be a commitment to widening unemployment subsidies, probably because the Republicans cannot believe that they are in favour of tax reductions for the rich, denying unemployment benefits for the unemployed.
After Tuesday's meeting in the White House, there is greater optimism about possible treatment of these issues during the upcoming meeting, along with the ratification of the new START Nuclear Disarmament Pact (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty).
But William Galston, from Brookings Institute, warns that successful cooperation in the emerging issues will not necessarily lead to continued bipartisanism when the new 112th Congress meets in January.
He said, on the contrary, that it is very likely and even inevitable that a period of disagreement begins.
"After the things to be done are done, psychology will in the short term reverse the situation to a confrontation," he said.
Wehner also expressed scepticism (which is widely shared) about the fact that civilism can lead to true cooperation.
"I see most of what will happen between now and 2012 as a trial for the main event of 2012," he said.
The reasons have a lot to do with the constitution of the new Republican majority in the House and the Tea Party voters, who have made a decisive contribution to their creation.
More conscious that Republican leaders have the dangers of exaggerating their position, they know that they must try to fulfill their promises to cut the costs of the state and cancel the new health law.
These guidelines are already clearly observed in the initial responses to the recommendations of the deficit committee, including the reform of the tax code and the increase in some taxes and retirement age, and the cuts in expenditure.
Co-Chairmen Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken care of one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and, according to their own assessment, have put the issue of deficit in the public agenda in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in the 18-member commission to publish their plan as an official recommendation, and have been struggling to get close to that figure.
The greatest resistance is among the officers elected in the panel, suggesting that there are at least few bases or wishes for commitment in fiscal matters.
Galston foretells two phases in the battles between the Republicans of the White House and the Congress.
The first will happen next year in the form of party shocks, when the Republicans challenge Obama on the budget, taxes and medical assistance, followed by a period of increased bilateral cooperation.
What would cause the change?
Public opinion.
There is considerable evidence that, despite the partisanism of the recent election, a majority of Americans still want to see the two parties working together.
If the confrontation leads to a dead point, as happened in 1995, then both parties will observe closely the reaction of the people.
Anyone who thinks he's losing will probably change course and look for commitment.
However, this can be an optimistic vision.
Partisanism and polarization are now greater than they were in the mid-1990s, and there seems to be a greater ideological gap between Obama and the Republicans of Congress than between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans at the time.
At the same time, activists from both parties see 2010 as the only prelude to a more transcendental election in 2012.
Given this reality, the civilism shown this week can be welcomed by many Americans.
But this will require much more effort on both sides to find common points on issues that still divide them.
A U.S. filtered document depicts Moscow as the paradise of corruption
The city's control is in the hands of a "cleptocracy", and leaves some of the bribes and protection money that directly appeals to Kremlin, according to the US Embassy in Russia in February.
It was reported that both the police and the Federal Security Service operate huge blackmail systems, which helps explain the high cost of life in Moscow.
They collect money not only from legitimate businesses, but also from organized criminal groups.
Each strata of bureaucracy, what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called "vertical authority", takes part as the money goes up on the scale.
The note, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyle, was published by WikiLeaks on Wednesday.
The note is based on sources whose names have been censored.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still the mayor of Moscow, and he blamed him for much of the corruption.
President Dmitry Medvedev dismissed him in October, but there has been little evidence of a cleansing since then.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns an important construction company, have systematically denied the allegations of corruption over the years, and he has won several verbal claims about such accusations.
In September, when a Russian television channel asked him about a documentary that would suggest it was corrupt, he said, "It's crazy, it's a patron, it's a joke."
According to the polls, the Russians strongly believe that their society is corrupt.
But it is unusual to find the details explained in detail, as they were in the embassy report, and it is unusual for diplomats from a foreign country to do so.
"The direct slaves of the government of the city of Moscow with crime have led some to call it 'disfunctional', and to claim that the government works more like a cleptocracy than a government," the note says.
"The criminal elements enjoy a 'krysha' (a term of the criminal world and the mafia that literally means 'stechy' or protection) that passes through the police, the Federal Security Service (SFS), the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD), and the prosecutor's office, as well as all sectors of the government's bureaucracy in Moscow.
"The analysts identify a three-level structure in Moscow's criminal world."
"Luzhkov is at the highest."
"The SFS, the MVD and the militia are on the second level."
"Finally, the common criminals and the corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level."
"This is an ineffective system in which criminal groups fill a void in some areas, because the city does not provide some services."
The report states that the SFS collects the money from larger companies, and that the police point to small businesses.
One source, stated the report, "explained that the commercial owners of Moscow understand that it is best to achieve the protection of MVD and SFS (instead of organized crime groups) as they have not only more weapons, resources and power than criminal groups, but also are protected by law".
"For this reason, protection against criminal gangs is no longer a priority."
The note notes that while the collection of money is complete, protection may be irregular; even those who pay are subject to arrest.
Those who do not pay quickly find their business closed by a pretext or another.
Medvedev has spoken several times about the fight against corruption, but he has acknowledged that he has made little progress.
The embassy note informs about men taking bags, probably full of cash, within the same Kremlin.
"In its fight against corruption, Medvedev has to rely on bureaucrats," said Georgy Satarov, director of the Indem group of experts in Moscow, in a recent interview.
"But he's part of this bureaucracy."
"He does not belong to a political class, because there is no political class in Russia anymore."
Without politics, without opposition, without separation of powers, he said, corruption is inevitable.
At the national level, Indem estimates that corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year.
In a recent survey on global perceptions of corruption conducted by the non-governmental organization Transparency International, the country was classified as 154 (the countries are at least classified as the most corrupt).
The revelation of the U.S. Embassy's note, which did not take place until late at night in Moscow, will surely cause resentment within the Russian government, and even though Luzhkov may be blamed for Moscow's weaknesses, it could be an opportunity for Kremlin to argue that the problem is being solved.
Interviewed with CNN by Larry King, Putin suggested that WikiLeaks documents could be lies and reacted furiously to a revelation that claimed US diplomats called Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth of the matter is that this relates to our interaction, which is an important factor in domestic policies in this country," he said.
"But to be honest with you, we do not suspect that this would have been done with such arrogance, with such pressure and, you know, that it would have been done in such an immoral way."
The veterans of the Red Jemeres forced to face the past
In a concrete class with weakly illuminated walls, the director of the Anlong Secondary School recalled the man who had built it, the last leader of the Red Jemeres Ta Mok.
"Here everyone loves Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader and worried about his people," said 42-year-old Sarg Kor Ma.
Known as "the Carnicero" for its brutality during the government of the Red Jemeres, the commander remains popular in this remote former fortress of the Red Jemeres in the northwest of Cambodia, where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructures, and where thousands of former soldiers of the organization still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Red Jemeres surrender to the government, the long-lasting loyalty is finally challenged in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local forum for truth and reconciliation allowed victims to face publicly those who had participated in the regime.
In June, the government distributed here a secondary school text book that for the first time teaches the story of the Red Jemeres to the children of their former soldiers.
And in July, a United Nations and Cambodia Joint Court issued the first conviction of a former member of the Red Jemeres, judging the former head of the known torture centre Tuol Slang, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Dutch, 35 years in prison.
With each of these events, anxiety has grown among the veterans of the Red Jemeres of Anlong Veng, complicating efforts for reconciliation and their attempts to reintegrate into Cambodian society.
"There is resentment and fear among the former Red Jemeres, but they can do nothing," Chhang Youk, director of the Cambodian Documentation Centre, said an independent organization that investigates the regime.
"To them, life under the Red Jemeres was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"This is generating divisions within families."
During the government of the Red Jemeres of Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, about 1.7 million people were executed or died of hunger, disease or overwork.
When in 1979 the Vietnamese invaded and defeated the government led by Pol Pot, the rest of the regime and its military fled to the border of Cambodia with Thailand.
There they launched an insurrection that lasted until the last move that was made in December 1998.
As Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the war of guerrillas from their bases in the mountains and forests of western Cambodia, Ta Mok cultivated followers in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a peace agreement sponsored by the United Nations led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Red Jemeres fighters began to desert the government, culminating in the performances of Ieng Sary in 1996, and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had resisted, was captured by government forces in 1999 in nearby Dangrek Mountains.
He died in a Phnom Penh prison in 2006 while awaiting the trial.
Without the support of its benefactors, the oldest combatants of the Red Jemeres fell into the absolute misery common in rural Cambodia, and many felt nostalgia for the movement.
Although a few Red Jemeres elite officials maintained their local administrative positions instead of depositing their weapons, the race soldiers remain poor and unqualified farmers.
"These people have gained few benefits after the surrender," said Sok Lang of the Centre for Justice and Reconciliation, which offers public forums throughout Cambodia, even in Anlong Veng.
"They have incorporated the utopian agricultural ideology of the regime."
"They were created without any concept of doing business."
Sister Lim, 55, who joined the Red Jemeres when she was a teenager in 1974, fought in the forest near Anlong Veng before being dedicated to life as a poor rice farmer in 1998.
"Life with the Red Jemeres was good," he said.
"This Mok gave you to eat all."
"But now life is difficult because we have to self-abstain."
The current Red Jemeres court has also caused concern here.
Early next year, it is expected that the court will begin trialing Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sarry and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Minister of the Red Jemeres.
The court's mandate is to prosecute the leading leaders and those of greater responsibility for the crimes, but it has not said whether to prosecute cases in addition to those four.
This is not much used to calm the fears in Anlong Veng.
The recent speculation of the media has focused on 64-year-old Im Chaem, who was a district chief in the province of Banteay Meanchey during the government of the Red Jemeres in late 1970s.
In 2007, she told the Cambodian Documentation Centre researchers that she had supervised the construction of the Trapeang Thma dam, a project in which thousands of forced workers were thought to have died.
During a recent rainy afternoon, Im Chaem again worked in the fields at his house on wooden pilots on a dirt road outside of Anlong Veng.
When the sun poured out long shadows on the breadbread, Im Chaem refused to talk about his past in the Red Jemeres.
She said that if the court had not brought her in.
"Camboya is in peace and stability," he said.
"If there are more prosecutions, there will be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who deserted the Red Jemeres in 1978, has also repeatedly warned that there will be instability if the court prosecutes more suspects, although experts and historians question him.
"Camboya must dig a hole and bury the past," he said.
But facing the past is exactly what Cambodia must do to move forward, Chhang Youk said, from the documentation center.
"The reconciliation, according to Khmer, is to reunite broken pieces," he said.
"It is our duty to gather these broken pieces so that we can understand."
The centre produced the first text book approved by the government on the Red Jemeres, called "A History of Democratic Kampuchea", of 75 pages.
It was distributed in Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the book of secondary school history of the Ministry of Education, which contains fewer than four pages on the Red Jemeres.
As in most Cambodia, the young people of Anlong Veng know little details about the Red Jemeres, despite the city's link to the regime.
Toque Valeak, 19-year-old, a student at Anlong Veng Secondary School, said that the new textbook helped students to understand an important part of their history.
But his parents responded with skepticism when he took the book home to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the text book and the court," he said.
"They have suspicions because they are not sure about the number of persons who will be prosecuted by the court."
Such resistance has made the reconciliation process complex and difficult, Sok Leang said.
But the public forums, the text book and the court are beginning to produce an impact, he said.
Anyway, here the Red Jemeres retain a powerful charm.
In the Dangrek Mountains, a path with too many herbs and covered with waste plastic bags leads to a rectangle of the black holline covered by an oxidized ice cream roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned here on a bunch of tires after his death in 1998.
Noum Sothea, 31 years old, a cell phone salesman on the road, said he didn't know much about the man who was burned there.
"But he has a strong spirit and many inhabitants of the place go there to pray to him," he said.
It was the birthday of Noum Sothea, and later that day he decided to walk to the place of Pol Pot's last rest, where he would leave a handful of mature bananas with the hope of good luck.
Belarus accepts to give up its qualified uranium reserve for weapons
In a surprising victory for President Obama's campaign to protect nuclear material worldwide, the government of Belarus announced Wednesday that it will give up its highly enriched uranium reserve, a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was revealed in a joint statement published after the Minister of Foreign Affairs Hillary Rodham Clinton met with the Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov, on the edge of a security summit.
For years, the U.S. government had been trying to persuade Belarus to renounce its highly enriched uranium and seemed to have reached a point without returning last spring.
But U.S. officials told Washington Post that a couple of operations were carried out with Belarus in the last two months, to withdraw 84.82 kg of uranium qualified for weapons of a Belarusian research facility.
This prepared the ground for the Wednesday agreement to remove the rest of the material, approximately 227 kg, according to an official, who spoke from the anonymous due to the confidentiality of the subject.
The agreement seemed to be one of the most important results of the 47-nation nuclear security summit chaired by Obama in April, which excluded Belarus.
And apparently it was a good achievement to ensure the invitation of the former Soviet republic to the next summit in 2012.
"I was really fascinated by the fact that they wanted a place at the 2012 Nuclear Safety Summit."
"This proves that this process is working," said Ken Luongo, president of the Society for Global Security, a group that promotes nuclear security.
Clinton said the agreement is "a very significant and important step" given by Belarus.
In April 2009 Obama promised in Prague to protect all nuclear material that is worldwide vulnerable in the next four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of all their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries did it under George W. Bush's administration.
At the time of the Obama Nuclear Security Summit, the Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko had declared that the nation would never renounce its uranium.
"We have preserved the highly enriched uranium (cents of kilograms of what is basically qualified uranium for weapons) and the low-rich uranium," Lukashenko said at that time.
"This is our raw material... we're not going to make dirty bombs, and we're not going to sell them to anyone."
"We use it for research purposes, that's all."
However, Belarus approached the United States a few months ago, showing interest in reaching an agreement.
Officials said that the first task of removing uranium from Belarus in October was particularly complicated, since the material had been slightly irradiated.
Officials said it was loaded on a special train that traveled more than 2,000 km to a Russian storage and disposal facility.
According to officials, the second operation ended on Monday and was carried out on a plane.
The U.S. government spent $13 million on tasks, and most of the money was used to provide Belarus with low-rich uranium research, which is not ideal for nuclear weapons.
Andrew Bieniawski, an Energy Department official who works in the Global Threat Reduction, said that "this was coordinated and orchestrated very carefully to strengthen trust" which led to the agreement signed by Clinton.
This year, the James Martin Center for Non-Proliferation Studies estimated that Belarus had at least 40 kilograms of uranium qualified for weapons, as well as hundreds of kilograms of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will try to eliminate its reservation to 2012, according to the joint statement.
The relationship between Belarus and the United States has been strained for years, mainly because of the harsh repression of Lukashenko on human rights.
But Wednesday's statement suggested a potential distance.
It was stated that "as long as progress is welcomed on these global security issues, the United States and Belarus recognized that greater respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central theme for improving bilateral relations, and is essential for the country's progress and its citizens".
The Spanish Government did not repair CIA flights
The Spanish Government did not repair the CIA's flights with Taliban prisoners and Al Qaeda directed to Guantanamo for Spanish territory, as the US ambassador in Madrid said on a telegram.
This is reflected in the documents filtered (cables) by Wikileaks to the El País daily, where it is added that then the Government's first vice-president, María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, asked that the Spanish Executive be informed to "be able to demonstrate that they were exercising proper surveillance over foreign aircraft crossing Spain".
In June 2006, after a report by the Council of Europe in which he accused of complicity in practices contrary to human rights to a dozen countries, Spain, a meeting was held between former US ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega.
The Vice-President acknowledged that the Council's report "has taken Zapatero's Government out of play" and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
"From Vega he stressed that Spain has no repair to intelligence flights through Spanish territory."
"They just want to be informed" to avoid being "unavoided pills", Aguirre reports on a cable.
The then holder of Foreign Affairs, Miguel Angel Moratinos, also pointed out to the ambassador that the Spanish Executive "would like to give the lowest possible profile to this issue, although, when being in the hands of judges, the Government had limited influence".
In January 2007, prosecutor Vicente González transferred to the Embassy that would not attempt to block the judge's initiative to request the disclassification of documents from the National Intelligence Centre (CNI) and the Ministry of Defence on CIA flights.
"These reports do not contain any criminal elements or sensitive information," the Embassy explained after speaking to the prosecutor.
However, the United States reflected its concern about the "appearing coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors" rather than the classified information of the CNI or the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between independent researchers will complicate our efforts to deal with the case discreetly between Governments," Aguirre regrets.
In March 2007 at lunch between the US ambassador and Interior Minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, he commented that "although Spanish judges are furiously jealous of their independence and will do what they consider appropriate," he had instructed his collaborators "to avoid feedback from rhetorical flame, in an attempt to lower the temperature."
The Ambassador also expresses concern about the conduct of the PP in this matter.
"Despite its pro-American general orientation, our experience suggests that the PP will not hesitate to capitalize on any indication that the Zapatero Government has tolerated or deliberately ignored US actions that could be interpreted as possible violations of human rights, even if these revelations have negative consequences for the US Government," he points out.
The Parisian confession complained on the network of "agobio" being a mother
The young man was talking about the boy when he was already dead and had a blog: "Terror in the Gallega."
Monica Juanatey Fernández is "Muki" on the network.
With this nickname, which he used since he was small, he communicated with a cousin and at least a friend; the two natures of Noah, the Korean people of which she originated.
Messages belong to 2008.
To understand them, it is necessary to know your sentimental life, which ABC rebuilds through testimony from its relatives.
The 30-year-old Galega started an industrial relationship with Ivan Túñez in 1998.
It took a year.
When they left him, she was soon supposed to be pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was yours, but his ex never let him do DNA testing.
It wasn't long before another girl met him.
The elected was Alberto, a boy from Lousame, a neighboring town.
He came to live with him for a long time.
Caesar lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to explore the labour market, the boy stayed with her partner, who even came to accompany her to Palma for a week.
But because of the content of the communications, it is seen that his romance was broken, that they broke.
In March 2008 he is in Menorca alone, and writes: "Alberto is very rare and mosquitoed, because I have come to work."
"When I said it seemed good to him, but of course, now he realizes what it is to be with the child all day and has no freedom to do what he wants."
Then he talks about a message to the cell phone he just received: "I want you to come back this month or give me a direction to send you to the child."
She complains, "If she doesn't like me leaving the crib with my mother, I'll pick it up when she comes back," she says.
In May, he spoke of the return to his people: "This week I'm going to go there, but I'm only going to be there until the 19th, because the 20th I have to introduce myself to a job not to lose it."
Make it clear that if it's all right with him, he'll be taken to his firstborn.
"It will be with whom you must, or with me, and never in life will it happen to me again with no one who is not my mother," dubious intent given their bad relationships.
In July, there's another post.
When you type it, it is assumed that the child, who arrived on the island on 1st of that month, was allegedly murdered on 10, is dead.
"César is happy on one side, but not on the other."
"He's on one side with me and he likes the place a little, but on the other, he's going to class almost every day."
He's talking about a transfer to Mallorca.
"He'll go there (the child) to some summer classes, and so I save a little bit of the cane."
On the 17th, memories and complaints.
"A very big kiss from Caesar, who asks me when you come."
"Tell Alberto that he sent you I don't know what videos to email, see how he wants to find me, he has to fuck."
The 30th, another: "The child is fine, goes to summer classes to learn Catalan."
From Victor, his current partner, there's one: "He's making me money."
On the Internet there are your messages on blogs dedicated to the soul and the manga.
He even had one of his own in the universe of MySpace, now involved, where he was called "Muki the Excarclerator."
"Terror in the gallega (epigraphe)."
The last man who lived with her, keeping her sworn, declares her regret for feeling guilty.
He doesn't want to believe that everything happened because he didn't tell him that he was a single mother.
Monica joined Palma's provincial prison yesterday, from Menorca's judicial detention center.
The lawyer, Carlos Maceda, explained that he did not remember how the events happened, "did not intend to cause any harm to the minor."
Earlier, he confessed that he had drowned Caesar in the bathtub and deposited his body in a suitcase.
The defense and the prosecutor requested a psychiatric test.
Populars would win 4 seats at Congress and PSC would lose 9
With the results of the 28-N, the PP could be decisive in the municipalities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona
Following the significant increase in votes and Members experienced in the recent autonomous elections, the Catalan PP has already taken a look at the generals as whether or not the prospects are more positive, as the number of votes that this training receives in these commissions is often doubled to what it receives in the Catalans.
Thus, the popular Catalans received 610.473 votes in the 2008 generals, while in the 2006 autonomouss, the figure rose to 316.222.
Last Sunday, the PPC reached 384,091 votes.
If this trend is maintained at the height, which has been fuelled by a transfer of the PSC vote and the loyalty of the PP electorate, analysts of this formation have calculated that, if general elections are held, the PSC could pass from 8 to 12 MPs in Congress, while CiU would also win four (now 10) and the PSC would lose nothing less than 9 MPs (at 25).
These calculations would show that the Catalan square is fundamental to PP and PSOE.
According to popular analysis, the ERC would lose a MP - now he has three - while the ICV would stay with a MP or win one.
But to maintain the electoral calendar, the most immediate date will be held in May 2011 with municipal commissions, where the popular can also be decisive at the end of socialist hegemony in the four capitals of the province and in its response to the Barcelona Deputation, one of the most budgeted administrations - 661 million euros for 2011 - .
Both nationalists and people agree that the PSC will lose the cities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where socialists would not get the majority or the possibility of resorting to their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
Given the republican debacle, it would not be debarred that this formation loses its representation in the Barcelona Consistency - it is necessary to obtain 5% of the votes - .
The PP has increased its number of votes in the four capitals and could be decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
Nationalists are convinced that they can play a role in the Tarraconense capital, where they ruled with the PP before the current socialist mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, the PP has located only 500 votes in the PSC, whose mayor, Angel Ros, maintains very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during this last campaign, they have been found on several occasions.
Populars have also grown in other important municipalities such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
Currently, the PP is present in 34 municipal governments in Catalonia and aspires to form lists in the highest number of populations.
Catalan cell provided thousands of passports to Al Qaida
In addition to the seven detainees in Barcelona, there were three in Thailand
The seven Pakistani and Nigerian officers of the General Police Information Commission in Barcelona formed a yohadist cell that, directed from Thailand, provided passports to different groups of Al Qaida, including "The Tigers for the Liberation of the Land of Tamil" (LTTE) and "Laskar and Taiba" (Let), the author of this last of the Bombay attacks that caused the death of 106 people in 2008.
The Ministry of the Interior has attached great importance to these investigations, to the point of ensuring that with the "Kampai operation", Al Qaida's counterfeiting device has become "weakened" at the international level and, therefore, "their operational capacity".
Researchers estimate that the cell, during the two years it has been active in Catalonia, has been able to send thousands of passports to Thailand, where they were falsified and then distributed to groups that integrate the criminal galaxy Al Qaida so that its "combatants" can cross the European borders and other Western countries with total impunity.
The isolated cell is not the only one that the Yihadist network had operational in Europe, so that in the investigations they have participated, in addition to Thai services, other European police units, so it is not clear that in the EU territory, similar attacks are being carried out in the coming days, similar to those that occurred last Tuesday night in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigerian Babatounde Agunbiade), another was developed in Thailand with the capture of the Pakistani Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and the Thai Siriklaya Kyjbumrung.
These were the ones who led the cell in Spain and other European countries from Bangkok.
The Catalan network - part of it was hit in 2009 - was mainly stealing to tourists passports that met the requirements marked by the so-called "World Islamic Front".
In other words, the documents should be in the name of men between 25 and 45 years of age, with a validity of several years and without printed visas.
In the investigation it is stressed that no data has currently been found linking the detainees in Catalonia to the Bombay attack, despite the fact that the author of this attack, "Laskar and Taiba", has been one of the recipient groups of the passports stolen in Spain and then forged in Thailand.
However, it should be recalled that days before this attack was committed, since Catalonia were sent through a transfer agency about a thousand dollars that were "inverted" in the purchase of mobile cards that were then used by the members of the "command" that ended with the life of 106 people.
The police have been charged with extensive documentation.
PP requires Mas to park the tax concert
The leader of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, had the opportunity to personally expose Arthur But his conditions to support his investment as President of the Generality, identical to those already set up during the campaign, which summarizes the priority of the recovery of the economy and the fact that he is aware of thread-supermanist adventures, such as the economic concert that the nationalist leader wants to focus on the equator of his mandate.
The president of the popular Catalans came to Arthur Mas's meeting with the security that he had obtained 18 MPs in last Sunday's elections, which is more than enough to be desired, because the CIU candidate needs at least one of the trainings that will be carried out by the opposition to abstain from the investment vote.
A possible agreement with the PP depends on the future alliances that nationalists want to maintain in Congress when general elections are held, but, at the moment, the talks that these days are held But with the rest of political leaders they are held in the Catalan key.
And with regard to the president of the PP, to support an investment "will have to park all the sovereign and independent speeches", as well as the economic concert - similar to that of the Basque country - that the convergence leader even intends to submit to referendum.
Both leaders have in common their commitment to speed up the political apparatus of a very inflated autonomous administration and the elimination of succession and donations tax.
Details of the Mas's investment negotiations will be taken up by the PPC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
But he has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who promised a hard opposition - , Joan Herrera (ICV) and today he will do so with Joan Puigcercos (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Catalan Solidarity).
The geriatric claims that the deaths were not due to "no measures"
The owners of the center of Olot do not deny that their cello killed more than 11 elders
Geriatrics La Caritat de Olot (Gerona) offered yesterday a press call to highlight the damage the criminal conduct of Joan Vila Dilmé, the nurse who killed at least eleven elders in charge of the institution while he was employed there.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, appeared with the letter from the centre, lawyer Joan Cañada, and announced that "the desire of La Caritat would be able to carry out the charge against the responsible" of the deaths but "legality and responsibility force us to assume the procedural situation of civil liability".
And in addition to the social reprisal that the entity may suffer because it has not detected the criminal activities of the cell mate, the great threat to La Caritat now covers the form of substantial compensation that the legal representatives of the victims' families are already calculating.
Joan Vila Dilmé has confessed that the first crime was committed in August 2009 and has since not stopped killing.
The judge had already pointed out in the car that ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - old patients of the dentist - that he suspected that in many cases no doctor would personally explore the deceased but that, taking into account the age and the pathologies of the patients, the treatment was disbanded by telephone.
The Caritat, through its director, repeatedly denied this extreme yesterday and pointed out that "the lack of measures cannot at any time have been the cause of what has happened".
La Caritat's lawyer added that "there is no indication in the case that there has been an unreasonable action by any other person who is not the accused himself".
He was already baptized as "An Angel of Death" and confessed 11 murders and detailed that the first crime was committed on 29 August 2009 for a month and a half later to kill a second grandmother.
In this case, he caused death by pinning an insulin overdose, unlike the first crime he committed by using a mixture of sedated pills.
The Director of La Caritat points out that it is difficult to control that the staff of the centre have access to medicines.
The insulin pinches and the sedative cocktails would have been the mechanism used in six of the nine crimes that the nurse, in her afane to alleviate the suffering of the internals, used to kill them.
But it will be the analysis that is being done in the laboratory that must clarify if Vila doesn't lie and sought for her first victims a less cruel death or if, on the contrary, she embraces them as she has already confessed that she did with the three women who killed between 12 and 17 October.
In La Caritat, they do not give credibility to the manifestations of the cellar, nor even to the number of committed murders, which do not deny that they are superior, and justify their attitude in the different versions that Vila has given in her visits to the judge and in the little sense that she has to change her way of doing after she has successfully committed eight murders.
That is why they say that justice is made available to clarify the scope of this event.
The ECB’s threat
The investors reacted abruptly to Trichet's yesterday's threat that warned "the markets should not underestimate our reaction capacity".
Peripheral differentials have been severely closed and European banks' shares have increased by more than 5%.
However, we must not underestimate the ECB's ability to make mistakes, and the euro has only been a worrying signal.
What has happened yesterday is itself from an illegal market as it unfolds is recovered but motivated by the closure of short and highly speculative positions.
The institutional investor will be slow to lose fear.
A month ago, the ECB called on us today to withdraw liquidity measures and we will have to withdraw tomorrow for the fourth time in two years and those remaining.
The Bundesbank called for the finalisation of the public debt purchase plan for ineffective and the elimination of all extraordinary liquidity measures in time and leaving only unlimited weekly access.
Following the Irish crisis, we hope to extend the current liquidity measures "at least until March" and maintain the quarterly auction with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity at least until June.
We also hope that they will continue with their bond purchase program and even give the signal to intensify it.
If they fail to meet the expectations generated, they will reverse the excellent reaction of the markets yesterday and if they are still obsessed with withdrawing liquidity measures, which God is watching us!
Just as at their May meeting, in which they claimed that they had not even considered the purchase of bonds and had collapsed the markets, the story could be repeated tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May he announced the bassuca on Monday and Wednesday he said he had already bought a lot, causing a new market collapse.
Yesterday's abbreviation of letters to a year in Portugal has been very poor.
The Treasury only issued 500 million to 5.28%, compared with 750 million to 4.81% of the previous auction.
Still, the types in Portugal fell 30 basic points across the curve, clearly reflecting a change in market sentiment after Trichet's words.
In Ireland, the figures of the Allied and Bank of Ireland hole have been published.
The estimated figures are about 10,000 million short-term and other 15,000 potentials and have until February to obtain private capital or will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility after not detecting the problem in July with stress tests, the figures are acceptable within the Aid Plan and help reduce uncertainty.
However, on the next Tuesday, the Government will have to obtain parliamentary approval of its new budget and still lacks sufficient support, so Ireland remains a focus of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has moderated the tone of her speech to relax the tension towards the next Summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December, in which a political commitment is needed to show that we are a union and that we all play the same score.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the rest of Beethoven's joy.
In Spain, the President had the opportunity to present yesterday's plan of action to be adopted by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous communities and financial institutions, reduction of deficit, liberalisation, privatisation, measures to re-activate employment seem to be in the ears of investors such as the four Vivaldi stations.
The double effect of Trichet and ZP explains that the Spanish Stock Exchange has increased by 4.5%, the double that the rest of European Stock Exchanges.
Unlike February, the reaction of the Government and the Bank of Spain has been rapid and decisive and we are benefiting from the surprising effect.
Today there is a three-year bonus sub-assembly that will benefit from the Trichet effect so we hope that it will resolve with strong demand and help to resolve the doubts about our refinancing capacity.
For Spain to ask for a Aid Plan would be a self-immolation.
They would give us a liquidity line that we don't need, the Treasure has more than 40,000 million in liquidity available in the triple that in March, to lovely types and closes you access to the markets without delay.
However, the strategy must continue to be that of Caesar's women, "even if it is, it must seem so."
Spirit, we can.
Eulen's president will challenge the council of Vega Sicily requested by his children
The timing does not lead to the open conflict in the Álvarez family, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David Álvarez, the founder of the group, will challenge her, in considering her as "no full law", the court board of El Enebro on the next day 16, requested by five of her seven children and in which they will try to make most of her and deal with the management bodies of the firm titled Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Álvarez and his sons Jesus David and Mary José are finishing the legal battery for the new court chapter in their fight for the control of the group.
The founder of the largest holding business services to the company does not seem willing to surrender in his dispute to be present in the government organs of El Enebro.
The Board of Directors was dismissed by five of its seven children who were appointed administrators at the 18th January of this year's shareholders' assembly and whose complaint is noted in the Mercantil Register.
The court board of El Enebro for the next day 16, convened by the Magistrate of Mercantil No. 2 of Madrid, has reopened the box of Trues within the Álvarez family.
The appeal to the judge to establish the assembly is, until the conflict is resolved, the only legal mechanism that guarantees the Board's summons.
The last movement of Juan Carlos, Paul, Emilio, Marta and Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz, is described by David Álvarez as a "despised appeal of the applicants to, through procedural arguments, in clear fraud of the Law and abuse of the law, try to validate and heal the radically nullity of 18 January," according to their official spokesmans.
This argument will be the basis for the Board to be challenged once the Board has been convened, considering it to be "non-full law".
The same protagonists, who maintain a discreet silence, have already unsuccessfully tried to bring the magistrate together in June.
In El Enebro, heritage society and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicily, among other assets, the seven children of David Álvarez control 100% of the capital.
The founder of the service group, however, claimed the benefit of 51 per cent of the capital, according to family protocols.
This matter is the substantive issue that the judge must decide upon once the view on the appeal is held, for which there is not yet a specified date.
Red Bull triumphs in F1 with a secret weapon of Siemens
A software designs improvements in real-time cars.
Since Red Bull broke into the world of Formula 1 in 2004, its history in this selection of speed universe has been marked by surprise and success.
At first, no one took into account the options of a newly arrived shield and, in spite of the rising traffic of the last seasons, last November, in the final straight of the championship, all were betting on the Ferrari of Fernando Alonso's triumph.
Without demerging the skill as a pilot of the final champion, German Sebastian Vettel, nor the engine engine Renault that drives his car, in the world of Formula 1 has become a legend the "secret weapon" that multinational Siemens has put into the hands of Red Bull to turn it into a winning team.
This is actually a powerful process simulation software that Germany placed on the market in 2007 for very remote purposes from the high automotive competition.
Named PLM, this powerful computer tool has been used to design assembly chains of manufacturing factories around the world, energy plants, high precision instruments.
The goal is to reproduce, faithfully simulate the product or process before building it in a real way, thus avoiding preventable errors and costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon's cameras, Sukhoi's planes or Nissan's most famous utility cars.
Siegfried Russwurm, responsible for the Siemens industrial division, explains that the use of this computer tool in its Formula 1 factory has allowed Red Bull to design and carry out "in a few hours, almost in real time", the changes, changes and improvements that are detected during the race and in the tests.
Russwurm explains that in 1992 the shields had an average of 10 technicians on their team who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements in vehicles during each season.
In Red Bull's team today, 180 highly qualified professionals are working, who, equipped with powerful computer teams, analyze and project any kind of changes in the balloons.
The director of Siemens explained that the PLM software is able to analyze and improve all elements of Red Bull bubbles with the exception of the engine, which is entirely Renault's responsibility.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are amended.
Changes can be made from the virtual reality of the simulator to the reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced systems of production through lasers and high-tech autoclaves.
As the only limitation of this lack of technological improvement is the figure of $40 million that each Formula 1 team can spend as much as in each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has installed the high-tech factory to design and produce its bubbles in a locality about 50 kilometers from London.
These are two buildings in which visits are restricted, especially for journalists.
Everything that happens there is considered "high secret."
The template for this performance amounts to 580 people, including its two pilots, the Vettel and Mark Webber champion.
The hero of Red Bull Formula 1 is undoubtedly the recent Sebastian Vetell champion.
Among the vast technological resources that the brand of energy drinks has put in service for its participation in the circuits, there are other players whose competition is invaluable and their zero notoriety.
The factory's technology chief, Steve Nevey, said that five years ago it could be said that I+D advances in road cars contributed 50% of the victories and pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today, these percentages have varied and technology accounts for 85% of the success, while pilots contribute 15% of the added value.
Nevey recognizes that the Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by computers as "they are unpredictable gladiators".
HP will install its own shops with local distributors in two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) opened his first exclusive store in Barcelona yesterday in collaboration with his partner Pont Reyes.
This will be the first of the network of 20 shops of between 80 and 100 square metres that the multinational plans to install in Spain over the next two years.
The company will support this initiative with the 16 areas already present in multi-market centres such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte English.
The Vice-President of HP Spain, Helena Herrero, set as an example the remodeled store located in the Great Barcelonese Via, owned by Pont Reyes, who has been working with him for 30 years.
The US group has prepared a plan to place 200 brand points in Europe in 2013, a strategy that includes 20 Spanish establishments.
The first to open was Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, being Barcelona's third.
Herrero did not want to reveal the following possible openings, although he acknowledged that Madrid could be the next destination.
The director of HP personal systems also ensured that the philosophy of installing shops will always be the same, based on a local distributor with experience and knowledge in the sector.
The US Group advises and is responsible for the exclusive furniture design of shops (with products that can be played interactively), which in Europe will have an identical image.
In addition, HP covers the training of staff of establishments.
Helena Herrero denied that this was a system of frankness and stressed that the exclusive network of trade aims to "improve service to the customer and the pymes in the purchase, attention, post-packing and even packaging".
The Barcelona store includes a space with a global pilot program that is responsible for solving the possible problems of HP computer equipment in guarantee.
An online service connects to a technical centre located in Maastricht, Netherlands.
"So, in 10 minutes we can solve problems that can sometimes take up to two days."
"This system is designed especially for SMEs and users, as large companies have already contracted technical assistance services," Helena Herrero said yesterday.
Sabadell bet for 'robar' a million customers to his rivals in three years
More optimistic than other directors, Banko Sabadell's CEO, Jaime Guardiola, believes 2011 will be a tough year for the bank, but initially rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the passive war.
In spite of this, it provides for a fluctuation of the margins of interest, which will seek to offset partly with commission increases and the credit price.
Sabadell expects to capture in three years a million private customers, their pending assignment.
Sabadell has found a way to exploit the next three years and can thus survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The bank will launch a new manager plan in 2011.
The objective, in addition to surviving without the need to resort to FROB's public aid, is to win a market share with the capture of a million new private customers -700,000 if those who can get out of the bank - its large pending allocation, as it has so far been more baited by the SMEs and companies than the retail client.
This year it has captured 250,000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
Its market share in particular is 3.5%, while in companies it exceeds 10%.
Another of the basis of the 2011-2013 plan is the commitment for productivity, or what is the same, of austerity, with cost reduction as objective, and whose challenges will be exposed to the bank when presenting the results of the exercise.
Few banks today dare to set goals and make them public, as the financial crisis has disrupted all the plans of the world bank.
Sabadell, in fact, will close this year his Optima Director's plan, set four years ago, although it was initially for three, but the market situation has made it an additional exercise.
Customers who let the savings boxes escape will be their main goal.
In a breakfast organized by the APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 will be a "hard and transcendental year".
The executive, in fact, believes that the end of the crisis in Spain will "be slow".
In addition, in two or three years it will be "very difficult to create employment", something fundamental for the survival of the banking business, he insisted.
And although he believes that the passive war - which penalises the margins - is being reduced, the price of risk premiums that are paying banks and cash for their emissions for liquidity is already being transferred to the credit price to compensate for the drop in the margins.
"The issue of liquidity and funding is structural, and will be a pressure factor on credit."
"We haven't closed the flu, but the differentials are higher," said Guardiola.
Banesto already ordered his network on Thursday to limit long-term credit and lower the price of differentials - see Five Days from 22 and 27 November.
He also recognized that the bank's trend now "is to be made up of commissions", but "there is a competitive framework".
Sabadell's plan is based on organic growth, although, as always, the group does not discard corporate operations.
Not in vain, make sure that Spain "will require larger sizes."
"The next year will move everything," he assured.
He claims that the capital needs are "very high" and does not deny that any Spanish financial entity enters red numbers.
It points out that FROB can supplement the market in the collection of funds before new recapitalisations.
After ensuring that Sabadell can survive the temporary closure of the markets, it remains important for some banks to become Vatican as well as a new liquidity crisis.
It points out that it cannot be issued, but contrary to what happened in June, short-term financing can be obtained through rest, which depletes the crisis.
The ECSC rejects a second wave of mergers in the boxes
The Director-General of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, rejected yesterday that a wave of savings box mergers would be produced and again insisted on the speed at which the restructuring of the sector is being carried out.
When it started the process of concentration of Spanish savings boxes, there were several entities that ensured that they would not participate in this first phase and that they would be reserved for the second round.
However, the Director-General of the Spanish Confederation of Savings Boxes (ECCA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, rejected yesterday that this new wave of operations will occur.
"I believe that the largest part of the mergers has been made, the incorporation of Cajasol into the Cívica Bank Group cannot be said to be a second round, which is adjusted."
"Most of it is completely done; we may be 13 or 14 instead of 17 but all major processes have already been done and shot down by the Bank of Spain, which has collaborated very much also," the director pointed out.
In statements during a breakfast of the Aragón Directive and Executive Association (ADA), Olavarrieta has stated that the concentration process is taking place "as quickly as possible, and we need to be very satisfied with how it is going to take place in the time-frames that, not now, were marked in business plans with the Bank of Spain."
"Over 45 boxes with an average of 28.500 million assets to 17 with 75.500 million are a process that has no parallel in history, reducing the number of entities by 62% to be much larger to meet Basilea," he stressed.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there are a number of rather unlucky opinions about the slowness of the process" that show "a lack of seriousness and sense", because "what the Bank of Spain does is to remember that we must be within the deadline before the end of the year".
The Director-General of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday, assured that Spain has the most rigorous financial system in all of Europe and "probably" in the world, and attributed it to those who consider it a "miss of knowledge".
The Director pointed out that, within the current economic context, "we can be very calm" with the situation of financial institutions and savings boxes, a system that has undertaken a "significant" concentration process and that "go as fast as possible".
He also recalled that the Spanish bank came out very well from the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July.
Zapatero and the German red line
Berlin has chosen to remain in the euro, but it has set the conditions for the Union as a whole.
Market tensions have caused a double government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has advanced new adjustment measures, from tax reductions to SMEs, regulation of private placement agencies or the abolition of the 426 euros of non-performance aid up to the privatisation of 49% of AENA, the management of the Barajas and El Prat airports and 30% of the State Lotteries.
On the other hand, Vice-President Elena Salgado, with the support of former President Felipe González, has been criticised by Chancellor Angela Merkel for his responsibility in disposing of the current crisis.
How do you interpret those movements?
Go ahead that Merkel's position is not a mistake in his communication policy.
On the contrary, it is another turning of Turkey in the difficult process of redefining the euro.
And there Germany has a radically new vision of what its future must be, which shocks it with maintaining the old traditions of a good part of its partners.
Faced with European resistance, Germany began to speculate about the three possible outbreaks of the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, integrated by it itself, Austria and the Netherlands, among other countries, while the south would leave the monetary area.
The second, the recovery of the framework, although it now seems science fiction, with a very favourable current, is about 50% of the population.
The third, a redistribution of the euro, in line with the German proposals for greater macroeconomic control, budgetary rigour, fines to the countries of the cross-border, possible suspensions of payments from some of them and extension to the private sector of the costs of potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and has been defined for a long time, so now there are no excuses.
First, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission stimulated deficits, the German Government withdrew from the sleeve a constitutional reform to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first sign of differences between what Germany believed should be done (tax rigour and stability plans in public finances), and what was being practiced by its European partners, including France.
The second in the front gave it to the central European country when Merkel extended Greece's rescue decision.
It was then a critical subject, but the truth is that political consensus in Germany and public opinion and published were very opposed to the rescue of Greece.
Finally, in the last days of October, Merkel again emerges with a clear position, requiring the reform of the Union treaties, to make it possible to save a country and, at the same time, to force private lenders to run with part of the cost.
This position has been interpreted as anti-European, as it has precipitated the Irish crisis and everything else.
But its proposal, although somewhat sweetened, has been approved and, in the coming months, we should attend the Union reform process which allows for those measures from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that doesn't intend to cross.
And it is telling us all that, although there is now a need to take measures with which you may not agree very much, from that date the former functioning of the euro will be over.
2013 will mean the birth of a new monetary area, in which criminal countries will be severely punished, may be required to be declared in suspension of payments and, in that case, the private sector will also run part of the cost.
Germany is pointing out that we must follow a severe path of growth with high savings and investment rates, consumption moderation, productivity and competitiveness and positive external balances.
Another alternative based on debt and construction, with huge gaps in the balance of payments, such as the one that has presided over Spanish growth in the years of boom, will simply not tolerate it.
The invitation is clear.
And we'd be wrong not to understand it.
This is not just about reversing the public deficit to 3% in 2013.
What they require of us is much harder.
And the worst we could do in these circumstances is deceive ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will lead to greater calmness.
And let us take advantage of the opportunity window they have given us, until spring 2013.
It seems that President Zapatero has also understood this and his double manifesto (the reforms promised after last Saturday's meeting with the big companies and yesterday's announcement of new measures) suggests that, despite the criticisms to Merkel, there has been an open way for the thesis that order must be made at home.
But the red line that Germany has drawn is there, and it doesn't seem to be moving.
And, among the possibilities that are envisaged, the abandonment of a monetary area that is too narrow from less serious countries cannot be excluded.
Then Germany can always tell us that it has already warned us.
Sport and fraud of the law
Alonso and Ramos in front of the Ajax show engineering but do not want to escape a penalty.
The alleged expulsion by two Royal Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the party in dispute against Ajax on 23 November in the League of Champions has caused ink rivers to be written about whether or not such behaviour is anti-deportive and whether both players should possibly be punished by UEFA.
As it is well known, in the absence of a few minutes to finish the game (that your team had already clearly won), the two players deliberately lost time in the time to take out missing tracks to cause the referee to show them the second yellow card.
Thus, and since the Real Madrid will end up as the leader of its group, both players will comply with the next game of the league, against the Auxerre, and will be able to pass cards clean at the next stage.
Finally, the UEFA disciplinary committee has penalized two parties to the team coach José Mourinho and with different economic amounts to the players involved.
The provocation of a yellow card in circumstances such as this or similar is not a new practice, but more often in the football world.
It is so extensive that it is part of the ethos, of the rules not written, but followed, of this sport.
Part of the discussion in the reported case is due to the fact that a team of the Royal Madrid entity (which in its hero name assumes nobility and honor, and has sometimes punished its players for similar acts) and the orchestrate dramatization, it seems, by Maurinho, who adds an episode more to his dilated history of hysterical and provocative technique.
In any event, the debate revolves around whether this kind of behaviour which is not expressly prohibited by the regulation contradicts the principles of sport, i.e. whether these actions are unlawful; therefore, they are actions that are respectful to the sport regulation, but they seem to avoid their meaning.
The issue is to examine the kind of harm that causes the sports spirit.
One of the things that understand sports spirit is the physical integrity of the opponents, a aspect that with these actions was not put at risk, i.e. there was no violent game.
Another of these assets to which the clean game is arranged is to prevent the team of the criminal players from taking unfair advantage of the other team, which did not happen either.
However, the paradox of the action of the Royal Madrid players is that it did not accommodate what we normally characterize as a fraud or fraud of law, because its violation of the rules was not hidden to try to avoid punishment, but precisely its action sought to be the most obvious in order to receive the punishment of the arbitrator.
They waited and gladly accepted the penalty.
Another issue is what kind of advantage the offenders receive in the intentional shortcomings under consideration.
Here it seems necessary to note that there is no disadvantage in the rival or benefit in the same party, as the result of the action is clearly supposed to leave the team with fewer players.
And it's also not a useful strategy for the next game, because the club can't count on those players.
The advantage, of course, is that players will start the next phase of the League of Champions without cards that may threaten their participation in a future game.
But it is a long-term advantage, with a certain degree of uncertainty, because the team can be removed from the first exchange, and with this action players perform a penalty match and pass to the second card cycle, in which the card accumulation suspension occurs with less than the first cycle.
So, if you're going round, it's not so clear that it's an advantage.
Finally, these actions are not against the sports spirit, which is part of strategic decisions that favour the maximum benefit of what the rules allow.
As far as we are concerned, the players did not act to avoid the application of the penalty (it would certainly be a clear case of fraud by law), but rather chose when to submit to it.
They made a strategic decision without getting the punishment or running away from it.
Although the border between engineering and law fraud is widespread, on this occasion I believe it was a clear case of engineering.
The debate, I think, arises by two factors: because it was about two self-evictions and the way in which it was carried out the transmission of the directive to provoke them.
The damage caused by the principles of sport by these actions is not both ethical and aesthetic.
Offensive offers to capture Navigating Group dinners in NCB
The dictatorship of the calendar this year concentrates on a range of reservations for the 16th and 17th days.
Self-suffering celebrations are being held by employees, who want to spend between €20 and €30.
As the tournament and the lottery, with the arrival of December, the group dinners before Christmas, which continue to exercise oxygen balloons for the restoration and relaxation of Barcelona, have also been launched in an offensive of adjusted prices to capture the majority customer: almost all want to spend between 20 and 30 euros in dinners or meals, the entrepreneurs and associations of the interviewed sector coincide.
To make accounting more complicated, this year's calendar (when the Nochevieja fell on Friday) has concentrated the petitions on the week of 13 December, with the result until the date of an avalanche of dinner reservations for the peak days (on 16 and 17) and only movement for the previous week.
As has already been happening since 2008, when the outbreak stage began, many companies have eliminated collective dinners on a budgetary basis.
In order not to deviate from tradition, many workers keep it paying off their own pocket.
Whatever the circumstances, some and others demand battle prices, the president of the Baroque Restoration Scheme, Gaietà Farrás, confirms.
The representative of the boss, today, does not dare to Vatican what this month's celebrations will be like.
"People think so much before booking."
"He wants to get out but he has the alerts on the topic of prices," he points out.
The business will go well "to those who give quality at good prices and with good service", he adds, and remembers that customers tend to lower a ladder with the crisis, so that the gap around the 25 euros has become majority in demand.
In a survey in various central establishments, the crash of petitions for the night of 17.
In the Soteras group, they indicate that there is a genuine boom of applications for that Friday, with the claim to spend less than EUR 30, to which they have responded by adapting their menus to the county, with full formulas of EUR 25-35.
In another of the most powerful groups, Andilana, with 16 establishments in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, Funda and others), the peculiarity of the calendar has led to more early reservations, including from the beginning of November.
"We made it impossible to keep the same prices last year, with menus for all tastes from 19,95 to 30 euros," they say.
In AN Group, which abandons El Mussol, Attic, QuQ, and up to a total of 23 locations, optimism is maintained after detecting an increase in billing since the second semester and some good, though concentrated, business prospects for Christmas.
Group sources point out that the 18 will also be a hyperactive day at the level of groups of friends who prefer parties.
The six group menus have added a Navigator, with 30 euros or more as a star budget and the perception that there is a willingness to spend 10% more than last year instead of demanding more details, such as diga.
They also see green bubbles in some companies that invite their employees again and feel that the volume of the groups is something bigger.
On behalf of the Fécasarm boss (which includes entities such as the Bares Association, Restaurants and Ocio de Barcelona), its vice president, Enric Gomà, trusts to begin to see the end of the tunnel and maintains that together the reservations are "animated", although the customers "negotiated at most".
Yes, the illusion of the feasts has not come down, pays who pays, indicates.
Pakistan's nuclear programme creates great concern in the EU
Islamabad produces atomic weapons at "a faster pace than any other country".
Wikileaks' filterings confirm the links between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the US Embassy in Pakistan and the US Department of State filtered by the Wikileaks portal confirms the enormous concerns caused by the Pakistani nuclear programme in Washington.
Apart from the clarifications and juicy details that offer about the content of the conversations and thoughts of US diplomatic representatives accredited to Islamabad, the documents reveal that cooperation between both countries in the field of atomic security rather than increasing, "decreases", and that the unstable Asian country produces nuclear weapons "at a faster pace than any other country in the world".
The particularity of the Pakistani nuclear programme - that the weapons are not assembled but that they remain stored by components to make their destruction difficult in the event of an attack - is one of the main causes of development in Washington.
This is what the ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, listed in a report prior to the visit of the then National Security Council, James Jones: "The proximity of some nuclear installations to the territory under the Taliban attack, the noisy dispersion of nuclear materials and the vulnerability of the transport of nuclear materials".
The high number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programmes is envisaged, not only by the US, but also by Russia, as a proliferator and reason for maintaining the guard.
"Pakistan has had to hire personnel with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear installations; given the drop in educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who work in nuclear or missile programmes," said expert Yuri Korolev, of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, at a meeting with their American counterparts.
The latest of the documentation filtered by Julian Assange's portal is the ever-increasing cooperation between the US and Pakistan on nuclear proliferation issues and the high Pakistani pace of nuclear weapons production.
An embassies office in May, which calls communication with Pakistan "frustrating", says: "Transparency is often non-existent; aid offers remain unanswered or rejected".
In another message, Peter Lavoy, an official of the National Intelligence for South Asia, notes that "in spite of the economic catastrophe, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons at a faster pace than any other country in the world".
Ambassador Patterson also asks Washington, during a visit by the Chief of the Army, General Ashfaq Kayani, to leave "very clear" to the responsible that "the Pakistani Army must end up with tacit support to terrorist groups".
In the pursuit of the chief Wikileaks
Obama appoints a high responsibility for the anti-terrorist struggle to avoid new filtrations.
Interpol emits a red alert in order to follow the movements and locate Assange where it is.
Everything related to Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, forms a complicated maze where it is difficult to be sure of the facts.
Yesterday Interpol issued a "red alert" to "localize and follow the movements" of Assange.
However, this is not a traditional arrest order.
In addition, it is not new, but it is the date of 20 November.
And it has nothing to do with the latest filtration of more than a quarter of a million US diplomatic documents, but with the allegations of sexual abuse that Australians face in Sweden.
Furthermore, the lawyer of the creator of Wikileaks, Mark Stephens, assures that "the police know where and how to contact Mr. Assange".
It was the 20th day when the international police force headquarters in Lyon (France) issued the order at a request from Sweden, but did not reveal it until yesterday, after receiving authorization from the authorities of that country.
Thus, the 188 Interpol countries have indications to identify or locate Assange "in view of their provisional arrest and extradition".
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red alert, many of the Member States, as the organization has explained, consider the so-called network notice free to proceed to a arrest -- which must accommodate the national police body -- especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, such as the case of Sweden and England, where it is believed to be Assange.
The movement has angered Assange lawyers, who issued a letter yesterday claiming that 39-year-old Wikileaks founder was willing to respond by videoconference to the questions of the Swedish authorities.
They also remember that Assange requested and was given permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of his case, compared to mythical Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, the security chief of Stalin.
"This seems to be a hunt, not a legal persecution," the missive reported.
While the world is looking for it - and from Australia your mother defends the innocence of her son-- Assange remains in unknown standing, but not silent.
On Monday, from an indefinite place, an interview was given to the director of the Time magazine through Skype, a conversation in which he requested the resignation of the US Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be shown that it was responsible for ordering US diplomats to spy on the United Nations by violating international treaties that the United States has signed, it should resign," he said.
His opinion was denounced yesterday by the press secretary of the White House, Robert Gibbs, who called the petition "religion and absurd".
"I'm not entirely sure why we should care about the opinion of a guy with a website," CNN said.
Obama himself has been responsible for the anti-terrorist struggle, Russell Travers, to prevent further leaks of documents.
President Barack Obama's attempt to remain important to Assange contrasts with the views that these days proclaim conservative politicians and commentators.
Peter King, the congressman, who from January to preside over the National Security Committee in the Lower Chamber, has asked the Department of State to examine the possibility of including Wikileaks in the list of terrorist organizations "to intervene and pursue their funds and any contribution or assistance to them".
Even further, Tom Flanagan, a Canadian president's advisor Stephen Harper, has had to withdraw after saying that Assange should "be killed".
"Obama should turn it into a target and use an unmanned plane or something."
Who didn't apologize was Mike Huckabee, Baptist minister, Arkansas ex-rapporteur and possible candidate to the presidency.
"Anyone in the Government who has filtered the information is guilty of treason and anything that is not execution would be too kind a punishment," said the Fox chain.
Puigcercos seeks peace in ERC with guides to Carod
The Republican leader will allow the party to vote in secret on its continuity.
Huguet proposes a more plural executive and the end of the assembly system.
Joan Puigcercos seems to have found the recipe to sort out the ingenious internal revolution in the ranks of the ERC, with no north due to the loss of 11 Members and half of the votes.
The president of the party is aware that his resignation is insufficient for the likes of exhilarating Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but he also knows that the influence of that sector is today as dilute as his own mentor and that he can in no way cause the head fractures he had with other extensible currents.
Therefore, the Left leader will try to win the new critics with guides that allow him to blend into the municipal elections.
To begin with, Puigcercos announced yesterday that the more than 200 national councillors of the ERC will be able to speak about their continued secrecy.
Through the paper, and not the hand raised.
If the cardiologists want to drive a certain vote of punishment to the president, they can do so without fear of reprisals.
In fact, the head of the line wants to avoid the image of division as well as the image of submission to his person.
In several interviews, he stated that it would not be considered to be ratified with half the votes, but he added, without specifying percentages, that it would also not be a good result "to Bulgaria".
The next members of Carod demand the president more than to make their mission available to the military, a gesture that is not valid when Puigcercos controls the highest body among congresses.
But when you don't have the majority enough to force resignations, you'll try to agree with the executive a road map from here in May.
To this end, they hope to participate in the preparation of the strategic re-orientation document that the Directorate will put to the vote of the National Council on day 18.
Its intention is to take down Puigcercos instead of promising to advance the convention in the autumn of 2011, something that the dome already gives in fact.
The leader of the ERC acknowledged that the "polyphony" undermines stability and that its goal is to make the organization, once and for all, be able to wash the dirty doorways of the inside.
In this line, it is symptomatic the article that the adviser in functions Josep Huguet signed on his blog.
Considered the ideology of Puigcercós, the head of Innovation said that the leader would be called "the change of various goals".
And he listed five, two of which stand out.
First, "recompensate" the executive to represent at least 90% of the campaign, i.e. to include new faces coming from the sector like Carod.
The second can be the great novelty.
Huguet proposes that the ERC liquidate once the assembly as a mechanism of operation.
Thus, it advocates a reform of the statutes that enables congresses to be held through delegates elected by suffrage.
Ending with the assembly model, an exception in the Spanish system of parties, has been an obsession with the Puigcercos team, which has already fought in this regard in the last two congresses.
In fact, the 2008 conclave left the responsibility of the director to review the assembly at a specific convention of status reform.
This meeting is still pending, as the internal tide of recent years has been reluctant to address the issue.
Now, without critical sectors to the ice, it can be a good time to take it back and try to close it forever.
23 executed in November; 290 for 2010
According to the count of MILENIO State of Mexico, a decrease of four cases was recorded compared to 2010.
During November, 23 persons were executed in the State of Mexico, four less than the previous month according to the contents of MILENIO State of Mexico.
Among the murders are the three women and the finding of a couple of bodies researched in the Valley of Mexico.
In the last month of the year, 390 deaths are reportedly related to organized crime.
Among the cases is the one of a corpse found in San Diego of the Fathers Cuexcontitlán, municipality of Toluca.
The subject had at least three firearms and the grace shot on his head in addition to his feet and hands tied with cable.
The next day, a subject's corpse was found in a suitcase inside the cage of a abandoned vehicle on Mixtecas Street, in the Santa Cruz Acatlan Colonia, of the municipality of Naualpan.
On Thursday morning four, Ejidari found a body with signs of torture and at least three fatal shots in the chest, on the Tenango-Ixtapan quota highway of the Salt, in the plot that crosses the municipality of Villa Guerrero.
A message was found next to the body, allegedly signed by the criminal organization La Familia Michoacana.
A day later in Nezahualcoyotl, a 50-year-old lord, was murdered by eight bullets after leaving his home to start trash collection work.
On November 7, two 30-year-old subjects were hit by a bullet in each head in the San Pedro Xaloxtoc colony, the municipality of Ecatepec.
In Chalco, with the grace shot in the front, a man's body was found on a solitary path of the Colonia El Naranjo and beneath the body they found a shell hit by a 25-caliber firearm.
In Ecatepec, parts of a human body were found in the Black Water Canal of the Playa Golondrina colony.
Emergency bodies carried out a thorough search of the other members of the body, but were not located.
Neighbors of Tepotzotlán warned about the finding of a corpse found in the Colored Peña paradise, which was attached from his hands back and with his head sold.
The man had a wound caused by firearms shot in the neck.
Half a month the execution of two men, who were wrapped in cobies and abandoned in the seat of a vehicle on the streets of the Hacienda Villas fractionation in the municipality of Atizapán in Zaragoza, were also discovered by the victims.
One day later, a cardboard box containing a human head was found in the Valley de los Reyes colony, in the municipality of Los Reyes La Paz.
In a nearby colony it was found wrapped in a black plastic bag the rest of the body with a message signed by El Incorrigible.
On the 17th, enveloped in cobias, two women were found dead in the village of Zoquiapan in the municipality of Ixtapaluca and the next morning the body of a man in Huixquilucan who was wrapped in a yellow cobby with blue, allegedly identified with the name of Mario Ríos according to a message that his executioners left beside him.
In Ixtapaluca, with firearms in the neck, the lifeless body of a woman was found in the village of San Francisco Acuautla.
The woman's skin detected tattoos of the Holy Death, as well as glues with her image.
In the last part of the month, the body of a man was found on board a car in the municipality of Zinacantepec with at least three bullets and a message signed by a criminal group.
Two days later, the corpses of a couple of men with their head bent and a message were found in the community of Pune de Piedra, in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
In front of the bodies there was a message that was probably signed by a criminal organization that said, "This happens to those who don't align themselves."
In Ecatepec, with signs of torture and attachment of feet and hands, two bodies were found inside a taxi abandoned behind the St. Augustine colony's Centre of Justice.
On the last day of the month, the bodies of two men were found in the municipalities of Los Reyes La Paz, and Nezahualcoyotl.
The first of them was decapitated in the colony of Cuchilla Ancón and was wrapped in black plastic bags, attached with tape tape and a message; while the second was tortured and found in a plastic bag in the streets of the Colonia Juárez.
With him, the agents found a cartridge with a message.
Keeps China's objectives of reducing greenhouse gas emissions
The representative of that country in COP16 ensured that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce the carbon footprint and detailed that it supported its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 per cent by 2020.
China maintains its bid to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 per cent by 2020, Su Wei, a representative of that country at COP16.
In its first public appearance at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16), Su Wei assured that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce the carbon footprint and to convert its industry.
In fact, in the last four years, his country has invested $245 million in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
He made it clear, however, that China would not change its objectives, but would continue to work together with the international community in that regard.
He said that the Chinese climate change strategy was divided into four areas: dialogue; capacity building; institution building and support for pilot programmes.
In all these areas, progress has been made, including the adoption last year of a new Energy Act, which sets out the targets for reducing gas emissions, explained.
On the other hand, he stressed that in China, federal authorities have been working in a coordinated manner with states and local authorities to achieve energy saving, efficient energy use and emission reduction targets.
In addition, it has increased, or has already completed several multi-annual plans, both funded by the Chinese government and by Governments from other countries.
For example, he referred to the Energy Efficiency Programme, which had been implemented over the past five years and had received investments from the United Nations (UN), the Government and the private initiative.
A provincial climate change project is also under way, another for the exchange of incandescent focusses by savers and one more mitigation and adaptation, he said.
At the same table, Martin Krol, a scientific adviser to that country's climate change government, assured that China's efforts have been greater than those generally thought.
For example, the emissions per capita of greenhouse gases in China are six tonnes per person, while in the United States it is 100 tonnes; China is responsible for 9 per cent of the historical contribution to pollution.
It has also made unprecedented efforts in the use of energy, as it has increased energy efficiency by 20 per cent over the last five years and planned to do so again by 2020.
Adhesive to the legality expulsion of Espino: César Nava
The national leader of the PAN explained that the former Panist leader was in his right to approach the National Order Commission to claim what was appropriate to his right.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the expulsion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was due to the rule of law and that the former Panist leader was in his right to approach the National Order Commission to claim what was appropriate to his right.
In an interview prior to the protest of Gabino Cué Monteagudo as the governor of the state, he said that in any case Espino's expulsion was a decision taken in the local area.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Sonora Order Commission."
"Mr. Espino has the right to appeal to the National Council's Committee on Orders, where appropriate, so that it is a decision taken in the field of a competent body," he noted.
On the other hand, it clarified that it is not time to think in 2012 and that there has never been an alliance at the negotiating table for the presidential candidacy.
Nava Vázquez said he was convinced that National Action would be strengthened by the internal election of 4 and 5 December, in which he would have to elect his successor.
"This (an alliance in 2012) is a topic that has never been at the negotiating table, at least not for now, was an approach to the local election that was successful and fulfilled the goal," he said.
The Panist leader required that the PAN support 71 years of dialogue, so "we are not afraid of internal competition; we enjoy it and strengthen it," he said.
He said that the council will no doubt be able to choose the best or the best leader required by National Action for the next three years, from where he will deliver the staff "to whom the council determines."
"I have that absolute tranquillity and openness, to any of the five would be proud to hand over the office of the party president."
He predicted that the party's response to the past July 4 elections will be reflected in the next contents, although "it's not yet time to think in 2012."
"For now it is a matter of accompanying Governor Gabino Cué in this task."
In this context, he stressed that the three governments emanating from alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the flag and will be the reason for observation throughout the country, so that "many hopes, longings are placed on them, and I am sure that Gabino will be at the height of expectations".
When asked about PRI's criticisms to President Felipe Calderón for his speech within the four years of his government, César Nava called on the priests to reflect on the sixties of former President Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas of Gortari.
"If the PRI thinks that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Calderón; that they start defending them; that they come out of the castle," he said.
He felt that the head of the Federal Executive could make expressions such as those he made in his speech at the National Audit Office, because there was no doubt or much less censorship in the country.
Promote Obama on Twitter law for undocumented students
"If you agree that adopting the Dream Act is the right thing to do, call on your senators and insulates to approve it is legislation," the president of the United States tweeted in the popular social network.
President Barack Obama today joined the national mobilization in support of the Dream Act, to legalize undocumented students, with a message in his personal account of the social network Twitter.
"If you agree that adopting the Dream Act is the right thing to do, call your senators and install them to approve it is legislation," Obama tweeted.
Its short message remains open a cyber link with a broader document calling on the public to communicate immediately with the senators, as the vote on the legislation is imminent.
"With a vote that is expected soon, now is the time to make your voice listen," he says.
The message was released after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block the vote of any legislation, unless the extension of the Bush tax cuts and government financing were approved.
Such a blockade, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote of the Dream Act and other projects such as ratification of the new START treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Questioned by the Republican blocking of the Dream Act and other projects, President-in-Office Robert Gibbs trusted that once the tax issue was resolved, a timetable for the rest of the projects could be set.
"I think there's a long time..."
"We all agree that we must resolve the tax issue before the end of the year..."
"I think we can make an agreement at some point in that and then we can plan the sequence of the rest," he said.
The leader of the majority democratic Senate, Harry Reid, announced on Tuesday that he would call for a "conclusion vote" for the Dream Act, so the initiative to legalize undocumented students could be voted from Thursday in the Senate, although it is more likely next week.
The Senate version of the Dream Act or the law of the American Dream would legalize some 800 thousand young people who entered the United States before the age of 16, have remained in the country for the last five years and entered a higher education institution or the army.
But the participants require 60 votes to approve the initiative, which requires the competition of a handful of Republicans, at times when the project's partner organizations protagonise an intense calibre to ensure the adoption of the law.
The Democrats, most of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, has said he will vote against, and only a Republican has expressed his support for the law, Richard Lugar of Indiana.
Therefore, the participants of the Dream Act require a number of Republicans to join in the event that other Democrats decide to give the initiative back.
Among the most polite Republicans are the senators of Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as the outgoing Senator George Lemieux of Florida, who completed the mandate of Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who have supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch of Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson of Texas, but have declared that they will not back her on another occasion.
Another Republican who supported John McCain has not defined his position at this time.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the Dream Act faces the greatest obstacles in the Senate.
With literature they put their finger on the hook
The second round of The Pleasures of the Language was a walk where participants made a gala of the story
"That's the sex in the language I understand but... what is expected of me?," asked writer Luisa Valenzuele, invited to open the second round of The Joys of the Language, a cycle that celebrates the literature in Spanish and that this occasion used the subtitle of her question (on another occasion the round table dedicated itself to the sex in the language, explained).
The finger in the lay... "put us in apriet," the Argentine writer greeted the public, mostly young people, who was quoted at the International Book Fair of Guadalajara (FIL) to listen to this round table moderated by Marisol Shultz and where they participated in Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text that she dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio and that Shultz would later define as a great account, with Luisa as the first person as the protagonist who in search of knowing what the "laga" is, goes from a doctor, of which she does not get answers even though it is clues in the same narrative thread.
Of the infected man, he says, "Licence isn't my strength, maybe it's my trap."
Finally, after a frustrating approach to the traumatologist who stole his breath in the middle of the passage, but whoever makes it clear to him that the strike is not a scientific term; it is the psychoanalyst who reveals the mystery: "the strike is the real open, the symbolic is the scarcity".
The protagonist sighed and concluded "from the lay only to know that it is the real open and that it does not exist", but convinced that the pleasures and traps of the language must be very entertaining.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both of them.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also presented a delicious story entitled Elogio of the invention, where the finger in the stick is not named but is discovered at a time.
With penced magical realism, an account of a famous witch, who was playing the same cloud, brought back men who had gone far or repaired the virtues that had lost a virgin, a story that came to speak then America, the great novel that he had not missed since the beginning of his own chroniclers who counted it and quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo as criticizing the excess of the story by the conquerors.
"Cervents who invented us all (the writers) made a joke about the fictitious witnesses who appeared in the stories presented as real, but otherwise they would never have come to tell the story of America with imagination that he missed until the smell."
However, he stressed "it is the crazy and the embusters who best imagine" and is where reality and lies are converging, where it is no longer known that the story belongs to one band or another, where fiction literature reaches its apogeus.
He actually calls it the "cervantine tradition."
"For your inheritance we are what it is reckoned."
In turn, writer Mayra Montero welcomed and praised the variety of interpretations that led to the invitation of the FIL with its round table The finger on the hook.
The Puerto Rican Cuban pointed its way to the great scourge of social violence that was through its country - and shares Latin America - the product of drug trafficking and sale disputes.
"I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs will conclude a tacit commitment that is of course not premedicated," he said, after quoting that the reality of literature is the communication and dimension of the commitment established between authors and readers, and that in a "chemical reaction" of the latter.
The night closed the Spanish poet Luis García Montero, whose speech also emphasized "the finger in the lay of the committed writer of the writer".
He considered that in a world that lives in a hurry, also in intellectual customs and control of the consciences that run in dogmatisms, forgetting "that behind each claim there is a little no and behind each denial there is a little yes."
"To be the owners of our thinking and to be the owners of the reality we have to mat: and mating often means putting your finger on the hook and bothering those people who are much more comfortable thinking about caricature, in black and white, in established and unmatched ideas and also harassing the powers that prefer a black and white world," he said, inviting to recover the meaning of writing.
Roman goes for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano has three final defeats, has had altibations in his career, but has already been able to reach the decisive series on three occasions.
With the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey at the end, there are also two different styles marked by their technicians, who meet each other with a contrast marked by the results.
Rubén Omar Romano has three final defeats, has had altibajos in his career, but has on three occasions already reached the decisive series, although it has so far gone white and that is why this occasion is very special for him.
The Argentine has ended up comforting with the bell of the sub-campeon, has remained a step behind the winners and has played consecutive ends with the same team.
The Holy Strategy reached its first final in 2002 as a coach at the Open Tower, when it carried the Morelia rains with which it fell globally from 4-2 to Toluca; later, in the 2003 Clausura it also reached the decisive duel and also lost it with a global of 3-1 and was precisely before Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna, in the 2010 Bicentenary Tournament, Rubén again suffered a turnout, as his team ended up with 2-2 in front of the dancers after 210 minutes of playing, but in the penaltis tank he took advantage of 3-1 with two opportunities to seal the title for finally three of his players failed since the 11 steps and suffered the 4-3 turning.
Rubén has already lost two finals with the Red Devils and one with Monterrey, his rival in turn, so he does not want to run the same fate, seeks to get rid of the evil and can for the first time celebrate a title, although he says that the institution is the most important for him.
"I want to go out champion, I don't want to break any statistics, that's for a club, that's for an affection I owe me, and therefore the title will come to me, but the previous is the most important," said the Timonel when he was questioned about the numbers he has against playing finals.
Very current has the previous end, of which, he assures, has learned a lot, "the only teaching we can have is that until the silver arbiter can't celebrate the end, we are prepared in the ray, the players too, because the previous time, with two penalties for throwing we were already ready to go out running and I think that's a teaching, until the party is finished we can celebrate".
To know that this series could be defined as criminal shootings, something that does not bother you, because it trusts in its players: "One never seeks to get to the penal ring, one searches to end in regular time, but sometimes there is no one else and must be prepared, in the previous tournament we were prepared, unfortunately made us a bad game of fate, sometimes by the nerves or the anxiety of having the title in our hands, but it left us something for this end that we hope not to reach that instance."
Romano has in his hands to stop being a champion technician and for the first time to prove the glory they give the titles.
EU changes rules for obtaining visas
People should visit the Visa Enquiries Service Centres before their interview in the Consular Section; the cost will be lower and as well as the waiting time.
With effect from 10 January 2011, the procedure for processing a visa will be changed in the United States Embassy and consulates.
With the new procedure, the majority of applicants are required to visit the Visa Enquiries Service Centres (ASC) before their interview in the Consular Section.
The ASC staff will take the applicant's biometric information, which will be reviewed by the Consular Section before the interview.
The new procedure will have certain advantages for the applicants, including:
The total cost of processing the visa will be lower, no longer will be required to make a payment for the appointment, another payment for processing the visa application and more for the mail service to deliver the document.
The vacuum cleaner will only make a single payment that will cover the three services.
The current rate will remain unchanged: $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for visas on request (including visas for temporary workers) and $390 for traders and investors visas.
People who wish to renew their visa will not have to go to an interview with the Consular Officer, but they will only go to the nearest ASC where they will present their documents and take their marks.
Because biometric information will be taken into the ASC, applicants who require a second appointment to be interviewed in the Consular Section will remain at this time less than in the past.
Similarly, those applying for visas at the Consulates in Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and New Laredo will no longer pay the extra fee of $26.

NASA will announce extraterrestrial life find
The U.S. space agency quoted the press as presenting a discovery tomorrow that will impact the search for living beings in space.
The United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) will introduce tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery that could prove the theory that there is an extraterrestrial life.
The find will be presented in a press meeting Thursday morning at 1 p.m. at NASA headquarters in Washington by astrobiology experts, science described as the person responsible for studying the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the Universe.
In quoting the press, NASA assured that it would present "a find that will impact on the search for extraterrestrial life", resulting in speculation by experts from other countries.
The discovery could demonstrate the theory that there are creatures in our pair and in hostile environments that were thought to be uninhabitable, and would put on the table the possibility of becoming intelligent beings like humans if they improve the conditions in which they live.
This seems to be a microbe that was found at the bottom of the Mono Lake in the Yosemite National Park, California, where it lives in an environment that was considered too poisonous for any form of life, as the lake is rich in arsenic.
In some ways, the creature uses arsenic as a way to survive and this capacity increases the possibility that similar life could exist on other planets, which do not have our favorable atmosphere.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it will be shown that "there is another way of life, a second way of life, different from what we know."
The space agency will let you know the true scope of the findings at the press conference on Thursday morning.
The conference will be attended by geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life in Mars; and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists studying Titan (the largest moon of Saturn), from the perspective that his chemistry is similar to that of Earth.
Gesta PRD, PT, Convergence and 'block' Pattern opponent
With reforms to the Organic Law of Congress, the arrival of 'bipartyism' takes place, they complain.
The 60 Legislature was not installed when an opposition bloc emerged at Congress, headed by the PRD, PT, Convergence and Jesús Manuel Patron Montalvo, who declared himself independent, and the four were questioning one thing: the arrival of the 'bipartyism' to the House.
Before initiating the installation session of the 60 Legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, of Convergence; Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of PT; Javier Corvera Quevedo, of the PRD; and patron Montalvo, 'tronaut' against the reform of the Organic Law, since it excluded them.
With this reform, they reiterated, starting with 'bipartyism', because now there will be two people, of equal number of parties, who will control the Congress.
These four MPs, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of the PRD, were the only ones who voted against the Board of Directors, led by Panist Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca, as Vice-President.
Corvera Quevedo described that these institutional reforms constitute the political marginality of the PRI and PAN.
He said that in the coming days they would speak to PAN and PRI representatives to modify the scheme, starting with a political will, and if they did not, then they would be re-evaluated by both parties and the opposition coalition would be over.
"So far it has come (the opposition coalition), that is what I look at, because we are excluded, from any decision, not even have the political difference to consider the opinion of the rest."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez, of Convergence, mentioned that with the PRD, PT and Pattern, there are coincidences and that is why they are forming a plural group.
It cannot be allowed, it has continued, that the Congress, after being a monopolies, is now a "duopoly".
"It is not the spirit of reforming the law that there is eternal bipathism in Congress."
To begin with, this group is starting with 5 legislators, and they are talking to other companions and companions so that they can be more, the Convergence abounded.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of the PT, explained that the Congress now became a 'botin' between two, in allusion to the PAN and PRI.
"Before it was just a game, now they're dividing it between two."
Mr Montalvo, he was asked to respect the personality of the honourable Member, to take his place at the negotiating tables.
"Not by collective agreements, let's leave out 5 that we're probably going to make 9 Members, adolates to the five who see us, separated into different groups, we've decided to unify ourselves to find a place at the negotiating table, that's the point that in the reform that they made they agreed, we're out and we don't agree with that reform."
$200 thousand more for "the supplier"
Pay the City of Mazatlán another check to the questioned owner of an electrical material company.
A check for little more than 200 thousand weights for Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the Town Hall.
With this, the amount paid in this second half to the owner of the electrical material company amounts to 1 million 200 thousand weights.
According to the municipality's transparency page, this last check number 9258447 was issued on 16 November, for the amount of 200 thousand 144.56 pesos, under the concept of "cash settlement for payment".
Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had advanced that he would sell more money from the Commune in favour of this supplier, which was observed by the State's Higher Audit Office for selling at a higher price.
What has not been reported is the total that is still due to it and therefore how many checks are still missing for sending in favour of Camacho Palazuelos.
"Nothing has been bought, you're just paying what you owe, just like the rest of the suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last checks "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: 24 September, two of the 15 October, 19 October, 29 October and the last of the 16 November.
Although the supplier has not yet been published in the Official Journal of the State, as the Act marks it when a company is questioned by the ASE, in order to prevent other Governments from using their services, the Treasurer assured that they had not used their services again.
The previous, after that, on 25 July, Northwest published a review to the Czechs issuing the City Council to its suppliers, in which it was revealed that, from March 2008 to July 9, 2010, in the triennial of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, Camacho Palazuelos paid more than 10 million weights to the municipality through 42 checks.
He also made transactions with Jumapam, where he collected checks for more than 3 million weights.
To serve tourist sites
They complain of the accident of the foreign tourist by bad conditions of the Gloriata Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlán.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in a deepening of the Gloriata Sánchez Taboada, the tourist sector in Mazatlán asked the authorities to give attention to the areas and sites that are in bad shape and that they project a bad image of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Association of Traders of the Dorada Zone, recalled that on different occasions they have reported that the image of destination is taken care of and reverse the evil that tourists find with new activities or routes.
He said that the bad state of the streets and banquets has affected because tourists come walking and see the disorder and take it back to the nearby businesses.
"The politicians don't know what it's like to close one day a company and have no idea of the diner that's lost, or otherwise they won't do the works in time and without the proper planning."
The hoteler José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the tourist drop exposed the lack of prevention and maintenance by the Town Hall.
"The municipality will have to assume its responsibility and prevent it from happening again, how to do so by giving preventive maintenance and not falling into the correction only," he said.
"We are eager to enjoy a clean city, because not only because it is a tourist area must be maintained, but as inhabitants we deserve a clean site to live and the City must change its strategy to keep the city well."
There are other places that also look careless and incomplete, he said, such as the Escudo and the Venadito de Mazatlán.
"Today, for the tourist to come not only depends on the promotion, there must be a good product, a city that has cleaning on its beaches, on its avenues, permanent maintenance in what tourist attractions are," he said.
"It has not been given due attention and this type of fact shows something that is notable to everyone, maintenance is needed."
Raúl Llera Martínez, Deputy Secretary of Tourism Promotion, said it is urgent to rescue tourist sites in Mazatlán, because they are not properly used and project a bad image.
He spoke of a number of places that should be put online with the municipality and be a priority to keep the city daily, clean, orderly and attractive because it is of tourist vocation.
"Happyly Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural sites and sites that will have to order first, clean and put us online to make them attractive so that we can add them to the inventory we have to promote the destination."
Request IP results at Congress
Mr Davalos, President of the CEC, proposed that the Members take on the great responsibility of being an example of a better Sinaloa for the various challenges they face.
A decent and free labour legislation of agreements between parties and the State Executive calls for the business sector of Mazatlán, because there is a convulsive Sinaloa that faces major problems.
Since yesterday, the 60 legislatures, composed of seven political forces, 19 PRI MPs, 13 PAN, three of the New Alliance Party, two of the PRD, one of the PT, one of the Convergence and one of the other of the PVEM, have been established, suming up a total of 40 popular representatives.
Among the expectations of the new members of the State Congress is that they will come to a clean and committed management with society and with the different sectors that require responsible legislative work and that the same patterns of partisanism or patronage are not repeated.
Eduardo Dávalos Zamora, President of the Business Coordinator Council, proposed that the newly appointed 40 state congressional Members take on the great responsibility of being an example of a better Sinaloa for the various challenges facing them.
"We hope that the Members will really exercise their right, free from agreements between the parties, because it is customary that they make arrangements to ensure their own interests and become carnival events of the governors and leaders of the parliamentary factions."
From there he spoke of certifying the commitment to establish the necessary bridges to the Governor in turn.
"We are engaged in doing a decent job, and above all committed to society and the sectors because they were the Synagogues who gave them the vote of confidence in the past elections."
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Three Island Hotel Association, considered that one of the major challenges of the 40 popular representatives was to push and add forces to seek economic growth of the state, because today the economic situation is very complicated.
"The most important thing is to boost economic growth, to generate incentives for investment and infrastructure, and that will in some way encourage the generation of jobs."
With regard to tourist activity, he asked that the new legislators give him the weight he had reviewed within the state budget to strengthen the State Tourism Secretariat.
"I understand that it is the second Secretariat in the state with a smaller budget and it is inconsistent as an important economic activity and as a source of money and investment, and that it is directly involved with the agro industry."
In addition, it is necessary to label resources for detonating tourism projects and to co-operate in providing security to the state and in updating the Alcohol Act that have not been able to resolve in previous legislation.
He is seeking a magic king
Dolls, cars and bicycles, among other toys, are the desire of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family.
For your parents, the next Reyes Day will be difficult to please your illusions, as your home is made up of nothing more and nothing less than 12 people and a key.
However, Adelaide, Isabel, Jesus, José Alfredo, Maria Guadalupe, Isaiah, José Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Melchor, Gaspar and Baltazar will give them the toys and clothes they want so much.
The family lives in a humble home of the Colonia Salvador Allende and lives a day because the father does not have a fixed job.
"Sometimes we see her hard because my husband doesn't have a leg, but we sell mandarin and papa... already in the afternoon I go out with the 'plebes' to sell to the street," said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, mother of the little ones.
Adelaide, 4 years old, wants a doll or a bike, while his 3-year-old sister Isabel would like a Barbie doll.
For his part, 10-year-old José Alfredo longs to have a 'monster' car and for his 8-month-old brother, Jesus, Cayetana suggests cutting clothes for a year.
"He told me (José Alfredo), 'I would like this monster', but I told him 'Let's go see the son', because he was very face-to-face,' he recalled with sadness Cayetana.
For older children, who were in school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
Maria Guadalupe, 11 years old, is size 12; Isaiah, 10 years old, is size 10, while 8 years old Miguel uses size eight.
José Juan, aged 14, lacks tennis, so a couple of sizes five and a half or six would be very helpful to him.
If you want to help make the dream of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family come true you can participate in the campaign Search for a Mago King, giving a toy or cash at the Northwest reception.
Fourteen alleged drug traffickers arrested
On Wednesday, in Estonia, a decade of persecution has been carried out in the context of the dismantling of a Cannabis production and sales network.
Fourteen people have been detained who will face various accusations.
The persecutions have taken place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mainly in the places where drug production was carried out.
"About 750 plants in Cannabis, four kilos of hachis, money and equipment for production have been seized," says Louis-Philippe Ruel, Quebec Security spokesman.
In total, eleven men and three women, including the two alleged network leaders, have been arrested, two men from Sherbrooke.
The detainees had to appear in the Sherbrooke courthouse within hours of their arrest.
They could be faced with cannabis production charges, possession of the object of trafficking, conspiracy and theft of services, among others.
These persecutions have taken place after a long investigation that has lasted about a year.
"It has been the information provided by the public that has enabled us to carry out the arrests," says Mr. Ruel.
In this police operation, about seventy officers from the Quebec Security Esther Research Module, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphrémagog Police Department participated.
You can fight clandestine migration without problems
The draft law of the Conservatives, which, according to the Government, should solve the problem of landfills loaded by clandestine migrants, will certainly face a major opposition, since the three opposition parties have announced Wednesdays that they could not support it.
"I rely primarily on the Charter."
"I meet here with a party that has created the granite that you walk," said liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, surrounded by the MPs after the weekly caucus meeting.
Liberals argue that the draft law in its current form, which would allow to hold up to one year to any person who proceed from a ship identified as the transport of clandestine immigrants, violates the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The leader of the Block of Quebec, Gilles Duceppe, also indicated that he could not support the bill because he pointed to the wrong white.
"We are against it and, it seems, all the parties to the opposition are against the project, so we will see what the Government is doing," said Mr. Duceppe.
The NPD's immigration criticism, Olivia Chow, has rejected the criticisms that indicate that its party is not strong enough with illegal immigrants.
"The neo-democratics agree that measures are being taken against the leaders of clandestine soils, and that is what we intend with another bill, C-35," said Mrs. Chow.
"We do not support the Conservatives' bill because it attacks refugees and incarcerates children for a minimum of one year," said Mrs. Chow.
The Minister of Immigration, Jason Kenney, has accused the parties of the position to play politicians and to ignore the will of Canadians.
"The vast majority of Canadians tell MPs that they don't tolerate this kind of clandestine migration, these criminal operations against Canada and that they treat the country as if it were a fraud."
"They expect Canada to take firm measures," said Minister Kenny.
The Government has not announced a vote of confidence on its bill, which could lead the country to elections as a result of its rejection.
However, a conservative has informed the QMI Agency that the Government was going to request a vote so that every MP who is going to object will be explained later in front of his electors.
The new unit does not achieve unanimity
Despite the announcement of the possible establishment of a permanent unit to combat corruption and collapse by Jean Charest, many observers continue to request the establishment of a public consultation commission on the issue.
The Minister of Public Security, Robert Dutil, supports that this idea has not been raised two days ago: Quebec would have consulted the Department of Investigation in New York since January last year.
The metropolis has a permanent unit against corruption since 1870.
Therefore, Tuesday's announcement has taken more than one by surprise.
It can be said that, during a Permanent Council meeting on Quebec police services held on 29 October, this action was never discussed in spite of the presence of Robert Dutil.
That was enough to enable the party's criticism of the issue of public security, Stéphane Bergeron, to qualify this ad as "a rabbit pulled from the kitchen" and as "a last-time puzzle solution".
Minister Dutil, for his part, has responded to those who fear that political power will have too much influence on the possible future unity.
"You will see the results when we announce it," he simply says.
"We are aware of this problem."
For the president of the CSQ, Rejean Parent, there is nothing that can replace the launch of a public survey.
"The more Mr Charest obstructs the creation of this commission of research, the more people share our opinion, that is, he has something to hide," he explains.
"The only way to have a commission of research is with Jean Charest's resignation," explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and governance of the National School of Public Administration.
To get out of this dead spot, he suggested that Quebec grant a special mandate to the general speaker to conduct a survey on collapse and corruption.
"We must be able to expand the mandate of the general speaker," he concludes.
It also considers that Quebec could grant the intervener the same powers as a Commissioner, thus forcing people to testify.
The creation of a permanent framework is not the only project in the Government of Charest.
Quebec also requests Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code to better adapt to this type of crime.
This request appears to be made by the prosecutor of Operation Marteau, who has informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the case-law is not explicit in this kind of investigation.
The Federal Minister of Public Security, Vic Toews, has confirmed on his part that his counterpart of Justice, Rob Nicholson, is currently inclined to make certain amendments to this issue.
During the Spring 2001 operation related to motorcycle groups, although the Criminal Code had not been adapted, 131 persons were detained.
Subsequently, Ottawa induced the adoption of the Act on gangsterism.
Rivers under extreme surveillance
Several water courses are being monitored closely due to the strong precipitations that have been recorded in several regions of the province since Tuesday.
On Wednesday afternoon, a ground run took place in Shawinigan, Mauritius.
As a preventive measure, they have been evacuated from the houses.
During the night, another ground run took place in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, Lanaudière.
There's been a road crash.
From Tuesday to Wednesday at night, several regions recorded strong precipitation, between 40 and 70 millimeters of rain.
Also, an additional 20 to 40 millimeters are expected from now until Thursday night, depending on the region.
The sectors located north of the river and in the valley of the Outauais were the most affected.
They could receive up to a total of 100 millimeters of rain.
Since these precipitations are added to the snow cover that has already been accumulated in certain sectors, it is feared that a number of rivers will be swept away.
On Wednesday night, the Quebec Civil Security Unit issued alerts to the Oueau and Achigan rivers in Lanaudière.
The rivers of the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentides, and in the Chene, in Lotbinière, have already caused floods in the past and are under surveillance.
In the Lanaudière region, strong precipitations have caused some lakes to land in Sainte-Juliane, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, the strong rains have pulled a provisional bridge.
As a preventive measure, ten residences have been evacuated.
In Outaouais, the landing of certain lakes has led to the closure of several roads, in particular in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pointenfract.
The civilian security unit continues to monitor and monitor the situation, as indicated by Annik Bouchard, the security adviser.
The Quebec Growth Forecast Centre, for its part, issued the Wednesday announcements communicating the strong growth of several rivers, in particular the Maskinongé, the Assomption, the Ouereau, the Achigan, the Batiscan and the Loup.
Partly blame Dupont
The broadcaster from Quebec Stéphane Dupont has suffered a certain reversal to the Canadian Council of Radio Television Standards (CCNR) by controversial statements regarding social assistance and on Haitians, as well as their gross language on the radio.
The CCNR considered that Mr. Dupont and his team of CHOI 98.1 FM had the right to express their opinion, but certain statements contained "inaccurate information on social assistance, inadequately negative representation of Haitians and gross language that should not be used in broadcasts during the day".
The Council has also indicated that the debates on suicide, including the disclosure of the names of two persons who had committed suicide, do not break the broadcasting codes.
The CCNR had received several complaints regarding comments made in broadcasts between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was issued after a complaint from the Common Front of persons receiving social assistance from Quebec.
The group complained that the amounts mentioned in the issue were not correct.
Presenters must communicate reliable data rather than lead to deception.
In connection with suicide, the present Stéphane Dupont had demonstrated that suicide was an act of cobardia.
Most members of the Committee have concluded that the message transmitted was that suicide should not be considered as a solution to the problems of life.
"Most of the Committee's views are that the episodes in the interview with Dupont le Midi have dealt with a delicate issue in an equitable and appropriate manner."
In this regard, therefore, any guilt has been dropped.
The last dispute referred to the statements made after the earthquake in Haiti.
At that time, Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had played a media confrontation that had sparked numerous reactions.
CHOI's presenter stated that he had not made any donations to help the Haitians because he could not know for sure whether the needy were really going to receive the money.
The Committee considers that these comments are not abusive, but that their cumulative effect constitutes an improperly negative representation of the Haitians.
"I've already completed my three-day suspension up there."
"My file has been clean for a year and a half," said the presenter.
In all decisions, the Committee denounces the issue of gross language.
In any case, the CHOI-FM radio chain has collaborated "including more than required".
The consequences will be minimal for the issuer, which must, inter alia, announce the decisions once in the hours of the highest hearing within three days.
A king of kung fu in Montreal
The Algerian-born observatory Nacereddine Zemmal has had an extremely peculiar journey.
The athlete, who highlights in "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), kickboxing and Thai boxing, goes up to the tatamis and rings of the world in search of new challenges.
"I started practicing martial arts such as kung fu and kickboxing 12 years ago in Algeria," explained Zemmal, who lives in the metropolis since 2008 to progress at the professional level.
"In my case, I seek fights everywhere because, for those who do not enjoy the game on the ground involving mixed martial arts, there are few competitions in North America."
The athlete, who works as a security agent and as an employee of the UPS company, has recently given bad news to his rivals, winning two gold medals at the World's amateur Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA), held from 23 to 30 October in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I have won in the categories of kickboxing full contact and Thai box," he explained.
"I am currently preparing to participate in the San Show World Cup in China."
"They will invite the athletes who have finished between the first four positions in the last world championship in each category."
"In 2009, I won the bronze medal in Toronto."
"In 2005, in Vietnam, I ended up in eighth place."
"In 2007, in China, I finished the tournament in fifth place, but I reached the third in Toronto in 2009," he added.
"The interesting thing is I've been making progress in every competition."
"To this step, I'll be the first time this year or next year!"
The "san show" or "sand" is an original discipline from China in which it is allowed to strike with the fists and feet, as well as to throw enemies to the ground.
The clashes are originally held on a platform and, less often, in a ring.
The most famous Pugilist in this kind of struggle is the American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, widely recognized in the world of martial arts.
Although the Nazir Zemmal should only keep a competition in his career, he will undoubtedly go to the great tournament "King of Sanda", the Super Bowl of kung-fu.
"This competition is China's most famous and prestigious," explains the sympathetic boy.
"It's like the equivalent of the Lumpinee Stadium (the largest stadium in Thailand). "
"It's been an incredible experience."
Zemmal won his first battle, in the semifinals of his category (80 kg), but lost in the end.
"The one who won me is a real professional," he says.
"There are four competitors per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"The winners of the semifinals face at the end of their category."
"Then, the champions of each category face to crown a single champion, the king of kung fu."
450 million in uninvited contracts
Hydro-Québec has awarded direct contracts worth $450 million to engineering companies for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
In the centre of this avalanche of more than one hundred contracts is a consortium formed by BPR, Dessau, SM Group and Axor, which has obtained, without an invitation to tender, the most important contract, the project management, for a sum of 295 million.
The consortium, called Energy Management, was created in 2004 following the decision of Hydro-Québec to entrust the private sector with its responsibility to manage this important hydroelectric project of $5 billion.
At the beginning of 2005, the Energy Management consortium received the profitable contract without a prior public tender.
For the Quebec Party, the use of corporate consortia poses a serious ethical problem that threatens to eliminate competition and raise prices.
"This is a new method of collision and elimination of competition."
"That is, people, instead of doing it in secret, now do it openly," said the party MP Sylvain Simard yesterday in a press wheel.
Earlier this morning, Mr. Simard raised the issue in the national Assembly because he said he did not understand how to benefit from the public interest in this way.
The Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, replied in the afternoon, firmly denying that a conflict had occurred with this contract.
"I began to get tired," he protested, arguing that the PQ had acted in a "dishonest" and "with a lack of rigour".
He said "minimum" would be that the PQ apologized.
The Consortium formula is a common practice throughout the world.
Normally, it is an alliance with a temporary limit that allows two or more companies to group their knowledge to respond to an invitation to tender for a complex project.
The Eastmain project presents a high level of complexity, taking into account the magnitude of the works.
The works have already begun and will last until 2012.
In any case, the contract has been awarded without the competition being put in place; it has been negotiated.
In addition, the consortium formula has ceased to be the exception to the standard in Quebec, including for relatively simple projects.
As Le Devoir published last week, the Consortiums' formula in the field of technical advice is being investigated in the Government.
A quick look at Quebec's commercial record allows for more than 200 consortia, some of which seem permanent.
Thus, Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors, such as CIMA+, Genivar, SNC-Lavalin, Roche et Tecsult, and others.
Each combination, and there are dozens of them, leads to a single legal person, that is, Dessau.
With regard to the energy management consortium, Minister Normandeau has pointed out that "the territory of the Bay of James responds to a particular dynamic of work and Hydro-Québec has been responding specifically to it since the 1970s".
The Chief of the Eastmain Project, Real Laporte, of the Baie James Energy Society (SEBJ), has provided an explanation that has highlighted the fact that the project's management contract has been awarded directly.
"If you respond to a bid and there are few participants, your prices will be higher."
"You have two options: you can get in touch with the actors in the sector and tell them: we will negotiate a satisfactory agreement and a good price."
"However, the idea is that what matters is not the price, but the competence of the people," said Mr Laporte.
The contract granted to the Energy Management consortium is part of a long list of contracts of more than $50,000 obtained by the Quebec Party.
The contracts were awarded by Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After the check, Le Devoir has identified 109 technical advice contracts granted between 2002 and March 2010 to companies or their subsidiaries, in particular geotechnical laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin has received 22 contracts, Genivar has won 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without taking into account its participation in Energy Management.
All contracts were negotiated.
In total, they amount to $449,783,344, including the energy management contract of $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard has made it clear that the four companies forming the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "well known to the Liberal Party of Quebec".
Minister Normandeau has made it clear that the PQ is also linked to these companies, that it is "financial" before he states that it is better for its leaders.
Barometer of responsible consumption. The "green" label does not inspire confidence
More ecological, but deeply sceptical.
Consumers only trust sustainable development actors, as well as fair trade marks and environmental certificates to guide their choices.
According to the responsible consumption barometer, whose first results have been published yesterday, the situation is even worse. The consumer is immersed in a media universe by which they pulse messages that defend a more responsible consumption, but regrets the lack of reliable information and considers that the consumer even breaks his commitment.
Even if the consumption of products called "socially responsible" has increased in 2010, the Quebecans seem to give very little credit to those trying to sell them.
Two thirds of them say, in fact, that they do not trust in the environmental commitment of companies or the environmental advertising of them, reveal the measuring tool developed by the Sherbrooke University's responsible Consumer Observatory.
Another conclusion: half of consumers question the reliability of official certificates bearing the products called fair, as well as the credibility of products and brands bearing labels indicating that they are "correspondable", says Barometer.
Similarly, only 14.6 per cent of Quebecans take the political discourses on this issue seriously.
In any case, information on responsible consumption seems essential to stimulate this sector of consumption, currently supported by about one third of the Quebec consumers.
In fact, the gaps and dubious nature of the information make 46% of consumers want this option.
This is the second obstacle identified by the Barometer, after the highest price of these products.
In addition, one third of Quebecans say that they also deny the alleged performance of the organic products or services they are trying to sell.
On the other hand, almost half of consumers changed their habits in 2010 and, in particular, they changed the brand of one or more products to respect their beliefs.
61% have given priority to shopping in its neighborhood shops and have preferred to buy food grown in its region, says Barometer.
More green and responsible (the responsible consumption index has reached 64 points above a maximum of one hundred this year), the Quebec Consumer Homo loves to occupy the position of the recycling king, who is trying to reduce its environmental impact by worrying about the protection of fauna.
However, according to the Barometer, this social consciousness seems to be from the front door (from its car) outside: in 2010, only 28% of Quebecers indicated that they used public transport or shared a car to defend their environmental principles.
In addition, 39.1% of the participants in this wide-ranging behavior survey, which has just completed its first edition, support the use of the bicycle and the pedestrian displacements.
A loan for the State to recover eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, which has been asked to make a financial commitment to the recovery of the eXcentris cinema complex after the Angus Society and the Parallel, agrees to cooperate, but only through a loan.
The Angus Development Society and the Parallele, who were expecting a donation of $7 million from the Ministry of Culture to buy Daniel Langlois again the eXcentris cinema complex in the Boulevard Saint-Laurent and return his true vocation to the cinema, have not obtained what they were asking for.
The Government has agreed to be involved in the matter, but on its own terms.
Instead of the expected donation, the Government of Quebec proposes a loan of which, in fact, would be less than the initial expectations; it could be a viable solution in favourable conditions, at least in the opinion of certain public employees.
Quebec had already rejected a first plan of action last spring and a 12.8 million application, but since then applications have been revised to the low.
The president of the Society for the Development of Cultural Enterprises (SODEC), François Macerola, who led the eXcentris file, sent a proposal and action plan to Minister St-Pierre.
A last report has been sent to you a decade ago.
However, SODEC received a counter-proposal from the cabinet on Tuesday.
The parallel and Angus are due until 31 December to respond to the same.
In any case, it seems that the assumption of a State's donation should be completely rejected.
We recall that the Association of movie owners and film complexes in Quebec opposed a direct investment by the State to support the recovery of eXcentris, arguing that the Ministry of Culture should not finance real estate projects, since it has not done so with other cinemas.
On the other hand, several representatives of the sector claim considerable economic aid.
Daniel Langlois, the owner of it, has carried the author's film charge for ten years in his complex premises, after financing his own construction, which could justify a derogation from the Treasury Council.
The lack of rooms for independent films was patented in Montreal and eXcentris had been able to loyalize her clientele.
Angus and the Parallele, led by Christian Yaccarini, are pushing for their part a private funding campaign, hoping to gather 700,000 dollars to open the way to the acquisition.
Since spring 2009, only one of these rooms, the Parallele, continues to project films in eXcentris.
The goal of future buyers is to reopen the three rooms next February 27th, projecting the beautiful film by Xavier Beauvois "Des men et des gods".
However, Christian Yaccarini has not returned to contact Le Devoir and we do not know what he and his group think of the proposals they have received.
The veil of the completed Canada is lifted...
The new U.S. diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks reveal what the United States considers to be the Canadians' complex with respect to the U.S., but at the same time reflect the feeling of superiority of the latter towards Canada.
U.S. diplomats are surprised that Canadian voters do not think of Canada-United States relations when they go to vote and believe that President Obama's visit has helped the conservative government to get its budget approved in 2009!
The four new communications between the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, which have been made public yesterday, offer rather juicy details than really substantial content.
A cable of 22 September 2008, i.e. during a full federal electoral campaign, reported to what extent the United States did not enter into the issues debated by the political leaders.
This brought great surprise to the US ambassador sent to Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr Wilkins offers some explanations on this situation.
"Perhaps political leaders are conditioned by a complex of practically inherent inferiority to Canadians when dealing with daily domestic issues, rather than leaving such a choice to the United States (as during the 1988 free trade campaign), " he writes.
Thus, it concludes that the United States is "the probable elephant of this choice: omnipresent, but potentially too dangerous to talk about."
The ambassador has even more problems in understanding this "silver silence" because the two countries maintain a strong political and economic relationship.
" logically, I think, the ability of a candidate, a party and, more importantly, the leader of a party to manage these essential relations should be a key factor in which voters should think when voting."
This feeling of importance can also be seen by the cable sent on 22 January 2009 by Terry Breese, a businessman in Ottawa, to prepare President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"His trip will contribute to ensuring the government's survival during the vote of confidence at the beginning of February on the federal budget, through which Canada will record for the first time deficit in the last decade due to a recovery plan of between $30,000 and $40,000 million," wrote Mr. Breese.
No mention is made of the fact that the government had to extend Parliament before Christmas in order to prevent it from being replaced by the coalition or that the opposition parties would be conditional on their survival to the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another January 2008 communication signed by Ambassador Wilkins alerted Washington about the increasingly negative image that broadcasts the dramatic series in the United States CBC.
The ambassador is concerned about the issue of Border, Little Moscow on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which unsatisfied references are made to Maher Arar, to the "No-Fly-List" or even to the kidnappings for the CIA to carry out intensive interrogations.
Another cable says that during his first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked his French counterpart Bernard Kouchner if Europe would be willing to welcome some Guantanamo prisoners.
Mr. Kouchner answered yes, but he depended "on every case".
At the end of the meeting, they wrote "to the Secretary of State for Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
"The Secretary agreed to review the file."
Finally, we can mention that the spirits have been warmed with the WikiLeaks site.
Tom Flanagan, a former very close adviser to Stephen Harper, stated on the CBC radio that the person responsible for this massive escape should be "killed".
In the United States, Mike Huckabee is echoed.
A Global Plan to Renewal of Lighting
Yesterday, the United Nations has proposed in Cancún a plan for the renewal of domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in hundreds of countries to reduce greenhouse gas (GEI) in a quantity that is practically equivalent to one third of the additional decrease that must be made to stabilise the global climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan is reflected in the whole of major concrete projects that the United Nations expects to adopt in Cancún to compensate for the lack of binding reduction commitments in industrialized countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, if the incandescent bombs, which still monopolies between 50 and 70% of the market, were replaced by fluo-compact bombs or, even better, by electroluminescent diodes (DEL or "LED") bombs, much of the 1,800 million tonnes (Gt) of GI emitted on the planet would be avoided to illuminate humans.
Lighting is responsible for 8 per cent of global emissions.
It is equivalent to 70% of the emissions of the planetary automotive park.
In Copenhagen, last year, the major emitters, such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed themselves to voluntary reduction plans that should reduce global GHG emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, a further 5 Gt of that amount should be reduced to stabilise, before 2020, the increase in temperatures in two centigrades to avoid uncontrolled.
In the incandescent pumps, 95% of the energy is released in the form of heat and the rest, that is, 5%, produces light.
In the case of fluocompact pumps, energy expenditure is reduced by 75% and with the new LED pumps, energy consumption is reduced twice more.
Fluocompact pumps last an average of 6,000 to 10,000 hours.
The new LED pumps, such as those launched by the manufacturer Philips this week (a company that has also participated in the UN study), have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than an incandescent bomb, which allows us to make an idea of the savings that can be achieved with the replacement plan that would be applied in hundreds of countries.
These new bombs can also work with restodies and emit very little heat.
Above all, they don't contain any mercury.
Several experts have expressed reservations regarding fluo-compact pumps, since they contain mercury and should be removed as hazardous wastes, which is not always possible in developing countries, unless manufacturers provide instructions.
However, the report indicates that the main source of mercury emissions on the planet are not the fluo-compact pumps, but the thermal coal plants, which emit a large amount of mercury to produce the electricity that melts with the incandescent pumps.
Only in the United States, these centers emit 25,000 tons of mercury per year.
The report details the benefits of this international programme to each country.
For example, Indonesia would thus save billions of dollars a year in electricity and eight million tons of CO2, i.e. the equivalent of 3.5 thermal power plants whose construction would cost 2,500 million.
Costa de Marfil looks forward to the announcement of election results
The UN Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, has requested the immediate publication of the results of the presidential elections in Côte d'Ivoire, as the deadlines have expired.
"The Secretary-General stresses the need for the independent electoral commission to complete its work and announce the provisional results immediately," said a UN chief spokesman.
"Ask all the parties in Côte d'Ivoire and institutions to demonstrate their sense of responsibility and refrain from any initiative until provisional results are announced."
Despite pressure from some foreign governments, the electoral commission has left the deadline for Wednesday to midnight without the results being published, three days since Sunday's election.
About forty minutes before the end of the deadline, the Chair of the IC had commented on the television that the commission "continued to work" to announce the results.
Wednesdays have multiplied in the world the requests that the CEI finally proclaim the name of the winner of the second round between the rising Laurent Gbagbo and his opponent Alassane Ouattara.
However, the Gbagbo band has been in favour of the abolition by the Constitutional Council of the "fraud" votes in the north, in the hands of the former rebellion of the New Forces (UN) since the fall of September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, director of the Marfil President's campaign, said that the intimidation maneuvers of the UN voters in the north of the country had deterred the followers of the outgoing president from going to vote.
Any election could be cancelled if the Constitutional Council accepted the complaints submitted by Gbagbo.
However, Gbagbo's opponents consider that the country's highest court is not neutral, since it is headed by Paul Yao N'Dré, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man from the north who renounces any relationship with the former rebels, has judged the delay in publishing the results and has asked Gbagbo to respect them, but has not gone as far as to claim victory.
His allies said that Gbagbo blocked the publication of the results because he knew that he had lost and that he had filed a complaint before the Constitutional Council after he had prevented the election commission from spreading the results from being illegal.
The second round of the presidency, on Sunday, should have led to the process of reconciling and reconciling a country divided into two years.
The United Nations has warned Wednesday about the political class in Côte d'Ivoire that they might be held responsible for possible acts of violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had completed the first round, on 31 October, with 38 per cent of the votes against 32 per cent of Alaskan Ouattara, which received public support from former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
The unemployment rate remains stable in France in the third quarter
According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), the rate of unemployment in France has remained stable at 9.3 per cent in continental territory (9.7 per cent taking into account the overseas departments), as indicated by the data corrected by the provisional variations (CVE) published on Thursday by the Insee.
The number of stops is 2,631,000 in continental France.
Data from the second quarter have been confirmed, 9.3% of the population active in continental territory and 9.7% with DOMs.
In one year, the unemployment rate has recorded an increase of 0.1 points.
In general, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France did not work in the third quarter, but they want to work, are or are not available in the two weeks to work and seek or not to work.
The situation of young people present in the labour market has continued to worsen, with a new increase in unemployment rate up to 24.2% in continental France (+0.9 points in three months, +0.5 points in one year), 25% including DOMs.
During the third quarter, 637,000 young people between the ages of 15 and 24 were unemployed in the sense of ILO.
For its part, there has been a slight increase in unemployment among older persons, up to 6.4% in continental France (+0.2 points in three months and one year), i.e. 482,000 people over 50 years of age, the figure that rises to 6.6% with DOMs.
Only a stability has been recorded between 25 and 49 years of age, with 8.3% in continental France (-0.1 points in three months, +0.1 points in one year) and 8.8% in all of France.
Since 2006, Insee has not published the monthly salary rate, after a discussion on its calculation methods.
Eurostat, the European Union's statistical agency, continues to do so and announced on Tuesday a 9.8% rate for France (DOM included) in October, after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini investigated and arrested
Alexandre Guérini, 53 years old, director of waste treatment companies and brother of the President-in-Office of the General Council of Bouches-du-Rhône, is being investigated and has been imprisoned in the Luynes prison near Aix-en-Provence, in the context of an investigation into alleged fraudulent public contracts.
Alexandre Guerini is being investigated for abuse of social property, abuse of funds and public property, coverage, active corruption, trafficking in influence and possession of ammunition, as your lawyer indicates.
"Alexandre Guerini will fight and answer all the questions that the magistrate asks him, not ghosts."
"It's easy to track you through a lot of reprehensible acts, another thing is to prove them," his lawyer, Florence Rault, had told the AFP before his client appeared.
Mr. Guerini, the PS leader's brother in the department, Jean-Noël Guerini, has wanted to transfer through his lawyers to the judge, before his appearance, a document to be explained.
On Wednesday night, they began investigating and also imprisoned one of their neighbors, Philippe Rapezzi.
According to your lawyer, Mr Lucien Simon, the only thing your client has done has been to take care of the vegetables you need to manage.
As to the allocation of contracts or the destination of the funds related to their implementation, there is nothing in this regard, according to Letter Simon.
In the context of this file, it is also being investigated since Wednesday, Daniel Pinna, former director-general of the services of the urban agglomeration of Aubagne, for the abuse of funds and complicity, but it has been released conditionally and has been prohibited from meeting with the protagonists of the case.
"My client has been able to explain all the facts that have reproached him."
"The teacher's magistrate has taken into account the explanations and left him free," explained his lawyer, Mr. Yann Arnoux.
On Wednesday night, four other persons were interrogated and released, under judicial control in the case of two of them, as stated by the Deputy Prosecutor Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, Deputy Director-General of the Property of Marseille Provence Metropole (MPM), has been charged with "trafficking of passive influences and corruption".
Two staff members of the Aubagne, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier's group have been questioned by "suspension and abuse of public goods by a person dedicated to public service" and by "complexity in the abuse of public funds", respectively.
Finally, Alexandre Guerini's companion, Jeannie Peretti, is being investigated by "covering the abuse of social goods".
Among those who have faced Mr. Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently imprisoned in a parallel case of fraudulent public contracts affecting Corcega.
Researchers suspect that their companies are serving to whitewash the capital of the great bandidism.
The investigation is being carried out within the framework of several judicial instructions initiated against X in April 2009 following the receipt of anonymous communications, of course fraud in the award of public contracts, in particular in the waste sector.
A close source of research notes that the research focuses particularly on the conditions for the allocation and operation of a dump in La Ciotat, which collects the wastes of Aubagne, as well as other cities of the urban community of Marseille (MPM).
The issue of Clotilde Reiss: Elisha has exaggerated the mediation of Syria
For more than ten months, between July 2009 and May 2010, Clotilde Reiss's fate, the young French researcher arrested in Iran by "spionage", has been in the village of the public in France, has warned diplomacy and has accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
Everything under the eye of the U.S. diplomats.
The American documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal some unknown aspects of this crisis.
They describe how Eliseo has explained his strategy to the Americans until he gives them advice to manage his own "rehenes" crisis in Iran (a small group of walkers).
They show how French officials tried to convince Washington that the release of the French youth did not take place in exchange for the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian detained in France and sought for US justice by trafficking in materials for the Iranian nuclear programme.
Finally, they reveal the harsh reality of how the French presidency tried to manipulate the media to give the idea that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad had played an essential role in the release of Clotilde Reiss.
Actually, he didn't do anything.
A diplomatic telegram drawn up on 12 August 2009 in Paris bears the title "Iran: French comments on how to manage hostage-taking cases".
Eliseo's strategic adviser, François Richier, accompanied by the director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, spoke with US diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain the French method.
They advise Americans to do the following to repatriate their own citizens held to the force in Iran.
"Did noise," they say, "dissolve continually" in the media the words "basic human rights", "innocentness", "indirect release".
Everything to shame the Iranian regime, careful of its image.
"When the Iranians ask you to stop, do it more often."
Because once the attempts to negotiate by discreet channels have been exhausted, "the silence will not solve anything", Iranians are "experts in dilatory maneuvers".
Mr Richier added that the detention of foreigners is "a usual Iranian tactic: taking hostages for political blackmail".
He announces that the release of Clotilde Reiss prison (which will take place on 16 August, the day he will be sheltered in France's embassy) "will require payment to Iranians of a large amount of money" (230,000 euros reward).
Moreover, he points out that Elisha anticipates other hostage crises, a phenomenon that "will increase".
Iranians could "in the near future arrest one another of about 1,800 French citizens living in Iran," he said.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss leaves prison after twelve days, but is locked in Iran.
The following information is disseminated: Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition is requested by the United States for illicit trafficking in sensitive electronic material to Iran, has been released in Paris by a judge ' s decision.
The US Embassy, like many observers, doubt this strange coincidence.
For Washington, which is near the Iranian clandestine network of materials acquisitions for the nuclear programme, the detention of Majid Khakavand is a bad news.
Has France accepted an exchange?
Release Iranian instead of French?
During a new conversation with Kathleen Allegrone on 4 September, François Richier guarantees that it was not.
Eliseo says, not only "it has been greatly surprised by the judge's decision" but has tried to oppose it.
"There have been intense negotiations between the French Presidency and the Minister of Justice" (at the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French Government cannot cancel the decision", he comments.
Mr Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand is still under the "stretch" surveillance of French information services.
The adviser of Eliseo marks a telephone number, knocks it off, and then informs the U.S. diplomat that Iran "is currently in a building in Paris managed by the Iranian embassy".
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, Eliseo does not waste his efforts, he uses communications and "flees" organized in the media to make Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad believe that he plays a "significant" and "influent" role of "mediator".
The Americans observed this activity with certain irony and verified that manipulation brings its fruits, since several press articles transmitted the French official version.
A telegram dated 25 August 2009 mentions "the "blitz" of French officials".
What is due to such "gratitude" to Mr Assad, the embassies are being asked in Paris.
"Despite their praising statements, French officials recognize in private that they only have a vague idea of what the Syrians have really done."
The document then deals with the reasons that led Elisha to stand up to this fiction.
The great communication effort "is aimed at validating Sarkozy's policy of opening to Syria", he said.
A policy launched in 2008 that "in the opinion of many critical voices in France and abroad, it had just become premature and dismembered".
By "exacting the Syrian role", Paris tries to "show Syria the praise that can harvest if it plays a constructive role in the region".
The objective is also "to sow the seed of the dispute between Syria and Iran".
The U.S. embassy knows this from a good source.
On 11 August, François Richier trusted him: "Of course, we don't know whether the Syrians have done anything or not."
"But anyway, if we're grateful."
"At least this should cause confusion among the Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returned to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy receives it in Eliseo.
In a communiqué, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria who have performed an "active paper for the release of our compatriot".
From midnight, Korean youths can't play online
The South Korean Government will adopt a law called "Cenician" that will prevent adolescents from participating in online games after midnight blocking their access, as government officials have indicated.
In December a bill will be submitted to Parliament to request online gaming companies to block access to these games after midnight to young people under 16 years of age, as representatives of the Ministry of Culture and Family have indicated.
"Many children play all night and then it's hard for them to study at school and live a normal life during the day."
"We think this law is necessary to protect your health and your right to sleep," said AFP Jo Rin, Minister of the Bill.
Online games will be available again at six in the morning.
Companies will have a year to prepare for the implementation of the law, precisely.
The government also intends to ask companies to limit the time of day-to-day access to these games when the parents of young people so request, he added.
In addition, it will make available to anyone who requests free computer programs to limit Internet connection time.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries and newspapers regularly report on various facts linked to intensive Internet use.
The country is also the indisputable champion of the world competitions of online games.
In November, South Korea received four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, where it faced 58 other countries.
World 2018-2022: FIFA appoints host countries
In the midst of the storm caused by the suspicions of corruption, the FIFA Executive Committee appoints Thursday to the world Cup organizers of 2018 and 2022, a clear political election where the struggles of influence and lobbying can become the primary focus of technical criteria.
One thing is clear: the 2018 FIFA competition edition will be held in Europe, the traditional foundation of discipline (four candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal and the Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 edition will be much more exotic, given that the International Federation expects to acquire new territories (Qatar, Australia), after a stranger on the African continent in 2010, or to continue its deployment in the United States or in the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities that were part of the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the leaders of the Belgian and Dutch Government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) confirms the economic and political interests that are at stake in a world.
Transactions between lenders, therefore, may last until the last minute.
On the other hand, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy among the candidates.
According to the FIFA assessment report, the English, Hispanic and American nominations (2018) and the US (2022) have better arguments than their competitors.
However, these considerations will not be too heavy for the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the time of the vote.
The Sunday Times, responsible for the revelations that led to the suspension of two members of the EC (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could have thus ruined the opportunities of their country, with one of the football players, who only welcomed the World once, in 1966.
The BBC added wood to the house on Monday by disseminating a documentary that has given evidence to three influential members of the EC, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Enough to disgust FIFA and shame the responsible English people, who have been thrown into intense lobbying in the last few weeks with David Cameron's head.
The Chief of Government expects to re-edit the hit successfully given by his predecessor, Tony Blair, who had achieved the organization of the JJ.OO. 2012 for London in 2005.
Will this intense activity be sufficient to restore England's brightness to the EC?
It is not clear, since the two Spain-Portugal also has numerous strengths thanks to its stadiums, already ready, its experience (Mundial del 82 in Spain, JJ.OO in Barcelona in 1992, Europe Cup in 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
However, the dark economic and financial perspectives of both countries could put their ambitions down.
The possible reprisals against the English and the doubts about the solubility of Spain and Portugal are the only points they can give to Russia, which is converted into a weightier despite the gaps in its candidacy (stations, hotels, transport).
However, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has decided not to move to Zurich and has denounced a "unfaithful competence in the preparation of the vote" in a direct statement to the English press's accusations against EC members.
"They're taking off their dirty traps, trying to compromise them," Putin said.
For 2022, the United States, which has 1994 experience, seems to be the most logical favorites.
First world economic power and headquarters of the main FIFA sponsors, the country seems to benefit Japan and South Korea, which have developed an excellent project separately.
However, these new applications appear to be premature for two countries that organized the championship together in 2002.
Another risk: the granting of the World 2026 to China, which is strongly desired by FIFA, would cause Asia to be unable to do so by 2022.
Along with Qatar, which has submitted its project based on futuristic stages, and Australia, FIFA would continue to expand to new horizons, but both countries are more at risk than they are certain.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could also be damaged by the weakness of TV rights paid (depending on the time difference) by European countries, the backbone of the war for FIFA.
Second mandate: the test
De Gaulle had really doubted.
Mitterrand had given me the impression that he was in doubt.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac had no slightest doubt.
And Nicolas Sarkozy less.
One mandate in Elisha leads to another.
Therefore, the current head of state will again be candidate in 2012.
However, the evidence does not combine well with the mystery that is often associated with the presidential function.
Therefore, one must always appear to be suspicious.
On one side and towards the other.
In 2006, although they did not believe it, Jacques Chirac's friends claimed that he did not reject a third term.
On 15 November, in a serious tone, Nicolas Sarkozy indicated that he would make his decision "at some point in the autumn of 2011".
Therefore, the fact that he deals with the UMP MPs, Tuesday night in Eliseo, the possibility of "two mandates" has led to a certain revision.
Is this about the official announcement of your candidacy?
Not much less.
The President only indicated that the constitutional reform of 2008 limited the number of five-year mandates to two.
He simply broadcasted the facts, not an announcement.
It's not the first time he talks about presidents, with a funny tone, in meetings of this kind.
"In the worst, or better, of the cases, you will still spend seven and a half years with me," he had released in July 2009.
On another occasion, in May 2010: "Don't think I'm going to put on what's next."
His claims of advance no longer draw him closer to the candidacy, nor less.
They raise comments for two reasons.
The acceleration of the race for candidacy in the PS, on the one hand.
But it is not the fact that Ségolène Royal has gone to the lecture which leads Nicolas Sarkozy to make a sincere statement.
Rather than the contrary; the fact that its 2012 candidacy is evident is what leads many PS people to claim that the battle is organised before it is planned.
On the other hand, the bad probes.
For the first time, right voters prefer François Fillon's candidacy to Nicolas Sarkozy's (46% compared to 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and there is no discussion on the subject at the UMP," the Prime Minister has responded immediately and cautiously.
"If you think you can lose, you won't be a candidate," says Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"You'll always think you can win," corrects Alain Juppe, renouncing the evidence.
Euro: The ECB is obliged to maintain its acquisitions of letters from the State
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year should allow to specify the modalities for the exit of the crisis or, at least, to announce the interruption of a large number of non-conventional monetary policy operations that should end at the end of the year.
Because of the European sovereign debt crisis, the Frankfurt Institute of Emissions cannot, of course, be allowed to be so persistent if it does not want to take the risk of worsening a more complicated situation in European bonds markets today.
The political cost would be equally high.
Yesterday, during a press conference, the French Finance Minister, Christine Lagarde, supported the ECB's active role in resolving the debt crisis of European States.
He did not want to say whether he considered that the central bank should do more, increasing, for example, its State bond purchase programme.
"I reserve my opinion for my fellow Europeans."
The evening, in Brussels, during its hearing before the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament, the President of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, did not appear any more eloquent as regards his intentions, indicating only that the state letter purchase programme in the secondary market was "continuing" and that "we will see what we have decided" during the Thursday meeting.
The only thing that remains clear is that the ECB will maintain its main invariable type by 1%, the lowest level of its history since May 2009.
In practice, the acquisition of the Treasury's liabilities by the ECB has doubled over the past week to some EUR 1,350 million.
Moreover, according to the market indiscriminate operators, yesterday I would have purchased Irish and Portuguese titles again.
Overall, the central banks of the Eurosystem have acquired securities for an amount of EUR 67 billion since May 2010.
Among market operators, there is no doubt that they will follow purchases at least (see page 29).
Economists also do not foresee any significant change in direction.
Although lending operations for more than three months have already disappeared from the ECB's arsenal, it still carries out unlimited liquidity allocations to beneficial conditions and with durations ranging from one week to three months.
Economists hope that this device will be extended today for a few months.
"I can't imagine that I'm going to modify your program significantly."
"If not, it would run the risk of creating new tensions in the short term," says Michael Schubert, the economist of the Commerzbank.
"It seems more likely that a progressive output announced during the first quarter of 2011 will be produced," says Norbert Bräms, an economist in Sal.
Oppenheim.
In relation to public debt market interventions, "the ECB should maintain a volume of purchases of these obligations for the market to remain stable," Norbert Brams added.
Taking into account the importance of European banks' exposures to euro area sovereign debt markets, the issuing institution has no choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
"It must compensate any price for the lack of investors in the market and act in such a way as to prevent a marked rise in the performance of the most fragile States," he said yesterday.
Because if the types of interest are put on the cloud, States will have even more problems to reduce or even stabilize their debt.
This is the price to protect the euro.
In Italy, the Berlusconi government takes over the time
After Italy began a worrying week, the situation improved slightly yesterday with the reflection of the types of obligations to 10 years old.
A recovery of the precarious calm.
At the conclusion of a meeting with the Minister of Economic Affairs, the regional presidents have said that they heard Giulio Tremonti calling the situation "indiscriminate" and that a "predictable" week's end was expected, statements subsequently disregarded by the interested party.
In any case, on Tuesday, the difference with the German long-term rates had reached the recorded figure of 210 basic points and the price of cover contracts against the risk of failure (CRQ) had been fired up to 263 points, causing a certain revision in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi commented that, in Spain, the difference with the German types was more than 400 basic points.
But his right arm, Gianni Letta, was "deeply concerned" by "the disturbances in the markets" and a possible contamination from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third economy in the euro area, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that it's like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, economist at the Hudson Institute.
In fact, its problem is the lack of growth and the stagnation of income associated with it, leading to the risk that the State will not be able to meet its financing needs.
The latest forecasts in Brussels have provided a cold water jar for the government.
It is estimated that Italian growth will reach 1.1 per cent in 2011 and 1.4 per cent in 2012, while the budget under consideration in the Senate is based on 1.3 per cent and 2 per cent, respectively.
Under these conditions, according to the European Commission, the public deficit will represent 4.3 per cent of GDP next year (against 3.9 per cent expected by the government) and 3.5 per cent in 2012 (instead of 2.7 per cent).
That is why the voice that new budgetary provisions can be applied after the festivals, for an amount of EUR 7 billion.
"If necessary, new austerity measures should be taken," said Economic Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn.
For the time being, Italy has the support of international institutions.
"The foundations of their economy are in order and their accounts are in good condition, as we have been saying for a long time," says Arrigo Sadun, the Italian administrator of the International Monetary Fund responsible for Italy's IMF.
"There is no immediate, short and long-term problem, because despite its considerable debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, NDLR), the stabilization efforts requested by Italy are lower than those required by other countries," says Pier Carlo Padoan, OECD chief economist.
The problem of political instability remains.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censorship in the Chamber of Deputies, after which elections could be postponed by the end of March.
In such a case, a period of time would be less conducive to decision-making in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans reflect on the strengthening of crisis response mechanisms
Christine Lagarde has already repeated this yesterday during a press conference in Paris: "I think we have already shown Sunday, night and day, that Europeans are clearly solidarity, determined, committed to defending their currency and their monetary area."
Although it was relative, the relaxation recorded yesterday in the types of obligations of European States has driven governments and the ECB.
However, we cannot talk about a principle of normalization yet.
The Standard & Poor's rating agency announced that it could lower Portugal's debt rating, the most frequent white in the current speculations.
"Just as in May, political clarity and transparency are really lacking, which weighs heavily on banking systems," says economists in Exane BNP Paribas.
Especially because "political rhythm is much slower than market rhythm".
Conscious of this hyatoma and the dangers it poses, the European countries are intensifying the debate to strengthen the mechanisms for the exit of the already existing crisis.
Informal consultations between Finance Ministers are most directly affected and, in general, with their G-20 counterparts are on the right track.
And this is also taking into account Eurogroup and Ecofin meetings at the beginning of next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
On the agenda, the type of non-conventional measures to support euro area countries in the market pillar (see above).
With regard to the European Financial Stability Fund (EIF), its Executive Director, Klaus Regling, launched a trip to Singapore on Tuesday to inform investors in the Far East about the new developments in the crisis in Europe.
Although the objective of these visits is not to raise funds, it is certainly to prepare the land.
It is expected that the first EDF securities issues will be realized next month.
Yesterday, a U.S. official representative has entrusted Reuters to the United States agency that would support a potential increase in funds mobilized through an additional IMF direct commitment.
With regard to countries on the front line, Portugal and Spain, they are preparing to adopt structural reforms, in particular with regard to the organization of the labour market.
These reforms are combined with austerity measures with a closer impact.
Lisbon and Madrid want to move on a different path to which Greece and Ireland followed.
Both want to avoid any cost of requesting international assistance before applying their own budgetary corrections and deciding on the structural reforms that they consider essential to increase confidence in a sustainable way.
The capitalist partners of the European funds are finally looking at the options available to speed up the process of standardising public bonds markets.
On 24 November, in Paris, Axel Weber was the first to launch the idea that, if the EUR 750,000 million mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not sufficient, the Union would not hesitate to take the wallet back.
The economists of Barclays Capital, a first-line actor in the European public debt market, believe that an amount of about EUR 100,000 million additional would be sufficient, "preferably" in the form of a direct liquidity injection.
There is an instrument for this: the European financial stabilisation mechanism, which currently has EUR 60,000 million.
A Council which could certainly examine the European capitals in detail.
In particular, market conditions are deteriorating.
Snow and ice: 24 departments in orange alert
The snowflakes continue to cause traffic difficulties, especially on the secondary network in Britain, and may affect various economic activities.
Currently, twenty-four departments are in orange alert due to the risk of snowflakes and ice formation.
Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienna have joined the twenty departments that were already in orange alert, eighteen from Wednesday to Wednesday and two, Dordogne and Gironde, joined the group at night.
According to Metéo France, strong snowfalls affect the north of Gironde and Charentes, although it also snows slightly on the island of France.
Snow layers of between 2 and 5 cm are expected, on time, between 7 and 10 cm, in the departments concerned, and between 1 and 3 cm, or even up to 5 cm, in the Paris region.
The departments affected are Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and those in the regions of Lower Normandy, Isla de France and Lemosín.
The snowflakes are strong enough to cause traffic difficulties and to affect some economic activities, warning Weather France.
In the Côtes d'Armor, access to several departmental roads to heavy vehicles of more than 7.5 tonnes, including the Guingamp-Lanion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac axes, has been banned.
According to the gendarmies, traffic in the secondary network of Britain is complicated, so they recommend that certain TER vehicles should not be driven safely if necessary and that the movement of certain TER vehicles has been prohibited during the day.
During Thursday, school transport in Picardia has been banned.
No specific measure was envisaged on Wednesday night to limit the movement of heavy vehicles.
The prefecture " urges all drivers to drive with the greatest caution on the roads and to adapt their driving to the situation".
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) requested airlines to cancel their flights at Roissy's Paris airport on Thursday and 10 per cent in Orly due to planned snowfalls.
The DGAC recommends that air passengers be contacted with their airline.
In Great Britain, Gatwick Airport, south of London, and Edinburgh, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro del Grand Paris: first financial drafts
Since the debate on the modernisation of transport in the French island has reached its climax, thousands of millions of dollars have been spent.
At least in the debate.
In particular, we are talking about the 23,000 million for the Grand Paris metro which must be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
To start this SGP, the State has announced an allocation of EUR 4 billion.
In the theoretical level, this sum will then allow the SGP to obtain loans in the markets to finance part of its double loop.
Today, at last, we have the first accounts.
The rectification finance law of 2010, considered by the National Assembly Finance Committee this morning, contains the means to find the first part of that money.
There are two ways: the creation of a special equipment tax and the increase in the tax on offices on the island of France.
The first, as we read in article 15 of the text of the bill, is "for the benefit of the public institution Société du Grand Paris".
In addition, it is set out in numbers: "The product of this tax is EUR 117 million per year".
The second is a modification of a tax on offices that already exist "to modernise it, increase its product and target this increase to the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would you get with this method?
Who knows.
The text does not contain any figures.
But it's far from 4,000 million.
"It is necessary that the tax resources be added to the EUR 4 billion of the allocation of funds that will mobilize the State and that they will be granted to the Société du Grand Paris as the project progresses," we can read in the explanatory statement.
The SGP is not surprised by this system.
"From the time the income is created (the two taxes, dnlr), we can cover the studies for three years and then receive the 4,000 million later, as we explained."
"It shall be recorded in the budget and used in accordance with the requirements."
The GSP estimates that it will begin to receive the 4 billion in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This device, in which the promised 4,000 million are not in credit, can trigger a slightly heated parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will be held on 7 December.
Versatile hackers and funguses
The WikiLeaks issue has a double value.
On the one hand, it reveals an apparent scandal, a scandal that only seems to scandal it before the hypocrisy that governs relations between States, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound international changes and foresees a future dominated by the regression.
But let's take a step.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation that each file created by a secret service (independent of the nation to which it belongs) is formed exclusively by press cuts.
The "extraordinary" American revelations about Berlusconi's sexual habits only reflect what has been written in any newspaper for months (except those belonging to Berlusconi) and Khadafi's synistically ridiculous profile takes a long time giving ideas to cabaret artists to create their sketches.
The rule that secret files should only be formed by public knowledge news is essential for the dynamics of secret services, not only in this century.
If you visit a bookstore dedicated to esoteric publications, you will see that each work repeats (about the Grial, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, the Temples or the Rosacruz) exactly what was written in the previous works.
This is not only because the authors of occult texts do not want to do unpublished research (or do not know where to look for news about the non-existent), but because those who dedicate themselves to occultism not only trust what they already know, which confirms what they have already learned.
This is Dan Brown's mechanism of success.
The same applies to secret files.
The informant is perishable, as it is perishable (or has little anxiety) the chief of the secret services (if it could not be, I know, editor of the Liberian) who only considers what he can recognize.
The top secret information about Berlusconi sent by the US Embassy from Rome to the State Department was the same as the newsweek published last week.
Why, then, have the revelations of these records caused such a review?
On the one hand, they only say what every cultivated person already knows, i.e. that the embassies, at least since World War II and since the Heads of State may be called by telephone or pick up the plane to meet for dinner, have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of some limited representation exercises, have become spy centres.
Any viewer who sees research films knows it perfectly, we only appear that we do not know it because of hypocrisy.
In any case, the fact that it is repeated publicly violates the duty of hypocrisy and gives a bad image of American diplomacy.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker can consult the most secret of the world's most powerful country significantly affects the prestige of the Department of State.
The scandal therefore affects both the victims and the "virgues".
But let's get into the true nature of what's happened.
In ancient times, in the time of Orwell, it could be conceived as a big brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
Orwell's prophecy has come true since, by being able to control each movement through the phone, each transaction performed, the hotel visited, the highway taken, the citizen thus became a complete victim of the eyes of power.
But when it turns out, as it happens now, that even the secrets of power secrets cannot escape the control of a hacker, the control relationship ceases to be one-way and it turns round.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen (at least the hacker, elected as the revenger of the citizens) can know all the secrets of power.
How can you endure a power that can no longer keep your own secrets?
It is true, as Georg Simmel said, that a true secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that all knowledge about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is actually an empty secret, without secret, since it comes from the public domain; but to reveal, as WikiLeaks has done, that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets means to remove it all power.
WikiLeaks has done no harm to Sarkozy or Merkel, but yes, and much, to Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this wound caused by such a powerful power?
It is clear that, in the future, States will no longer be able to place any reserved information on the network, since it would be like publishing it on a billboard in the street.
But it is also clear that, with current technologies, confidential conversations cannot be expected by telephone.
Nothing makes it easier to find out if and when a Chief of State has moved on a plane and has been contacted by one of the counterparts.
How can they maintain private and confidential relations in the future?
I know perfectly that, for the time being, my prediction is something of fiction science and, therefore, novelty, but I imagine that government agents are moving discreetly in line with uncontrollable routes, carrying messages that have been learned from memory or, as a matter of fact, hiding some data written in the pockets of their shoes.
This information is then kept in a single copy in locked locks: at the end of the accounts, the Watergate spying attempt was less successful than WikiLeaks.
In the past, I have written that technology is now moving forward as a congratulation, i.e., backward.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communications, the Internet has created a telegraph with cables (telephones).
Video tapes (analogic) had allowed cinema researchers to study a film step-by-step, moving forward and backward, discovering all the secrets of the assembly, while now the CDs (digital) only allow to move forward or backward from chapter in chapter, i.e. to enormous proportions.
With high-speed trains, we can go from Rome to Milan in three hours, while on a plane, with the displacements it carries, we need three and a half hours.
So it's nothing out of the ordinary that politics and communication techniques bring us back to horse cars.
One last comment.
In ancient times, the press tried to understand what was being done in secret in the embassies.
At present, they are the ambassadors who request confidential information to the press.
Climate: French hats in their financing promises
One year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to examine whether the rapidly disengaged (start or early) financing promises made by the developed countries have been respected.
And the French hats have been unveiled.
In the Copenhagen Agreement, developed countries committed to providing $30,000 million between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union committed itself to providing EUR 7,200 million in three years and EUR 1,260 million in France (i.e. EUR 420 million per year).
During the opening of COP16, the EU has placed on the table its best letters to convince its partners that its commitment to fast start funding is true: a report detailing the measures of its Member States, a press wheel, a large complementary event, the distribution of booklets...
Transparency was a valuable result and was truly appreciated: developing countries and civil society would want all developed countries to do the same and at the same level of precision.
The EU announces that it has released EUR 2,200 million in 2010, which puts it in the right path towards meeting its commitment of EUR 7,200 million in 2012.
But if we study the situation in detail, things are more complicated.
According to the Copenhagen Agreement, money must be "new and additional" to ensure that a complementary effort is made, without prejudice to official development aid.
Unfortunately, no agreement has been reached on what "new and additional" means.
When the European Commission proposed harmonisation, some Member States, including France, have blocked the procedure.
Currently, each one chooses the most appropriate reference.
For example, the European Commission has taken as a reference in 2009: international funding is maintained and 150 million are added in three years in terms of funding for start-up.
Other countries have chosen similar references with respect to the year or level of official development aid.
On the contrary, France considers that the funding of "all new projects" in 2010 is "new and additional".
In other words, no reference is made to the expenditure of previous years or to the total level of official development aid.
In particular, the total amount of France's aid to developing countries can remain stable (or even decrease), while it seeks to respect its commitment to "new and additional" funds.
Another crucial element, the division between donations and loans.
Once again, there is no norm and each one chooses the calculation method.
Some, like France, consider that each euro lent is equivalent to a given euro.
Obviously, this is difficult to justify: the effort is not comparable.
Although the use of loans may be justified for certain investments that are profitable (often, projects related to the reduction of emissions based on more efficient technologies), it is appropriate to present a euro that will be recovered as equivalent to a euro that is given... As much, only the cost of the loan for the country that grants the loan should be calculated for its commitments (i.e. the equivalent to a kind of interest).
But France does not find such reasoning useful: "respects" its commitment of EUR 420 million by making a 91.5% loan (EUR 389.8 million) and a 8.5% grant (EUR 36.1 million); consult the EU document to see it for itself.
It is the only country in the Union that uses the loan so often.
Germany uses it in 46 per cent, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia, among other things, respect their commitments with 100% donations.
In other words, when the majority of the European Union brings a euro to fulfil its commitment, France only gives 10 cents and considers that the effort is comparable.
A good trick!
In summary, in its financing for start-up, France commits double abuse: on the one hand, in relation to the actions in time and, on the other, in relation to the real financial effort.
With only EUR 36.1 million spent, it is possible to give the impression that it spends 420 million "new and additional" as promised.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it seems that it is Bercy who has been involved in arbitration) could have a double negative impact both within the EU (why would the other Member States continue to donate when they can just pay?) and in the negotiations, since developing countries are not fools...
The chapter of early financing is a short-term reduction in the overall climate negotiations.
But it could be an extra grain of sand in the vast machinery that is the CNUCC.
Let's hope it's not like that.
Whatever the case, it is essential to learn from this first year of early funding.
First, France could announce a change in its method of calculation for the years 2011 and 2012, with a view to respecting its commitments and in the same way as the other countries of the European Union.
But, especially, France could move forward discussions on gambling bets in relation to long-term financing (another essential chapter currently being debated): we will not get rid of the question of the "additional character" or the method of calculating loans.
France could change its position to become as progressive on this issue as it is on others.
We therefore hope that the new Minister for the Environment, Mrs Koscisko-Morizet, will arrive at Cancún next week.
A surprising announcement on France's fast start and its vision of "additional character" and the use of loans would help to improve the level of international confidence needed to move forward in the negotiations.
Warning on Children's Pesticides
A 10-year-old child ingested 81 different chemical substances in one day, according to a study published on Wednesday by the Association Generations Futures (the former movement for rights and respect for future generations).
The association, which warns that its results "does not have a significant statistical value taking into account the limited number of samples analyzed, but are illustrative of the problem dealt with," acquired in Oise and Paris supermarkets between July and September the foods that are usually consumed by a child of about ten years in four meals and a tempe per day.
These foods taken as a model, which respect the official recommendations (five parts of fresh fruit and vegetables, three milk products and 1.5 litres of water per day), as well as golosins, were examined in laboratories for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The balance of the dish is overwhelming: 81 chemical substances, 42 of which are classified as possible or probable cancers and five substances classified as safe cancers, as well as 37 substances that are likely to act as endocrine disruptors (PEs), according to the studies of various institutions such as the International Cancer Research Centre.
"Although, in practically all cases, the legal limits for each of the chemicals are not exceeded individually, our study clearly shows that the exposure of consumers to potentially carcinogenic pollutants and/or PE is worrying," the association said.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea only contain more than a dozen possible cancer wastes and three considered safe cancers, as well as about a dozen wastes that may harm the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, provided as a sample for the college, contains traces of six chemical substances, including a fungicide prohibited in France.
The same applies to green Jews in Kenya, including in food, in which the study has detected traces of a powerful insecticide banned in the EU.
In addition, the Russian thread, the latrine and even the bread bar or the chick were attached with pesticides and other chemical substances.
In the tap water, the analyses discovered the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
In the dinner, the salmon wheel was the most "nutrient" with 34 chemical residues detected and even the analysis of the plastic dish used to heat the food in the microwave was not completely clean.
The final risk generated by these "contaminants cocktails" for the consumer "probably underestimates", says the study.
The European Alliance for Ecology-Les Verts (EE-LV), for its part, has proposed a moratorium on the use of pesticides to stop "the increase in diseases associated with civilization".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Agency (EASA) indicated the presence of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, of which 76 were in cereals.
