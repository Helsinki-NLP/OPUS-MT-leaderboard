Rubin's defender, Paul Mogilevec, told us about the causes of the failed game of the team.
The Russian casinos suffered four hits, as well as their departures from Cuba.
We're on every game, they're quoting Mogilev's "Experts."
Hence, each of us needs to consider the causes of such a failure.
In advance, they need to prepare and correct the situation.
How?
If we knew, we'd probably fix it.
But first of all, I think we should add to a component like unanimity.
I think we have a problem with that.

On Friday, the official representative of the Office of the Gossovate of the PRC on Taiwan, Ma Xiaoguan said that.

This historic trend cannot be stopped by any force, said Ma Sioguan.
TikTok hides unwanted videos from users
According to TikTok, the number of users worldwide exceeds 500 million, 40% of whom are under 18 years of age.
China / Reuters image
TikTok’s Chinese social network is censored by video-censorship, where the Tianian area, the independence of Tibet, or the banned religious group of Falun Gong, is mentioned by The Guardian.
The documents published indicate that the owner of TikTok (ByteDance company) is promoting the foreign foreign policy objectives of China by means of the annex.
The main part of the violations of China's policies is the "burning of hatred".
In each case, TikTok has unfavourable publications in the context of common rules so that social networking does not look censored.
For example, the ban on the criticism of China's socialist system is under the general prohibition of “criticism or attacks on the policies and social rules of any country, such as the constitutional monarchy, the parliamentary system, etc.”.
The ban on the mention of incidents in the areas of Tianianmen or genocide in Cambodia is under "the history of China or other countries".
The document also lists the names of the 20 prohibited "foreign leaders or public actors", including North Korean leaders Kim Chen Ira, Kim Ir Sen and Kim Chen Iin, Indian policy Mahatmu Gandi, US Presidents Donald Trampa and Barack Obama, Japanese Prime Minister Sindzo Abe, South Korean President Pack Khan Hi, President of Indonesia, Joko Vidodo and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, as set out in the document.
The prohibited material is divided into two categories, as stated in the document.
Publications in the first category are removed by the system administrators and may lead to user locking.
The second category is not too strict: such publications remain on the site, but their distribution is limited by TikTok algorithms.
Representatives of ByteDance told The Guardian that these rules have become obsolete and no longer apply: "We are now using a localized approach to modernization, as well as attracting independent local professionals."
Russian users TikTok has no specific publication restrictions, says the founder of the "Producer Centre" by the Rust Bogdanov.
"Producer Centre" is a Russian media company that officially cooperates with TikTok.
All the advertising materials of bloggers "Producer Centre" are in agreement with the representatives of the Society, but user materials can be placed without agreement, and Bogdanov is passed on.
On the question of whether TikTok can speak about politics or Putina, Bogdanov is responsible and says he has seen such publications.
The founder of our Diggital Roman Zaripov agrees with the Bogdanovs: “The basic rules for TikTok users are listed in the user agreement: no shocking content that discriminates against statements can be explained further”.
But under these rules, any content that does not like moderators can be subtly identified by Zaripov.
Zaripova is another Russian partner TikTok.
According to TikTok, the number of users worldwide exceeds 500 million, 40% of whom are under 18 years of age.
Under the user agreement, TikTok can only be used by persons over 13 years of age.
Neighborhood administrators check their age with artificial intelligence: the nervousness analyzes individuals and determines how many years a person looks, tells Bogdanov.
If nervousness decides that the user is younger, his account can be removed, he adds.
According to RBK, ByteDance opened an office in Moscow in September 2019 in the territory of WeWork.

Russians warned of false bank calls
In Russia, the number of bells from fraud has increased, replacing the telephone number of the bank.
This is reported by the Commersant with reference to the Central Bank.
In the summer of 2019, the regulator communicated to communication operators more than 2.5 thousand numbers from which clients were called to different financial organizations.
In 189 cases, the operators found a sub-number.
A further 218 numbers were blocked and, in 59 cases, there was a restriction on the use of financial services.
The deputy head of the Information Security Department, CB Artem Sichev, said that a large circle of Russian banks had been encountered with the issue.
He explained that operators did not always respond to the Central Bank's warning of false bells, referring to the lack of such a duty in the Communications Act.
In the Open Bank, Rosbanke and Alpha Bank have confirmed information on the increase in the number of fake phone calls with a fake number.
As reported in the Bilaina press, some of the information on the fake calls transmitted by the CB was incorrect: the lists of falling numbers that were actually used by banks to communicate with customers.
Their blocking would lead to failure in the work of the organization.
Artem Sichev said that the Central Bank is planning to establish a bank of fraud numbers to which the liaison operator will address each challenge to check the number.
He explained that it would be necessary to amend legislation in order to establish such a base.

Barcelona blackmails Nimara
The Spanish Barcelona and its former Brazilian footballer, Neimar, are trying to settle a financial dispute that arose after the French attacker "Pari St. German".
The case was almost brought before the court, but the Catalans offered to settle the dispute without interference from Femida.
Otherwise they would deny him the return.
Neimar and his othrum father, who is also a Brazilian agent, took an interesting focus: according to the Barsa agreement, which the game signed in 2016, he had to receive 40 million euros.
However, almost a year later, Forvard appeared in the GSP for a record of 222 million euros.
Nevertheless, he received 22 million from the Catalans and now wants to take the remaining 18.
Little by little, Brazilian lawyers insist that the club should still pay interest for the advance payment.
When Neimar's claims became known in the capital of Catalonia, Barcelona filed a meeting request.
"Sine-Granate" insists that the award was based on the implementation of the entire contract from 2016 to 2022.
Accordingly, the club considers the game to be only a quarter of €40 million and requires the return of the proportion of the first payment.
But the most interesting thing is that, in the summer, Neimar and Bars had almost agreed to return the "false" game to the Catalan lono.
True, the deal was broken, but the hope for the return of the Foreward remains.
And that's what Sports says.Ru, referring to the insaiders, the lawyers of the club told the players that if the issue of financial claims is not settled in a pre-trial manner, it would rule out the possibility of a return to Brazil.
Naaman himself wanted to return so much that he asked for guarantees that the Catholics would buy him back.

But Laar replied that the reform party's goal was to get two seats in the advice of the Bank of Estonia - that, in addition to Jaanus Tamkivi, Andres Suttt would also be in the council.
On Tuesday, 24 September, Riigikogu rejected Laara's proposal to appoint new members of the Bank of Estonia Council.

Mass disorder on three
The Moscow case against the participants in the summer protests is further seen as separate fragments and is losing political momentum.
The evidence of the very fact that "mass disorder" does not support checks, but in the absence of a political decision to put this case down on the brakes, a weak evidence base would not necessarily lead to the removal of the charges.
The breakdown of the case must be encouraging to society, but it will probably leave a lot of frustration for the soldiers whose efforts to fill the case with figures and evidence have been in vain.
On Thursday, 26 September, one of the three remaining indictees under article 212 C.E. (mass disorder) - Alexei Minailo was unexpectedly released from custody without any obligation, and a few hours later and was rehabilitated: the CD withdrew his indictment.
After nearly two months, several professional communities — historians, priests, and literators — immediately followed him.
Thereafter, there were only two accused of mass disorder (formerly 13): Sergey Fomin, transferred 3 September to house arrest, and Samariddin Rajabov, whom the court had previously extended arrest until the end of December (it was also charged with violence against the representative of the government, article 318 C.).

Russia bids to punish police abuse on the Internet
The Ministry of the Interior of Russia has prepared amendments to the Police Act in order to protect custody from the spread of slander and insulting information on the Internet.

The hydrometre centre called true folk monuments
In Russia, there are many popular customs that people are trying to predict the weather.
Unfortunately, not all of them work.
At the Hydrometre Centre, all the notes that are probably working have been checked.
Meteorologists have concluded that only two of them can truly be trusted, true, in a short time.
As Dr. Roman Wilfand, the head of the Russian Hydrometre Centre, said, if the sun is red in the morning, the next day will indeed be burning, as our ancestors have noted.
And if the sky was white, then the rain would come on the next day.
The second working note is based on bird surveillance.
More often than not, if they fly low, it's usually raining.
This is simply because when the humidity of the air is large, the muscles are sucking the wings and the feathers are forced to fall to catch insects, says TAS.
In different continents, there are their peoples' monuments.
Surka Day is a traditional folk holiday in the United States and Canada, celebrated every 2 February.

It may be discharged from one of the ships after the tank has been cleaned.
Many continue to do so.
And it is likely to fall into the ocean," said the Brazilian news portal G1 coordinator of the oil industry union of Pernambuk and Paraiba Rojerio Almeida.

Russians don't want to retire - B. Matvinko
The Speaker of the Council of the Federation, Valentina Matvienko, believes that the Russians do not have enough stocks to fully earn a draft pensioned product in the country.
The practice of increasing pensions by means of personal savings in the world is quite widespread.
Another case is how timely it is for us to introduce it.
"In my view, a large part of the population now has incomes from which they simply have something to spend on increasing pension provision in the future," said B. Matvinko.
The Russians, in the view of the speaker, cannot understand the mechanisms for the formation and assessment of the pension, since “the constant changes in this area have finally affected them”.
That does not mean that I object to the improvement of the pension system governing its legislation.
"Russia is a social State, and we are obliged to do all we can to improve the amount of pensions, social protection of citizens.
But steps in this direction should be smart, responsible, taking into account national realities," said B. Matvinko, RIA News.
The Head of the FSF stressed that if this initiative (the draft law on guaranteed pension product) is to develop, several basic principles, including voluntaryity, tax preferences for citizens and employers and strict guarantees and the responsibility of the State for ensuring the preservation of pension stocks, should be provided.
The Ministry of Finance announced on 6 September that the draft law on guaranteed pension product (PPP) was sent.
Among its main elements is the exclusive voluntary arrangement of citizens to join the stockpiles system, guaranteeing the preservation of long-term pension stocks of citizens by the State, registering the stockpiles of citizens by the central administrator, tax benefits for business and tax charges for citizens.

It was previously reported that Disney and Sony Pictures were unable to reach a income-sharing consensus, which left a filmed Marvel.
Sony has the rights to the cinema.
She gave them to the Marvel film rental, which belongs to Disney.
As a result, Sony received incomes from the movies and Disney from souvenirs and toys.
It was reported that at some point Disney had ceased to be established, and the company wanted to review the agreement.
President Marvel Studios Kevin Faygi said he was in the woods.
Surprising that the journey of Spidery [Man-Pawka] to filmed Marvel will continue.
"All of us at Marvel Studios are very happy to be able to continue working on it.
A man-pook is a figure.
This is a hero whose history affects all generations and audiences around the world," he says in his press release.
At the same time, Faygi reminded me that Sony is creating his own cinematic, built around the Human Pauka.
"So it happened that he was the only superpower given by a hero who appeared in different cinematics.
So while Sony continues to develop his own spaceship, the future can teach unexpected surprises," he said.
Tom Holland, who played the Human Spider in five films, apparently commented on the news, put in his Instagram account a copy of the movie "Wolk with Wall Street", in which hero Leonardo di Caprio yelled "I'm not leaving!"
Information on the contradictions between companies appeared in August.
According to the media, Disney wanted to receive half a box of movies on the Human Pauke, provided that both companies would pay half of the cost of painting production.
But it didn't stop Sony.
The news of the possible withdrawal of a beloved superhero from a cinematic Marvel caused anger among many devoted worshipers.
Details of the new conditions are not yet disclosed.
According to CNBC, Sony refused to comment on the agreement, but said: “We have been working well for the past four years, and our joint desire to continue working together was comparable to the wishes of many fans [Humano-Pauka].
We're glad we can move forward together."
The film "Mistiles: Final", a united Human Pauka, Tora, Halka and other superheroes Marvel, became the most cascading in the history of a world cinematographer, moving from the first place in Avatar.

The Panel of Scientists from Canada representing the University of McGill found that more than ten billion microplastic particles fall into a cup in five minutes.
The packaged drink can also be added to some of the opiums, said the National News expert on food security Elizabeth Tihonov.
According to the agronomist, the consumer cannot obtain reliable information on the composition of the packaged tea - the manufacturer may add ingredients that will not be indicated on the package.
The pills at the end of the season don't come out, so they can be in tea.
"More than that, tea plants are not always included in the packages," Tihonova said.
She said that it would be better to refuse to use such a drink for the benefit of tea for development sold in specialized stores.
In addition, she stressed that the danger of packaged tea was not only in its composition, but also in its method of production that micro-particles heat up to high temperatures, which could lead to the distribution of harmful substances.
"It's best to buy pure green or black tea - at least one add-on in that drink," said the expert.

Regions were invited to share business support secrets
As noted in the "Parliamentary Journal", on 27 September, the Chairman of the Federation's Economic Policy Committee, Andrew Kutepov, sent a letter to the Minister of Economic Development, Max Oreskin, and to the Minister of Finance, Antono Siluanov, proposing that he express his position on the initiative of the federal entities to improve legislation in support of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
Time to establish interregional links
The Committee of the Council of the Federation on Economic Policy has gathered information from the regions on their business development programmes and the legalization of self-employed people, as well as on the outcome of such programmes.
In their letters, the regions told senators about the issues of SME development and submitted proposals to improve existing legislation.
"To date, communication between regions has not been sufficiently established, resulting in the absence of information on regional entrepreneurship development programmes in the country as a whole by the entrepreneurship community in all regions of the Senate," noted Andrey Kutep.
In the annex to the letter addressed to the Government, he presented a set of positive contributions from regions for the legalization of self-relationship and consolidated data from regions with proposals and issues (recorded).
In addition to the profile ministries, consolidated data from the regions are also sent to the heads of regional executive bodies.
The exchange of information on positive jobs in the regions could give a boost to the development of entrepreneurship as a whole.
The first step towards this exchange will be to provide the information available to the Committee on Economic Policy," said the Senator ' s "Parliamentary Journal".
Beneficiary experience
Today, programmes of support for small and medium-sized enterprises have been adopted and successfully implemented in many regions.
For example, in the Voloyear area, the Business Support Centre operates, which, in addition to financial support measures, assists businessmen in the certification of ready-to-production.
In the Ivanov area, a business support system has been developed to implement the principle of a single window through multifunctional centres.
In the region of Krasnodar, agricultural consumption cooperatives provide grants from the land budget.
In the Orlov area, the cluster development centre is operating.
The Amur area under the federal project “Acceleration of Small and Medium-sized Entrepreneurship” provides for the possibility of subsidizing business incubators established on the basis of existing non-State quarking centres through the federal budget.
A number of other regions have adopted special support measures for youth entrepreneurship.
Self-restraint continue to be removed from the shade
In the opinion of the regional authorities, a number of changes to existing legislation should be made to support small and medium-sized businesses more effectively.
For example, the Arkangel area has proposed replacing the term “self-employment” with “business activities”, since it is “the most appropriate content of the public service to promote self-employment of unemployed citizens”.
In the Ivanov area, amendments are needed to expand the list of activities carried out by self-employed citizens, including activities on the division and repair of residential facilities, roofs, physical training activities.
The Bryan area considers it important to strengthen control of the poor dairy producers through the Mercurie veterinary system.
In the Kostromian and Magadan areas, the concept of "social entrepreneurship" and social entrepreneurship are in line with the rule of law.
All proposals from the regions will be taken into account in the preparation of State programmes for small and medium-sized enterprises, and the most important will be the development of specific legislation.
"All proposals from the regions will be taken into account in the preparation of State programmes for support for small and medium-sized enterprises and the most important will be developed in the form of specific legislation," said Andrey Kutepov.
The airline helped passengers avoid neighborhoods with crying children

You can now avoid them if you want to be a neighbor.
Japanese Airlines (JAL) passengers were given the opportunity to take advantage of a new option and avoid unwanted neighborhoods with small children.
The air carrier has launched a function that enables it to track where the children will be seated.
When choosing seats in the living room, passengers will be able to see a picture of the head of the child on the ground that is occupied by children from eight days to two years of age.
Thus, those who do not want to fly near the children because of the possible problems associated with their crying may be present as far away as possible.
Internet users who are using airline services have become exacerbated by innovation.
Some of them thanked the carrier, noting that other airlines should do the same.
One of the Southers complained that he had been traveling from New York to Doha a few weeks ago, and he was sitting next to him right away with three crying children.
Another commenter suggested introducing “reissions only for adults”, expressing his willingness to pay for such a trip.
Many tourists have noted that they are now always trying to choose Japan Airlines for their movements because they do not see any pleasure in flying near a crying child in a closed space.

There are rare archival images and footage from movies on the wagon walls.

The "licensing" provisions in Russia fell 100 times
In the RF Government it was estimated that the supply of agricultural and food to Russia from countries under the Russian food embargo had declined more than 100 times since 2013.
According to a report sent to President Vladimir Putin, 31 thousand tonnes of production from the countries were imported in the first half of 2019 against 3 million 442.2 thousand tonnes for the same period of 2013, reported "Interfax".
The value of the imported product was reduced to $226.5 million from $4 billion,75.5 million, respectively.
It's about supplies of goods that didn't fall under the embargo.
As indicated in the report, the volume of imports prohibited has been offset by increased imports from CIS countries, Africa, South-East Asia, Serbia.
It should be recalled that by the end of August, the Government had extended until 31 December 2020 the period of the rules on the destruction of agricultural, raw and food products which were prohibited from imports into Russia under the anti-dumping measures.
The document on the official legal information portal noted that the time limit for the rules was extended for another year, from 31 December 2019 to 31 December 2020.
The original anti-pollution order applied to US, EU, Australia, Norway and Canada.

The Putin ' s order for the destruction of the illegally imported "licensing" country (products falling under the food embargo imposed by Moscow in response to the anti-Russian sanctions of the West) entered into force in 2015.
In turn, the Government has allowed the destruction of "licensive" food in any legal way.
As the sanctions were maintained in the West, the RF also extended its response.
However, the measure does not apply to products imported by citizens for personal use.
The prohibition does not apply to imports of goods for personal consumption up to 5 kilograms.
However, the President of the Council, President of the RF on Civil Society Development and Human Rights, Michael Fedotov, previously called the destruction of food, which he said would have a negative impact on the education of people.

After that, the Human Rights Council gave a similar recommendation to the Government to President RF.
And Deputy Prime Minister Alexei Gordeev said that destroying food products was wrong, and we should think about how they could be used for appointment by assessing quality.

In Chile, the telescope began to be worth 1 billion euros
This is reported by TACs with reference to the European Southern Observatory (ESO) press service.
As ESO reports, this week the construction of a building dome, where the E-ELT (European Extremely Large Telescope) is to be located, has been officially launched, until the most expensive and ambitious astronomical project.
Its total value, estimated by ESO, will exceed EUR billion.
Most of this money will be spent on equipment and construction of the observatory building.
The most expensive and complex part of the telescope is its record large mirror, with a diameter of about 39 meters.
It will be collected from 798 six-storey segments of 1.4 metres.
It is a huge mirror, as well as two supporting surfaces with a diameter of 4.2 and 3.75 metres, that will help E-ELT get the first detailed photographs of the planet outside the solar system, star in other galaxies, as well as search for Earth's twins.
In addition, scientists are trying to use this observatory to monitor the surroundings of Sgr A*, a supermassive black hole in the centre of the Milky Way.
Although the construction of the dome is only started, mirrors, scientific tools and other components of the observatory have been developed by scientists, engineers and other specialists for three years since the announcement of the first E-ELT construction plans.
The contract for the production of the main mirror, whose total value was about 400 million euros, was received by the German company SCHOTT and by the French company Safran Reosc.
