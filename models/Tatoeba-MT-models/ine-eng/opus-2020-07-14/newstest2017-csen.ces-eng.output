Eighteen-year-old chef found dead in a shop in San Francisco
Eighteen-year-old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was on the steps of local trade this week.
But the victim's brother says he doesn't think he's going to hurt him, and he says, "He finally started to do it."
The body found in Westfield Mall was identified as the 18-year-old resident of San Francisco Frank Galicia in the middle of the morning, a doctor's office was established.
The San Francisco Police Department reported that it was a violent death and investigation.
The victim's brother Louis Galicia for the ABC KGB station in San Francisco said that Frank, who was a former chef in Boston, had his dream job as a chef at the Sons & Daughters restaurant six months ago.
Sons & Daughters said his death was "shocked and destroyed".
"We have a small team that works as a closely connected family. We will miss much," the speaker said.
In this difficult time, our thoughts and concerns belong to Frank's family and friends.
Louis Galicia stated that Frank had first slept in the living room, but that recently “beginning to give him”.
"You found an apartment, you went with a girl," Louis Galicia said to the CEO.
Louis Galicia said he doesn't think he'd want to hurt his younger brother.
He had a kind soul and a big heart.
When he wanted to connect with his family, he always made us food, made us dinner," Louis Galicia said.
He never wanted to take part in any fights.
He was a brother who took things the way they were.
"Even if all the others in the world were bad, he was an unscrupulous diamond that flashed every day," he said.

Czech routes have invested in the modernisation of vehicles over 31 billion.
They have air conditioning and new toilets.
In the last six years, public transport has invested over 31 billion crowns to modernise vehicles.
A third of the vehicles are currently equipped with air conditioning, and about half of the trains have a new system of closed toilets.
However, parts of modernization in individual years with the exception of 2012 are gradually declining.
Over 31 billion crowns have been invested in modernising vehicles over the last six years.
A third of the vehicles are currently equipped with air conditioning, and about half of the trains have a new system of closed toilets.
The money invested was shown to reduce average age by two years for locomotives and separate units and by six years for classic cars.
The greater part of the investment gave the transporter a regional transport in which approximately 60 per cent of the said money was directed, 40 per cent of the company then invested in refurbishing vehicles for long-distance transport.
Average old locomotives and units currently reach 19 years.
Modernized older vehicles, however, are listed in this indicator as completely new.
If the modernisation of vehicles were not calculated, the average age of driving vehicles of the CD would increase by ten years.
Some older ones are on average a personal wagon, whose average age at the time of reading the upgrade is 23 years.
If only age had been taken into account since the date of manufacture, the average age of these vehicles would have been 33.4 years.
Classic components consisting of wagons and locomotives but in recent years from the Czech and the world's railways have gradually been replaced by motor or electric units.
Between 2011 and 2015, the locomotive from 280 to 223 pieces was also reduced by the number of classic cars from 2716 in 2011 to 2132 in the middle of this year.
In particular, the carrier was free of old vehicles equipped with leather seats and doors without the possibility of blocking the opening during the journey.
From January to July, he let the carrier destroy 110 of these vehicles.
For example, from the investments planned for the CSD in the vehicle park in the near future, it is possible to introduce for example a purchase of 50 cars for speed up to 200 kilometres per hour, which the carrier plans to place on the international line Praha - Bratislava - Budapest, or a framework contract for the purchase of electrical units for foreign speed tracks.
The contract includes up to 30 pieces of motor and 20 pieces of electric units.
The offices know about illegal advertising for a quarter of a year, they can't get rid of it.
We're totally powerless, they admit.
For a quarter of a year, the online editor of the newspaper Aktuálno.cz has been watching the story of the billboard in the southern Czech Republic, which now attracts motorists to the visit of Lipna, where it is not only a touristic walk in the tree crowns, but also an Olympic park.
The district manager knows they're standing there, but he says they can't do anything about it.
Similar advertisements are hundreds throughout the country, perhaps thousands.
According to officials, it is a criminal law that makes it impossible to remove illegal mobile billboards immediately.
The need is ahead of a complex red tape.
In the meantime, the company will change its name and the office is short on it.
Or it's enough to move the ad for a few meters and the official process has to start again.
The road and road management said four years ago: the main bus from the Czech Budějovic to Lipno is standing on our ground at the state road advertising billboard.
Not for three months, but the officials did not have to get rid of unauthorized portable constructions with a huge incinerator poster.
It's like nobody cares that they're standing right next to the car, in a 50-foot protective belt, where they can't stand anything for safety.
Road managers say they can't afford a billboard because of the law of the hole.
You need to load him up and take him away.
"This is not the only way we can afford it," says the spokesman of the Directorate of Road and Road Nina Ledvinová, referring to a complex red tape that the removal of the billboard must be preceded by law.
The case of this specific billboard, whose destiny began online journal Currently.cz to monitor in detail in the spring, is not alone and shows a general problem that cannot be made and the authorities can't deal effectively and quickly.
In the south of the Czech Republic alone, the editors counted dozens of similar mobile advertisements placed against the rules directly by or near the vehicle.
So are other countries.
"We have difficulty in getting the company to remove the passengers," confirms the head of the Committee on Transport of the Czech Buddhist Country Office Jiří Klas, whose colleagues have similar stories.
According to Klasa, there is a law that binds officials.
First of all, the owner of the billboard has to make a hard call to get the commercial out of the way.
Although the boss' company is often inconvenient or they know the fine that was already in the past described when the issue began to be more interesting: just mobile stand with the advertisement to move about a few meters and the officials can put the previous call to remove the black fire into the trash.
That's because the office has to determine exactly where the illegal billboard is standing.
"If someone moves her and coordinates suddenly disagree, she looks at it as a new device and we have to call the owners again," explains Jiří Klas.
The new law won't help.
The change could bring in a new law that, since September next year, would ban billboards at the distance and limit them to class I.
Critics point out that the rules for the suppression of illegal and easily transferable advertising will remain the same today.
And the authorities don't care.
Firms can continue to make tens of millions of crowns each year on the lease of illegal areas and no one can.
For example, the billboard lying on Lipno belongs to Commerz Billboard.
Officials are well aware of it: the Chezkobudjejov magistrate is currently running three administrative procedures for the well-established billboards.
The company is threatened by a trisethrian bribe in each order.
This is a number of advertisements that were placed without permission in class I. road safety belt.
The operation has not yet been completed, says Jaroslav Mráz, head of the Czech Buddhist Master's Transport Committee.
An advertisement that is currently interested in.cz, although it is not yet listed among these cases, will soon be added to it with the greatest probability.
According to РSD spokesperson Nina Ledvin's company did not respond to repeated written calls for removal, and the case will be reached at the national table and then probably to the magistrates.
Commerz Billboard is one of those suspicious companies that can't be contacted.
He didn't receive the mail and the official seat on Zižko's office cancelled more than six years ago.
It's not even clear who's behind it.
In the past, the company's mail came to the Yugoslav businessman Anton Fischer, who made a sharp argument with the head of the Czech representative Hyundai.
Fischer, whose Euro Billboard company rents and offers the premises from Comerz Billboard, but in the past he refused any connection.
But this year in the spring, when the RSD began to promote Actually.cz to be interested in advertising on Lipno, Fischer's state officials left a letter for the secret company Commerz Billboard to his pension, where he is allegedly a new company.
Even from this address, however, no one has yet contacted the remote administrators.
It's a dead fight.
Similar silence or opaque changes in seats are not uncommon.
One company we gradually awarded two million crowns a few years ago.
She just changed her name and ICO and it wasn't a solution.
The executioner returned the case, the commercials continued, maybe elsewhere.
We are quite powerless against similar companies and their business practices.
It's like fighting windmills, accepting anonymity as one of the officials.
No one's going to solve the bill in this respect yet.
Currently, several Members have spoken to the problem.
But they haven't done any activity before.
On the contrary, Members who wanted to extend the term for the maintenance of billboards in the main Czech communications appeared.
The government has rejected it.
Billboards are not only for the nationwide, but also for national and general policies very sensitive and some sort of schizophrenia theme.
On the one hand, they know about social demand after their limitations, on the other hand, they themselves need to be included in pre-election campaigns.
I'm not left with the fairly well-informed feeling that if something doesn't work, it's necessary to change laws.
This year, farmers grow fewer crops, but more reptiles and worms, they estimate statistics.
According to the estimates of the Czech Statistical Office, the crop harvest will be 6,7 per cent lower this year than last year.
However, this year's average is greater than the last five and ten years.
On the other hand, it will be higher by 3.9 per cent and by 2.5 per cent.
The crop harvest will be 6.7 percent lower this year than last year.
Farmers raise 7.2 million tons of cereals.
It follows from the estimate published by the Czech Statistical Office on 15 July.
The initial estimate was more pessimistic a month ago and predicted a decade's decline against the laurels.
The last crop harvest, however, was too moderate.
The average of this year is greater than the average in the last five and ten years.
On the contrary, this year, it's gonna be higher than the blades and the blades.
Frogs grow by 3.9 percent more than a year ago, when they reached a peak of 1.256 million tonnes.
This year's crop may be 2.5 percent higher than last year's.
The expected decrease in production of cereals is due to the reduction of the hectare yield by 3,7 per cent to 5,71 tonnes per hectare, and the reduction of the arable land.
This year's farmers had three percent less fields.
Grains, which is the most important crop for the Czech Republic, fall by 3.3 per cent less this year, according to the estimate.
The farmers put it on more fields.
However, a lower hectare yield will be signed at a reduction of 6.04 tonnes.
The drop in five statistics is expected in barley barley, which is most commonly used for beer production.
The decrease in yield is 15.2 per cent, but also a lower hectare yield.
On the other hand, the blades of the zodiac are generated by 6.3 percent more.
You'll also grow the grain harvest.
Statistics are estimated to be 1,305 million tonnes, which is more against the Czech Republic.
The axis areas were thus extended by 7.3 per cent.
Hectares yield, however, will be 3.2 percent lower than last year.
This year's tail yield exceeds the 10-year average by 13.3 percent, while it is planted on the surface of a third larger than ten years ago.
In the last four years, there's also a poppy field.
This year, the farmers sent it to 35.543 hectares.
By 2008, when the cat grew to 70,000 hectares in the Czech Republic, the field was half.
Thanks to the expansion of the light areas, this year's climb will be richer.
It will rise against the front by 2.5 per cent to 27,423 tonnes.
Hectares yield will be 6.1 percent lower.
The breakup police accused two men of being assaulted by knives and swords, and the court sent them to jail.
The police accused two attackers who attacked a man with a knife and a knife for twenty-five years on Tuesday in the center of Olomouce.
"Although the attacker was trying to escape, he was subjected to severe and severe injuries, which he requested treatment at the hospital and other treatments," police spokesman Marie Štrbáková said.
Both of the apparent perpetrators were detained immediately after the attack.
The complainant filed a motion for a court to take them into custody and the court brought him out on Friday.
Both men are threatened by three to ten years in prison.
The police accused two detainees of assaulting a man in the center of Olomouce with knives and knives.
The attackers caused him a severe and severe injury, and the man ended up in the hospital.
The attack was preceded by an incident between the two groups of people who became a police officer on Tuesday on the right of the afternoon in the class of Freedom.
The Pachtales ended up in custody, informing the Olomopolitan spokesman Marie Štrbáková.
A joint drive between the two families took place in the garden area in front of the Trattoria bar in the immediate vicinity of the center of Olomouce.
After an aggressive verbal attack, two attackers were attacked by a 15 - year - old man with knives and cats.
Although the assaulted man was trying to escape, he was subjected to severe and severe injuries requested by the hospital and other treatments, the police spokesperson said.
At the rally, which aroused a great deal of attention in the city center and for which it had to involve several police guards and guards, it was a family dispute.
The criminals of a man from Slovakia and a man from Olomouca for the past four decades have been accused of trying to seriously harm health and excitement.
The complainant filed a motion for a court to take them into custody and brought him out on Friday, added the speaker.
The cat was used in the center of Olomouce during a collective battle also five years ago, it happened only a few dozen meters away, before the Varna discotheque in Riegro Street.
The police then said that a group of about ten foreigners with weapons attacked the company's guests who stood in front of the entrance.
According to the police, they had knives, holes, and cats in their hands.
The court then punished two attackers with conditional punishment.
Abandoned and empty houses in the center of Prague.
You'll be surprised, maybe you walk around them every day.
One of the most striking examples of an unused and empty house is the extensive construction of the former IPB seat in the middle of the Senovážnaj square.
She was supposed to work as a hotel a long time ago.
It's all right.
Is there a need to build new and new apartments and offices in the metropolis?
And what about the use of existing, often architecturally valuable and protected?
Directly in the centre of Prague in the immediate vicinity of Václav Square are several crime houses, which, despite their location, size and often memory protection, are only empty and empty.
We chose real estate in the center using the project Prazdnédomy.cz, which maps the long-term empty property in the territory of Czech Republic.
Houses are usually victims of financial problems of their owners, unbiased relations between companies or belong to a state that does not know or wants to escape them.
There are more empty houses in Czech Republic than homeless people.
If the owners pay special taxes to them, they want an initiative

Clinton's wife made $10.6 million last year.
Trump refuses to publish his tax confession.
Hillary Clinton and her husband, President Bill Clinton, made $10.6 million last year.
More than a million dollars spent on Clinton's charity.
Most of Clinton's revenues -- over six million dollars -- are due to their expressions.
Trump refuses to publish his tax confession.
The candidate for US Democrats to President Hillary Clinton published his tax statements on Friday, increasing the pressure on his Republican rival Donald Trump to do the same.
Hillary Clinton and her husband, President Bill Clinton, made $10.6 million last year, announced the AP.
Most of Clinton's revenues - over six million dollars - are due to their performance, mostly from the period before April 2015, when Clinton started his campaign before the elections.
The tax report showed that Clinton's husband had a federal income tax of 34.2 per cent last year and then a national and local income tax of 9 per cent.
So they paid 43.2 percent of the income.
But Trump has a similar problem, so far he has not decided to publish the tax receipt.
It's possible that Donald Trump doesn't pay any taxes at all, he wrote Clinton on the Twitter a few minutes after publishing his confession.
Clinton repeatedly returns to the secrets of Trump's revenues, including to raise doubts about whether her opponent is really as rich as he claims, the AP has introduced.
The trumpet's name is estimated to be billions of dollars.
A lower benefit would damage the reputation of a Republican candidate as a successful businessman.
Senator Tim Kaine, who has been running for the vice president's post in tandem with the former first lady, today published a report on his tax deductions in the last ten years.
Together with his wife, Anne Holton, they gave 7.5 percent of their contributions to charity and spent 25.6 percent of their expenses last year.
In Nigeria, there was a turning point again.
The Islamists of Boko Haram defended the subsequent expectation and killed the doctors.
In Nigeria, cases of child abuse have reappeared.
In the northeastern part of the country, the government expressed extraordinary anticipation because two children who were infected here were protected from this disease.
Vaccines were transported there by helicopters.
In the affected area, Islamic terrorists from Boko Haram, who defended and even killed their father.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the virus was undetected there.
In the north-east of Nigeria, the extraordinary expectation of children against the rebel began because there were two children who were infected with this disease.
In Africa, the virus was last diagnosed two years ago in Somalia.
The Nigerian government announced that in the state of Borno there will be millions of children and four million others in the surrounding countries.
The Nigerian military helicopters on Friday, according to AP, quickly delivered vaccines against child defenses to the affected northeastern part of the country, where Islamic terrorists from Boko Haram are involved.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has stated that the virus has been undetected for many years.
The extremists of Boko Haram, in the past, defended the waiters and even killed the doctors.
Their attacks also made it impossible for doctors to reach areas where children were found with a gun on Thursday.
The two wounded battalions came from refugees from the part of Nigeria, newly freed from Boko Haram.
The head of the WHO section responsible for the release of the armor Michel Zaffran, BBC station, said that waiting in Nigeria will start next week.
In the state of Borno, the Islamic radical group Boko Haram has been active for a long time.
The area was made available by international organizations and governments until the beginning of this year, when Boko Haram managed to weaken in this part of the country in a fundamental way.
The Nigerian Health Minister Isaac Adewole admitted that the new defence cases were a major disappointment for the country, as Nigeria wanted to declare next year that the defence had been expelled.
WHO noted that it is possible that although the disease has not appeared for two years, it has spread among children.
The children will now be buried under the age of five.
In 2012, Nigeria belonged to half of all the world's defence cases.
While in 1988 it was still in 125 countries, it is now only in three areas - Afghanistan and Pakistan and in northern Nigeria.
The Pope met with former prostitutes in Rome.
He listened to the stories of fallen women.
Pope František met with twenty former prostitutes who, thanks to the police, escaped from the gang of passports.
The Pope listened to their difficult life stories and urged them to look to the future with confidence.
František wanted to draw attention to this meeting to trade with people and to call for a stronger fight against them.
Pope František met with twenty former prostitutes in Rome, who were freed from the power of a gang of passports.
The head of the Catholic Church listened for more than an hour to the moving stories of fallen women and then urged them to look to the future with confidence, leading the Vatican speaker.
Among the former prostitutes that František visited were six women from Romania, four from Albania, seven from Nigeria and one from Tunisia, Italy and Ukraine.
Their average age is about 30.
According to the Vatican, all of them were exposed to cruel physical violence during forced prostitution.
The visitor wanted František to focus his attention on dealing with people and to call for a stronger fight against him, he introduced the pope’s spokesman.
František often points to the fate of people on the edge of society.
For example, on Thursday, he had lunch with Syrian refugees who arrived in the Vatican this year in April and in June due to his personal invitation.
France's gonna hit the Georgians' productions.
But without the help of the Muslims, it won't work.
France is fighting radical Islam to help Muslims themselves.
The government of Prime Minister Manuel Valles is also preparing for key changes in the functioning of mixed and spiritual education.
Since last December, we have closed 20 mixtures and prayed.
And the others will follow, the Minister has announced inside.
In the country, it works over a hundred Georgians.
"If Muslims do not help the state in fighting those who violate public freedom, it will be increasingly difficult for France to guarantee this recognition of freedom," Prime Minister Manuel Valls said.
In particular, it is intended to ensure that only the imams who were educated in France are shown in the mixes and prayers.
At the same time, he wants to stop funding mixing abroad.
Currently, about 20 percent of the money comes from foreigners to build new blends, most from Morocco, Algeria and the Persian Gulf.
And that's why they get to mix with teachers who can spread radicalism in France.
"Our country must show that Islam is compatible with democracy," the Prime Minister added.
The key that will ensure his achievement of these goals will be the new Islamic hope of France.
It should function as a bridge between secular state and the Muslim minority.
No more foreign money.
In the country, the French Constitution for Islam, which was established by the then Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin in 2005.
It has already had a contribution to the transparency of the financial flows between the mixes and the countries that finance their construction.
But the institutions soon struck up internal conflicts and rivalry.
"It's a total failure," Valls said recently.
On the French political scene, after the attack on Charlie Hebdo in January 2015, the debate on a new institution that will replace the non-functional reward has been heated.
All the other terrorist attacks in France have accelerated, which on behalf of the Islamic State have led to the radicalisation of Islamists.
The French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve has recently heard that a new hope will arise in October this year.
It will have two main tasks - to ensure funding to mix from domestic sources and also to watch the images.
In the meantime, it is not clear where money will be taken not only to build new mixes, but also various educational centres.
But he's considering a few suggestions.
One of them is a special fee or food tax.
In practice, the sellers would pay for food, for certification.
Part of this money would then travel to the cash supply.
The contribution of 10 to 20 euros (270 to 540 kroner) could then be paid by French passengers who are issuing to Mecca.
Every year they go there for a traditional trip to Saudi Arabia about 30,000.
And not just that.
According to the Prime Minister, only teachers who have gone through special education programmes at French universities should be involved in the mix in the future.
This should ensure that the preaching is in line with democracy.
We'll close the radical mix.
At the same time, the French government is fighting radicals.
And the others will follow, the Minister has recently announced inside.
In France, there is no place for those who declare hatred and respect certain principles of our country, such as equality between women and men.
In the country, it is estimated that about 2,500 people will mix and pray.
It is estimated that about 120 of them are under the influence of radical Islam.
Since 2012, the authorities have made up about 80 imams and several more decades have considered it.
Not all think that the government's steps can have a significant impact on radicalism.
Those who want to radicalize will do the same.
In fact, in the mix, young people are radicalizing on the Internet, Severine Labatová, an expert from the National Research Centre.
Driver Kelemen lost in the 1st round of a sprint with the star Baugue.
The procedure for the osmiffinal must be carried out by the Czech cyclist in the correct driving.
The leading cyclist Pavel Kelemen in the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, after the process of qualifying the sprint among the top eighteen, lost in the 1st round of the battle with the French great Grégor Baugum, the silver defender of the past games in London.
The procedure for the osmiffinal must be killed in the correct driving.
At the start of the royal discipline on the road, 27 riders were built and the best Czech driver at the moment signed up for the 14th best time.
Two hundred and ninety-nine seconds from the summer start.
In the main extraction phase, he was waiting for him in the qualifications of the fifth Baugé, who already has the bronze from Rio in the team sprint.
Kelemen finally touched on the experienced French, but he took a look at the procedure.
With a great performance, Jason Kenny was a gold miner.

Young Doctors Press: Want a fresh wind in the field
Representatives of young doctors met to approve new steps in their dispute about a new contract.
The Board of Young Doctors (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) must seek the full advice to support further sectoral actions from early September.
JDC says the ministers were unable to resolve the issues concerning the contract.
Young doctors and medical students in July voted against the rejection of the agreement agreed with BMA.
58% of its members who took part in the elections were rejected.
In a letter to members published on Thursday night on Twitter, President JDC Ellen McCourt said that the government remained "and still calm" on the issues, which led to the rejection of the contract.
She said: “In this light, the JDC voting authority has decided to reject the proposed new treaty completely and to request a new formal procedure in all matters.”
In response to the government's silence today, the JDC Executive Board formally requested a special meeting of the BMA Council with a view to approving the current programme of restricted sectoral actions from the beginning of September.
The dispute led the young doctor to a six-year report, including the first general reports in the history of NHS.
The leader of young doctors in BMA, Dr. Johann Malavana, resigned after the decision to reject the agreed terms of the contract recommended by BMA.
BMA members at the pre-voting meetings with 54 000 young doctors and medical students said the agreement was good and should be adopted.
After the vote, the Minister of Health said the contract would mean a burden for doctors in England.
Russia and Turkey: Alliances of "insolvency"?
It was a gesture that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and announce the formal end of eight months of long verbal wars and economic sanctions.
But while Vladimir Putin welcomed the Turkish side of the hall of the palace in Petrohrada, I felt that Ankara wanted more after this reconciliation.
There was a hand-to-hand, yeah.
But Putin didn't laugh, and he hardly saw the heat from him, and that's according to his measured standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke about his "beloved friend" to Mr Putin - five times, as one of the reports states.
I didn't count it.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their level before the crisis, but would be even better.
The next day, one of the local newspapers wrote that Erdogan was acting like nothing bad ever happened.
According to his enthusiasm, there was an exact opposite.
But the persistent cold he was looking for from Putin showed that the Russian leader did not forget anything.
The real cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening statement: Shooting the Russian warplane Tureck on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction back then was annoying.
Putin gave wounds to himself and Ankara accused Moscow of killing a knife in the back.
The humiliation was the greater that came from an alleged friend.
It will be difficult, perhaps even impossible, to rebuild true trust.
The Russian public opinion has also changed since December.
The state-controlled media led a massive global campaign against Ankara a month later.
Suddenly it seemed as if the Turks could do anything.
It was more serious to blame the top state representatives for the fact that Erdogan's own family benefited from illegal oil trade in parts of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He strongly opposed this.
But in Petrohrada there's an official message that it's time to move on.
The end of this meeting was only because Putin had an apology requested by President Erdogan.
Russia could have declared a victory as well.
For Ankara, the benefits of the statement are quite clear.
In the first row, Erdogan was almost out of power last month during an unscrupulous storm and therefore he needs all his friends.
The repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey are also visible to him.
There's also an economic motive.
Russian sanctions have had a serious impact - especially the cancellation of charter flights, which will transport several million Russian tourists on the Turkish coast each year.
This figure was reduced by almost 90 %.
As far as Russia is concerned, tour operators and charter companies will breathe here when the flight renewal occurs.
They earn on the Mediterranean travel in the end of the season.
Even this week, the state television promised cheaper fruit and vegetables when the imports of agricultural products from Turkey were again allowed.
"Tourists there, the tomatoes back here," said the report in the Vedemosta newspaper.
The visit, however, had another political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry at what it considers to be a failure to react to a coup attempt.
In addition, the long-term non-violence of long-term EU accession talks and Putin's accession, which is driven by the fact that the ice can be used and cut off from Turkey to the West.
The Russian leader certainly won the bonus points when Ankara asked her for help from the elected authorities after attempting to set the ground.
You must understand that for Moscow, which is deeply rooted in fear of changing the regime, it is given.
So the summit in this impasse, the Russian and Turkish Supreme Palace has made it possible to predict what one analyst described me as the "uncooperative alliance": how they connect the forces of two countries that feel rejected and used by the West.
Nevertheless, despite public reconciliation, there are fundamental differences between these two countries.
The first is Syria, where Moscow recently became a peacekeeper, but where Russia and Turkey stand on the opposite sides.
It should be said that after almost three-hour opening talks, both presidents at the press conference stated that they had not mentioned this question.
The Turkish President answered the question of differences between them, while Putin decided to raise these differences.
There is no clear agreement on the basis of which both States could find a common word on the question of Syria.
But after months of open hostility - and given the risk of a complete disaster when a member of NATO shot the Russian war aircraft - it is certainly better that both leaders speak again.
Royal Bank of Scotland disappears for customers outside Scotland
According to the Executive Director of the Bank, the RBS is to be pressed into the role of the back office.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be lost for customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS label was connected to the global ambitions of the banks.
She got rid of them when she almost disappeared eight years ago and had to be bought out of debt.
At that time, the strategic brands used RBS to protect other brands of consumer finance.
It was followed by millions of pounds spent on sponsoring international sports, from the six Nations football championship after Winbled's Andy Marraye.
Now, however, it has been decided that it is better to get more out of national brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used by Scottish customers, but it won't run any new business.
All references to RBS in England and Wales, with the exception of the center and the stock coding at the stock exchange, will be changed to NatWest.
For customers in the Republic of Ireland and in Northern Ireland, the Ulster Bank brand is already used.
There are other, smaller brands for private banking that will get more ahead - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank.
During the trip to customers and employees in the Inverness-shire, McEwan answered us questions from Ross McEwan.
The BBC Scotland Station said: "The RBS seal will cease to be our investment mark and the mark for which our employees work, because we are now becoming a bank of the brand much more."
Because the bank itself became a global brand, it became a global brand and RBS.
Now I'm saying that we don't have global aspirations anymore, we're doing our homework.
Each of these marks will mean something completely different in their own communities and our workers will work under these marks.
RBS has already stated that it will not continue in its sponsorship of the Six Nations Championship, has developed a profile of individual sports sponsorship brands.
"It is a good time for us to move to a brand bank, because the basic question (which we are asking) is how to focus on becoming a better bank for customers?" the Executive Director said.
Three years ago, it would be very cynical if we said that we would become a great bank for customers and the brands.
But together with how we focused on customer needs, not on our own, I think there's a lot of change.
We can recollect these marks, I think it's the right time.
Frankie Dettori in Newmarket on the horse Predilection led to the goal 3000.
Dettori unscrews champagne after the double victory in Newmarket brought him 3000 wins
Jack Frankie Dettori won 3,000 in Britain on Friday in New Market.
Tohoto the miller achieved his second victory at night on his local track - on the horse Predilection trained by John Gosden.
Ital is a six - year - old hooker who has achieved such a result in equal returns.
His predecessors are Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddy and Willie Carson.
A three-way champion of Dettori, who had previously won the Ghaiyar horse, said, "It's strange."
I'm very touched because my family is here, too.
I'm so glad it happened in New Market, because I was stuck here 30 years ago.
It's not a great action, it's not a Royal Ascot - it's a Friday night on the ground with 20,000 people.
I'm so excited and I'm very grateful.
Dettori collects congratulations when he brings Predilection after the victory
Two jockeys of this mill arrived in the obstacles - a champion of the Richard Johnson jockey and a 20-person champion of the Sir Anthony McCoy pension, who, during his career, brought more than 4,300 winners to the goal.
Lester Piggott, 9th winner Derby, 4 493 winners in career
Frankie is one of the best jocks of modern times, and it is not surprising that he has reached a milestone that only a few riders have reached before him.
He's stylish and strong, but it's just his tactical Fistron that distinguishes him from the other riders in the weight.
He is a fantastic ambassador of achievements, his enthusiasm and charisma attracted fans to this sport for many years.
A few weeks ago, I told Frankie in Epsom that if he didn't just go out on weekends and big hits, he'd already have 6,000 winners!
However, the truth is that Frankie was driving a winner in the United Kingdom for most of his 30-year career, and that's really something.
He's a living person, which is good for British sports, but more importantly, he's an incredible cook.
Frankie Dettori celebrated his success with his official summer shock
From the summer finish after the summer break - Frankie Dettori has been the ambassador of the British equivalent achievers for two decades.
It was like a ride on the mountain road.
The unacceptable number of winners of the major races, including his famous "major sevens" in Ascot. He also survived the plane crash and had a ban on the launch of drugs.
Three years ago, when he returned after a six-month ban, he showed incredible inner strength and returned to all doubters in the best form.
And maybe it won't be the last thing - Detectives already said he'd like to continue in the race for at least 50 years.
Russian President Putin missed President Sergei Ivanov's office
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly missed Sergei Ivanov on Friday from the post of President's Office Chief.
Ivanov was one of Putin's closest associates for many years.
Ivanov was appointed a special representative of the environment and transport for thirty years.
The Kremlin statement states that Putin "has released Ivanov from his services to the head of the Russian presidential office," but there was no reason.
We will take his place Anton Vajno, who has been Ivanov's representative since 2012.
Four and a half years of military service was a diplomat.
He was born in the capital of Estonia Tallinn in 1972, promoted at the prestigious State Institute of International Relations in Moscow (MGIMO) and worked at the embassy in Tokyo.
On the website (in Russian) it is stated that he was later the head of the presidential protocol and the president's office.
When he called Putin, he said, "Thank you for your trust."
I believe that the most important role of administration is to support your head of state activities in terms of the draft laws and to the extent that your directives are respected.
On Friday, the Russian television station stated that Ivanov had asked her to be released from the post and recommended that he replace her with the military.
Can you believe the smiles?
This step has completely mystified Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has been one of the closest collaborators of Vladimir Putin for a long time and as well as Putin has been working for KGB.
As head of the president's office, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, who broadcasts state television, both men declared that the president's office's office is on its own request.
But the smiles to the camera have convinced only a few people - especially now, right before the parliamentary elections.
So this is the result of a struggle over power?
Nobody knows that yet.
But the official claim that the man who once considered himself as a possible president wants to lead the environmental policy of Russia at once met with great mistrust.
The Kremlu pages quote Putin, in which Ivanov states: “It is true that in 2012 I asked you to give me this very demanding post, even to say the problem post, for four years.
Looks like I've been the head of the president's office for four years and eight months.
Ivanov was arrested in December 2011.
Formerly, the Deputy Prime Minister of the Government and Minister of Defence were in office.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, previously worked for the State Security Committee (KGB).
At the end of the 1990s, when Putin served the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his representative.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov one of his five closest associates.
It was even speculated that Ivanov could become the successor of Putin in front of the State after his second election period because the third period would be anti-constitutional for Putin.
This post, however, was taken over by another close associate of Putin Dmitrij Medvedev.
Putin went back to the presidential office just three and a half years later as prime minister.
Thomas Gibson, the star of the Crimean Thoughts series, was released after the director threatened.
Gibson, last month in Los Angeles, was involved in the physical exchange of views on the scene.
The TV stations ABC and CBS, which produce the series, were notified in a joint declaration of their release.
Gibson, who played special agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized on Thursday before announcing his release.
There have been creative differences on the scene and accidents.
I'm sorry it happened," he said in a statement.
According to TV stations ABC and CBS, details are about how Gibson's status disappears from the series, which follows the stories of the FBI's team, later on.
The 14-year-old actor, who celebrated the main role in the Dharma and Greg site, has been in the series since the first series in 2005.
"I love the thought of criminals, and over the past twelve years I have given them hearts and souls," Gibson stated in his statement on Friday.
I was hoping I'd be in it by the end, but it's not gonna be possible right now.
I would still like to express my thanks to the authors, the producers, the actors, our wonderful team and especially the great fans in which this show could have hoped.
Returning the series to the 12th series is expected on September 28th.
In Banff, they secretly landed in the fish garden
A man from Banff town asked for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden.
Kevin Bain is believed that 75 pieces of fish can be sandstorms that left the water.
Bain, who lives about 500 meters from the sea, published a short film of his findings on Periscope's channel in the belief that someone could help him to explain how about 5 centimeters of fish were caught in his garden.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connects with Fife
The project for 1.35 billion pounds is to be completed by May 2017
Engineers connected the north and Queensferry Crossing and viaduct - the bridge now connects with Fife.
So it's the first of four closures between the "breaths" that are now almost finished around each of the three bridges.
The part of the bridge from Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It has 10,000 tons of iron and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 centimeters.
The project is to be completed by May 2017.
Economic Secretary Keith Brown visited the building today and was among the first to come from the fortress on the bridge.
He said: “This is the historic moment and the symbolic moment of Queensferry Crossing.
On this project, we all witness how construction engineers, in effect, used more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel to construct this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive dimensions and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the surface of the bridge was a delicate operation that required extraordinary accuracy.
In its place there is now a total of more than 79 % of the total area of the bridge, concrete for the last part of the surface is now flowing out in Rosyth, so the entire area is ready to rise to the bridge.
Michael Martin, project leader of Fort Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: “The first conclusion in building each bridge is always an important milestone.
On this wonderful project, this conclusion represents the corner of the earthly structure.
After installing the last part of the road surface and its connection to the expanding North Tower surface, we had to close the last space on the north side - direction to the fortress.
This is what we've done by extending the Northern Approaching Viaduct 700 millimetres south.
This was massive and at the same time very delicate.
Massive because the viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs about 6,000 tonnes and it was necessary to pull it with a climb of about 3 %.
The delicate because the tolerances he worked with were very small - only a few millimeters each direction.
Everything went very well.
Saved in Moelfre Bay: Three men are "happy that they are alive"
Three men are "happy that they are alive" after the water from their fishing ship at England's.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue ship station issued a crash on Friday at 13:20 British summer time after the crew saw the incident in the Moelfre bay.
All three men tried to swim safely, while their ships continued unfavourably.
"We saw their boat crossing in their vicinity and the worst hit us," said the rescue ship Cormorant Moelfre Vince Jones.
"A strong wind drove her away from them before we left," he added.
Two men saved a local fishing ship, a third man at the age of 60 was found without a rescue vest exhausted as they hold battles.
All were transferred on board the coastal rescue ship and transported back to the rescue ship station
Jones said: “Three men thrown into the water are happy that they are alive and without any injury.
The ship's engine had a chain for emergency shutdown, but something happened to its disconnection from the person who was driving the boat when it came back.
Someone snooped over those bitches holding their hands.
The judge refuses to deal with the case because of Tlucho's wife.
Petr Tluchoř is one of the three Members who, according to their complaint, were to be received from the Prime Minister of the Netherlands and his then head of the office of Janny Nagy's political traffic, which means a lucrative post for political intervention.
In 2012, the tax package was approved.
Schnajdr, Fuksa and Tulchoř made it possible by their resignations.
And then they showed up at the affected positions in state companies.
And that's why they also faced charges suspicion and ended up in custody for a month.
According to the court, however, the damages were almost 2 million crowns.
The fat man now appears in the case as a witness, after the Supreme Court's intervention.
His wife works in the fruit market building and solves civil disputes.
However, Judge Helena King wants to be careful (refer to criminal law matters - no. red.) and to overcome possible objections.
The case is likely to bring anxiety to another Prague courthouse.
The Queen, however, has released the guilt of Jan Non-Time, before Nagy's.
It was a alleged abuse of military intelligence to monitor the first wife of Prime Minister Nekze Radky.
In this case, Tluchoř did not appear.
According to Lawyer Jaroslav Ortman, however, it is an unremarkable reaction.
I think that impartiality cannot be ruled out in such a way as to be ruled out if the witnesses have a wife or relatives in court.
I'm afraid then it wouldn't be a trial at all, marked for the journal.
"I think it's crazy," he added.
In the case of political traffic, Roman Boček is also accused, former official.
According to his lawyer, Peter Toman, however, a possible objection would have a chance of success.
The District Court for Prague 1 discussed the 13th June complaint by some head of the cabinet of Prime Minister Petra Nekzeme Janny Nagyov (now Not Time) and other accused of abuse of military intelligence.
There's an Untimely husband coming to court on the video.
The fat guy was supposed to make up for Peroutkova's judgments.
For example, the wife of the exhibition was to judge President Milos Zeman's judgments on democratic pre-war journalist Ferdinand Peroutkovi.
The earth declared him to be sympathetic to Adolf Hitler.
One of the schoolgirls is already dead!
The girl must have died in the plane crash of the joint forces.
In Syria, along with her two elderly friends, she took off last February from Gatwick London Airport.
The British Ministry was not commenting on her death inside.
The young Londonmen who fled home were secretly transferred to Syria across the Turkish border by police.
Shamima Begumová, Amira Abase, and Kadiza Sultanaová were determined by the media for their other former London school partner Bethnal Green Academy.
Last year, the case caused a huge wave of attention and tension in relations between Britain and Turkey.
British security figures estimate that some 600 British Muslims, including about 50 young women and girls, have travelled to Syria.
A number of them joined radicals from IS and other groups.
Those who return home represent a terrorist threat to Britain.
Dream work for hundreds of dollars.
Great payload, you don't even need a high school.
That's how it looks at the first look of the mother's job.
And often for the other one.
The benefit is not only extremely high pay in Czech terms (in Prague you will earn up to 180,000 CZK), but also extreme benefits.
The reason is a huge lack of IT specialists.
There are thousands of specialists missing.
According to estimates, nearly 20,000 IT specialists are missing in Czech Republic.
Among the most sought after are programmers, developers, network engineers and application specialists, according to staff agencies.
Candidates can choose between a few job offers.
The candidates do not support the job position, but the job position of the candidates, comments Jitka Souková, marketing manager Grafton Recruitment.
High school isn't necessary.
However, higher education is not necessary for mothers.
Higher education means a good foundation and is an overall indicator of the intelligence and education of the candidate, but it does not often have much of the knowledge of development.
Developers must constantly learn new things, which once studied high school does not make up, says Petr Kubačka, Director Monster Career CZ.
He's making the most of it in Prague.
The mothers are moving high above the Republic's average.
For the most money they'll come to Prague and Brno, there's no such hitpare in the regions anymore.
"The conditions in Brno are comparable to those in Prague," Kubačka confirms.
The technical directors will reach the highest cost.
In Prague and Brno, they can reach 120 000 - 180 000 CZK.
In other regions, the pay is lower, but not less than 80,000 CZK.
Demands are also IT project managers.
They can make 60,000 to 100,000 CZK when they arrive.
The fight's about a graduate.
While in some professions graduates often have to go straight to the office of employment, they don't pay for it.
If companies are to transfer and transfer an expert from another company, they are happy to apply for a graduate.
They can raise him according to their own.
They won't be able to speak without language.
The knowledge of a foreign language varies in every profession, but there is a need for a minimum of decent English.
The knowledge of at least one foreign language is necessary in some IT positions.
On the other hand, we meet with a number of cases where companies are looking for a highly educated and experienced person in particular and are satisfied with only the average English knowledge.
However, if, for example, a support worker has more than one language, it is interesting for his employer because he can serve more customers from different countries, the director of Kubačka will deliver.
Yoó in Google, there's paradise.
It's easy to envy the most frequent employees in Google.
Of course, it is a time of work for them, a possibility of working from home or a variety of short-term relationships, not just for mothers.
"The newly sealed fathers are provided with a four-week vacation in addition to the child's birth," says Martina Joneková, Google Talker.
Hiccuping also involves health care for employees and family, feeding, transport, training, wellness or massage directly at the workplace.
Whoever wants to be educated has a green one and doesn't matter what new ones want to learn.
But the benefits don't end.
Such a full refrigerator for free is also definitely not to be protected.
A healthy meal (in some places and breakfast and dinner) is available on site every day.
In addition, there are so-called microwaves in all the offices, where people always find healthy candles, they see a speaker.
And so that nothing could be spared, as it does, it's put in a box that employees can take home tonight.
And the reason for these incredulous benefits in Czech?
Create a creative and motivating environment!
"For Google, it is not important for employees to sit in the office eight hours a day, but the results of initiatives or projects, movement or development, ideas and innovative solutions," he adds.
The United Nations strongly criticised Bulgaria for the criminalization of refugees.
Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein, UN Commissioner for Human Rights, accused Bulgaria on Thursday that it systematically violates the human rights of refugees.
The Bulgarian government's official strategy "is causing serious concern about Bulgaria's failure to respect international law," said Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussain in a statement.
He pointed out that "it is particularly disturbing to be a witness to how important and influential public personalities express public support for criminal armed fighters who hunt for fugitives at the border between Bulgaria and Turkey".
"One of the most serious problems is that almost all people who move into Bulgarian territory are automatically arrested," Zeid stressed.
What is worse is that they are often imprisoned and imprisoned for a year or longer, if they try to leave the country.
Their attempts to leave the country are criminalized despite the fact that everyone is entitled under international law to leave any country, including their own.
Bulgaria held 14,000 migrants this year, last year for the same period of 21,000.
Pokémon Go - Honba for health and happiness that will be paid
It's fascinating to watch the world change.
During the last decade, many people complain that teenagers and children no longer play outside and prefer spending free time in front of the screens.
Pokémon Go takes people out of the convention and leads them to activity.
The time spent in front of the screen was originally on television, later on video games and more on smart phones.
It's great to see that technology and activities outside are not mutually exclusive.
Of course, I'm talking about fashion, which is Pokémon Go, application based on settings that first appeared in video games at the end of the 90s (there was a drawing series, playing cards and more).
As with many cultural phenomena, there has been a decline in interest in the beginning of July in the United States, Australia and New Zealand.
The introduction in other countries was then postponed because of the potential interest that led to server overload.
Pokémon Go has gained over several days more users than Tinder and almost as many users as he has Twitter.
How does it work?
In short, players on the smart phone go out looking for Pokémons who follow them using GPS, and when they find them, they can "draw" them (through a screenshot on the phone) or "get them".
Manie praised the generation who played the game at a younger age and took her out of the seat and women out looking for Pokémony.
In the United States, this game has resulted in a marked increase in the number of steps that “average” people make every day.
The Cardiogram application for smart hours from Apple, which follows 35,000 users, recently told Washington Post that during the two days since the launch of the game, the number of people who have been practicing every day for 30 minutes has jumped from 45 to 53 percent.
The company has no information about who is playing Pokémon Go - sees only rough data about level exercises.
Many public campaigns trying to "find 30", "get up from the couch" and "were active every day" have fallen to an unusual ground, because most public health-oriented messages are boring and targeted by people who do not look good.
However, the importance of exercise must not be underestimated.
Those who practice regularly reduce the risk of cancer or depression.
Physical activity is involved in weight control, high blood pressure, sugars and a long list of benefits that we cannot bring in here.
But the beauty of the game Pokémon Go is that people go out and do something they enjoy.
So you cover three health pills - movement, fresh air and sun peppers, and fun.
Some people get new friends even when they're in a hurry.
As it is, of course, there will be such boring patrons who are looking for any excuse to complain.
And yes, someone can enter the door.
What about, like?
It's a break.
At their time applications for smart phones, like Fitbit, were able to monitor our activity, but they didn't give us any reason to do anything like this game.
The news will be watched and the interest will start to drop at a certain time.
However, thanks to the success of Pokémons, there will be other games that will combine applications and virtual reality with activity in the real world and help a number of people to lose their activity, health and better form.

Simone Biles won gold in a multi-faceted female gymnastics
Forget the pressure.
Forget the excitement.
Simone Biles is immune to all this.
Dynamic to jump.
- No, no, no, no.
They've all been in trouble with the simple ones.
Excellent in everything.
And now finally an Olympic champion.
Nineteen-year-old American gymnast went on Thursday straight after the title in the competition and the others in the full line won the Olympic reflectors.
The overall result of 62,198 clearly confirmed its impact on silver medalist and member of the "final five" team, Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Ali Mustafin.
Simone Bilesová (USA) on Thursday during the event at the club in the finals of several players in the sports gymnasium at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Brazil's Rio de Janeiro.
Biles became the fourth American in a series that won the most, and the fifth in total when she confirmed her reputation as the best gymnast of her generation and perhaps even the best.
When her overall final assessment was on the table and her long journey to this point ended, she found herself face-to-face.
This success ranks it in the same league of single athletes of their time as Michael Phelps, who added a new dimension to their sport:
Billes' sport has dominated for the last three years, won 15 medals in world championships - including 10 gold. Its fascinating compositions are mixed ambitions and precision and the 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton marked her as "the best gymnast she'd ever seen."
The final test was waiting for her in Brazil, not between Billes and the rest of the race, but between her own and the burden of too great expectations.
Anything other than returning home to your family in Spring, Texas, with a hand full of gold medals, would be perceived as a disappointment.
Simone Bilesová (USA), left, and Aly Raisman are engaged in winning gold and silver medals in the finals of the women's multiplicity in the 2016 Summer Olympics in Brazil's Rio de Janeiro on Thursday.
The first Biles won Tuesday, when she was as a janitor at the famous national team coordinator Martha Karolyi.
Billes says that during her long journey to the summit, she never looked forward, but she's not quite the truth.
Part of her composition in the simples - the one that contains her typical triple salt with a double twist - is inserted into Latin music that would just go home to the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio.
It's not a coincidence.
The girl was adopted by her cousins as battalions and her talent was discovered by the mother of coach Aimee Boorman on her way to the gym where Boorman was trained and where he was getting the power.
The competition has not won in the win since 2013 - this is the result of a victory that can continue as long as Biles will want.
Even though Mustafin took a short lead on the two islands, it was just an illusion.
Kladina and the simple - where Biles defends the world championship - wait.
She got back to the front with 15,433 points behind the deck - and ended with 15,933 points in the loose.
Raisman had a fine hug when waiting for the final score - only formality - and around three-and-a-half red, white and blue shadows, Billes' tears were revealed when the wish that she had ever written in her diary was fulfilled.
Raisman's performance was so little payback for the Olympics four years ago, when she shared a third score with Mustafin, then she was bronzed for the sum of the three best compositions.
This time, a twelve-year-old team captain, who the Americans call "baby", was quite ahead.
After her simple sending a gift of air kisses, she was defeated by a return that seemed to be inexhaustible at times.
For Biles's contribution, this nine-year-old athlete posted on Twitter this week, where he became a complete hit, a whole new issue:
Police: Three victims in the case of a serial killer shot at listening to music in the car
According to police reports published on Thursday, two women and a girl died at the age of 12 during the most serious attack of the decade, in the case of the first serial killer in Phoenix. They were shot while sitting in the car, talking and listening to music.
The authorities announced that Angela Rochelle Linerová, Stefanie R. Ellisová and the daughter of Ellis Maleah were shot in a car parked on the road.
The report indicates that the armed man stood on the side of the co-pilot and fired eight wounds from the handgun.
According to the police, there is no triple murder robbery because the attacker did not take the money, nor the amount of $2,900 that one of the adult victims had.
Speaking police in Phoenix, Sergeant Jonathan Howard said the investigators were investigating whether the shooting had any connection with any of the previous four attacks.
In two predominantly Spanish quarters, a total of nine attacks occurred during four months, with seven people killed and two others injured.
"This is happening in the villa district in front of the houses," Howard said earlier this month for the KHO branch of the CBS station.
The police believe that the suspect used several cars, including Nissan's nest at the end of the 90s, black BMW at the end of the 90s and white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to explain what evidence they had led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and were carried out by the same killer.
Ellis (33) was transferred to the hospital where she later suffered her injury.
Linear (31) and the daughter of Ellis Maleah died on site.
A police witness said it was not unusual for women to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
The authorities also published a police report on the shooting, which became an empty delivery only half an hour before a triple murder, and the police believe that its source was this serial killer.
The investigators found the belts and made the bullet from the rest of the ball in the seat and from the under the hoods of the engine.
The mother of a six-year-old child with a microcephalus: "His condition is improving"
Edmund Picciuto, like most children his age, loves songs, toys, and of course also his mother.
But unlike her peers, she suffers from microcephalus, which is the result of a genetic disorder that her mother Elizabeth Picciut did not know during pregnancy.
When he first came home, I thought I couldn't handle this.
I can't do this.
I'm not ready for this.
Which is not true at all - of course you are preparing for it," she said.
She and her husband, Vincent, learned that Edmund might never know and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be placed in the institution.
"My first reaction was that I didn't think people were doing this anymore," Picciutová explains.
Edmund's walking with a walker.
He wasn't supposed to sit down until he was three years old, and he's still not talking.
Some barriers are already filling in slowly.
He comes with help and rides on his bike.
He also enjoys playing with his two brothers and loves singing.
Elizabeth carries out a sign saying that Edmund says, "Please sing to me."
"We teach him the sign word," said Picciutová for CBS News.
But it's not a regular sign word - says Edmund invented some sign himself.
Microcephaly can arise from a number of different strains: genetics, such as in the case of Edmund, and after infections in pregnancy caused by viruses such as bedroom or Zika.
Symptoms and prognosis may vary significantly.
It's too soon for us to say how the Zika virus will affect the lives of the infected.
Picciut reminds us of a tax that does not exist in the future.
I keep asking, "What's next?"
What's next?
And she's still not sure about it.
In fact, I've never wondered what a total prediction is, because I don't expect anyone to tell me.
Picciut has an encouraging report for the mothers of all children who suffer from birth defects caused by Zika.
The situation is getting better.
You know it's gonna be better.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Strong rains and floods requested rescue work in Louisiana, Mississippi
A strong rain and extensive floods in Louisiana led the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday. Another rain is expected in the state on Saturday.
The National Weather Service (NWS) reported that after extreme floods, a number of rivers in the south-east of Louisiana and in southern Mississippi flow from their shores and threatens vast floods.
Governor Louisiana John Bel Edwards said state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and help is already on their way to the affected areas.
Mike Steele, spokesperson of the governor for national security and preparedness for the crisis, said that they are receiving requests for water, boat and sand vehicles.
Steele said that only the Tangier county asked for ten thousand pints with sand.
Flood monitoring will remain in most southern Louisianas working on Saturday.
The Meteorological Service reported that more than 8 to 13 centimeters above sea level could be used.
In southern Alabama, there was a flood monitoring on Friday, when rains continued in the area of the city of Mobile.
According to predictions, the Committee at Baton Rouge and Amite at Denham Springs have the weekend to culminate.
Meteorologist Alek Krautmann said that both said they could sail a number of homes in the rural areas of Baton Rouge.
He further stated that there is a danger of flooding after a current in the Ascension District, when these depleted streams will flow to Lake Maurepas only slowly.
Said Tickfaw, about something more south of Mississippi State border in Louisiana state, reached the highest recorded level at 9 a.m. on Friday morning.
Rescuers are still raising people from the riverbeds in the county of Amite and Wilkinson in the southwest of Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and his own son were among the Gloster survivors before Friday.
Hansford (62) said that the water from Beaver Creek, which is normally more than 120 meters from his home, rose quickly overnight.
He said he was alerted by his next in-law son who lives nearby.
"We woke up and the water was getting closer," said Hansford.
We had her in the belt.
According to his wife, it's the highest level she's ever lived on a river in the last 48 years.
Hansford said he and all his family are injured and he's the only one who can swim.
Hansford stated that crisis workers saved all three huge military-style freight vehicles and moved them to a fire station in Gloster, where they were hidden on Friday.
Krautmann said that, with the continuation of efficient rains, the floods are “extremely expanding” and the authorities consider evacuation.
According to Krautmann's observer, not far from Livinston, it was reported that from midnight to Friday morning it fell 35 centimeters [35 cm] of rainfall.
Krautmann said that the ground is strongly inflated from the middle.
The authorities indicated that the eligible rain and the paid roads requested the rescue of the residents from their homes during the Tangierhoa period and the abolition of education in five school districts.
The WWL branch of CBS announced that 200 homes were flooded according to Tangier elders.
The inhabitants were evacuated to two churches, both of which are now flooded.
The mayor of the city of Robby Miller stated that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven domestic animals that had been trapped by high water.
In the village of Amite and in the city of Hammond there were shelters for those who were evacuated.
"They will be able to return home when the water starts to drop," he said.
In the county of Tangipahoa in Hammond, more than 20 streets were closed because of the flood, and the locals were given a sand piste that they could pick up and try to protect their homes and businesses from the water.
"The last major floods we had here in March," said the governor of the city of Lacy Landrum.
It seems these floods will be similar.
Rupert Lacy, crisis manager in Harrison County, Mississippi, stated that on the coast of the Persian Gulf, a persistent rain continues.
He said that on Thursday, a few homes were closed, but on Friday none of them were reported.
Keith Townson, leader of Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has been living in the field for 40 years.
"I've seen water in several places where I've never seen it before," Townson said, "and it's still there."
Mahaj Brown (6) - "a boy shot like a shot", survived shooting in Philadelphia
According to the police, there was a six-year-old gun shot in Philadelphia, and this week the second time he was shot at a child at 6 years of age in the city.
Her child's parents identified her for CBS Philadelphia as Mahaje Brown.
The parents say that the boy suffered several gunshot wounds, including weakness, legs, arms, and abdomen, but when he was on his way to the hospital, he was conscious.
"He grasped the tremendous power, his small body was scattered as it was resolved," said his grandmother, Delores Melendez.
I can't believe it.
The boy was in critical condition at the hospital and underwent several operations.
The family for the station said the boy should get better.
He was supposed to be in the first class of elementary school.
Mahaj Brown is among the four people who were shot in Germantown.
Three more men were shot: two at the age of 29 and one at the age of 32.
One of the men at the age of 29 is in critical condition, according to CBS Philadelphia are another two victims in a stabilised condition.
According to the report, a child was found on the front seat of the vehicle with a man of 90 years in critical condition.
Two more victims weren't in the car, and the police are checking if any of the injured men could be a shooter.
The investigators at CBS Philadelphia stated that there was a possibility of a shooting between several armed men.
The site was equipped with a weapon of a type of attack, a number of attacks.
According to all, it was definitely about the ongoing battle.
On the street there were tapes on both sides of the road.
It seems, then, that there were several armed combatants here who were actively involved," the captain of the Philadelphia police station, Anthony Ginaldi, said.
Several homes and vehicles were also seized in the area.
No one's been detained, and the police are allegedly investigating video footage from the camera.
Another six-year-old child, this time a girl, was shot in a wildfire on Tuesday before home in the vicinity of West Oak Lane.
The girl's getting drunk, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why do we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie?
That's just how I imagine a female gymnastics team for this year's Olympics, right for a few reasons.
First of all, I've been to every summer Olympics since 1984 and the United States has never been so dominant.
And second, in this team are three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who inspired so many young colored girls.
Everyone is proud of the composition of this team, which complements Aly Raisman, who is of Jewish origin, and Catholic Madison Kocian.
We finally have a team that looks like America.
He also confirmed the presence of black and Latin American on the corner of this sport.
A gymnastics number one in the past four years was an African American.
Simone and Gabby were on the first and second peaks last year.
That means something.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Dougals suddenly became a champion of the Olympics and America was jealous.
Now the world could be a witness of the incredible performance of the three-dimensional world winners Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, who performed unexpected but masterly gymnastics figures.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American to receive gold in a woman’s multiple combat of individuals.
And a member of the Aly Raisman team got silver.
We're witnesses to the sports top, but it doesn't seem that way in the country's gym class.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie graduated from the Olympic team the same way as Aly and Madison.
They're "fine five", because the team's gymnast at the next Olympics will only be composed of four athletes, and this is the last year Martha Karolyi's training.
The fact is, however, that gymnastics is financially demanding sports and gymnasts train mainly in private gyms that keep parents paying for training, equipment, travel, clothes, competition fees, hotel accommodation (for coaches and their creditors and families).
Most of these sports clubs are in rich areas in the suburbs that can support activities.
In these clubs, all gymnasiums have gymnasiums and gymnasiums are a costly and long-term commitment for families.
Aimee Boorman, coach Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach Laurie Hernandez, both trained athletes at the time they started high school.
It is our duty to bring gymnastics training that is more accessible and accessible to communities of countless young girls that Simone, Gabby and Laurie inspired.
I founded the gymnasium project 20 years ago.
In my organizations where we offer free gymnastics or with low costs in Harlem for more than 15,000 young people within the city (mainly black and Spanish origin) and we trained national and international champions.
In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown), where we will provide quality gymnasts to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and strive from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develop strength, flexibility and coordination of the body and hard work, discipline and mind-reducing.
This combination means life benefits for good health, success in school and work.
The inspiration of this team will send thousands of young girls to us who will want to do gymnastics, and that's great.
Participation in this sport is very important, especially for girls.
It's a very exciting time.
Thank you, Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison, for proving the "wonder force" and for winning the Olympic team gold. And thank you for motivating so many young girls for all the reasons that they are on their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
When Jeremy Hunt's proposal is rejected, young doctors are ready to enter other strains
The ministers hoped that after the conclusion of the recast contract, the representatives of the British Medical Association (BMA) would end the disagreement with regard to the changes, but 58% of the 37,000 young doctors who took part in the election refused the contract.
In July, Hunt discovered plans for the termination of the contract with the fact that NHS was in "no one's country" and that further delays would have a harmful impact on employees and patients.
The first young doctors have already signed a new contract, which includes changes in night and weekend work procedures with a view to improving care in non-social hours.
Dr Ellen McCourt, president of the BMA Committee on Youth Doctors last night, stated: “Young doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contracts, especially in the sense that the current labour crisis will increase and therefore the fair treatment of all doctors.”
Just eight weeks before the first group of doctors goes into a new contract, progress is needed and time is coming.
The BMA's efforts to resolve disputes through negotiation met with eagerness to engage Dr and often with the government's adjourning silence.
And despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month, this option is still open.
"Jeremy Hunt now has to act, push for expulsion and solve the concerns of young doctors."
If this does not happen, young doctors are ready to take further steps.
During the last stop at the end of April, almost 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 visits were postponed, as sisters and specialists were invited to assist doctors who were among the protestors.
The Ministers hoped that after the conclusion of the recast contract, the representatives of the British Medical Association (BMA) would conclude an agreement on changes.
BMA wants higher pay for work on the weekend for 54 000 young doctors who would be the subject of the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, president of the NHS employees, urged young doctors not to enter any camps.
Mortimer said: “The defence action will only achieve little or nothing, but pressure will arise on the already overloaded teams and services and growing fears, exhaustion and disruption for patients, curing staff and their families.”
In the past two months, we have dealt with the advice of young doctors and with the Ministry of Health and have responded positively to their concerns about the role of supervisor and informant.
Employers hoped that the continued positive involvement in other important issues - such as difficulties, flexibility in schools, other training for those returning after career interruptions, training costs, mutual recognition of subjects, study freedom and gender pay gap - was evidence of how serious employers, Health Education England and the Ministry of Health are taking agreements that were reached with BMA in November, February and May.
A medicine for 60 crowns per day can reduce the risk of heart attack
Thousands of patients at risk of heart attack will be able to take a medicine that is estimated to be about sixty crowns (two pounds).
Ticagrelor reduces the risk of reinjection in people with heart disease.
The medicine is now administered for 12 months after the heart attack to reduce the risk of death or other seizure.
NHS watchdog NICE recommends that the medicine be given to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Now, however, NHS watchdog NICE recommends that people be given for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
In England, about 140,000 people suffer from a heart attack each year, and a quarter of them suffer another stroke or heart disease.
The heart and the body are caused by a accumulation of fat that creates a related layer on the walls of the artery.
If this layer is broken down, blood clots may occur, blood clots may block access to the heart and heart attack.
If the infection is released, it may continue with a blood clot, block the bloodstream into the brain and cause the brain to die.
People who have already had a heart attack are exposed to a higher risk of another seizure.
Ticagrelor, who manufactures the British company AstraZeneca and which is sold under the commercial name Brilique, reduces the risk of injury being less likely to occur.
It is recommended that patients receive 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months and then 60 mg with aspirin twice daily for another three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Centre, said: “In spite of the availability of effective secondary preventive treatments, there are a quarter of patients who have had a heart attack and who have other heart arrest or death - often with devastating consequences.”
Fear of repetition may have a significant negative impact on the quality of life of the patient.
Ticagrelor in combination with aspirin has been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of other heart arrests and death in people who have already suffered a heart attack.
It is our pleasure to see that when Ticagrelor is given a preliminary recommendation, we can extend the treatment options that are available to thousands of people who will be able to take care of it.
Because information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor - especially about the risk of bleeding - is limited over three years, the proposal for treatment over this period is not recommended.
With computer culture, they began to breed fraud in Muslim areas
The mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was dismissed last year for corruption, which was linked to the government's report
The culture of political justice has led to an overview of the widespread fraud in the Muslim communities, as reported today in the government report.
Former Minister Sir Eric Pickles strongly criticises the police, election inspectors and advisers for ignoring the abuse of their wishes for "interference in ethnicity and religion."
The former secretary of the community, now the leader of anti-corruption measures, said that threatening the voters on the basis of their religion is so bad that the police should make cordon and expelled voters protect from the polling stations.
He recommended that the electorate take the identity document with them and be able to prove who they are in the elections.
Currently, the electorate will only enter its name and address.
The report further proposes that the person's fingers be made an unmistakable ink when the vote is cast to prevent a person from choosing twice.
Whistleblowers should have more protection, says Pickles.
It calls for greater access to documents from the meeting and decisions taken by the informal committees or by the working group.
"It is only a matter of protecting against electoral fraud, but also of protecting the local government from the wider corrupt environment and the financial frauds that go hand in hand with it," he said.
The report requested Downing Street as a result of the election scandal in Tower Hamlets in West London.
Last year, the special election court decided that the mayor of Lutfur Rahman should be dismissed from his position after charges of corruption and illegal practices.
The court found that Rahman "cynicly struck" the religious feeling of his Muslim community and silenced his criticism of the accusations of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman, according to his words, "has led his campaign in such a way that it is the religious duty of the Muslims to vote for it."
Up to 300 votes were questioned or as a result of identity theft, when a person votes and gives in to someone else.
Sir Eric stated that there is evidence of fraud throughout the country.
He expressed particular concern about the fraud in the corresponding vote - which is claimed to have been caused by the senior members of the Muslim community during it by pressure on people to vote for the candidates they chose.
Sir Eric, on the video, gave several recommendations on how to clean up the electoral system, including presentation of the identity document
His report states: “The evidence was presented that the vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, were pressured to vote in accordance with the will of the elders, especially in communities from Pakistan and Bangladesh.”
"The concerns were raised that... state institutions had closed their eyes to such behaviour because of "politically correct" sensitivity to ethnic origin and religion."
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations on how to clean up the system, including to prevent political activists from manipulating with a corresponding voice and preventing such "voice wear."
The report, which is now valued by Theresa May, also requests more detailed controls on registrations in order to prevent the use of electoral lists for immigration fraud and dose fraud.
Consider the possibility of asking voters to submit a document of identity before the vote.
Use an insatiable input on the fingers when voting to prevent a person from choosing twice.
Conducting systematic checks on the nationality of persons in order to ensure that they can choose.
The request for automatic correspondence shall be limited to a period of three years.
To prohibit political agitators and activists from manipulating their respective voices and electoral envelopes.
To give the police permission to create around the election rooms of the cordon.
To amend laws to make it easier to reach out to those who develop an illegal burden under the 1983 Reform Act.
To prohibit the installation of photographs in the polling stations.
To require that only English (except Wales) be employed in the polling stations.
Ensuring training and ensuring that employees comply with the rule that voters go to the polling stations individually.
Sir Eric criticises the London police and says it's "surprising", that after the Tower Hamlets case, no criminal charges were brought.
"The Court of Justice excluded Lutfur Rahman and his agent for Lithuania from corruption and illegal practices," he said.
For a number of reasons, he was found guilty of a series of fundamental doubts - in force of the evidence of a criminal act.
It also criticises the inconsistency of "supply control" in the polling departments.
Sir Eric said: “The previous court ruling in the case of Tower Hamlets by awakening.
Our nation has a proud link to parliamentary democracy, but the disturbing and hidden proliferation of electoral frauds and the refusal of some authorities threatens this reputation.
Illumination of the cyclist's double leader Kate and other well-known doubles on the Olympics in Rio
The fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio went crazy this week to the French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who is an apparently similar leader of Cambridge.
But fourteen-year-old Olympics are not far from the only athlete who strives for gold this year, who can boast of his own double in a number of known personalities - at least not according to social networks.
At the celebration of the Olympics in Rio and of all the well-known personalities that currently appear on our screens, the FEMAIL women's column compiled a list of the Olympics that are more than remotely similar to the Hollywood Celebrates.
As a hunted animal: A member of the American team of shooters Brady Ellison (left) was compared to Leonardo DiCaprio
Next to Kate's two-wheel drive, a number of people online quickly pointed out that a certain shooter could be the twin of the star Leonardo DiCapria.
A racer with a team of American shooters, Brady Ellison, caused a storm on Twitter after his images were invented, on which he was supposed to look like a Wall Street wolf.
Brady himself noticed the media madness and admitted that he was listening to a little girl about his similarities with Lee.
"I don't see any big similarity, except for the boobs," Brady said for Huffington Post.
"It's a guy and it looks good, so I think it's a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons from London 2012 will undoubtedly be highlighted this year even more: an imaginary image between the British jump to far away Greg Rutherford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
About the Russian gymnast Aliye Mustafinov with her big, prominent eyes, it was said that there was a copy of the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And when we look at the swimming pool, the South African sailor Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to the star of the Gell Matthew Morrison series for several years.
And for change: User thinks Nathan is an "athletic version" actor from the film Home (Inception)
Another long-lasting comparison is the comparison of the tennis star Rafael Nadal and the actor Josh Hartnett, who have similarly dense eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver swimming pool Yulia Efimovo is proud not only of the same roasting and blonde hair as Annalyn McCord. And about Nathan Adrian from the U.S. team, fans say it looks like "athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitta."
Powerful women: Hope Sol (left) football star and actress Dexter Jennifer Carpenter series (right) have a similar shape of face and eyes
Not only one: Twitter user was very pleased that the similarities were noticed as well
On waves theory: According to this user, there may be a reason for a similar view of couples
One Twitter user recently expressed his satisfaction at the fact that "the rest of the Internet thinks Hope Solová and Jennifer Carpenter are really identical."
The Hope Sol football star and the actress Dexter Jennifer Carpenter series have a truly incredible form of face and eyes.
Among the other favorite comparisons is Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to the smile of the actress Laura Linney, or the holder of gold medals for the gymnast Gabby Douglas, proud of her beautifully wide smile, who like copying the smile of Gabrielle Union, the stars of Bravo film, girls!
The CBC Olympics Commentary apologizes for saying that the Chinese swimmer said he was "blowing"
Biron MacDonald's 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's reviewer by Byron MacDonald. The swimming pool ended up in the fourth place of women's race at 4x200 m free style.
The Canadian CBC station was forced to apologize after one of its commentators said that the 14-year Chinese swimming pool was "stirred like a smell" and "pulled".
Commentor Byron MacDonald thought that his microphone was turned off when at the end of the women's final staff at 4x200 metres of free style began to shake his own opinions.
MacDonald, who was supposed to bring "life" to the CBC team, said, among other things, "The little 14-year-old from China gave it up, you fool."
Too much excitement, it smells like a smell, it explodes.
Thank you.
Chinese swimming pool Ai Yanhan (14) sailed the second race staff at 1:57.79 - at 1.61 seconds slower than Canadian Taylor Ruck and allowed Canadians to reach China.
The spectators in Canada began to appeal quickly online and were frightened by the tone and language that the commenter used
Emmett Macfarlane wrote on Twitter: "The speaker told the CBC that the 14-year-old swimmer from China "blowed"???
The idiot hasn't noticed he's still on the radio."
Ai Yanhan from China at the finals of the 4x200 meters women's staff race was described as: "The little 14-year-old from China gave it up, you fool."
Critique Byron MacDonald on Twitter came from all sides and many asked for his resignation
When Twitter users found out how rude Byron MacDonald is, they didn't hold back.
Another user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: 'Wow #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada, and it sounds like we're a bunch of racists.
Shortly thereafter, Scott Russell, who was hosting CBC's broadcast, apologized for the live MacDonald's comment and said, "We apologize for the comment on the performance of the swimming pool that escaped the broadcast."
It was an unfortunate choice of words, we're sorry it happened."
CBC finally apologized more than 90 times to people who tweeted in response to the comment
Co-rapporteur Scott Russell had to apologize on behalf of MacDonald
CBC then copied and filed their apology for more than 90 Twitter users who complained about comments by MacDonald
The station also quickly apologized and published a statement.
She's really sorry that the word was pronounced, she shouldn't get to the ether.
We quickly apologized to our viewers in the broadcast and to those who watch us on social networks.
To be clear, Byron's comments were about the performance of the swimming pool, not the swimming pool itself.
In other words, it was an inappropriate and unhappy choice of words. Byron deeply apologized for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, Byron MacDonald apologized in a live broadcast and tried to explain his note by saying that he did not want to be identified as a personal attack.
"I would now like to apologize for the comment I made last night after the women's staff," said in a broadcast from the Olympics at the CBC station.
"I had in mind the performance of a swimmer and not a person of a swimmer like that."
"There's no need to say that I didn't mean any offense and I'm very sorry."
Customers in Primark abused by a woman who was reluctant to try underwear in the middle of the store
When the woman tried out on the sales plate in the middle of Primark, they weren't buying a certain way to look at.
To make it even worse, she tried how her size fell, took off her pants and returned them back to the regal.
She continued in the search and finally tried four pair of pants in the shop in Bouverie Place shopping center in Flokeston.
Primark Shop in Bouverie Place Shopping Centre in Folkestone, where a woman tried her pants before returning to the regula
The mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was in the shop at the time, stated that after testing the underwear, a mysterious woman “redressed and went out of the store without buying anything.”
She said, "People couldn't believe with their own eyes."
She was standing in the middle of the store, taking off her pants, taking off her own pillows and pants, and putting them on.
"She didn't even try to find a discreet place - she just stood there, holding as a monkey."
"Everybody just watched her dress up again, and obviously they didn't like her because she came back to the regal."
She did the same with three others before finally decided that she didn't like anything, dressed again and left.
"She didn't seem to mind who was looking - nor would she think of the man who was supposed to buy the pants she tried."
Ms. Davidson (33), who lives in Kent, said: “The idea is that someone will take home the pants that someone had on them and nobody cleaned them up.
The event took place on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms. Davidson added: “When she left, I picked up the things she had obviously tried to get them out of the market, which is also the only right thing.”
"I'd like to imagine that I'd bring a new coat home and find out that she had another woman on her side, took them off, and they weren't washed."
Primark said in his speech: "The Primark knows about the incident that occurred in our trade in Folkeston on Tuesday, 9 August."
All the products concerned were downloaded from the sale.
How to defend against the attack of weapons by Krav Maga
The world out there is dangerous, but thanks to this video from Dailymail.com, it could be safer for you.
We talked to Rhon Mizrachi, a great federation of Krav Magy living in New York to find out how to deal with armed wolves near the distance.
This video will show you how to suddenly get over the rapist's weight, whether he's getting close to you in the front or in the back.
If he approaches you from the back, says Mizrachi, then the first thing you have to do is turn around to see your attacker and "have a free shot".
Then you will grasp the weapon between your forwards and the shoulder just before you hit it in the face with a free pocket.
Then he follows his knees to the weak, and while the attacker turns in pain, you draw a weapon out of his hand, hit his head in the face, and start to stand, then you hold the weapon aimed at him.
If a armed man approaches you in front of you, it's a similar technique - get your body out of the fire line, grab a gun and turn it around so the donor can't shoot.
At the same time, put force into the weapon and strike the attacker into the chest, then turn the weapon out of his clutches and start to step down, while still at peace with him.
Does that sound complicated?
Look at the video, where you'll see exactly how Misrachi does it.
Remember, however, that the safest way to get out of the fall - if you are not the great Krav Maga - is to issue all cash.
Traveler Ian Wright smells the most spicy places in Europe to travel guide
The British traveler decided to undergo a difficult test of his immune system and a dabbling reflex - by relieving the most spicy and unpleasant places in Europe.
The moderator and travel author Ian Wright (51), from Suffolk, visited his immune system with a euro bank card in his language, hit Piccadilly Circus, the button hung on the train's toilet and the Russian public phone.
Before approaching each object, he used a light meter to show himself and all of us what he's going to do.
The experiment, based on which the movie Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was filmed, brought interesting results.
The idea of relieving the switch button on a train that has been used by thousands of other people may seem quite repulsive, but the need for a kitchen sink is actually much more harmful bacteria.
Ian Wright spoke to doctors and health professionals throughout his journey throughout Europe about strengthening the bacteria of celery and his own health.
Luckily, none of what he smelled left anything worse in his mouth than his shoe.
Ian Wright celebrated himself by testing the resistance of his blades on the roads around the world and eating strange and amazing things.
During this mission, he tested his immune system safely - from public checkpoints to train stations after landing
In the film he filmed, he says: “I haven’t had much to do with my health since childhood, and I’ve given in my mouth everything I can, from the clay after eating worms and boiling water.”
In the film, his reputation was confirmed by a dotist.
The only thing he refused was dirty public toilets in Russia.
After a simple layer, the luminometer showed a value of more than 4,000 units.
For comparison, freshly washed hands should have less than 60.
One public toilet in Russia but the oil was refused after its luminometer showed more than 4000 units, while freshly washed hands have less than 60
Ian Wright and Finnish dairy producers Valio filmed the travelers' film called The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, which shows the number of bacteria in different places, such as in the bathroom
He said in the film, "This is almost the most disgusting thing I've ever felt in the toilet."
Nothing more dirty than this!
I'm not gonna smell anything because it's disgusting here.
Film Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was staged in collaboration with the Finnish milk producer Valio.
Mr Wright’s company has provided Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria and vitamins C and D, which help people to strengthen the serum bacteria and the immune system.
Niko Vuorenmaa, senior vice president of Valio for decorations, juices, and new categories, said: “We wanted to offer consumers something really new.
Something that would follow the engagement and at the same time enable us to explain the benefits of probiotics.
We've come up with a lot of crazy ideas that end with the idea "Let's call Ian."
It's said that interest in the health of insects is becoming a global phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about producers, we wanted to put them in a broader context - good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of the liver health and how it is linked to the immune system.
The growing interest in healthy cream is a global phenomenon and through this document we have provided consumers with more interesting information.
I also think there's a great sense of humor in the movie!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, adds: "Let's say this, Ian would lose my respect if he found out something about what I wanted him to do - like the disgusting Russian toilet that appears in the film."
It was natural for Ian to make some things easier, others rather difficult.
I'm glad we made some of those dirty things.
Valio carried out a survey in 2015, whereby 84% of respondents combined their lactic acid bacteria primarily with stomach and intestine health and 58% of respondents indicated that at least occasionally they used products containing the added lactic acid bacteria.
The family of the socially needed before the move destroyed the general building in Saltash, Cornwall
The family of the socially needed left at their general home a 50 000 pounds of damage after they were accused of terrorizing their neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were expelled from home in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long number of complaints against him.
After their violent departure from the house, apartment officials were shocked when they found that the property was in an accident condition.
There were holes in the air, the floor cover was torn down, the floors fell on the floor and the walls were walled.
The family has already moved away and it is considered that they live in private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, director of Cornwall Housing, said she was worried if she was going to save the house.
She said: “It was a nightmare for people here, and I don’t think people should live like this.
A number of circumstances need to be considered, as this property is likely to come into consciousness as “not so much a part” of Cornwall.
This family is not well known and their names are not well known.
Couples have three sons who used to live in the house, and the police have stated that the horrors of the family involved street battles using baseball bats, intimidation of the people around them, drug use, drug distribution and voice screams, quarrels and clues.
The Skeldon (47) whose name was mentioned in the lease agreement was sentenced to anti-social behaviour in June.
In a few rooms in the house, which may have been torn down, were found burning waste.
In a house where drugs have been distributed in the past, the floor cover has been removed
Neighbors say they've seen them on the street like a pear, and people here regularly called the police
Cornwall Housing and her partner were forced to move out of the house this week after they had received an additional 11 weeks to move out voluntarily.
The neighbor who fell asleep welcomed the relief that their lives were a living hell.
One of them said, "They did not care about anyone at all."
We lived next door for 20 years, and it's always been like this.
How many times we've seen the police here, they can't count at all.
"We couldn't sleep this morning."
We got up because there was an incredible silence - we're not used to it!
It'll be nice when they're finally gone.
Adam Fitzpatrick, manager of supervision in the neighborhood of Cornwall Houseing, stated that the family was unable to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, the police were regularly called to the house
Waste and old toys have collapsed in a remote part of the public house
She adds: “It is a shame that the tenants were unable to accept responsibility for their own conduct and for the conduct of their families.
It was a very difficult case because their conduct was extreme and their actions, according to the witness, had to fear her neighbors.
I appreciate all the work my team has done, the Devon and Cornwall police and the local community members who have been firmly informing us.
I hope that this step will bring a little comfort to the neighbors and at the same time bring a message that we will not tolerate sexual behavior.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons of the rent who lived in the house at different times were about 20 years old.

Workers will now have to remove the waste heaps left around the house
In 2014, she carried out police in the house of razia and found more than 70 grams of rope, weight, equipment and 1,700 pounds in cash.
Skeldon received a fine when she was found guilty of holding Class B drugs she wanted to sell.
She claimed that the money was designed on the basis of the house for her son, Lee Skelton, who died in a car accident in 2013.
Tanya and her partner are now living in private accommodation in Plymouth.
The walls in many rooms of the house were painted graffiti.
Police say they're going to try to move out tenants who violate the rules of their rental contracts.
Angela Crowová of the Denov and Cornwall police stated that the removal was a clear message for other tenants who would continue to violate the rules.
"This is a message for all those who think they can behave impartially, and for those who would like to follow such conduct," she said.
The Denov and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and non-social behaviour and will continue to cooperate with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal scared after a low crossing of a military trisk aircraft over the beach
The tourists who enjoyed the sunflowers in Portugal's Aveir were terrified of death
Portuguese military aircraft P-3C Orion flew to incredibly low
Military aircraft declared that it was a exercise flight and insisted that there was no danger of safety
At a time when a low - flying swimmer had fallen over the crowded beach, the frightened tourists were fascinated by panic.
The dramatic images show how the military plane reaches almost a distance from the sun to the sand beaches of the city of Aveiro in northern Portugal.
The tourists began to learn after they were disturbed by the noise of the engines of the Trish plane, without seeing what was coming out of the clouds.
The incident occurred last afternoon at Costa Nova near the city of Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of several recreationals who published video recordings of the dramatic transition on social networks, said: “The plane has been really low twice, and at one point it seemed to be going away.”
Nuno Arroja adds: “I was suffering, and I really thought the plane would fall on my head.”
Tourists on the beach in Aveira were frightened when the plane was flying low from darkness
Portugal's military aircraft today declared that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft was on the exercise flight with the aim of identifying fishing vessels by the coast and had to move low because it was the only way to control the ship.
The plane reportedly flew about something lower than it is common, due to poor visibility caused by smoke from nearby forest fires. However, the flight takes into account that the safety of people was not threatened.
Forest fires this summer destroyed part of mainland Portugal and requested four victims on the island of Madeira.
Portugal's military aircraft today declared that the pilot had to fly low due to dense fog and smoke from fires that kept him in sight.
The pilot was asked to identify fishing vessels during the training.
Half of funeral services do not comply with the rules.
Half of funeral service providers do not comply with the legislation.
The Czech Commercial Inspectorate (CIOI) found this in the second quarter of the year.
The funeral services do not, in its opinion, inform the rest of their prices or issue written confirmations of the acceptance of the order.
The C.I.I. put 41 beaks in total of 73,000 crowns.
Today, her talker Jiří Fröhlich was informed.
The inspectors found a doubt in 47 out of 95 controls.
In addition to not informing about prices and missing confirmations, some funeral services also sold products or provided services at other prices than they were registered.
In five cases, the products sold were not properly labelled and once the seller used an officially unaudited measure.
The inspection therefore prohibited the sale of 23 products for a total of 7077 crowns.
These were packages for urns, candles and candles, which were not properly marked with mandatory information.
"Since there is still a violation of the law in this specific area of services, control actions will continue in the next quarter of this year," Fröhlich added.
The London schoolgirl who joined the IS was killed in Syria
It was reported that Kadiza Sultana, one of the three British schoolchildren who had left London last year to join the IS, died in Syria.
Legal representative Tasnime Akunjee said the family learned about her death in the Syrian Rock a few weeks ago.
ITV News announced on Thursday that it was likely killed during a Russian air raid in Racca, which is the property of the country's group.
Sultani was 17 years old, and according to her family, she died just when she was preparing to flee to a war - torn country and return to Britain.
"People want to believe that the only good thing for the whole thing - as a message and a warning to others that these are real dangers associated with the road to the war zone - is to make people do away with when they make decisions," Akunjee said.
Sultana and two other schoolchildren from eastern London arrived in February 2015 on the plane to Turkey and then on the bus to the border with Syria.
The Sultana family found out that she had married an IS warrior in Syria for several months.
Reid says if Clinton is elected, he leaves Garland as a candidate for the Supreme Court.
The leader of the Senate on the democratic side of Harry Reid says he is convinced that the presidential election candidate for the Democrats Hillary Clinton appoints Judge Merrick Garland to the highest court in the case of his election.
The Republicans in the Senate blocked Garland's appointment, even when President Barack Obama nominated it in March.
The leader of the Senate, Mitch McConnel, says that the person who replaces the late judge of the Supreme Court will be elected by the future president.
Reid said on Thursday during a conference call that Clinton was believed to choose Garland "with a certain degree of confidence."
Reid's speech later stated that he didn't talk directly to Clinton about whether Garland would be nominated and that he was just speculating.
He appreciated Garland and said that the Clinton team would not want to "understand the ship".
Garland is the president of the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington.
Reid said that the republics that block Garland's appointment are "obligators" and "spoké" of the Republican candidate to the presidential office of Donald Trump.
He said Trump wouldn't go to the office.
According to the magazine Treats, our calendars are for "women and men"
The magazine Treats collaborates closely with photographer David Bellemer on the 2017 calendar, inspired by Pirelli's 70th-year calendar.
But instead of the well-known personalities you're trying to find another generation top models for your 2017 NU.
President Treats Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his magazine is full of trouble from Playboy from the old school, because "Playboy is for men."
I'm doing it for women.
He obviously thinks the calendar too.
"We must return to the display of overtime and classical tensions, when women and men are happy to feel and let themselves be inspired by the photos of the woman's body," Shaw said in a press release to the calendar.
Women want to be part of this project because it's a beautiful piece of art.
Models can send their pictures online or personally during open competitions in Los Angeles and New York.
Where does vinyl focus: who really buys gramphone boards?
Vinyl loves the isolation of a man of middle age.
Before you decide to pay a section of the comments to pay close notes under the pseudonym Not AllOmbudspersonsIn the Middle Ages, we suggest that this sentence comes from real data.
According to YouGov, so much debated the creation of a gramophone desk is linked not to the boom of millennials who want to love the original property of the physical object, but to the nostalgia of the middle age.
Those who recently bought their vinyl album are the most likely people between 45 and 54 years of age.
Young people 18-24 are at least likely.
It's not about collecting a excited fan, it's all about the emotional dimension: older people who buy gramophone boards are more likely to want to keep their feelings (56%) versus 53%) and like themselves (69% versus 66%).
But are the results of YouGo's true?
If this blog was broadcast as a television report, the camera would follow me as I go out into the street in Soho, dressed in a decent gray suit and widely gesticulous. Then I would stop, pull out my hands and say something authoritarian, like, "Let's go look at it."
Let's take a look at that.
While Soho's heart slowly loses its charm and charm - buildings once occupied by independent sellers, hotels, restaurants and food, supplies and office needs - several fantastic specialty shops with gramophone desks have yet to be filled.
I'd probably ask the camera to stop filming for a while. I'm going to get close to different men in these shops and try to figure out what their age is and what their emotional disposition is.
Stuart (55), a family from Glasgow, which I'm looking for from Sister Ray (counts: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (counts: eight middle-aged men, one woman about 20) has a meeting in London in the afternoon and is looking for shops to fill a few hours of time.
I'm asking him if he's a collector.
"I think so," he says.
I've got about three or four thousand recordings.
All those tapes glue the walls of his living room - on the top picture (he sent me an e-mail, I didn't follow him at home).
This huge amount of albums and singles also has thanks to the fact that they can afford it: they can now buy gramphones that they couldn't afford when they first came up, and they buy again what they sold in the youth and had no wind.
“A lot of what I buy is from the end of the 60s and from the beginning of the 70s. These are the things that would be issued when I was 11 or 12 then I was too small and couldn’t arrange them,” he says.
They agree that those who buy recordings are likely introverts that they like their own company, and he adds: “I don’t smoke or drink too much.
This is my sin.
Wez (25) works at Sister Ray and also thinks that a number of customers he meets are in the profile of YouGov.
He also noticed a new abundance of people affected by the media wave. People who heard about the comeback and felt forced to buy their old phonograph boards back.
According to my interviews, the people of their collections were most often released between 1998 and 1999.
Customers who once sold their gramophone records and bought CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their gramophone records back," he says.
That could explain the boom of lovers of the gramophone deck of a certain age.
But what's the supposed emotional importance of the gramophone covers?
It won't take you more than a few seconds to find out in a store like Phoenix that in a music store you will find a pleasant community of people with similar thoughts.
According to Weze, some older customers are particularly damaged by the wireless payment system.
Some of the beneficiaries of the gramophone desks may feel overwhelmed in the digital world and have decided for the familiar environment of the envelopes of the gramophone desks, things that bring memories of peaceful learning.
"I think that filling the gap or ownership of something material can bring certain comfort," says Wez.
I'm a collector myself, I have it, and I think a lot of people too.
It's an easy way to fill a place in your head.
"We're all like their social workers!" a collaborator is called from a collection of gramophone boards.
The ICM survey in April revealed that almost 50% of the people who bought their vinyl album a month ago had not heard it yet.
According to the survey, 41 % of the questionnaires that never use, while 7 % of those who buy the gramophones do not have a gramophone.
At this point in the report, he probably seemed really upset when he passed the crowd building the bossa nova.
The aspect of the “trophy” and the recovery of interest is something Jonny (42), who works in the Sounds of the Universe (number: three men of the Middle Ages).
"Someone recently came and said, "I don't have a phonograph yet, but I want to buy on the radiohead desk so we can put it on the shelf," he says.
That's not a big percentage, but it's happening.
It's more about the product page than about music.
People who say, "I don't have a phonograph."
They're younger people, not the older, grown-ups who get into it.
Fopp, where at the present time almost one-thirty-one-six are replaced by a gramophone board, has many different visitors on my arrival.
There's a couple of 70-year-olds, tourists, who take pictures, teenagers, and middle-aged women.
While the atmosphere is not as relaxed as shops before - from players with the latest pop from Wild Beasts full of synthesizers and sex, it is good to see different customers.
None of them look particularly lonely, but you'll find it hard to estimate an intruder's mental trauma by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora (27) spends a few minutes in Fopp and explores various gramphone boards in the basement.
It's one of those who's looking at the exhibits more than they're going to lose.
According to his words, he doesn't make a lot of money, so he doesn't think he'd collect the gramophone records.
It's worth a lot of money.
It's easy to listen to music on computers or something, but gramophone boards have their magic... "exhales anxiously.
I can't explain - it's unique.
My last stop is a trade that supposedly inspired a new generation of gramophone desk lovers: Urban Outfitters.
I face that I'm very excited about girls in the sweaty jeans, and I'm following a bunch of cute girls who just hang out around Polaroid cameras, and then my father and daughter decide to buy Crosley's gramophone.
On the left is the vault, whose walls cover the gramphone boards Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary and classical music, the foundation of any average collections of gramphone covers.
No one's looking at them - maybe because they're just for decorations and some are so high on the wall that they can't be reached.
It's just a wine trick.
But since any attraction to it could mean more money for the sector and send several customers to the depth of Soho for others, there is not much to complain about.
It is no surprise that the demographic area, where there is probably more time and money than in other areas, is also where the most luxurious goods which vinyl is certainly the most expensive.
But while my findings suggest that the results of YouGov are accurate - at least in stores with gramophone boards, they don't take into account a large number of collectors and vinyl lovers who actually exist in stores with gramophone boards and online forums.
These people probably work hard at schools or in offices.
He certainly doesn't spend the Thursday morning snooping after business with a phonograph desk on Berwick Street, passing recordings and avoiding a look at a strange, thirtieth-year false television moderator, hiding behind the back of nothing inconspicuous men of the middle age.
Green shark is the most long live predator - video report

The Court of Justice in France refused to pay off the operations in the refugee camp of Jungle
The court in France rejected the order of the authorities in Calais to demolish dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the camp of Jungle, where thousands of refugees live.
During the trial this week, the Office in Calais suggested that the state should be able to cancel a total of 72 provisional shops where people inside the camp sell goods, from cigarettes after energy drinks, offer hair cuttings, sell tea for 50 cents or basic bread for a few euros in provisional restaurants.
The Office of the Prefect in Calais argued that places need to be demolished because they represent a parallel economy that does not pay taxes and because they mean a danger of fire and health risks.
Humanitarian organisations at the court have stated that shops and restaurants are vital and that free foods offered by state-supported associations and other groups do not provide food supplements for increasing numbers of refugees in the camp.
Disputes and restaurants often provide shelter and free food to people in need.
The Court of Justice in Lille decided that there was no legal basis that would prevent the people from operating 72 provisional transactions, but stated that Prefect Calais's objections were "very understandable".
Judge Jean-François Molla said that food, coffee and restaurants have a much greater role to play than just feeding people who "live under extremely desperate conditions."
He said spaces provide peaceful places to meet refugees and volunteers.
One of the places that the Demolice threatened was a café in the camp, Jungle Book Kids, which is operated by a non-profit organization and which daily offers 200 meals, English and French hours and asylum advice for hundreds of vulnerable people without escorts to the camp.
More than 170 000 people signed the petition for the protection of "children" cafes.
The Guardian received a letter stating that the closure of the café “was a disaster for these children, some of whom are only 8 years old.”
The charity Help Refugee and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated on Friday that the number of refugees in the camp after the sharp increase of the arrivals over the years has increased to over 9,000 - which is even more than ever.
You thought he was dead.
Ulc crosses himself and the volleyball spirit.
"From March I could normally train," he reported on the start of the summer preparation in full force.
What's wrong with you?
I had both lung embolism, and that's why I had heart problems.
Because when I was at the University of Korea, I didn't know I had any blood problems.
So he made a long flight to Asia?
I've had a stroke for two years, and I didn't know about it.
It hurt me, no one found me.
Then the impact got up.
There's a broken life in the joint, and it's gonna hurt all the time, especially when it's gone, or it's changing the weather.
But nothing that would limit me is more aesthetic.
Were you worried about life?
He did.
Last year, I didn't know I had embolism at the summer tournament in the Woods, and I couldn't move there anymore.
I shed blood tonight.
The doctors told me it was something completely different, and I was still fully equipped for five days.
I actually thought in the Woods I was dead, and my girlfriend and family.
I've seen you somewhere else.
How did you deal with that?
I guess I had to go through it, and now it's just gonna go up.
I know I have some blood problems, that I need to be more careful when I'm going somewhere.
But there's nothing to do with it.
Just when I wanted to go back to the preparation of the Pribras last year, there was still a problem with the heart.
Everything's fine now.
Since March, I have been preparing myself to be able to play again.
I'm physically better at it than before.
What do you expect from Us?
I'm glad the party looks good, most of the boys know.
I'm curious about two other foreigners coming in.
I hope we sit down people so that we can fit in.
You're gonna pick up the ostrich?
There was a reputation for revelation, but every season is different.
Brno was eight two years ago, now the second is over.
There's a new team in the mouth, only a few players left.
It was the last one in extraly, so there's a big room for improvement.
As we use it, it's up to us.
We'll see who's gonna be the first round, we're not.
Is Brom's success guarantee?
He's already experienced and experienced it a lot, he'll think of a better place than the last place.
But my income doesn't depend on him, I made a deal earlier.
There were other coaches in the game, I'm a big friend, and it was agreed he'd act here.
I'm not gonna say a name.
Finally, Mr. Brom came and I'm glad.
He's got a big name, he's been in good clubs, he's been training for many decades, he's an old good player.
Send us up.
What will you bring?
This team will fight, which is my position.
I love fighting, I love gambling, and I like to get a chance in a no-brained team.
I was in Prebrama for two years, but Ústí is a bigger challenge than being in the sixth team right now, because it starts from the bottom.
You mentioned a stranger, he's already training Australian Boehm in Ústí.
What's it look like?
I know him under circumstances, we played against ourselves at the university in the group.
And a couple of times we had fun together, sometimes we sat together after the fights, so we met friends.
We beat them three, and right away, at the start of the summer preparation in Ústí, I fell asleep.
He's got a Slovenian girlfriend, he's a sympathetic.
The American Nadazdin and Brazilian Ze are still arriving.
Do you know anything about them?
I wrote with the American, it looks like a nice boy, a Brazilian who's gonna know English.
Did you contact the American?
I thought it was a good idea.
I'm a tape recorder, so whoever's making it, I should communicate with everyone.
I just found out what it's like for players, I found myself on the Internet, how it plays, I saw some videos.
He's getting all right, the boy's jumping, he's high.
We wrote a few messages on Facebook, it seemed like a joke, it's coming up with us.
How do you feel about the position of the recording unit?
I didn't want to take anything else.
I'm only going to be forty-four, and I don't have the idea of going to work.
I'd rather be in the center of action. I'd rather lead a team than someone else.
I guess I don't want to play if I'm supposed to be like a second recorder and devote myself to it for the full time.
How many times have you been single?
Half the time in Pribra, when it didn't go to Kusto as a captain, he got hurt, and then there was money problems, and he left.
Since then, we've been climbing up and I've been playing.
In Brno, whose abductor I'm, I've set up one and two.
An excellent year was in Old City, after which I had a lot of offers and I just picked the Prebram.
That's where Budjejovice wanted me, I stayed, but I didn't finish the season for the embolism.
Now it's a new beginning.
Gold number 22.
The short half remains Phelps' domain.
"To be back on stage wins and to hear the hymn is sweet as always," Phelps laughed and then again had his eyes full of tears.
His fiancée and mother were laughing again in the gaze, the son of Boomer this time quietly slept on his ears.
I'm living an ineffective week at the end of my career.
It's crazy - 20 years ago I started swimming in a race, and in a few hours it'll be after all, he said sweet.
In the finals behind Phelps for two seconds, the silver Japanese Kosuke Hagino won a long run.
Bronz won Chinese Wang Shun, a bronze medalist in this discipline from the last championship of the world.
After Alu Oerter (disk) and Carl Lewis (dall) Michael Phelps is a third athlete who has managed the same discipline in four games behind him.
After most of the race with Phelps, another American Ryan Locht and the household Thiago Perreira were in charge.
While the gold miners in the final crusader’s 50s planted a tree finish, they fell outside the medal position.
The American superhero will have at least one more chance in Rio to expand its unique medal collection.
Shortly after the celebration of the post office, he went to the final race at 100 meters of motels.
The legend could not shield even the countryman Ryan Murphy, who won the double mark - after a hundred wins in Rio and a double track.
At the final, he left 37 sets of Australian swimmer Mitchell Larkin, the third finished the Russian Jevgenij Rylov.
While Murphy has only the fifth of the two-storey championships since last year's championship, he became a distinguished king in Rio.
From the mental throne, Larkin, whose double success was just on the last world championship.
At the Olympics, he won the medals just now.
Canadian Penny Oleksiakov and American Simone Manuel were divided into gold at the Crusades.
For the sixteenth year of Oleksia, it was the fourth medal in these games, for Manuel the second after the silver from the staff.
Blue gold won the OH as the first African American in history.
I believe I can be inspiring to others.
This medal is for everyone who comes after me, sports will become love for them and get to where I am, said touched by Manuel.
The third was Swedish Sarah Sjöström, who won a 100-metre motorcycle race in Rio in the world record and still has silver from the Kraularian twin.
By the time the sixth world recordman, Cate Campbell, finished.
Japan's Rie Kanet, for which it was the first Olympic medal in the 1970s.
There is no precious metal or from the world championship, its maximum was the fourth place in this discipline in 2013.
The second silver in Rio was won by Ruska Julia Jeffimov, who, due to the start of the games despite the doping past, has suffered the inviolability of spectators and rivals.
I made a big mistake once.
But I won the court and I don't know why I should always answer these questions.
I'm so tired of it, she said to the Russian swimmer.
The right to start in Rio went off until the special panel of sports arbitration CAS just before the start of the game.
They got involved with my call, and I won.
If someone likes it or not, or if he has another opinion, whether he turns to the arbitral tribunal, she added.
Hermann: Disappointment, we could win.
And start at midnight?
I don't remember.
The Czechs had a special day.
Just a few hours before the match, they found out who he was going to face.
They had to cope with tactical preparation.
And then, in a non-radical time, the little court game number one started.
The first set did not start well, then the opponent jumped, but at 19:19 they failed the final.
In the other, they were clearly better and compared, but the decision-makers did not get out of them.
Above all, the number of services shown meant losing 10:15 and playing with the Olympic tournament.
"We could have defeated Russia," sorry Hermann.
How would you assess the game?
Hermann: After a bad start before I played, we got pretty into the game.
In the end, in the last balloon, the income that I used to get used to was mine.
We lost the set of keys.
In the next set, we came up with an overview of the game, another defense, and we pressed on the service.
In the tee-break, there's been a lot of damage to the administration, and we've been wearing this page.
It was a disappointment because we could defeat Russia.
Sluková: The damage to the beginning of the first set, we escaped there.
We were able to download it, but we missed the points.
The second set was great and decided the service in the third.
We made a lot of mistakes.
We gave them five points, and it was about the five, and there was a lot of confusion.
It's a shame because Russians were playable.
How'd you guys play in little castle number one?
Sluková: Similar to in China in the next door.
The media and the atmosphere were different.
There was an hour in the night, quiet and quiet, no music, nothing.
It was a difference to the center.
We wouldn't choose such conditions, but we can't choose.
What was the preparation for the match when you found out the name of the opponent an hour before the match?
Hermann: She was special.
We started practicing the game without knowing the anti-games, so we couldn't do the tactical training as other teams.
But Simon (whore Nausch) caught the tactic on almost all the options that were there.
He had a lot of paperwork with tactics, so we were pretty well prepared on this page.
Do you remember ever start a midnight game?
Hermann: I don't think so.
We played in the 11th, but not in the 12th.
Blok Rusky Birlovov in the pre-play-off on the OH in Rio.
Beach volleyballists Markéta Sluková and Barbora Hermann in a pre-play-off on the OH in Rio.
Was it unpleasant?
Sluková: By playing the last two games in the group since the tenth, we had a regime moved before.
This was two more hours.
It's strange, I can't imagine that another sportsman has to give his best performance in 12 hours.
But I think we've prepared the best we could.
We knew it would be, but it's not quite typical, and it probably won't be my favorite time for the game.
How do you evaluate the Olympic experience?
Hermann: Since the group was our target, it's on one side, okay.
We did what we said.
But now I'm sad after the fight.
Sluková: I'm going to sleep on it and from tomorrow I'm going to remember the Olympic tournament only positively.
The big brother's here, comes the first Shimmering SIM.
You won't let her go.
The new rules should apply to all persons without a Thai passport who, while staying in Thailand, will decide to arrange a SIM for one of the local operators.
So not only for tourists, but also for people with long-term visas, who, for example, work in Thailand or close their marriage there.
The Secretary-General of the National Broadcasting Office and the Telecommunications Commission Tatarn Tantasith informed that no exceptions would exist.
The SIM sale plan for foreigners exclusively represented the national telecommunications regulator at the beginning of August.
The new measures which enable them to monitor their position shall be adopted by the authorities within six months.
According to Tantasitha, it is a means of preserving national security, which enables the criminal activity to be handled by the victims of the crime.
In addition, so-called tourist SIMs have the help of discovering also persons who exceed the allowed length of stay.
In the case of sellers, a special SIM for a foreigner should also appear on the SIM side, which is intended exclusively for Thais.
The difference will be the function of monitoring, which will be permanently activated in the karate of persons with no Thai passport.
It won't be possible to turn it off.
"This function at the SIM for Thailand is not because you can always be easy to track," Tantasith added.
It must be added that in Thailand there are no prepayments anonymous as in the Czech Republic.
The seller requires an ID.
On the other hand, a few years ago one of the operators gave free start-up SIM to tourists at airports.
They were so anonymous.
The introduction of the same measures as Thailand also considers ten telecommunication regulators from other Asian countries including, for example, Malaysia or Singapore.
They are also currently subject to mandatory SIM registration, but the legal use of the monitoring system is not possible.
However, the measures in question do not mean the obligation for a foreigner to arrange for entry into the country of the local operator's SIM.
Of course, they can use roaming services with their own home SIM, in which case Thai authorities will be brief.
Operators of the country concerned know only relevant network information after crossing the border, i.e. after the application of the SIM to their network.
So they know the phone number, not the owner's information.
However, the difference in roaming prices against local operators' rates is so devastating that most tourists start looking at local SIM during their stay in Thailand.
The efforts of the authorities to oversee the movement of foreigners from foreigners living in Thailand have been legally facing immediate criticism.
The Tantasith situation calms down and, in relation to the protection of the private sector, the acquired system aligns itself with the obligation to provide a resident address in immigration documents.
The police will also need a court order if the person concerned needs to be monitored.
Any abuse of the system will threaten the imminent punishment.
"If the service provider is monitoring the position of the SIM without a court order, he will be charged with a criminal offence," Tantasith added.
The system should also maximize the use of prepaid cards.
While a specific number is currently being recycled until after the 90-day period after which the SIM has not been registered to the network, a new number could be restored after 15 days in the case of the release of Thailand.
Luxury apartment in the new building on Vinohradech has a pool and a terrace.
Why did you choose to stay in the new building?
We've been looking for an old-fashioned apartment where most of the property care is in existence by the administrator.
The condition was that there were enough parking and lifts in the house, which was essentially declassified by the older building.
Do not talk about problematic acoustics in old homes, problems with flooring, high energy demands, and so on.
There were also large terraces, which the old building is not able to offer.
Further interesting visits can be found in the magazine Modern Apartment.
The entire interior for you was designed by architect Lenka Langer with his colleague Kamilou Polákova from Artiga.
Why did you just call them?
Would you recommend working with an expert?
We would recommend cooperation with the architect to everyone if he proposes to stay from the beginning, that is, it is a very complex technical process.
The second equation is the interior design itself: designers have a much better idea of the scale of possible materials and based on the customer's desire they are able to sweeten the interior properly.
We cooperated with architect Lenko Langer already on our mountain apartment, then on the basis of a personal recommendation of another client, and given that everything worked well, it was a clear choice for us to rebuild our new apartment in Vinohradech.
What were your practical and aesthetic requirements?
We enjoyed a magnificent community-dwelling space with a suitable ground for a four-member family known as modern, but not a cold interior.
The priority was to connect the apartment with the terraces and realize intelligent household control.
And of course, the quality of implementation had to be undermined.
Did you leave everything in the labs, or did you do it on your own in the final form of the interior?
All proposals, including technical drawings and samples of materials, have been approved, but the proposal has always been taken from architects.
At first, we decided what we expected from the design, and showed some elements of the interior that we would like to include in the proposal, such as covers or images.
I think that just our collection of mostly Czech authors including the works of Karl Malich, Karl Vysušila, Václav Spály or Otto Gutfreund architect helped to guide our taste.
The combination of black, white and orange wood was also the idea of architects as well as individual pieces of furniture, walls, floors, lighting, blankets, textiles, art etc. What if all the ships are together, then we checked together using visualization.
Did you come up with a complication that made you give up your original ideas, or did you come up with a new one?
I hope only in the initial phase of the project, when we came to the building at a time when it was possible to get to the height of our floor, and found that the prospects we were planning were actually the shadow of the surrounding building.
Then we literally changed the layout from the base overnight.
Yellow was used on the kitchen line and on the cover of the blood wall.
In the interior, the wooden surfaces are then controlled by the complemented skin, for example, by choking Norma’s food and bar chairs from Arper.
How would you describe the interior?
Are you going to make any changes here or is there something you'd like to have today?
I think it's a modern air interior, which, above all, fulfills its purpose.
We do not understand the changes, most of the adjustments after movement have taken place in the level of shade and stay of the terrace.
Maybe the only thing on the floor is when the nut tree is shown to us as too good to be home with a dog.
Words by architects, Ing. arch. Lenka Langerová and MgA. Kamila Horniová, authors of the realization.
The apartment is in the last floor of the new building, so it was possible within the building to make completely new available solutions and several other adjustments.
For interior is an important element of placing light bulbs in the hallway ceiling and the main toilet.
That's how we got daylight into the darker space of the apartment.
Also direct entrance from the main bathroom to the roof terrace to the pool from the USSPA is one of the construction adjustments that was very beneficial for the entire apartment function.
Part of it is also a pool and a venison.
In comparison with France, you are not negative, says a Muslim living in Prague.
You're from France.
Where did you live before you moved to Prague?
My parents are the origins of Algeria.
I was born in southern France, a piece from the Spanish border.
I've moved quite a bit.
I lived in Toulouse, Lyon and Marseille.
In France, I studied journalism, so I got to work in a magazine.
So why did you decide to leave the country?
I started to feel like I was in France.
I just didn't want to live there anymore.
Especially because of the atmosphere between people.
I thought every Frenchman was very negative.
People in France are negative in general, but the last time it got worse.
That's interesting that you're referring to negativeism.
Some people, that's how they evaluate the Czech character.
Trust me, you're not negative in comparison with France.
Some people don't get that much when they come to France, because as tourists, they don't get that much.
But it was too much for me.
A big theme is money.
People feel they have little money, while the minimum wage in France is fifteen cents of euros, which I think is enough.
Now there's also a problem with people's behavior towards Muslims.
That's completely incomprehensible to me.
For example, in the street where I lived, my non-Muslim neighbor began to look at me through his fingers just because I was a Muslim.
It's like I was some kind of evil.
That's why I didn't feel good in France.
But my family stayed there.
So you decided to go to another country.
Why did you choose the Czech Republic?
I was looking for a job, basically anywhere else, and I found a place to live with Air France here in Prague.
I admit I didn't even know from the beginning of Prague.
I knew something about the Czech Republic, my dad even told me about what was going on in Czechoslovakia, but I didn't even know what to expect from Prague.
I've been here for three years now, and I can't imagine living here.
Was it a big difference when you moved from France to Prague?
Especially because of completely different atmospheres.
Maybe it's because I don't speak Czech, so I can't capture any negative reactions or hints, but I feel that people are more free here.
That I can do anything, get dressed anyway, and no one's gonna judge me.
In France, you're still being looked at by someone who's having special clothes and something like that.
I started to feel really free in Prague.
I don't think the desire for such things is what I think.
Where do you work now?
After working in Air France, I worked for one travel website for a while.
Then another friend and I set up websites on which people are offering and looking for shared housing.
So far, we are only working in Prague, but we would like to expand it throughout Central Europe.
Do you have any Czech friends in Prague?
I have two very close friends here who are Czechs from half, and two more Czech friends.
I have to say that the other specific feature of the Czechs is that they're getting more out of hand at first.
He won't let anyone go to the body right now.
It's quite different from where I grew up.
Everyone in the south hugs and kisses the face.
It's different here, but I understand it's a cultural issue, so I'm trying to adapt.
You mentioned not to speak Czech.
Is your language barrier a problem?
On the contrary, it's quite simple in Prague, because everyone here speaks English.
Even in the evenings or in the food.
I'd like to learn Czech, but I don't have that much time.
And by everyone having to communicate a little bit in English, I don't need to learn language quickly.
And every time I have a problem, there's someone who can help me.
Have you met with any negative reactions?
Maybe because you're a Muslim?
Not really.
It may also be that I work in an international environment that is more tolerant.
One experience is what I'm thinking.
My leader, Czech, once told me about the French football team and said something in the sense: They're not French, but Africans.
I'm pretty touched.
But if someone had a problem with being a Muslim, I haven't had it yet.
And even though my colleague once warned me of some anti-Muslim demonstration.
He told me not to go to the center to get me in there.
Protimoslim demonstrations in part relate to terrorist attacks.
How does the current situation affect you?
Do you fear that something like Paris, Nice or Brussels can happen in Prague?
I feel safe in Prague.
But the problem is, today can happen anywhere.
I probably couldn't imagine that something like this would happen in France.
And it's not just about Muslims.
Besides, Islam doesn't even know violence.
For me, the people who kill are not Muslims.
The Koran says that man has no right to kill because he is not God.
How do you feel when terrorists protect your faith?
It's very hard.
I feel shame and guilt, even though I shouldn't feel that way at all.
I try not to follow the reports of violence, but every time I read something, I need to apologize for something that's not really my fault.
I'm a completely different person, so why should I apologize for the terrorists?
We met at Jiří's place from Poděbrad.
On Wednesday, the common Muslims and Christians were protesting violence.
Did you record it?
I didn't know that.
But I understand that these people feel the need to prove they don't agree with violence.
I don't think they'd have to do anything like that.
Why should they feel guilty for something they didn't do?
Do you meet with other Muslims in Prague?
For example, my colleagues are from Egypt and other Muslim countries.
They're a little more religious than I am, so sometimes we have quite a wild discussion about Islam because we all see it a little different.
I'm from France, so I've been through another education, they must have been learning Islam at school.
We have different approaches, but we respect each other.
People sometimes associate themselves with the subordinated status of a woman.
How do you feel?
I don't fit in any way.
On the contrary.
I'm a woman, I'm strong.
It's related to not wearing any head coverings.
For example, hijab?
And it's signed in the way I was raised.
For example, my mom is a really good Muslim.
She prays five times a day, but she just doesn't wear a coat.
She always taught me that faith is a purely personal thing.
It depends on everyone who interprets it.
When a person reads the Koran, he should have his own opinion on those things.
So when I read in the Qur’an a passage that says, “God has told the Prophet to hide his wife from the sight of others,” I said, “I am not the Prophet’s wife, so why should I hide?
On the other hand, I respect it, and when I get to Iran or Saudi Arabia, where the suits are required, I'll take it.
Are you planning to stay in Prague?
So far, yes.
I didn't feel so good anywhere else.
I've been thinking about Poland for a while, but it's great in Prague.
I'll even introduce myself to raising my own children here.
I think dust is an ideal city for it.
The common Muslim association with Christians was a demonstration of violence.
The rider of the Kozelsko Fenclow wind in Rio hit the promenades.
The five-way voyages to the sea in Brazil's Rio de Janiero were carried out by Czech hunter Veronica Kozelské Fenclové.
In the class, Laser Radial moved in front of the final two trips to the tenth place.
That would ensure Czech participation in the final ride.
You're collecting bags like cashews.
They want to compete with the transporters.
The idea of using already planned routes for the transport of violence lies with the TV director Matej Liška and manager of the Prague music club Marek Gregor.
With a thought, life was inhaled by three applications with different geographical scope.
We dropped the national transfer application in May.
At this point there are thousands of cities and we will expand the network.
In Czech Republic, we want to learn it first, before we focus more on abroad, says in the conversation for IDNES.cz, a 40-year-old manager.
How does the Transfer application work, and who can benefit?
You download it and register for free.
Then you can enter the route and the details of how big a package you can carry and how much you want to carry.
Someone needs to ask for transport again that day.
When the route and delivery time are up, it's jammed, and the two of them come together.
In that moment, the chat will open where the two will agree to surrender.
How many people do you think you're supposed to have to register for every package to always find your courier?
I don't know the perfect condition, I can't estimate how many registered and how many roads it takes to be completely optimal and each offer is filled with demand.
It's already working on the main tracks, and it's logically easier than it's supposed to be on the road between villages.
The more people, the greater the potential of speed and precision.
People are also building trust and finding out that no one will run away with the package.
You didn't have to deal with that yet?
How many users have been in the service two months after the release?
At the moment, we have about 5 to 6 thousand people who create roads.
We consider this to be a success and believe that they will be packed further.
Don't you think the dispatcher's gonna be waiting too long?
We hope that we will be competing for large conglomerates only for the reason that we are able to deliver the thing the same day and for a fraction of the price.
In large companies you will pay a few thousand for delivery within two hours.
You'll have to pay a hundred or less here, because it's the way someone's already doing.
Should traditional transporters be afraid of possible customer accommodation in the future?
We hope so.
The market has a huge potential, a huge international transporter is fed here, as well as a commercial chain, where everyone began to buy and gradually found that quality does not correspond to what they are paying for.
No one wants to find in the box with a message that the shipment is to be picked up on the side, first on the day after 19 o'clock.
At the time, I needed the package for six hours and waited at home because it was important.
We want a better, faster and functional service that will not praise anyone and send out a signal to the competition to try.
Marek Gregor (41) and Matěj Liška (39).
No one ever acted in the field of information technology.
Marek Greger works as a music club manager, Matěj Liška as a television director.
In 2014, Shippancee LTD was launched, which uses already planned routes between the world metropolis, especially the aircraft, to transport packages.
In 2015, they launched a project to process a company that created applications for MALL.cz, Jobs.cz or ČSFD.
The programming lasted three-quarters of the year and the applications were placed on the market in March 2016.
The transfer application began to develop in December last year and was released this year in May.
This is the local version of Shippancee managed for the Czech market.
The applications Mesík and Mesík Profi have been developed since this year and made available to users at the end of July 2016.
It was the intention from the beginning to make all these applications that would one day join in one.
In Czech Republic, they want to apply and then, in cooperation with a strong investor, focus more on the global market.
The shared economy is a topic recently, and this is an AirBnB or Uber service.
Are you not concerned about the action in the area that no one can say so far, where is the boundary of sharing and where is the grey economy?
It's the same, just another product.
It is clear to us that if it is successful and we are going up there, we will be another step in the eye through the shadow of the economy.
But while someone saves and someone makes, it's not the intention to include financial authorities and tax controls.
Each user, either on one side or on the other, will be urged to pay his income if he does.
What do you think the service has so much potential?
The shipper saves and the carrier earns, then reduces costs on the way.
That's the strong idea that connects interest on both sides.
At the time of the social networks that people divide, we would like this to be brought closer.
They can create nice stories, people are happy to help someone, and they'll talk about it.
Maybe someone will bring you forgotten glasses, keys or pills.
People, according to me, have been missing personal access for a long time, and we say that this application is the service of people.
So, how do you guarantee that the chicken doesn't spray with the package?
Each user of the application together with the registration shall draw up a public statement and indicate a bank connection, a payment card or a credit card.
These are channels that give service and human credibility.
The riders also collect stars based on the assessment of the senders.
We offer insurance, we still ship details.
For uninsured shipment in case of loss or damage, the courier shall be held responsible for the content, in accordance with criminal law, if it is illegal and does not know about it.
If he is stopped by the police and finds himself in a closed box in his suitcase or ten kilos of hats, the criminal liability to the consignors shall be transferred.
Does the misuse of sensitive data from the database pose any danger?
The registrations are, where necessary, the investigating administrative authority, which as the only one will have the opportunity to observe them, and we are not able to see them ourselves, data are protected against abuse.
How much money will he get after a successful delivery of the courier?
Which determines the price and gets the full amount he's going to say.
Several percent are also taught to communicate.
This money is our profit, but it's just a few percent, because we want to push the volume.
The courier can't even charge that he didn't deliver the shipment when he actually delivered it, took it, and delivered it is verified using QR codes.
Are there any restrictions?
Whether in relation to the size or contents of the package?
You can carry anything.
We have three sizes, small as a bone of butter, medium as a plate of eggs and large as a base of beer.
Then there's no further restriction, and if anyone has a seat in the car, they'll probably transport the refrigerator.
Plus the sender has the opportunity to take a picture of the package application, so the courier sees what he wants.
You don't even have to pack things if you don't want to hide the contents of the exhibition.
Forget about the machine, you put the couriers in your hand, and that's it.
Who came with the idea, and how long did it take to get off the job?
A friend got the idea over two years ago, when I didn't pay much attention to it.
Then he showed me a demo application with an international reach that aims mainly at a traveling plane.
At the moment, I told him I wasn't going to look for an investor, but I'd like to stay with him and put him in the back.
The next year was the development before we founded the LTD Shippancee LTD in London due to the greater credibility of the entire product.
But this isn't the version you're focusing on right now.
No, marketing we've focused on Czech Republic, where we're trying to catch up with the application because it had all the birth pains and it's still something to solve and improve.
We are trying to react to the feedback from customers and the foreign market is not so much at the moment.
We know it's a long run, but we don't appreciate it, we want to create a really good product for people.
Shippancee LTD was the most basic and expensive application, the other two were in their way of upgrade.
The transfer was made when we said that the national segment could be far more interesting and that we would at least learn it in Czech.
The third application in Mexico is local, for the city.
But he can send the package to the exact address and to the second end of the world.
It works for the senders as well as the Transfer, but the difference is that in it as a courier you see shipments in the form of points on the map that are closest to you, thanks to the geolocator in the cell.
The application for the couriers who want to live with it, we called the Mesika Profi.
So someone can make a show by picking up the package after town?
Exactly, the last application will be downloaded to Prague like a taxi driver, a student, a mother on parental leave, someone who wants to take a trip to work.
As they're all messing with these shirts now, they can collect this all the same.
A person sees where orders are in the city, comes to it, clicks and sees when it must be delivered and sent.
It's more cheap than competitive services.
At this point, we're still doing a web interface that's going to be difficult for companies to send the shipments, the web will fill in on them, or create points on the map.
Then we're able to use the service to bill every month.
Are you now committed to full implementation?
It's bothering us, but we have it normally when we work so that we can use and develop the project.
We're not hiding a strong supranational investor, we're two guys, one of whom had a brilliant idea, and the other one jumped into it with other ideas and ideas.
Now we are looking for an investor strong enough to be able to anchor with us, not the Czech market, but who should go with us to the world-wide product and become another huge player on the market like AirBnB and Uber.
The historical part of Titanfall 2 should bring a close forgotten pest.
This will fix the second part and only the game in it will be more peached in the first information than in Call of Duty.
The length will move around the standard eight hours, and the full will come from the concept of the net load in the first part.
It is therefore possible to look forward to freedom of movement, which includes, in addition to running, the possibility of using war titanium.
In addition to the action passports, the game will contain a level-focused exactly on the reverse movement.
They're gonna remember the plates and cover the cracks.
To overcome them, therefore, there is a fundamental example of a double jump, a run-in and a chain-chain.
Sometimes, however, enemies will have to be eliminated.
There will be no missing maps that remind you of the fraud and with special concepts.
In one example, you will be able to lift and tear the plates and close the door.
You're going to be like a fighter.
The pace of the game should therefore be exacerbated between the raging actions and the calmer moments for exploring the unknown planet.
We're gonna play Jack Cooper's walker, and I'm gonna dream about the pilot's career.
Cooper at the start of the campaign, together with Captain Lastimos, is being plundered on the alien planet Typhon, which is inhabited by enemy soldiers.
And there won't be even a dark savage to him.
Lastimosa also suffered fatal injuries during the accident, and therefore Cooper will get the task of running the captain of the Titans.
His dream of a pilot's career comes true as soon as he's expected.
The first step, however, will be to steal the battery needed to fix the robot.
It's important that Cooper's talks with the Titan are also important.
The players will serve as a source of information about the military's past, but at the same time a robot-customed communication will create humorous moments.
For example, when a Titan will permanently eliminate all the injuries that Cooper is threatening at the planned height.
The first information about the campaign in Titanfall 2 brought the server Polygon.
The result will also be within two months and Bonusweb will bring you the first impressions of the network game after Gamescom.
Titanfall 2 ends on October 28, and it's for PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
The THQ mark will survive, but the original publishing remains dead.
Swedish company Nordic changes name to THQ Nordic.
In 2013, the THQ received a number of his trademarks and the right to use the logo and the name of the company.
Nordic has made use of it, for example Darksiders 2 Dieatnitive Edition or Red Faction Collection.
In addition, for publishing, another 23 games and 13 of them have not yet been discovered.
Thirty years ago, when I went to retirement, my wife, after thirty years of marriage, found a younger man, our neighbor, in twenty years.
I knew it from the start - first of all, it was obviously a long time ago, and then they went together.
He's such a big guy, probably her type, because he was walking in front of me.
She's completely gone mad at him.
In those first days, she even changed her voice, had such a girl, in love with her voice.
But when I told her that I knew what was going on, she got it.
But I've been watching it all.
At that time, he went from work regularly to half a quarter, and so she always left at three to buy.
Every day she tried to see him at least.
Later I found out they were meeting at his bar, in the laundry.
I knew how many times they were there.
I got my keys, he was determined to get them there.
But I don't know why, I've always stayed home.
I've never been able to go there, make that decisive step.
Maybe you'll laugh at me, but I believe that my wife was mentally controlling me.
Soon, I think she found out that I'm capable of doing what she wants me to do.
And I really did.
Maybe I'm just such a doll.
At the time, the neighbors told me they knew about it too.
I was such a fool I never asked them what to do.
I was afraid if everything went wrong, it would be bad.
That it's going to happen to everyone in the family, she just had a little bit of a shower.
So I always put it down, go on, go on.
But one time, I went to his apartment to get some help in the laundry.
He went there with me, and I told him that I got anonymous, that he was meeting my wife, and that he was telling me all about it.
I asked him what he was gonna tell me.
He stood there, shook his shoulders, looked into the ground and didn't say a word.
Then I also met his wife on the way out of the store at the time.
I told her, but she didn't believe it at all.
She didn't respond, and she didn't tell me either.
No one said anything to me back then.
I'm a man who's never gone much, who has a problem meeting someone, but finding a woman.
So I didn't even think about divorce.
I've always relied on it to end one day.
I told myself I'd forgive her all this and my life will go on.
But it wasn't.
And I've never actually dealt with it.
I've got it in me.
I used to give it to her quite often, but I finally left it for peace.
He's still living in a nearby house, and I'm still living with her.
It's just more than my wife's housewife.
She always did everything at home - cooking, washing, cleaning.
She's working.
She's always been trying to keep me from having another reason to complain.
And it can be said that it's good.
But sometimes I'd like to see her, hug her, and she won't let go.
We're going for walks and shopping together, and everyone thinks what a happy marriage we have.
But she used to tell me she never loved me.
She loved me, but she didn't love me.
And I see she loves him today, she's her god.
And I don't enjoy that kind of life.
When it started, and I was wearing it very badly, I told her once that she didn't want to live with me, and I asked what she would say if I did.
I wanted to know if she'd agree or not.
And that's what I wanted to hear from her: Yes or no.
But she thought and finally said, "But there's enough room here."
Prime Minister Manuel Valles wants to establish a new French Islamic hope that should serve as a bridge between the state and its Muslim inhabitants.
After terrorist attacks, France is fighting radical Islamists, and the government is calling for help from a local Muslim minority.
"If Muslims themselves do not help the state against those who violate public freedom, it will be increasingly difficult for France to guarantee freedom of expression," Prime Minister Manuel Valls said.
He intends to ensure that only spiritual education in France is taught in the country.
To stop, he also wants to mix funding from abroad, when money often comes from the leaders of the sighted jihad.
In October, Prime Minister Valls wants to establish a new French Islamic hope, which should serve as a bridge between the state and its Muslim inhabitants.
The new institution replaces the current French Islamic Foundation, which was founded in 2005 by the former Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin.
It had already contributed to the transparency of the financial flows between the mixes and the countries financing their construction.
Soon, though, internal conflicts struck her, and that's why she never worked properly.
"It's a total failure," Valls said.
In front of the new donation, it is likely that the former Minister of Interior and Defence Jean-Pierre Chevrenment, who is known as the founder of the secular state, will become the former Minister of Interior and Defence.
In France, about 2,500 mixes and prays, about 120 of them serve radical Islam.
Since 2012, some 80 Islamic clergy have been harassed by the French authorities from the country and several more decades have considered this step.
This week, the German police also attacked the Georgian clergy.
Imams reportedly beat the fighters for the Islamic state.
One of them operated a space where the believers allegedly radicalized and later attacked the Sikh temple in Essen.
Immediately after the attacks on Charlie Hebdo in January 2015, the debate on a new institution in France was heated, which will replace the non-functional reward.
All the other terrorist attacks, which on behalf of the Islamic State, have been carried out by the radical Islamists, have accelerated.
The new funding will have two main tasks - to ensure funding to mix from domestic sources and also to watch over the assets.
But it's not clear where he gets the money yet, even though he's considering a few proposals.
One of them is a special fee for food halls, especially for meat coming from defeat according to Islamic principles.
In practice, this tax would be paid by the sellers to collect food, for the purpose of granting permission.
A portion of the money would then travel to the donation budget.
A contribution of 10 to 20 euros could also be paid by French passengers who are issuing to Mecca.
Every year, they are on a traditional path to Saudi Arabia from France to about 30,000.
In addition, only teachers who have passed educational programs at dark universities should be involved in the French blends.
That's why their preaching should be in line with democracy.
The government also closes radical mixtures.
"Since December we have closed twenty and the others will follow," Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said.
"There is no place in France for those who report hate and do not respect the principles of our country, such as equality between women and men," he said.
Zaragoza.
His ex-wife was seriously injured by an unknown shooter on Friday morning at the shopping center in northern Zaragoza, an Independent newspaper writes.
There was a shooting after a woman and a daughter left the garage in their car.
The man was waiting in the car in front of the shopping center, from where he also started shooting.
According to the witnesses, the man then turned his weapon against himself, says the Independent.
The woman took the unharmed daughter to the hospital, and for the man in critical condition, she had to take a cure.
The crime occurred around 11 a.m. in the central part of the metropolis of the autonomous region of Aragon, near local universities.
With a call to the Spanish agency Europa Press, Independent writes that the motive was probably not resolved by the recent divorce of both partners.
Celebrations with a christmas, waving rhymes, a ring and a chili sauce.
This summer he wants a light, well-fated food, because we Czechs are rebels and we have our tastes and our heads.
And so out of the summer garden smells of grilled rabbits, beads, wild rabbits.
Nothing too healthy, nothing too easy, yet sometimes with the exception of salad or roasted vegetables.
The truth is, grilling is time-resistant, and also it's a social matter, and no one has to be locked in the kitchen.
But there are other alternatives to making good impressions that special stalwarts, their preparation is a small ritual, but there is nothing more to be done than cheating, piercing, cutting or breathing.
And they're still contributing to our health.
Whether it's a domestic sushi or sashi, where quality raw materials and a couple of well-contained grabs make the preparation a fun and food itself a genuine exotic box.
Just like even easier rolls in the rice paper from today's recipe.
Even here is a time-consuming cooking and roasting of rice.
The paper can only be wrapped in water for a moment and then only depends on the imagination of the cook, how he intends to play with the fillings and supplements.
There's no race like race.
The benefit of many Asian cuisines is that raw materials have already been generally available.
Includes loaded sugar-cooked toast, which is one of the basic flavors of the accompanying sushi or fresh rolls.
You can prepare it at home as well, but the right pink walnut has a unique picket tail and at the same time a pleasant taste thanks to the secret recipe, which mixes with several kinds of octopus and celery.
So just buy a bag of appropriate size, and the annex with detectable antibacterial effects, supporting fatigue and resistance to cough or flu, is ready.
Banana leaves.
They are used, in particular, in Buddhist and Hindu cultures in serving and obtaining food within the framework of various holiday occasions and rituals.
The long numbered banana leaves are very extended in a number of countries in Asia or South America as well as "help" for the preparation of the various cooked, cooked and roasted foods, which are packed in them as well as in alobal.
The banana leaf then transmits a specific flavor.
We are allowed to buy in shops with exotic fruit and vegetables, even previously cut into the shape of a doll.
But select only green-yielding leaves, and lo! they are clean and clean.
Similarly, it is easy to make salads from the vaama, sesame and sesame oil.
That one can buy cold again.
Anyone who often or prepares sushi will probably know a lot of crazy in particular.
In Japan, it is one of the most important species of seaweed, from which it is produced by pollinating, liquefying and drying the so-called nori list - the wages intended for the production of sushi.
Wakame - dark green breed growing in the waters around the island of Hokkaidó - is also fresh and dried and is as popular as a nut breed.
By the way, those who do not know how to harvest are supposed to be used by Asian women for breeding after birth.
And it's almost amazing in this range of effects.
Cleanssing blood, strengthens the blood circulation, even supposedly bans gray hairs and is literally absorbed by mineral substances.
The dried and diluted wax also serves as a root, for example for the taste of rice.
The fresh lines are first let into the water, then melt, put into the woman's water, and cook half a minute.
Then they cool in the ice water, cut down the middle ribs, and further adjust, perhaps as a favorite salad.
However, buying it is the easiest, cold, solution.
So there's only left to wrap the roll with an easy green, gentle and light, full of healthy tastes.
Such a long-term bomb.
If you give up and don't add the grilled beak.
Eat healthy, light and summer.
The Asians know how to do it.
Just a few special raw materials and a lot of sugar, and you have interesting fresh food that combines taste.
And it's ready twice.
Four pieces of rice paper, 40 g of ink, 40 g of white thread, 100 g of green cross, 60 g of salad kiln, 60 g of wama and 60 g of sweet chilli sauce.
Cross of dried coriander, black sesame spoon, cheese spoon of chilli sauce, 20 g manga and 40 g loaded gastropod, a little pine nuts.
First, we're gonna get some wires ready.
We'll put the rice paper in cold water for five seconds.
Then we'll take her out and wait for her to faint.
In the meantime, in hot water, we will soon bring out Christ’s samples, about three minutes after which we will let them cool quickly into the ice water so that they do not lose their color.
We're gonna put a lot of vegetables on the approved paper and we're gonna pack it up.
We are fully prepared from the white line, the carrots and salad keels, which we put on fine noodles, we mix them with sweet chili sauce, we add dried coriander, we mix thoroughly and put them on rice paper.
On the banana leaf we put Christian samples, add candles, and finally the whole cream we get a bunch of waama, loaded with a bell, a plate of manga, pick up a black mustard and add a couple of pine nuts.
Britain must be satisfied with silver in the septic rug, Fiji's choice takes gold
The impressive performance of the United Kingdom in the seventh race ended with a zero mark on the last obstacle, Fiji defeated in the final match on Thursday night in Britain at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio high 43:7.
The Fijians taught the master lesson in processing, puzzle, puzzle, supportive games, running to the lion and brutal forces - and they gained gold, their first Olympic medal at all.
The defeat came with an unsurpassed price of relief in the form of silver medals - for Britain on the third day - and the British could be at their performances in the opening Olympic tournament of the seven-year-old bear, defeated New Zealand, Argentina, and the South African Republic.
The prize won over South Africans 7:5 in the semifinals the same day , it may have frozen in the finals .
However, Fiji would also defeat a 15-member team in full health.
It's probably not going to be comforting for the British, but they can be happy that at least one of them will have a gold medal around their neck tomorrow: the main fan of the Fijians is Ben Ryan, the former head of England from Wimbledon.
The Great Britain has hit a piece of the road.
Eight years ago, under Ryan's leadership, they lost every match in Adelaide Sevens.
They lost the only one here.
This defeat hurts, but progress is irrefutable.
Fiji started a great deal, the British tunnels reflected for joy.
For Captain Tom Mitchell and other associates, it was like running behind a series of buses in motion and champions of the world Cup led 5:0 when Osea Kolinisau came out of the corner.
The timer showed four minutes and Jerry Tuwai added another down on the right wing from which the conversion was made.
12:0 and Britain is heavily affected by the ball.
Great Mitchell tried to stop the huge Leon Nakarawa and prevent his third score, but only Fijian slowed down.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua threw touchdown into the right corner and the British lost 17:0.
Nakarawa added another one after the return, and the hours still remained more than 1 minute... from the first half.
Vatemo Ravov then penetrated the tiny Brits and came to the lain where he scored.
After the conversion to point 29:0, the break was followed.
It was like Fiji was born for the 7s, while the British were still learning the surrender.
That's exactly what it is.
After half-time, the British made collective changes, and the Fijians' efforts stopped... for the entire four minutes, which compared to the first half, it was good until the brilliant mid-range of Fiji Joshua Tuis continued.
Dan Norton tried to get an opportunity for the British, threw the touchdown into the left corner at an increase of 36:7. But the victory had long been won by the inhabitants of the Pacific islands and their fans sang on the horns, had the flags and danced.
It was hard not to admire the completely gratified approach of the Fijians.
In the final moments, Mata Viliame, another attempt to win the Fijians, was over.
The writer called, the Fijians hugged and the Brits fell on the lawn all the way.
Earlier that same day Fiji defeated Japan 20:5 in the semifinal, and Britain defeated the South African Republic in the narrow semifinal - unlike one conversion.
Kyle Brown received South Africans in the first half to lead, but Dan Norton, thanks to his hard work, was able to see a defensive line and scored in the second half under the hook.
Well, the great late-story of Marcus Watson, Anthony's brother from England's 15th team, won - and finally also silver medals.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning, for the victory in the veslar race, inspired the fight of coach with cancer
You won't find more emotional gold in these Games - and that's what to say.
From the first recorded to the last, during 220 containing expenditures in history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found another meaning in their golden moment at Estacio de Lagoa.
While two were happy, there were three voices in the ship. When the ship was happy to raise the second Olympic gold behind it in the women's race, there was still a voice in the ship of the present coach Robin Williams. They are the first women in the history of British sports that have achieved such a result.
Their weight was absolute, overall it was their 39th race, in which they remained unsurpassed.
What we see - two excellent athletes, how by the water level they fly with an elegant labyrinth - does not reflect the nature of victory completely.
For every gold medal from the vesting is a battalion with a hand of help, which means a bit of difference. And no hands were more helpful than the hands of a coach who didn't know if he was living this day when he was diagnosed with cancer.
According to him, it was not true.
I suffered from the cancer of the bladder that can be operated, and I underwent this operation.
Without surgery, anything could happen.
It would be a very bad situation.
Somehow it changes your view of the thing.
Cancer was discovered to Williams in December 2013.
Luckily for the whole trio it was possible to undergo treatment at the beginning of 2014, except for the season, and to reduce the accident to a minimum - if we can call it under such circumstances.
I needed to make money, so I had to get together fast.
That's what it was for.
I was in the hospital and I went to the room - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at the time when they said a few steps were enough.
That's how it started.
The wedding itself is a journey, but this was more challenging.
Immediately after the victory, their first thoughts on Williams, who was very nervous in the morning, spoke less than usual as he tried to control his own discomfort.
Stanning, the captain of the royal department's pool, who has a mission to Afghanistan, said: "This week I was with emotion at the bottom, maybe it's a little extreme, but it means so much."
Again, it highlights how much it means to me, how much Helen and Robin and I worked together.
So far, it's been three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we wouldn't be anybody, so he's a huge thank-you, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't wish for a better person to train or a better guy.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost the only race in five years.
The two had a tremendous rhythm that their rivals could not balance.
Even in the final 500 metres, when the crews from New Zealand and Denmark began approaching, Stanningová had a very large reserve.
We've been focusing at a certain point.
Helen shouted, "Don't stop, don't stop."
It's really important not to let go.
We had a good start, and at the same time, we didn't try to achieve anything famous.
We didn't like the firehouse today, we just wanted to be good at it, go out and win the race, what happened to us.
He'll take two years to think before they decide what's to go on.
Glover's getting married next week, she's a TV fan of Steve Backshall.
Now he wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean to say it was gonna be my last race.
That would mean too much pressure.
It took about six months in London before they found out I was an Olympic champion.
It was all so new, and I was so stressed.
It took about four minutes.
I feel much better about it," she said.

Prison?
Rather than driving people for free, the cab driver says Rubes to break a complaint.
Six taxi drivers and former magistrate's official in Prague are, as CT has stated, a complaint.
You have made a number of reports in which you have discovered false practices and those who are to be in the group that will be before the court.
That's why you've been dealing with a few unpleasant moves with revealed actors.
How much is the report of the members of the organised group too overwhelming for you?
I was waiting for him to come to some court.
I'm particularly curious about judgment.
But I don't think they should be in jail.
It's nothing.
Primarily, they should return all the stolen money.
And they should get them back so that all the people will drive for free.
That's some kind of weird solution.
Does this mean, then, that you do not view the punishment as effective enough?
For me, it's enough that some of them are so scared that they don't do this job anymore.
For example, one makes a pingle, another weighs the pizza, and one of them is totally stuck to it.
The defendants can theoretically get two to eight years of prison.
You think it's an adequate rate?
In general, I have a problem with the exercise of freedom.
I consider it a bad punishment.
To put someone in prison, especially in such a case, is nonsense.
Such people should return to the company they took.
The fourth century saw the destruction of our country by the name and theft of the people.
So let's make a good visit now and let's get people out of here for free.
I can't imagine.
It would work as a public service.
As someone walks to collect waste, they'd get a car and free people would drive after Prague.
No, I really think they'll finally get a condition and they don't care.
They'll find another way to cheat somewhere.
He studied at the Miroslav Ondříčka Film Academy in Písk and then at the University of Tomáš Bati in Zlín.
It belongs to people who in the Czech Republic started with viral videos and videos directly for the web.
He works as an editor for Internet TV Stream.cz, where he shares in a series of series, now prepares the Prague Guide, which is intended primarily for foreign viewers.
The Rubes, in the form of short reports, advises what services to avoid in Prague and what the opposite is recommended to use without worry.
He used to film a series with names How to do it, City of Deceptions?, Life in luxury, And Enough! and Praha vs. Prachy.
In the complaint, they are spoken of as an organized group.
The police have been following her for months.
Can such a network of underwater taxi drivers be identified as Mafia?
They're such cute mafia people, not as we know from Kmotra.
It's more about the mafia - juniors, but the organization is sure.
It's just that they're looking at each other's staff.
The dust is completely divided.
I noticed that, for example, the main station does not like Paris, Paris does not like taxi drivers waiting for Karl's Lázní (disco club)
Everyone just keeps an eye on their place and every group is kind of organized.
It's probably a complex network.
However, only seven people, six taxi drivers, and one former magistrate's officer, who warned the driver to control, are accused.
As you're saying, the unwanted eves didn't disappear from the street.
So, what's the percentage between the Prague submarines in the taxi service according to your estimate?
It's a very small percentage.
The worst on the street is still.
I'm talking about Alex Ryak.
It's a man who's really dangerous - in his car, he's driving a telescopic shoe, and every Friday and Saturday he's standing at Karl's bridge and he's driving people.
When I last walked with him, he wanted me seven hundred miles.
His police didn't stop for any reason.
Only a few people from the whole big group were selected.
The same situation, however, is in other locations in Prague.
Thus, it is difficult for the seven people to pronounce the already pronounced praseus nonsense, which has apparently much greater dimensions.
Of course it's nothing.
It's gonna help, but all the evil isn't gonna work out, it's true.
Are there taxi drivers who steal foreign tourists still in the same places you showed in the reports, that is, at the Karla Bridge or in Paris Street?
Yeah, that's right.
They stand in these locations every day, and every day they break the statements.
He ignores both the city police and the Prague magistrate.
It's not a cocours anymore, but it's a total greed.
Business of Prague taxi drivers in numbers
However, some of them, as if it were only a part of the group, will be brought before the court.
It's already a break.
So I have to ask myself, do you feel satisfied?
If I took it as an excuse, it would be wrong, because it was my goal, and it would always be to improve the centre of Prague.
And even if I feel it's a little bit better, I'll keep going.
You need to press the door on the other side.
Even if the last thief stays there, we should still do something to remove him.
You can't take it easy.
But it's not like that, of course, there's more.
Are you still trying to confront them directly in taxis?
Sometimes I do test rides and I have to say it's still bad.
Just last week, I caught a cab driver, except for the same group, and he was very surprised to see me again.
He taught 560 crowns in three kilometers, even though he then claimed that it was 56 crowns (used a trick with a tensile cord).
He had the point, the police arrived, and this cab driver was so excited that he was still following the cops and asked them when someone finally gave him those 56 crowns.
A similar case.
A taxi driver on the taxi taped a ten - page stamp and stole tourists with 357 crowns.
Is it true that the rage of the treacherous taxi drivers did not stop even after you showed the faces of those who counted the foolish amounts for a short ride?
Their strength is still incredible.
How did it happen to that cab driver with 56 crowns?
The police sent him away because he had a bill.
And that will be, I think, a problem with the court (six taxi drivers and one ex-author).
On the one hand, there will be a cab driver with his bills, on the other hand, the police.
However, according to the decision of the Supreme Administrative Court, the magistrate must not use secret records from the taxi service vehicle as evidence at the court.
When I filmed their stories, the cab drivers themselves warned me about this precedent.
I've been taking pictures, but I've always wanted to use it in the report.
Are you worried that this fact could protect them from trial?
I hope every judge will understand that no taxi driver could drive for six or ten miles because he wouldn't live on it.
You've been talking about a trick with a ten-year-old brand, especially in front of foreign customers.
Is it still up-to-date, or are they worried about using this figure after publishing your reports?
I think we've been popularizing this trick by sending out the order.
I recently went with a cab driver, and he boasted in front of me that he was the honest cab driver.
Then I noticed that a black sticker was attached to the side of the taximeter.
When I asked him what it was, he said to me, "You know what it is."
If the taxi drivers didn't work too well, could a court order with their colleagues be effective?
Is there anything he can do to get them out of trouble?
You've been talking about how to cheat on your way, they'll always find you.
I don't think there's anything you can do about it.
But someone can push them out of these places.
And they're ferocious cab drivers who should wash themselves out more than they really should get away from there.
From my experience, I have to say that these ferocious cab drivers in Prague are fortunately considering.
But do they like to go against those who condemn their service?
They still have, but they're missing their mind.
They can't go into it and they can't say exactly what they want.
When they arranged this demonstration (due to the proposal for a comprehensive restriction from the primary office of Adriana Krnáčov), it was not very clear what they actually wanted.
They said they didn't protest against Uber that they just wanted to have the same conditions as this service, and then they said they wanted more than Uber.
It happened that they were just blocking Prague and creating only the best possible advertising for Uber.
How do you fully assess the approach of the Prague magistrate to solve the problem of driving?
It's clear that she had to go into this until the criminal police came in to figure something out.
The magistrate was short on it.
They had a mole who collected information there, which means that the taxi department did its job for a few years completely unnecessary.
I hope that this officer will be charged with the final inspection of all the frozen controls to be aware of what he has done.
That's the worst thing I've ever heard of.
I was even with him on a check-in ride, which I found out until then from their appointment.
A few months have passed since the last series was published.
What's the answer?
I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean,
Every time I have a friend from abroad, I'm gonna let the video go.
And then when we go to the Old Town Square, they're surprised that the same people who are seeing the pictures are really standing there.
Immaculately celebrated Prague Celebrations.
But seriously.
I'd set up a fence around them to get people to look at them.
Museum of Communism directly on the street.
My last question is clear.
Do you drive a taxi when you need it?
Sure.
I'm on my way to services where I don't have to pay cash, but with a card.
I use services such as Uber or Liftago, where there is no possibility of fraud.
There's also a lot of dyspepsia that's fair.
I've only taken a cab on the street since then.
The driver said, "Well, you've got the courage."
I'm in a dress for an Italian tourist.
It has already been written about the fraudulent practices of taxi drivers in 2005.
In that same year, the former Prime Minister Paul Bém went on a check-in tour to dress up for an Italian tourist and immediately to his first attempt, his driver drove about two hundred.
But editor Rubes had a worse experience.
The taxi drivers taught him to drive from Old Town to Václav Square 820 kroner, which is about 195 kroner per km, as reported by the reporters.
The Prague magistrate then set a maximum price of 28 crowns per kilometer.
There are also other surprising amounts in the report: for example, a two-kilometre road from the street of Paris to the Truhlářský stalo, a tourist 400 kroner.
The expensive rides also provided taxi drivers waiting at Karl's bridge.
For the ride to Angel, which has 2.5 kilometers, you have to charge six and a hundred crowns.
The marble washes mostly with clean water, the most without chemistry and the longer, the better.
Its impurities go well, even if at times the dirt has to be put down with a scalpel, it is necessary to remove it from the shields.
It's not easy and it's not going fast, she's getting close to her work restaurant, Vanessa Trostov, from Oldrich in The Hague.
Bottom pile: the tomb is equipped with a drain, after which it is necessary to go out again and again.
"The restaurant should be careful, patient and non-discriminatory in the working environment," she noted.
In Friedlance, it's not far from her first restaurant work.
Thanks to her, for example, the stone elements of the facade in the last tract of the Friedlant Council, she also restored the soybeans of St. Mary Magdalena in Zatiš, St. John Nepomucky in Friedlant, Piet in the Friedlant District Street, Marianský column in Friedlant or atlants across the spa in New City under Smrk.
With the refurbishment of Melchiora, Kristofa and Katherina from Rederna, Frydlanta started in 2011.
Now the surface of the stone elements is cleansed from the stain of uncleanness and the cross, the loose parts of the stone will be protected against falling and moving; either they will be thrown into the wall or to each other.
There is also treatment and preservation of the surface.
The inscriptions on the tomb will be made again.
"Then the writing begins with the burning of marble plates with red plated gold," said the State monumental care director of the city office in Frydlant Věr Sobotová.
There are no records of the past that the tomb would have been repaired.
I'll take a closer look at the openings drawn in marble columns.
They're hundreds of years old and it's about the remains after the funeral.
He was greatly refined, unfortunately, after Sweden's trip to the Thirty Years Wars, everything went away.
The letter of the funeral was read out, marked by Sobot.
In the church of finding the Holy Cross there are restaurants with a small surface like home.
After the flood in 2010, there was a need to put in order the burials that were left under the water, the churches were restored, the paintings in the tomb, and now the burial.
"We would also like to let ourselves in the future," Sobot said.
The church is in a very good condition, every year to maintain and repair money.
Restoration work on the refurbishment of the refurbishment tomb will total 128 thousand crowns.
They will be threatened with grants, and no money will be invested in this part of the recovery.
A hundred thousand crowns will just come from a victory in the national round of the historic city of 2015, the remaining 28 thousand crowns are then the contribution of the Ministry of Culture, explained by the mayor of Frydlant Dan Ramzer.
The representative decided to grant a refund on the opening of the refund.
Opinions of experts on future developments in selected foreign markets followed by indexes and comparison with the Czech Capital Market (PX) in the horizon of one and a half months.
Low volatility and growth prevail on the markets.
Who would have said that at the beginning of the year.
The American S&P500 index, which went through 12% of the correction in February, is today at a new historical maximum and has already signed 7% since the beginning of the year.
It reaffirms the iron rule that traders should never go against the interests of central banks, which have finally reached their own.
In a situation where the US shares are at the historical maximum again, the volatility mix, which is currently at the lowest since 2014, when markets grew satisfactorily and without fear due to the quantitative release of the US Central Bank and when the current Volatility Index (VIX) remained stable below the 12 per cent threshold.
And don't be.
Although the Fed market continues to prepare for a gradual increase in interest rates, the quantitative release in Europe and Japan is in full flow and has also joined the Bank of England in the last week, which will purchase 70 billion-libre bonds over the next six months.
The new wave of quantitative release thus pushes down such low results and contributes to almost complete elimination of risk and fear of the future.
How long will this condition last?
That's, of course, a million question.
However, there is currently no risk, the world economy is experiencing almost constant growth without increasing costs, the situation in the commodity market and China is stabilised, and the brexit is no longer essentially a theme, so we should not be surprised if, in a similar calm regime, American action continued.
It's a shame that Juncker doesn't study Klaus!
I'm very glad my friend Michel Barnier took this important and challenging task.
I wanted to make this difficult work of the experienced policy, said Mr Juncker, chief of the European Commission, when the French policy (actually experienced, because of the so many different supranational political functions that the better example of the so-called European elite would be difficult for us) appointed the European Commission's chief negotiator of the terms of departure from the United Kingdom from the EU.
Juncker's election has sparked signs that it is in the EU's serious interest to look with Britain for forms of future friendship coexistence.
However, most British media adopted the name of Barnier as Juncker's war act.
Barnier is a rock European federalist.
The Great Britain hates it.
As the European Commissioner for the Internal Market (2009 - 2014), he was concerned about the reform of European banking law.
He explained it as he could only understand it: a stubborn enemy of the English concept of free market and the model of capitalism.
The stand of multilateral regulation was a co-author of the so-called banking union and is committed to all that comes from the London Financial Centre City, promoted legislation to break the hard financial sector and services regulations.
So this Michel Barnier, the representative of Paris in a dispute with London, will be a tough, unbreakable, and apparently unbiased negotiator.
That's probably not a good news.
How not to mention in this context the peaceful and friendly division of the Czechoslovak Federation, to which so much has contributed the differences, overview and capacity of Prime Minister Václav Klaus.
That is why today the Czechs can be the closest friends and allies.
It's a shame that Juncker didn't learn from Václav Klaus - at least in this.
It'd be all right!
Earthquakes around Putin?
Master Kremlu missed his close Ivanov.
Russian President Vladimir Putin missed Sergei Ivanov on Friday from the post of Chief of President's Office.
We'll take his place Anton Warno.
She informed the Russian media of this with a call to the Kremlu press service.
Putin then indicated Ivanov's release on his own request.
At the meeting, which was broadcast by the Rossija 24 television station, the president said that Ivanov's desire to be the head of the President's office for a maximum of four years was coming.
At the same time, he announced Ivanov would be his special representative for the environment and transport.
The report on the exchange in front of the President of the administration, which will now be led by Ivanov's current representative Vyno, is considered rather surprising.
Ivanov, who is 63 years old, is identified as one of Putin's closest associates.
This former KGB officer in the past, for example, was a minister of defence and vice-chairman of the government.
He will now also leave the chair of a member of the President's Security Council.
Ivanov, at his meeting with Putin, said that the length of the interruption in the head of the state's administration was actually a record.
He's been in it for four years and eight months.
In this regard, he recalled that in 25 years since its establishment, 11 people had already been established in this function.
The receipts and the delicacy of Strýc are not playing the finals of the Shafárár.
So far, not one of the Friday tennis matches has been able to turn into final participation.
As the first battle to defeat Peter Quintov, who was subjected to the Puerto Rican surprise of Monica Puig after sets 4:4, 6:1 and 3:6.
After a while, the Czech deliists followed Šafárív with Stryc.
The winners of the Williams Sieges in the first set fell after the win, but two sets were lost, and Russia finally took advantage of the set in a short game.
The second set then lost by 4:6.
The Polish success in the afternoon program in Rio was recorded by the Czech village: skier Ondřij Synek won his semifinals with a review when the second Damir Martin of Croatia defeated even after his release in almost a second.
Today, the conditions were great, the wind calmed down.
I tried to walk as hard as I could, brought in the Son.
His opponents, unlike him, had to fight the process.
So it's got some power on them, so it could be easier to do that tomorrow.
But I'm not saying it's gonna be easy, it's just playing karate for me, said the Prague Duke.
Mirka Topinkova-Knapkova but didn't walk in Snyk's blinds.
The five-year-old hunter had a fourth position in the semifinal today in her ride, and on Saturday she was due to start at the B finale and fight from 7 to 12th place.
The gold from London doesn't work that way.
At first, I didn't go to the finals at the Olympics.
I'm a little sorry, but on the other hand, I went to a quality race, and I put everything that was going on.
The rivals were just better, the Topin's button was turned in front of them.
She fought to the end and believed that in her fourth games, he would get among the elite six.
The fight has given up just ahead of the target.
I knew the girls were balanced, that anyone could get out of this field.
I was surprised by the Chinese that she had such a finish.
And I thought I could go to the finals through the Rakušanka.
Unfortunately, today's life race, the 2011 World Championships said.
Far behind the final dams in Rio, a young shooter, Philip Nepeichal, who was unable to escape from his qualifications this time in bed.
Nepeichal sat in her 33th place.
Qualifications are the best way out for the Russians.
From the first peak, Sergei Kamenskii made 629 points, from the second Kirill Grigorjan (628.9).
Neeichal's gun had a value of 620.5 points.
The program was first started by athletes, including Czech Squads Kateřina Cachová and Eliška Klučinová.
The coaches belong to the eleventh place after the second Olympic competition, the Czech recordman Eliška Klučinová is twelve.
Head of British Katarina Johnson-Thimpson, which jumped to the height of 198 centimeters as well as the continuous second Belgian Nafisatou Thiam.
Both of them took care of the historical best performance in the course of the seven.
They tried to jump 201 centimeters, but they didn't make it.
German, Russian, who's worse?
When we look at the absurdity of the question, the German society has gone through a deep self-flexion, where the Russians are not.
In both large Eurasian nations, in the 20th century, dictators emerged, and they came to the power of regimes that were non-existent, brutal and terrible.
From 1917 to 1989, Russian Bolsheviks contributed a great deal to the 94 million victims of Communism, which the Black Book of Communism, whether it was a daily individual repression, targeted famine, incompetent war management or non-American experiments.
In a non - Nazi way, about 6 million Jews were hungry, and the total victims of World War II were estimated to be 60 million.
In occupied or abandoned areas, the Germans and the Soviets carried out miracles.
In Germany and the USSR, there were not only a few individuals, but a large part of the nation took part in either actively, passively or by cutting their heads to the sand.
It's not just the specificities of these nations, we Czechs are likewise guilty.
In Germany the immediate end of the war came denouncing, the Norimber Court.
But the most important thing came later.
When the children grew up, they began to ask: "Dad, Grandpa, why did you participate in such miracles?
How could you!
This has brought true reflection and healing to society.
Germany's elites have been taking care of the prosperity of the country, the elimination of poverty, the welfare of their citizens.
Now they also have other (often idealistic) goals, but certainly they can't connect them back to Alsako-Lotrinski or anyone - to the revenge - military attack - it may be recognized by everyone.
After the Cold War in Russia, there was no big reflection.
The window of possible positive changes was definitely closed at the end of the millennium when the former KGB officer (sic!)Vladimir Putin came to power.
The often criminal past is celebrated in Russia today.
Putinovski Russia's policy is remunerated, gaining lost territories, humiliationing the West.
The health, prosperity and the future of its own people is not worth it.
Fight yours, and the stranger will be afraid.
I still believe that it is only those decades of despotic regime that the Russians are not genetic or culturally low - destined for Asian (self) tyranny.
To whom does the growth of tension around Crimea increase?
Ukrainian army.
In the last days and hours, the situation on the Ukrainian-Russian border in Crimea has deteriorated.
To whom does the growth of tension benefit?
After a long period of relative peace, there was a further deterioration of relations between Ukraine and Russia.
The Ukrainian party's prison became a part of the Crimean peninsula, which was connected to Russia more than 2 years ago and is part of its territory.
Of course, reports from both sides of the enemy are contradictory, and it is difficult to verify them independently, and so we have only a chance to think about the old known question to whom it suits?
According to Moscow's report, terrorist attacks on Crimea have occurred on the Ukrainian side, which, of course, Ukraine rejects and, on the contrary, accuses Kreml of provocation.
Information on the arrest of Ukrainian special units in the territory of Russia has already come from the case of the pilot Savchenkove known answer that they were allegedly kidnapped in the territory of Russia.
If we were to join the Ukrainian version, in which would Russia benefit from the deterioration of the situation around Crimea?
The simple answer is: in nothing.
The escalation of tension around Crimea can only harm Russia, mainly from the West in the form of further sanctioning and strengthening the anti-Russia campaign.
In recent years, the backdrop of the immigration crisis to Europe has been shifting attention from the situation in Ukraine.
Ukraine's leadership has already lost total credit in front of its inhabitants when the current support of President Possenka moves around 15%.
Ukraine's economy would have long since turned out to be a generous financial injection by the EU and mainly by the IMF.
In this situation, the Ukrainian regime needs to refocus its attention on its country so that it can justify its further requests for financial assistance and try to improve its reputation before the voters in its country.
President Poroshenko and other members of the leadership of strength components want to again be seen as strong men who are afraid to build a large Russia.
It is only hoped that all those who are trying to resolve the open conflict between Ukraine and Russia will finally realize their enormous responsibility for the lives of not only soldiers but all ordinary people on both sides of the enemy and will stop their hostile actions.
Bulgaria first showed inflation in eight months
According to national statistics, inflation rates reached 1% in Bulgaria in July.
This is the highest value for several years (since June 2012) and the first non-zero value since October last year, when a positive inflation rate of 0,2 % was published.
The annual average inflation rate, measured by the CPI index, over the last 12 months (July 2015 – June 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 – June 2015) was -0.8 %.
The consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101,0 %, the monthly inflation was 1,0 %.
The inflation rate from the beginning of the year (June 2016 versus December 2015) was -0.2 % and the annual inflation rate in July 2016 versus July 2015 was -0.2 %.
Against the backdrop of the previous month, in July 2016, the road to the following groups of consumer goods: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), transport (1.8%), culture and recreation (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), other goods and services (0.3%) was marked.
Prices decreased in clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, household equipment and regular maintenance (0.5%), health (0.1%).
At the same level as last month, prices for alcoholic beverages and tobacco products, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communication and education remained.
The U.S. Secret Service was monitoring the hacker attacks of the Russians last year.
Information on Russian attacks was received to the public last month, when the Federal Investigation Office (FBI) announced that it was engaged in an attack on the servers of the side centre of the Democrats.
However, there is no mention of the Russian side of the attack.
Moscow's share of the attack has been denied.
The report on the monitoring of the alleged Russian attack was extremely secret, as its expression would indicate that American secret services monitor and reveal the hacker attack could also be the way they do it and the resources they use.
Two Russian intelligence services were involved in the attack.
New cybersecurity advisory body
The Russian track tracking material was encoded and only a small group of experts had access to it, Reuters wrote.
Only a small group of eight members of Congress' leaders, called the U.S. gang, were informed.
It is made up of both the heads of the chamber, Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan, the president of both the chambers of Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid, and four members of the Congress' defence and security committees.
The head of the Democratic Party of Donna Brazil announced on Thursday that he is setting up a cyber security advisory body to "stop future attacks and ensure the first-class protection of the Democratic Party's servers".
In the famous salmon from Albert, there was a dangerous parasite.
The chain was apologizing.
Based on the consumer's suggestion for health problems after consumption of food Losos wildly recognized - pieces 100 g, date of consumption 22.11.2016 carried out dirty hygiene checks in Albert's stores at Václavje Square and in the Městka.
The verification found that the L23012562/T4 stock with the date of consumption 22.11.2016, on which the customer notified that it was no longer available, and therefore the product of the same stock with the date of consumption was collected 11.12.2016.
The laboratory examination confirmed the presence of Anisakis spp. Anisakis simplex.
It's a parasitic worm of the trachea of marine mammals.
This is dangerous for a person - larvae in the body’s dot or whale fish are strong allergens and human haired live larvae can penetrate through the stomach wall into the internal organs, Štich said.
We apologize very much to customers for the problems of this brand product.
We immediately withdrew the stock item from the sale and for preventive reasons we also downloaded all the other stock items.
There was a doubt on the side of the supplier we're dealing with, and at the same time we let this product test ourselves, said Albert Barbor Vanko's Newsman.
If the customer bought this product, he can return it in any of the chain stores and get the money back.
The larvae will destroy the frost and enough heat adjustment
The seller was the company Nekton - Vrňata.
The hygiene authorities informed the Prague and Medieval Veterinary Administration of the existence of a dangerous product.
According to the food safety server, after exposure to parasites, people may be sick of anisakiososis, which occurs with severe abdominal pain, vomiting and nausea, or disease can occur inadvertently, the CHK has indicated.
Symptoms will be delivered within an hour to two weeks after the consumption of inadequately processed fish infested.
After three weeks from the beginning of the larval disease, the majority of the larvae will spontaneously leave the digestive tract.
Adult worms and larvae are sensitive to higher and lower temperatures, so they are killed either when they are hot enough to process fish meat or when they are frozen.
Currently, the veterinarians have also checked salmon with the importer of imported goods in the Mediterranean region.
Three of the five samples examined had parasites in them.
The consignment arrived in the Czech Republic in 1700 according to the State Veterinary Administration (SVS) at the beginning of April.
A total of 919 packages have been shipped to the Ahold chain.
At present, unsold product stocks are being downloaded from sales, SVS spokesperson Petr Peichal said on Friday.
As soon as positive samples were found, the veterinarians prohibited the dispatch of other products from the warehouse.
Seventeen-year-old Brit wanted to get out of Rocky, probably killed her in Russian.
After the initial excitement and rapid touch with the jihadite, who was killed by the dragons, there was an explosion.
The expected paradise of the caliphate has turned for British girls into hell on earth, from which there has been no escape.
The girl was related to her sister Halimo.
She called Britain all the time and made sure she wanted to go home.
Leaving the Islamic state is like trying to escape Alcatraz.
They're ordered to shoot without reason, quoted The Telegraph as a family lawyer who died of Tasnim Akunjee.
The last tracks were taken to Rocky, from there the girl called the last.
Then there's only a report about her death, but she can't verify it.
The family communicated with her from an apartment in East London.
Together they discussed how she could get from Rocky and cross the Turkish border.
There they hoped to meet the former student again.
Kadiza, however, was probably killed before she could escape because the house where she was staying was compared to the country in May, the British ITV News reported.
She added that the bomb was apparently dropped by a Russian plane that attacked the IS garden in Syria.
You would take the blue from the sky just to get your child out of the dangerous area, said Tasnim Akunjee, the family lawyer.
In the week that she (Kadiza) thought about escaping from the territory of the Islamic State, one Rakušanka was caught in an attempt to escape and, according to the information available, was publicly killed to death.
I think she put it out as a warning and decided to get nervous, according to BBC Akunjee.
The family would do anything.
Kadiza Sutlanaová, along with 15-year-old friends from Shamimo Begu and Amir Abas, were released on their way on 17 February last year.
At home, they just said they were going out.
But they headed to Gatwick airport and from it across Turkey on the territory of IS.
The family of the girl according to the lawyer did everything in her power to get Cadiz back.
You would take the blue from the sky just to get your child out of a dangerous area, and this family did everything she could, drank all the power to get her daughter home.
But it was not possible without risking their own capture, a lawyer added.
The only positive thing he thinks is that Kadizy's fate can serve as a frightening case for other girls or even boys who let themselves be fooled by Islamic propaganda.
"There are many cases when people went out there, they realized how things were, they understood how far they were different from the promises of the Islamic state propaganda, and they wanted to come back," Akunjee said.
The fate of Cadiz's associates is unknown.
Since they have also been silenced, their families must focus on being most likely dead.
In prison for money.
In Scotland, you can go to a network without committing a crime.
For many centuries, Inveraray was the town center and the headquarters of the Duke of Argyll.
Since the middle of the 18th century, the court's council has been held and the basement has served as a local prison.
The conditions in which they lived were sad and many prisoners tried to escape.
Many of them have succeeded.
Therefore, the city representatives decided to move the prison premises to a new place.
The new building was completed in 1848 and was much more attractive to prisoners, with heating and gas lighting.
It has not been in operation for a long time since the end of August 1889 for economic reasons, since the smaller repair equipment was operational and did not pay too much.
The stories of the prisoners and the ghosts.
For the public, the prison opened in a century later, visitors can compare the old building to a new one to convince themselves of the different conditions in which they were mastered.
Guides in old costumes are still strengthening their authentic experience.
To see, there is also a torture room where visitors can learn what forms of punishment were applied to the criminal, whether it was the grinding of the fingers or the burning of the marks on the body.
In the context of the survey, tourists can be confined to one of the goals, mostly because of the photograph on the memory, or to indicate the sense that the prisoners live behind the grid.
By the way, the Inveraray prison is one of the most famous Scottish sites where he supposedly fears it.
There were already several groups of paranormal hunters, and to this day the museum enables people to come to hunt some ghosts.
That night, however, comes to 300 pounds, which is estimated to be about 9500 crowns.
In addition to this popular tourist attraction, the village also attracts great food, surrounding panoramas and history.
"Anime" effect on Snapchat is criticised as Asian cartoon
According to Snapchat, this filter is inspired by animation, but some observers say it's racially insensitive.
The Snapchat application allows about 150 million users to change the reality and play with the identity of ways that border with absurdity every day.
You can make yourself a pineapple, a dog or a figure that would come out of Roye Lichtenstein's picture.
Filters are simple tools that deform reality and generate more than 30 million improved selves every day.
Any mistake will be made immediately.
The Snapchat filters in the past have served their criticism of the fact that the application promotes blackfaceting or that it supports the white stains of the skin as an ideal beauty.
So when this week she offered the users a filter, which made them look ugly, curved teeth, and accentuated faces, some critics called it the racist character of the Asians - "yellowface."
And they wondered if these repeated controversial questions did not indicate a bigger problem for society - a problem with diversion.
On Wednesday, Verge and Motherboard wrote and the news and excitement spread rapidly and Snapchat immediately indicated that the function was interrupted.
The company offered an explanation: The filter was intended as an expression of the account I set souls, not as an Asian cartoon.
But to observers who witnessed racism, the filter recalled painful stereotypes in action.
The others refused to compare the package with the spirits.
Grace Sparpani, a student of American art from Korea, whose photo tweet was widely shared, stated in the e-mail that the filter was "at least harmful and embarrassing."
She added that “it is difficult to argue against the comparison of obvious Asian cartoons and filter effects.
It is shown that the filter is not only about the yellow face (yellowface), but that the yellow face is involved in the creamy extremities.
Snapchat is not the only company that has crossed these cultural boundaries.
It seems that American culture has an endless fight for diversity and inclusiveness, from sitting in companies after Holywood and the equipment that we all carry in our hands.
And the huge number of young people on Snapchat - who are more racially diversified than their older partners - can mean that even more sensitivity can be expected.
“When a Snapchat filter creates a picture that is offensive to some user,” said five-twentieth Katie Zhu on Thursday in the conversation, “but these things will be very difficult today without notice, as it was earlier.”
Katie Zhuová, a product manager and designer who works for the Medium, decided on Thursday to remove his account on Snapchat and urged others to do the same.
In the article for the Media and in the telephone interview, she stated that she was convinced that racially motivated problems reflect a lack of diversity in the recruitment of workers in Snapchat.
Katie Zhuová criticized the excessive white, completely male management of the company and the article included hash tag: #DeleteSnapchat.
“It’s like they don’t have any fun and color people between employees at the moment when they decide on these things,” said Zhuová, who has Chinese-American origin, “or color people work there, but not in positions to feel safe or pleasant to talk about.”
Other observers share her opinion - the complaint that Snapchat left to a considerable extent without an answer.
The company shall not publish the numbers relating to the diversity of its employees by having a private company status.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to talk about the racial origin of his employees, but according to the speaker, she recently accepted a recruitment worker who should focus on the poorly represented population and on the internal management of inclusion.
Zhuová adds: “I’m curious if they really need other users who can say that it’s not okay, ” with their account being canceled.
Military officials have outlined reporting information on IS, says the parliamentary committee
In a report issued on Thursday, the Parliamentary Committee stated that the officials of the United States Central Authority had changed the reports of the intelligence service to reflect a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than the country's events.
According to the preliminary report by the Working Group drawn up by the President of the Republic of the Armed Forces Committee, the Committee for the Reporting Services and the Sub-Committee for Defence, a "extensive dissatisfaction" was found among the analysts of the Central Intelligence Service, which changed their evaluation of the American effort to defeat the Islamic State.
The Central Command, known as CentCom, is an army headquarters in Tampea, Florida, which oversees US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
The press statement states: “The outputs of classified secret services approved by senior officials of Centcom have usually offered a more positive picture of the U.S. counter-terrorism efforts than confirmed by facts on the ground, and have consistently been more positive than analyses obtained from other parts of the reporting community.”
"What happened in Centcom is unacceptable - our fighters are injured when a misanalysis is submitted to the top political developers," said Ken Calvert, Congressman and Republican from California.
The settlement in the management of Centcom is up to the top of the organization.
The December report details the continuing problems of the Central Staff in describing and analysing American efforts in training the Iraqi forces in 2014 and 2015.
Although no decisive evidence is provided that the senior representatives of Obama have ordered the reports to be amended, it is stated in the report that the analysts felt that they were pressured by the Centcom leaders to present a more optimistic view of the dangers posed by the Islamic State or the IS.
"In the first half of 2015, there were many press reports from the Central Staff, statements and statements from the Congress significantly more positive than what events were actually happening," the report states.
For example, the representative of Centcom publicly stated that a major military attack on the takeover of Mosul could start in April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"This is quite clear after months of investigation," said the representative of the Republic of Kansas, Mike Pompeo, in a statement.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the highest position staff of the US central reporting staff had manipulated the staff with reports of the staff with a view to baccalating the danger of IS in Iraq.
The Republicans set up a working group after learning about the concerns of analysts that information from the intelligence services relating to the Islamic State is being manipulated.
Following the report published on Thursday, further examinations have to be carried out.
In Centcom's intelligence services, further investigations are being carried out by the Department's Chief Inspector of Defence.
The Democratic members of the Committee on Reporting Services published their own findings on Thursday, which corresponded to some of the conclusions of the working group of the Republicans.
"Centcom has established a very close process between 2014 and 2015 to assess information on IS and the Iraqi security components," said representative Adam B. Schiff, Chairman of the Committee and representatives of the Democrats.
According to Adam Schiff, this process "has led to the conversion of the outputs of the reporting services", has damaged the morale between analysts and "has taken insufficient account of the inconsistencies."
However, Schiff and the Democrats claim that they have found no evidence that the White House would try to pressure Centcom analysts to adjust their conclusions according to the "proposal or political situation".
The preliminary results of the parliamentary investigation were published in the Daily Beast on Tuesday.
In August, the New York Times reported on the ongoing investigation by Inspector General Pentagon, which was initiated after Centcom's complaints.
Commander-in-Chief Patrick Evans, spokesperson for the Pentagon, stated in his statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment because the investigation of the Inspector General is still continuing.
He stated, however, that "the experts sometimes disagree with the interpretation of complex data, and that the reporting community and the Ministry of Defence welcome a healthy dialogue on these key issues of national security."
The investigation has an impact on the scope of the question of whether the Americans led the bombing in Iraq and Syria are successful (a sentence now declared by the increasing number of defence representatives).
However, last year's indictment has raised questionnaires as to how much President Obama can rely on the central staff to assess directly the military operation in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis sites.
The criticism of the Islamic State's report reflects conflicts for more than ten years, when the analyst of Centcom's intelligence services, Gregory Hooker, wrote a research work in which it was stated that President George W. Bush's administration - despite the opposition of many analysts - defended a small unit in Iraq and spent only a little time thinking about what would follow the invasion in 2003.
Hooker also played a key role in resisting the Islamic state's intelligence services.
Last year, the authorities announced that Hooker's team had reached the conclusion that despite the public statement of objections, air strikes directed against the refinery of the Islamic State had not significantly weakened the financial resources of this terrorist group, as the group had developed temporary refinery and oil sales on the black market.
The Times reported in September that the discovery was not transmitted outside the central staff.
Commander Centcomu, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was then criticised last year after many legislators were found to testify to the Senate's too positive assessment of the war.
General Austin retired in April and in Centcom replaced her by General Joseph L. Votel.
USA won the ground hockey in the fourth match in a row, so today will play the decisive match in the UK team
Katie Bam, in the match against Japan, who ended victory 6:1, shot three branches and only a day later for the American women's team of ground hockey, shot the first two races of the match in which India 3:0 was defeated on Thursday.
Five branches in the two matches are a good memory, but Bamová (27) said she was not sure if something like this ever happened to her.
"I have no idea," she said.
I don't belong to those who write their own receipts.
But he knows this: Americans at the Olympic tournament are leading the 4th and they are the first place in the group with the Great Britain, which remained on Thursday after the defeat of Japan 2:0.
The UK and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last round of the first round.
Both teams qualified to the quarter and the match will decide which of the six teams will end in the first and second places.
A team from the first place will be removed from the strong Danes, who are in the head of the second group for a while.
No matter how Saturday the game ends, the Americans here caused their surprise ride, four years after they finished between 12 teams in London.
There was Bam on that team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and took the hockey to the ground hockey first when she was 3 years old (her older twin sisters played in Drexel) and joined the national team when she was 16 and became his youngest player at all.
The Olympiad escaped in 2008 because it was not on the final record.
Then came the year 2012, when it didn't happen much to her or to her team members.
Next year, the coach was appointed Englishman Craig Parnham and things began to change.
"Cultural change, mental change, physical change," said Bam.
In London, we didn't have the pace of work we have today.
We've made a complete turn.
On Thursday night Bam began in the first half of the shooting of the branch known as closeness.
India entered the match without a victory in the tournament, but the team proved to be surprisingly hard and kept score 1:0 until the end of the third quarter when Bam took advantage of the opportunity.
She ran off the left side of the playing field, then she called in the middle and shot the ball into the market to get the Americans to lead 2:0.
Melissa Gonzalez added the last white in half a quarter.
The cut-off of the American barrage, Jackie Briggs, who, in each of the three wins, helped one bronze, was at least the first in the tournament.
She's in excellent shape.
Just like Bam.
"We're in a good place now," said Parnham, but how good it is, it's going to be the result of a Saturday match.
Trampoline Zen mid-Olympics
It doesn't matter where you are, it doesn't matter how many hours it is - it's an olympiad.
From the experience in Rio de Janeiro, it is felt that competition and effort are persistent, unwieldy and busy.
It's like the Olympic origin itself would be a hot sticker that's handed over by a swimmer, a gymnast and a triathlonist.
You can't turn on the TV, read the newspaper or listen to your neighbor's conversation in the front of the café without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the hostility between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then Logan Dooley is.
Dooley, a lovely woman in the face, is at the Olympics for the first time and could also be among those whose name sounds in the homes in the main broadcast time between advertising and sponsor meetings if he was a swimmer, a gymnast or even a screenwriter.
But Dooley (28) from Lake Forest in California fights for Olympic gold in trampoline jumps.
The Olympics don't light up all the competitions anyway.
Far from the center, a little in the shadows are sports that are not generally recognized: shooting from air pistols, lightning shooting, badminton, taekvondo.
We'll always have success in a classic swim style - and it'll probably rule for a long time.
But if I can name my extraordinary favorite, let me point to the invincible charm of the trampoline.
Although the jumps to the trampoline Olympic sport since 2000, when they were first introduced to games in Sydney, after 16 years of intervention, this sport remains almost unnoticed - many of the people I questioned, nor did he know it was Olympic sport.
It can be regional greed.
The U.S. never got medals in the trampoline jumps and none of the athletes even got to the finals by 2012.
Prices in the male category are usually shared between China and Russia and in the female category between China and Canada.
This year gold medals from London will cover Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada.
The jumps on the trampoline have yet another charm, partly because the ear of the unencumbered one will seem to fit more at the clown university than at the Olympics.
I have to admit that I'm not an expert, but only the soul that follows from the earth.
It has a comic potential - a comical vibration of infinite reflection - but also the warmth of gymnastics and warming, two sports that combine.
The word "trampoline" is derived from the Spanish "el trampoline", which means "Skocan board".
Aspiring champions jump on a huge trampoline that shoots them up to about 10 meters high and carry out compositions with several elements (salt, heat and combination) before finally landing on their feet.
According to the official Olympic programme, they are assessed according to implementation, difficulties and "air times".
In Rio, there will be twenty athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women.
The usual trail of the Olympic route is ahead.
The gold medalists must go further, faster and even higher, sometimes to the end, sometimes back and forth, up and down.
He tries to build not only a target band or a starting wall, but also another line of thought: a world or an Olympic record.
This unanimous effort is noble, amazing, a little fanatical - and enough to bring the spectators to tears.
But I think it's a little exhausting at the same time as watching the Olympics.
Jumps to the trampoline in this respect bring a fall.
The track of the athlete on the trampoline is heading up.
It doesn't make sense to move forward.
He or she looks like they're in a state of no weight, like astronauts, flying up, then down, and then again without us up.
Without competition and, of course, no difficulty, but after the duration of the composition, there will be no fierce struggle to achieve the goal, no retrieval of distance, but only perfect, smooth delivery of time and gravity.
This is only near when the Olympics are approaching.
Qualifications and finals of women take place on Friday afternoon, at 13 o'clock in the east time, then on Saturday at the same time.
The NBC station will send the finals within the afternoon block, which starts after both days in 14 hours.
In the midst of the Olympic madness, they promise a peaceful, pleasant moment that you will probably see through the other battles.
And if the attention is to be achieved only so that male athletes will be the subject of the favorite views and disappointments - as the Wall Street Journal recently suggested by the gymnasium USA - then Logan Dooley is just waiting for his new fans who are crawling on the breath.
"Protesting Generation" in Ethiopia, long-term United States
Violent protests in Ethiopia
The demonstrators demanding political changes in Ethiopia have attacked the violent resistance of the government.
The witnesses claim that a lot of protestors were shot during the shooting with the police.
The threat to Ethiopia's war?
In the past decade it was one of the most stable nations in Africa, a strong Western alliance with a rapidly growing economy.
Over the past few months, however, the country has been enjoying the anti-governmental problems that are spreading to more and more areas.
In the last few weeks alone, thousands of people have been in the streets demanding fundamental political changes.
According to human rights organizations, the government’s reaction was unmerciful.
The witnesses claim that the police have shot and killed the representatives of the unarmed demonstrators.
In the rolling video recordings of protests that probably come from the end of last year or early this year, security forces members are captured, as young people humming with holles after being forced to stand at the wall on their hands.
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights is now requesting thorough investigation.
"It has always been difficult to keep this country together and make the move even harder," said Rashid Abdi, project leader Horn of Africa for the International Crisis Group.
Ethiopia is the second most populous nation in Africa, and its stability is supported by the West.
American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to eliminate the threat of a terrorist attack in the area, especially in Somalia, and many from African countries, if any, receive such assistance from the West.
Ethiopia's economy has evolved at an impressive rate.
Its infrastructure has improved in a key way - in Addis Ababa's capital, even driving a new suburban train.
And the streets of the city are typically quiet, safe and clean.
Ethiopia, however, can hardly be seen as a model of democracy - an organization fighting for human rights without standing speaks of government repression - opposition in the country has been suppressed, dissidents have been effectively silenced.
Many were imprisoned, imprisoned, killed, or driven far into the wilderness.
But that can change.
"When people are thirsty and they have no choice but to protest, there is a breach," said Seyoum Teshome, who teaches at the University of Central Ethiopia.
He's protesting all the young people.
He's been protesting the whole generation.
The complaint is many and it concerns all of the ground disputes after absolute control of the power of the ruling coalition.
After last year's elections, which were widely criticised, the ruling party received the last chair held by the opposition and now controls 100 per cent in parliament.
At the same time, the pressure on the border with Eritrea increases. The conflict along this clearly marked, disputed border in June has demanded hundreds of lives.
Anylistics are afraid that separatist groups, which have been more pressured over the past years, such as the Oro-Free Front or the Ugandan National Free Front, can try to use the confusion and re-arm themselves.
There are several factors that explain why these bitter feelings have been burning again now after years of flooding under the surface.
The first one seems to be harmless: smart phones.
Many Ethiopians have been able to communicate through social networks up to the last few years, when cheaper cheap phones have become available and Internet services have improved.
And even though the government prohibits access to Facebook or Twitter, as is usually the case during protests, many people can still communicate through the Internet proxy that hides the position of these people.
Several young Ethiopians spoke about how they gathered for protests.
Moreover, there is greater solidarity between Oromy and Amhary, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
Oroms and Amhars are not natural allies.
After the long years of Amharic, mostly from the Christian peaks of Ethiopia, they had come out in politics and commerce and used Oromas, many of which are Muslims and live in the lowlands.
But that also changes.
"We are on our way to united leadership," said Mulat Gemechu, leader of Oroma.
The biggest protests occurred in the areas inhabited by Amhary and Oromy.
Many Amharians and Oromas believe that Ethiopia is unjustly dominated by the Tigris ethnicists, who make up about 6 per cent of the population and control the army, reporting services, trade and politics.
The third reason for the troubles is the death of Melse Zenavi.
Zenawi, the former leader of the rebels, was the Ethiopian president of the government for the entire 17 years until his death in 2012, when he suffered the disease.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could see the corner.
Analysts say that especially masterly he was able to detect the initial signs of discontent and use the senders to process and obtain the opponents on his side.
"The current regime loses fundamental consciousness," said Abdi, an analyst of the conflict.
The new president of the Ethiopian government, Hailemariam Desalegn, was removed from relative ignorance with the aim of replacing Zenavi.
Unlike Zenawi, who came from the Tigris north of Ethiopia, Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts claim that he does not have confidence in the security services of the Tigers.
Many fear that the result will be another spilling of blood.
Finally, Ethiopia experienced such anxiety in 2005 after thousands of people protested against what analysts labeled as elections that the government picked up and then stole.
He followed a tough approach, during which there were many protesting killings - although less than in the past months - and this period of troubles passed relatively quickly.
Development experts assessed Ethiopian leaders for visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new urban train and measurable progress in the fight against poverty.
It is obvious, however, that the gradual rise in disputes within the Ethiopian government did not stop it.
And it comes to dangerous ethnic formation.
Last month, Gondar protesting in the city of Gondar attacked businesses owned by Tigers and anti-Tigers on social networks is becoming more and more common.
Analysts say protests create an unpleasant situation in the United States and other Western allies.
The U.S. government is using Ethiopia as the basis for the transfer of drones over neighboring Somalia, even though it recently declared the base was closed.
While the West wants to strongly support democracy, at the same time it does not want its allies to break down in such a continuous area.
"That," said Abdi, "is a very sharp edge of sharpness."
Donald Trump explains his sentence on Obama and funding IS as "sarkasmus"
Donald J. Trump tried to baccate the latest controversies on Friday, which floated his campaign, stating that he did not mean it, when several times this week he insisted that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the terrorist group of the Islamic State.
The explanation raised new questions about the ability of the Republican candidate to speak clearly to the American public.
It also puts into an unpleasant situation his opponent, who strongly defended him in a stormy time and must explain that he may not have thought his remarks seriously.
After this proposal for a Wednesday night meeting, Trump confirmed the statement on Thursday and continued in the discussions that he did not really intend to say that the President and Mr Clinton IS had been created.
However, in a Twitter contribution Friday, Trump said he was just sarcastic.
The contribution was repeated to the old one only one day when Trump said in a few interviews that he was serious about his accusation.
When the conservative voice moderator Hugh Hewitt tried to mitigate the remark to the effect that Obama was trying to destroy the IS, the Republican candidate did not respond to the president.
The latest storm comes at a time when Trump tried to focus his campaign on the economy, while his preferences in pre-election surveys declined.
Trump and Clinton took part this week in Michigan duel on economic issues.
On Friday, Trump tried to get back to this topic.
On Twitter, he again warned that Clinton's proposals were linked to an increase in taxes, and he stated that according to him, her speech was boring.
Trump used a sarcasm defense before.
At the end of July, when he made his criticisms when he came up with a proposal that the Russians should go through to Clinton's e-mails, he later explained his note: "I am of course sarcastic."
This approach enables Trump to push the limits of political declarations and to reduce them as necessary.
“I think it’s his way of testing to what extent some reports have responded to his beneficiaries in order to find out how they react, and then in response to one or the other way of “explanation”, said Ruth Sherman, a communications specialist who was monitoring the language used by both candidates.
But I also think that he is perverse in his statements and he knows that they are sufficiently sensitive to be able to explain them differently.
Because the results of pre-election research in its benefit continue to decline, Trump has chosen even more fortunate tone in the last days, rather than slow things down for ordinary voters.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist survey, which was published on Friday, showed that Tump is with a great distance to Clinton in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado and very close to her in Florida.
Trump is trying to avoid the provocative sentences he says, but he often blames his criticisms for misinterpreting his words or for not understanding his sense of humor.
But together with Trump, in the final months of the presidential campaign, increased attention, Trump's jokes led to the unpleasant situation of his loyal support, which must be made public, whatever his remarks are as provocative as possible.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former prime minister of New York City, which is one of the most prominent Trump climbers, had to defend the candidate in the CNN interview on Thursday.
"I suppose what he says is a valid political comment," Giuliani, when asked about the credibility of Trump's claim that Obama and Clinton founded the Islamic State.
This is true in the sense that in front of Obama, IS was almost unknown, a small organization he called the newest, and it came to this because his army had arrived from Iraq.
Most of the ordinary Republicans are trying to argue that Obama's government, in which Clinton acted as a foreign minister, allowed the IS to prevail and failed to deal aggressively with the situation in the Middle East.
Before Friday's meetings in Pennsylvania Trump continued on Twitter, he set a fire on the news media because they passed his word and were engaged in it.
He talked to the “poor, pathetic” television students who tried to understand her and said, “It can’t! ”
Several Democrats apologized to Trump for the fact that this is only another proof that he is not qualified for the presidential office.
The coffee shop has been pushed out of the price market. Now it's coming back to Greenpoint.
The Verb Cafe café was a rusty place in Williamsburg, where you could only pay cash, without Wi-Fi, but where the coffee has been served for 15 years.
Of course, she was pushed out of the house at Bedford Avenue.
Soap Cherie - a store that Verb replaced in summer 2014 - sells flour in the form of cakes.
The locals cried it as the last loss of the growing city.
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter: "New York is a change, I know, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead, Chelsea's hotel is exhausted, and Verb is now a medic."
But if New York changes, then it's also re-discovery.
The resurrected Verb Cafe opened in November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new Verb has wifi and receives payment cards, but some of the original employees are working there and there is a similar, modest atmosphere.
Coffee's still good, too.
The manager of the new Verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a long employee of the original coffee shop, who is also the owner and executive director of the new place.
In the Verb he started in 2001 and remained until the end.
When one of his customers offered to pay for the move to a new place, he said he would do it with joy.
Rodriguez (36) left a lot of things as they were.
Verb still has the same supplier of care and bought the same model machine on espresso.
He even again used the lighting from the old verb.
Rodriguez said he wanted to try something new, too.
He started using new bets.
In the offer are sandwiches with ham, eggs and cheese and toppings, such as caps and minced mushrooms.
You'll also find some rice mics here.
The coffee doesn't supply beer anymore, but it'll offer you fresh fruit juice.
After nine months, Rodriguez noticed a steady flow of original strains.
"A number of original customers from Williamsburg also had to move away because of the prices," he said.
Last week there was one of those customers, Rebecca Oliveirov.
Mrs. Oliveirová (34) lived in Williamsburg and went to Verb Cafe often.
She even came when the cafe moved to Greenpoint.
She said when Verb closed, she stopped drinking coffee for a while.
"I found out that what I like is coffee and culture in Verba," she said.
Now he's drinking coffee again, but on that day he gave his usual ice coffee a mixed chai, another novelty.
Tom Rosenthal, another long-term customer, has been faithfully going to Verb since 2003.
He goes before work and always orders the same thing.
"In the fourth and eighth days, every day, as hours, I will come, and they will prepare my cake with everything and with butter," he said.
Photo: Rodriguez said he wanted to try something new and add to the offer of a new bet.
Mr. Rosenthal continues to order what's usual, but sometimes on his lips he lets everything give his bacon, eggs and ham.
Rodriguez said he's not sorry that the soap shop took his old place.
The truth is, the owners of Soap Cherie offered him that he would make a special soap for Verb and use a filtered coffee from the coffee shop as an excuse.
"I think we could still use it," said Rodriguez.
The traditional Polish inhabitants of Greenpoint also welcomed the coffee shop well.
One of the new customers moved the offer to Poland and Rodriguez said he wanted to find a place where he would soon be shown to make his new neighbor feel at home.
The new place has other advantages.
The local producer of fruit juices wants to stick into the bottle and sell filtered coffee.
There is a possibility that the coffee shop will expand into a neighboring building.
A lot of customers just got their old favorite back.
Joseph Whitt was a regular customer and when the coffee shop closed, he broke his heart.
Mr. Whitt says when the coffee shop opens up again, coming in and giving yourself coffee is like coming home.
"I missed that smell," he said.
Depressive food from the time of the crisis - in "Square Meal"
Shortly after his arrival in the office of President in March 1933, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat in the Oval workshop and had lunch.
President Roosevelt's labyrinth enjoyed the selected dishes from the 5th Avenue, such as the pasta of the cattle and the Maryland wheat harvest.
His menu on this day was smaller: eggs in the devil's way in a paradise saucer, potato pears, and as dessert wet pudding.
"It was an act of cooking solidarity with people who were suffering," said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband, Andrew Coe, added: "It was also a message for Americans to eat."
A couple who live in Brooklyn Heights is devoted to gastronomic history.
The last book of Andrew Coea "Chop Suey" was about the Chinese cuisine in America, while Jane in her book "97 Orchard" tells the life story of the home on the Lower East Side through the food.
Their new joint work "A Square Meal", which will be published by Harper on Tuesday, is the history of the American kitchen during a major economic crisis.
They showed their own cooking solidarity and met with the reporter at dinner in Eisenberg's shop with sandwiches, a small tight buffet in Flatiron district, which has been in operation since the crisis, since 1929.
Jane (54) ordered cream cheese and sandwiches with dried olives, Andrew (57) gave himself a crocan, potato cheese and mixed vegetables.
The reporter ordered a mass carbanate, which, according to a couple, was very good at talking about food during the crisis.
"The turtles were very popular," said Ms. Ziegelman.
He sold himself a burrow, a liver and a pheasant carbanette.
They were made from that food and other cheap foods that the ingredients set up.
Stop the amount of bugs you'd have to eat for dinner.
Andrew Coe's in a hurry.
"They would lie in your stomach like lead," he said.
In the years before the crisis, there was an American kitchen, especially in rural areas, given the form of a buffet of snow what you're dreaming.
The women were cooking for farm workers and for breakfast, lunch and dinner, a freshly baked cake.
They were the Americans who sent food to hungry Europeans during the first world war. "A Square Meal" follows how the nation was balanced with that it was suddenly not a country of greed.
"It was the time when food became the central, feared point for the American people," Coe explained in an explanation why he and his wife decided to write about it.
The new budget diet was as worried as it was: secret food, such as carbanates and meats from the chestnuts, the chestnut as “a wonderful way to use the remnants”, Ziegelman noted, because the chefs could hide non-ethical ingredients under the cream sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
Mass - after a long year - the central point of American food - has become widely distributed by luxury.
The strange mixtures that were to serve as a caloric and life-fulfill were preferred before taste or even a healthy sense of cooking.
During the research for a book containing recipes, Ms. Ziegelman prepared a daily meal from a baked dish filled with butter.
"It wasn't a favorite dinner table increase," said Andrew Coe.
Jane Ziegelman stressed: "It was surrealist."
The pepper butter with the cooked onion does not come together.
It was typical for many domestic recipes.
So, as never before and after, domestic economists - among them Louise Stanley, the Cher of the Federal Office for Home Economy, from 1923 to 1943 - controlled the country’s feeding habits.
They published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they called on women to take over the burden of the budget, and the sleighs, such as cream spaghetti with ink, turned into delicious foods.
The book "A Square Meal" is a celebration of historical understanding.
In particular, in response to the government's hunger strikers, as if outside President Herbert Hoover, "I'm giving myself a cake."
While publicly praising the simple iow farm kitchen of his childhood, he stood as a chosen millionaire who became.
"He likes to eat continental cuisine, like fish with corn sauce," said Andrew Coe.
He ate in a nearly-exhausted room, he had tuxedo on himself.
He was incredibly old-fashioned.
President Roosevelt would probably have made the same mistakes if his wife, Eleanor, did not accept him as an example of his own stomach.
As the book explains, Mrs. Roosevelt hired a housewife who was not interested in taste at all. This led to the fact that the White House “was not provided with almost the most delicious food in the whole of Washington, but was also prepared in the most unpleasant way.”
A number of eating habits from the time of the crisis began to fade right away, as the earth was restored to its feet.
The link remained in our constant examination of calories and nutritional values, says Ms. Ziegelman, and how science applies to cooking.
Couples say that during the writing of the book, they better understood the eating habits of Ms. Ziegelman's mother - perhaps why she couldn't throw out the food.
"She was really afraid of food spilling," said Andrew Coe.
Ziegelman said, "It was bad people."
There's been an accident with the cousins.
When there were clean tables at Eisenberg, she and Mr. Coe pulled out the dessert that they had prepared at home: the Swedish dessert that President Roosevelt had eaten for lunch.
"It's called Swedish cream," said Ziegelman and added that the usual trick was to give humble recipes an elegant name.
There was no cream there, just sweats, a little milk, sugar, water and chicken.
Each one of them accidentally threw a spoon into a densely humid mass.
It was surprisingly wrong.
Andrew Coe added, and then again.
And as the right host, his wife said, "It would be a bit of a bit of dry hair."
Europeans: migrants are going for a dose.
Most refugees moving to Europe come for economic reasons.
Young Russians make fun of themselves.
That's how the series would look if we touched them.
A group of Russian artists, called 2D Omnig Us, is making fun of their country.
Photoshop's help creates colleges that funnyly show what it would look like if the famous films and films were filmed in Russia.
Gilead has a claim for compensation for legal representation in the case of a patent against type C jealousy against Merck Group
The judge of the periodic court decided that Gilead Sciences Inc has a claim to pay fees to lawyers who created it in the case of a type C patent against Merck & Co Inc medicinal products manufacturer.
In June, the judgment was annulled, according to which Gilead had to pay 200 million for the damage caused by the breach of two Merck patents in connection with the very successful medicines of Gilead, Sovaldi and Harvoni, after the federal judge found repeated unlawful proceedings on the part of Merck, besides lying under oath and other non-ethical practices.
On Thursday, Federal Judge Beth Labson Freeman stated that Gilead had a claim for a decrease in the fees incurred in connection with the representation in the case.
Merck is trying to reach Gilead, which dominates the drug market of a new generation against type C yellowing, which can cure more than 90% of patients with this liver disease.
The case dates from 2013, when Gilead and Merck complained to each other and claimed to be the owner of the basic laboratory research for sofosbuvir, an active component of the medicines from Gilead.
US-supported military units claim to have gained full control of the city of Manbij
The US-supported military units gained full control of the northern city of Manbídž near the border with Turkey after the last soldiers of the Islamic state fled the city, he set up a group of speakers on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) now examines the city after the departure of the remnant of the radicals who were hiding in the city.
The units released more than 2,000 civilians who were detained by radicals, said Reuters Sharfan Darwish of the SDF Alliance and the Manbídze Military Council.
"The city is now fully under our control, but we are still searching for it," said the agency Reuters.
Clinton made $10.75 million in 2015 and paid a federal tax rate 34.2 per cent
Hillary Clinton published his 2015 tax receipt on Friday, stating that the presidential candidate for the Democrats and her husband had incomes of $10.75 million in the year and made a real tax of 34.2 per cent.
Clinton spent $1 million on charity in 2015, mainly at the Clinton Foundation. President Bill Clinton contributed almost $5.3 million to the common cash for lecture, and the former foreign ministry granted $3 million to Simon & Schuster for its book on its foreign ministry activities.
Clinton's co-founder, American Senator Tim Caine from Virginia, together with his wife Anne Holton, published a tax confession in 10 years.
In 2015, they paid a real tax of 20.3 per cent.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Caine are still a model of financial transparency," said Jennifer Palmieri, who helped Clinton with the campaign.
Against that, Donald Trump hides himself for false excuses and withdraws from his earlier pledges that his tax confession will be public.
It's a habit that candidates to the President of the United States will publish their tax confessions, even if they don't have the law.
Trump, a businessman from New York, and his lawyers quoted the U.S. Ministry of Finance's tax committee's audit as the reason for his refusal to publish the tax receipt.
"Your move," said the supporter of Hillary Clinton's campaign on Twitter and linked the tax confession of a democratic candidate.
Michael Cohen, special Trump's adviser, said Thursday CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish his tax confession until the audits are completed.
According to Trump's criticisms, between the Republican candidate for the President of 2012 Mitt Romney and other members of the Republican Party, they agree that his refusal raises questions about his net profit, contributions to charity, trade and other relations, including relations with Russia.
Clinton's question is very strong and she published a video on Friday, which reminds us of how high the position of the Republic of Trump requires him to publish his tax confession.
On Thursday, the question is mentioned in its statement on economic issues in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what all the other candidates have done to the presidential office after decades - publish their tax receipts," he said in front of the people.
Politico said that Trump paid no or very low taxes in the last two years of the 1990s, and a New York Times journalist quoted a number of tax advisors and accountants who claim it can be the same today.
The federal tax rates have become the subject of the presidential election.
Clinton advocates a rule named after the billionaire Warren Bufat, which would ensure that all who make more than $1 million a year will pay tax at least 30 per cent.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
Last week, Buffet at Clinton's meeting in Omaz, Nebraska, where Buffet's conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway, called for a meeting and exchange of taxes.
Buffett said he also went through the IRS audit and that Trump is "fearing" the financial office, but the volunteers.
Clinton's campaign published tax confessions back to 2007.
Clinton, now living in Chappaqua, New York, paid a federal tax on the average of 32 per cent in 2007 to 2014, and a combined tax of approximately 40.5 per cent.
From Clinton's 2015 tax receipt, it appears that, unlike most Americans, it makes only $100 in their income.
Their main investment was the low-cost mutual index fund, from which Clinton received dividends and interest of $109,000.

Condoms filled with chili or elephant fire extinguisher in Tanzania
Conservationists in Tanzania use an unorthodox way to prevent elephants from walking into human settlements - throwing condoms on them filled with chili powder.
This process was certified and awarded Honeyguide, who came with the idea a few years ago, along with the American environmental organization The Nature Conservancy, promoted this process and trained volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania, using this inviolent procedure in four steps to protect their homes and crops, without harming animals.
Many of them used copies to defend themselves.
Friday is a world day of elephants, dedicated to the protection of these animals.
“Since the development of this ... file of tools, we have recorded a change of behavior in these communities. People believe much more that they can keep elephants out of their fields without being injured,” said the Executive Director of Honeyguide Damian Bell's donation in a statement.
The first and second steps are to light up the battery on the passing elephant and launch the kakson.
If it doesn't, the so-called "chilli cloud" will be released.
Chilli the powder mixed with salt with the petardo is wrapped in the condom, and its end is taken in such a way that he only sees the knot.
After the fire, the condom will explode and the fine chicken powder will spread into the air.
Most of the time, there's only one ring and the elephant seems to be in a different direction.
The last option is to turn off the fire extinguisher, which causes a loud, clear explosion.
Jewish director went to the Berlin hotel because he removed the code for calling to Israel for "a request" of the Arabs - RT News
The French film director of Jewish origin caused a stir in the media after finding that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin does not have a call code for Israel, according to the word of the employee on the basis of the "requirement" of Arab clients.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the documentary about the “Shoah” Holocaust, ventilated his frustration at the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin in an open letter to the German daily FAZ.
During his recent stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel in the hotel calls list.
However, the State was not listed among the countries to which it is possible to call directly from the room.
How is it possible that in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of Germany, Israel was removed and destroyed?
He wrote Lanzmann.
Hotel Kempinski Bristol instead offers the possibility of calling to Israel through its own call center.
The director was looking for an explanation and the problem was addressed at the hotel's reception.
The answer he received, Lanzmanna, according to his word "shocked".
The hotel employee replied that the measure was "decided after consideration of the management of Kempinski Hotels".
The director's reason for this step has been even more inflamed.
"Most of our guests are Arab and you were asked to delete Israel's call code," Lanzmann quoted the employee in his letter.
According to Suddeutsche Zeitung, the Israeli ambassador to Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman referred to the case as "great shame".
We were scared and shocked by the events.
It's just a huge shame of itself.
The fact that something like this happened in Germany and in addition in such a hotel chain is even more embarrassing.
No further explanation is necessary.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions," he said.
The event triggered a strong reaction online, people labeled it scandalous.
Some believe that the Kempinski hotel simply lost itself in the demands of Arab customers.
"Hanba to you," is indicated in another contribution that indicates that the hotel, which is located in the noble street of Kurfurstendamm, stands near the synagogue.
According to Spiegel's newspaper, the hotel itself was quick to accept any accusation by marking the event as "survey" and Lanzman as "an excuse".
"Never has a direct order been issued" does not include Israel in the call code list, says Suddeutsche Zeitung, representative of the Kempinski hotel.
It adds that the call code was added to the list.
Police used gas and rubber missiles against protesting Brazilian students
At the head of the students and the police came to Brazil on Thursday when the students met for a demonstration against government reforms in the public education system.
The police against the protester used gas and rubber missiles.
The problem was when the government's regular services tried to separate the students, which ended by the police using rubber projectiles and tear gas.
A number of hundreds of students attended the demonstration to express their concerns about the plans.
Among the proposals of the governor of the state of San Paulo Gerald Alckmin to save money is the closure of almost a hundred public schools and the transfer of 300 000 students.
Some of the demonstrators were able to see how they put their hand on the walls against the temporary President Michel Temer.
The latest protest comes only a few days after the demonstrators were sent together to the streets to support President Dilmy Rousseff's meeting when the Senate in the country decided on her complaint.
Trade between Russia and Iran increased by 71 % - RT Business
According to the Russian embassy in Iran, Levana Dzhagaryan has increased by 70.9 percent after the abolition of the sanctions between Moscow and Tehran in the interim comparison.
As the ambassador pointed out, since the abolition of international sanctions against Iran, interest on the part of Russian companies trading in the country has increased.
Russian companies renew existing ties with Iran while new companies are ready to enter the market.
Another expansion of trade is, of course, one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," Dzhagarianan said.
He noted that during the first five months of 2016, the turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 per cent compared to the same period in 2015 and reached an amount of $856 million.
In particular, Russian exports to Iran amounted to 91.5 per cent and amounted to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 per cent to $158 million.
The growth in trade has ensured the supply of machinery, land vehicles and weapons," the ambassador said.
Dzhagarian also expects Russia to visit a record number of tourists from Iran this year.
In the past year, the Russian diplomatic mission in Iran issued some 35,000 visas to the citizens of Iran, mostly travel.
In addition, Iran first arrived between top 20 countries according to the number of tourists arriving in Russia.
It can certainly be said that the record numbers of tourists from Iran in Russia will be overcome from last year," he said.
At the same time, Iran is visiting a relatively small number of Russians.
"I can personally recommend a visit to the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, where the memories of ancient Persian civilization are well preserved," he said.
Scott Callum Skinner rushes home after the British get gold in the cyclist
Callum Skinner from Scotland entered the night before dawn in a male sprint team in Rio, when the three VB team held the title from London in 2012.
A 30-year-old relative from Glasgow was in the role of the brake that he took for his Scott Sir Chris Hoy, and a young legend rejoiced when he reached the goal and stole the victory from the hand of a favored New Zealand.
Britain suddenly won four years ago and Hoy won a fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And the same trick was repeated after the end of a modest sixth in the world championship in a drag bike in March, even when Hoy finished his career between.
The problem between Beijing and London has been replaced by a specialized instigator of Jamie Staff.
So the Hindus showed up just in time.
After the departure, Hoye also set free a place that tried to fill the Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton.
Skinner was a man of British coaches and the search for potential has now been confirmed.
Kenny Hindes, who was with Hoy's champion four years ago, and Skinner reached the Olympic record in his qualification, but the trick took over in the first round of New Zealand.
And the British trio got gold in the team sprint.
Hindes was slightly behind his wheels, but Kenny's team pushed forward and Skinner held the lead.
The change of strategy was a large part of the transformation when Hindus went to a higher translation to slow down and allow Kenny and partly Skinner to keep pace.
Hoy was watching from his BBC commentary position and when Skinner, Kenny, and Hindus went to the stage, he didn't let them go.
Thirty-two-year-old Skinner, a relative from Glasgow, said, "It's a terrible comparison."
I'm here to get the best of myself and honor my name.
We created an Olympic record in the finals and we won the best.
It was just incredible.
There's no better way to win it.
After the victory next to Kenny and Hoye in London in 2012, Hindus admitted that he was on the road successfully after a bad start.
The note was later withdrawn, and British opponents had no opportunity to withdraw.
No such problem has occurred this time around this victory.
Hindus said, “With all those British flags on the courts, I felt like in London.”
In the last three months, we've all been together as a team.
We've lost in many world races, so winning the Olympics again is just amazing.
It's one event, one gold medal for a nation that won seven out of ten competitions in Beijing and London.
If it's supposed to be a progress indicator in the past five months, then we've been waiting at the airport for five days.
In the form that Kenny introduced, it is not unimaginable that he would repeat Hoy's success and win three gold medals at the same time on one olympiad.
This would then be for Kenny - which is exactly the day of 12 years younger than Hoy, he also has the birthdays on March 23rd (this date seems to be sacred for British sport, this day also celebrates the birthday also Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - meant a total of six gold medals and one silver medals.
No matter how much Hoy won.
As another Kenny will participate in a sprint that starts today and lasts another three days.
An 18 - year - old relative from Bolton said: “Now I enjoy this.
Team race is always the best.
You're winning with the others.
To tell the truth, winning for yourself is a little lonely.
Hindus said, "If he wins another two gold medals, he should get a knight's title."
It was the only medal race that day, but Britain was waiting for more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doul qualified as the fastest to win the company for four kilometers.
Ended with 3:51,943.
The world record that fell in London in 2012 is 3:51.659.
The first round and the finals (2:42) are on the second day of the race, to which the doser will focus on Wiggins.
Yesterday before the qualifying competition, he discussed with the Commissioner when her decision-makers called on her to measure the height.
In a similar race of women who continue and finish tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milgavie reached the world record of 4:13.360.
The VB team joined its strong team of dragon cyclists and controlled the middle Olympics and won a lot of medals.
After the truly exceptional performances that demonstrated a complete overcapacity in Beijing and in London, the expected decrease in the preparation for Rio was observed.
In the background, dramatic events took place, in the recent ranks of technical director Shane Sutton in April due to charges of sexism and discrimination, and the end of the career of the great ones, such as Hoy or Victoria Pendleton.
However, as the first night of the race on the highway turns out, the legendary reputation seems to be that the team of the Great Britain can deliver a peak performance with perfect timing, so it can be confirmed again.
There is no future of the camp in Portland after the end of the energy supply contract
The future of the Portland tabernacle in Victoria - and the jobs of hundreds of workers - is not because of the electricity that the company supplies the electricity and which informed about the intention of one of the owners of the tabernacle to terminate the electricity supply contract. It is expected that all electricity contracts will be cut off.
This step takes place after the Government of the State of Victoria decided earlier this year that it does not extend the supply of grants that the company maintains in progress.
The validity of a fixed 20-year grant expires in November.
Alcoa Portland can be at risk of up to 2000 jobs.
In the event of closure, up to 2000 jobs - direct or indirect.
And since the tavern consumes about 10 percent of the total electricity produced in Victoria, it can have other wave effects.
Alcoa closed Point Henry's tavern in 2014, which led to the closure of England's power plant last year.
Alcoa's camp in Portland is a formidable and dangerous closure.
This step follows several speculations about the future of the company, initially in response to the strong Australian dollar and recently due to prices for the production of the race.
AGL, which supplies electricity from the Loy Yang A power plant in the valley of Latrobe Valley, announced that it expects some of the other three owners to conclude the contract as well.
Most of the company's owners are the joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, the small business shares hold the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp.
"AGL expects the Portland race to continue to function, in other words, that the demand for electricity from the tabernacle will continue," she said.
The AGL stated that the contracts were so-called ‘insurance contracts’ that they had to enter into force since November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month reporting period, so their validity will indeed end in 2017.
‘AGL continues to assume that the contracts will be divided into profit for the fiscal year 2017’, the power plant declared.
Any possible impact on AGL’s profits from fiscal year 2018 is further limited at present due to the strong outlook of the commodity market for wholesale electricity prices.
The AGL stated that it had already deposited the value of the contracts according to its accounting books of $187 million "in the event of completion."
Alcoa stated that the contract decision "has no impact on its ... ability to operate a tent or to secure electricity supplies to the tabernacle."
The US company stated that in 2010 it concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, which was supposed to start paying since November of this year, even if it still has to explain why it stopped.
The analysts are very careful about the possible closure of the portland camp in Victoria and the Tomago race near Newcastle as a result of a poor sector economy.
AGL Stehpen Mikkelsen, who turned to analysts at the beginning of this week, said that Portland annually consumes about 600 megawatts of electricity and around 900 megawatts of Tomago.
If both companies were to withdraw from the market, this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the market [electric energy].
It would not be good for us as a manufacturer," he said.
Kendall is not only a star reality TV show of Kardashian - now is the cover of the star Vogue
Kendall Jenner (20), a model and fourth daughter of the mother-in-law of the Klan Kris Kardashian-Jenner, appeared on the title page of the September issue of the American magazine Vogue.
Kendall, the Ambassador of the Estee Lauder brand, who led the fashion of the week in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on Thursday on his Instagram account.
"In a room full of people I love, I want to cry in view of this title page," Kendall wrote.
The opening of the title page was followed by a bizarre (or simply a continuation of humor in Kardashian's administration?) scened video in which the entire family of Kardashian-Jenner's (Bara's fans Rob and Caitly and with them all the favorite showbyznys, producer Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest). On their sister's cover, they forgot only so the scene could end with a classic party: they prepare a secret party.
It's a protected history line almost every part of the children's television show (Seacrest says, "Did you think we forgot about you?" with the honesty of the painted rabbit in the eight o'clock in the morning), but Kris needed to make sure that other girls could live on this publication.
Because when we look at the September issue of the Vogue magazine, we are sure to enter the new era of Kardashian.
Senior sister Kim may have put Kendall on Vogue's cover (it was on her side with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the title of the January issue of the magazine is another league.
The magic issue of the Vogue magazine is the most sold all year round.
The edition, which reminds its audience more of a book for advertising purposes than a fashion magazine, attracts a whole series of ads (Fashionist estimated that 615 pages with advertising content were from 832 pages in last issue).
The discovery of the star that appears on the title page is unquestionably expected, so it is not surprising that in the past two years the images of the magazine have escaped even before its official publication.
Among the women who appeared in the past on the cover are Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelist or Kate Moss.
In recent years, more "cellebrits that make models" appeared on the title page than "models that are celebrities".
Jennifer Lawrence, the holder of the Oscar and the Ambassador of the Dior brand, appeared on the headline in 2013, a year later she had the honor of Lagy Gaga.
But although it is very unlikely that Kendall, whose magazine describes as her generation's "problem model", will fall into the first category, will be in a very good company.
These celebrities are not related to known people, nor the stars of reality shows, or children today who know how to make well-cut videos (even if Jenner represents all this).
They're demonstrably talented women who excel in the entertainment industry.
Beyoncé, who appeared on the title page last year, had one of the strongest years in her career due to the issuance of the Lemonade album.
Of course not everyone is excited about Jenner's success.
Her position in the fashion world will always be difficult because of her participation in the reality show.
Stephanie Seymorová, the original Victoria's Secret model in June criticised Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid and called them "girls of the moment".
These feelings were again heated by the report that Jenner was appearing on the Vogue envelope.
But this dissatisfaction is not in place.
Kendall Jenner's on the roof of the shadow Vogue.
It's a supermodel in the right word of meaning.
He's running for Mark Jacobs.
He's selling you make-up from Estee Lauder.
She and all her sisters are selling pictures of themselves to their own payrolls.
She's selling pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter, who's photographed for the Love magazine.
And in free moments it affects reality show, maybe just as one way to see Courtney and her children.
Community Law Centres of 160,000 people a year
More than 160,000 people are at risk every year in Community legal aid centres, and in the sector itself, they face impacts that will have further financial constraints on the already overloaded service.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly people of advanced age, immigrants, the threat of workers, victims of violence and people without financial means to fight unfair displacement and so on - are refusals already at a time when they seek free legal assistance and representation.
Community law services, which are already so strained to break down, are going to be in other traps.
As of June next year, these legal aid centres will have a further 30 per cent of federal finances.
The head of the Community Legal Aid Centre in Queensland, James Farrell, said that according to the latest summary report, the National Association of Community Legal Aid Centres found that five thousand people were rejected each year.
Mr. Farrell said that without a decision by the federal government, the situation would worsen.
"The Community legal centres in Queensland are chronically underfunded, which means that thousands of people are denied the vital services they need," he said.
People who have avoided relations with a rapist, people with excessive and protective debts, families undergoing separation, workers who are unjustly released - all these people have problems with legal dimensions and this report shows that they do not have the chance to get the help they need.
Since June 2017, the federal government has reduced funding by 30 per cent, leading to the fact that thousands of other vulnerable people from Queensland will have to focus on complex legal problems without assistance.
We call on the State Representative and Senator George Brandise to stop this financial cuts immediately, so that people can get the help they need when they get into legal problems.
In the past year, the government has been committed to ensuring the financing of legal aid up to the international average.
Now is the time to look at the needs of the community's legal aid centres and the community of their clients and the Government of Palaszczuk must invest in this important work.
Complaint against Donald Trump's campaign after the member of the staff allegedly targeted the weapon
New York: Donald Trump’s campaign was filed for alleged inaction after they were told that the director of the operation in North Carolina in February had targeted a weapon on the staff during the trip to the jeep.
The incident was described in the court register, which sent Vincent Bordini, a former software teacher of the campaign in the state, on Wednesday at the Charlotte State Court.
Bordini said he waited months for the situation to be resolved internally before he concluded that "it will not happen".
Director Earl Phillip "labelled his fingers, gave the right indicator on the trigger and directed Vincent's head to the Czech," Bordini stated in the complaint.
The list states that Bordini found that, following a complaint from local and regional leadership, at least four other people had the same experience with Phillip.
"The weapons must not be fired to cause harm," Bordini stated in the complaint.
The complaint comes only two days after the Republican candidate for the president called for a raise when he told the voters in North Carolina that they would be able to march arms owners and holders (which is regulated in the second addendum of the constitution) if his opponent Hillary Clinton was elected and could be appointed a judge.
Trump's campaign says the media dropped his word out of context and that Trump didn't watch the violence.
Bordini, in the case, asks the campaign to replace the unwarranted supervision and the Phillips to threaten personal security, unlawful use of violence and cause emotional harm.
Trump's speaker, Hope Hicks, did not respond immediately to the request for a comment.
Trying to get a statement from Phillip was unsuccessful.
WCCB, a local news agency in Charlotte, announced that Phillip had recently left the campaign.
Call his advisory company Innovative Consulting Services nobody responded during a short time.
The Republican candidate for President Donald Trump runs a controversial pre-election campaign.

Britain must continue to expand the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will also be a source of restoration and prosperity not only for our local communities and against London, but throughout the country.
For me, Heathrow is extremely attractive, just as it was in London in 2012, when we made extraordinary efforts to ensure that all our nations and regions will be able to compete in the Olympics.
The Olympics marked great benefits for Startford and East End.
And we'll do it again so that we can create opportunities for local people and companies near Heathrow.
For our local communities alone, we create 10,000 new places of education, 40,000 new jobs and end up with the unemployment of young people around the airport.
Just as before the London Olympics in 2012 they will find here those who will think that the extension of Heathrow is too big.
I was told that Britain would never be prepared for the Olympics and that we would smile at the world stage.
Suspects were wrong in 2012 and in Heathrow's case it turns out they were wrong.
There will always be obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow can answer any question that concerns him.
Like Olympic games, Heathrow is a project of infrastructure that is shared by many people and companies, not only by a few.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create 180,000 new jobs, an economic growth of 211 billion pounds, to leave heritage in the form of skills and employment both in the airport and in the UK as a whole.
We have a great team at Heathrow who, in time and with the budget set up an investment programme in infrastructure for 11 billion pounds, starts with the T5 terminal - which was chosen by the best terminal in the world five years behind it, after the T2 terminal, which was built between the two most devastating wounds in the world.
They are now ready to add a third edge, which is worth 16 billion pounds of private investment.
The games in London in 2012 were a huge success for the United Kingdom and I am convinced that the extension of Heathrow will be there too.
It is time for us to continue to spread the spirit of the Olympics and expand Heathrow, secure business in the future, and abandon the legacy of skills and jobs that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is President of the Board of Representation and a former Deputy Minister for the Business Affairs of the Ministry of Finance.
Adblock Plus - Facebook game on cat and mouse in blocking advertising
From trying to cover programs blocking advertising, for companies that make online marketing, it became a game on the cat and mouse. At least one of the companies that program such software claims it.
On Thursday, only two days after Facebook announced that it would block advertising filters on its desktop pages, Adblock Plus on its pages published a contribution stating that users can update filters in their program and re-block advertising on this social network.
Facebook said on Tuesday that his desktop website will change the encoding around advertising to make it more difficult for advertising filters to find out which parts of the website are advertising.
But Adblock now claims that the new codes have already been covered.
Speaking Adblock Ben Williams wrote in a blog that "this kind of war between the open source blocking community and those who try to surround it lasts since the blocking of advertising was found," and that Facebook is likely to come with another personal repair.
The fact that the company's largest social network in the world has been involved in war only proves how big a problem has been blocking advertising for industry.
According to the study, last year Pagefair and Adobe used advertising filters around 200 million people worldwide - almost four times before it was in 2013.
Mobile advertising now reaches 84 percent of the Facebook advertising profits, every day Facebook from mobile devices visits 1.03 billion active users.
The speaker stated that, of course, the company goes against advertising filters on the desktop because mobile advertising filters on the mobile application for social network and Instagram do not work.
Advertising on the desktop still represents a profit so high that Facebook decided to invest in it.
Facebook also stated on Tuesday that it will update the "ad preferences" tool to enable people to better control how they display ads.
On Thursday Facebook said that Adblock's new filters are concerned because they could also block content that does not relate to advertising.
“It’s not a pleasant experience for people, and we want to solve this problem,” Facebook speaker stated in an e-mail statement.
Blocking advertising is an insensitive tool, and that's why we'd rather focus on building tools like Ad Preferences that give control to people.
A woman hit a car on the Swiss highway
The victim was lying on the street in the middle of the night.
The police are looking for witnesses of the incident, where on Thursday in the early hours there were several cars across the street, a woman who was probably trying to commit suicide.
The accident occurred on the A1 road near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight on Thursday.
The Vaud police stated in a statement that the actor "suffering" was lying in the dark on the road and drove her several cars.
Clearly, the victim, a woman at 49, wanted to kill herself and hit her with a few cars, including a truck.
She died on the spot.
Several drivers have already been interviewed, but according to the police, they still haven't been identified.
A criminal investigation, a "logical" step in the situation, like this one, was opened to Le Tribune de Geneve, legal representative of Gilles Hofstetter.
It is still necessary to find out if any of the drivers involved will face any charges.
Was it possible to prevent an attack?
This has to be found by the plaintiff," said Hoffsetter.
On the basis of two similar cases over the past five years, it appears that drivers will not be responsible.
In both cases - one of which was about the person going along the road - it was decided that the motorists could not expect a walk that passes through the road in the middle of the night, as the newspaper said.
Last year the police officer was acquitted of the charge of being killed after she met and killed a man lying on the A1 road near Paynerne in August 2014.
The court found that at the age of 22, the victim drank alcohol and went on the road.
The court found that the police officer - who responded to the emergency call - was in an appropriate manner and that the presence of a man on the road was "a very exceptional and unpredictable situation," the judge said.
Any person with information on the quarterly incident that occurred at Morges should report to the police on telephone numbers 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
Tolerant city.
Prague is a popular destination for the LGBT community.
The Association of Czech Travel Offices and Agency (AČCKA) expects up to 20,000 visitors to Prague in the framework of Prague.
On Friday, it was announced by AČCKA Executive Director Catherine Petríčková.
The sixth anniversary of Prague Pride began on August 8, the festival is approaching the life of lesbians, gays, bisexuals and transsexuals (LGBT).
Last year, about 35,000 people attended the event.
"Praha is one of the most popular destinations of the LGBT community, and this is for the high level of tolerance and the wide range of specialised businesses," Petríčková said.
According to the survey, foreign visitors lose on average 3100 crowns per person per day.
Gay tourists are offered special maps of Prague with a complete list of Prague gay and gay-friendly bars, clubs, cafes and restaurants in the form of mobile apps, etc.
"For travel, it is generally paid that LGBT customers are very lucrative, interested in living in higher price relations with high standard travel services and losing more than the others," Petríčka said.
The first Pride Tourism Symposium will be held this year under the festival programme.
It is provided by experts from the LGBT road transport sector from Europe, the USA and China.
The festival continues until Sunday, August 14.
The main theme of this year is love, but action will also be devoted to several thematic areas, including family, AIDS prevention and transgender issues.
On Saturday, the festival will be the traditional route with allegorical cars from Václav Square to Letno.
The reason that thousands of people have attended last year is this year to observe a minute of the silent memory of the victims of the June attack at the Orlanda Night Club, where the attacker shot 49 people, mostly homosexuals.
Pat and Matt have been celebrating for 40 years.
The ingenious cutile Pat and Matt, whose effort usually ends with disaster, enjoys small and large spectators for forty years.
The pilot's part of this evening's series of directors, Lubomír Beneše, was premiered on 12 August 1976.
Following the creation of this animated series, now known as viewers in more than a hundred countries of the world, were painted by the artist and director Lubomír Benesh, who designed the magazine with two boxes of Mr. Ogolíčka and Sedlec.
Benes then called on Jiří Kubíčka and author Vladimir Jiránk to work together and together created a film by Kučáci.
Today's image with a yellow and red trick and a ball and a radio was given in 1979 when he started to create a series for Slovenian TV in the short film Prague.
The name Pat and Matt then got the cutlery in 1985, this time it was already touched directly for the Short Film of Prague.
In 1990, Lubomír Beneš founded his own studio of the animated AIF Studio in Prague and Curychu, where other parts were created.
After his death in 1995, other works were continued with other creations, many of which were shared by the son of Benelux, Marek.
At present, there are over ninety episodes of the stories of these corners that all sleep under their hands, but never get mad at themselves and are always full of optimism, ideas and kutil's enthusiasm and finally they are satisfied with their work, which is set by a well-known gesture "...and that's it!".
Pat and Mat even moved from television to books, to DVDs and to theaters and other toys with the image of Pat and Mata are the target of every toys.
A story for Fiji and two years of harmony.
At the end of the week, it's a story, we've chosen one sport and one of our lives for you.
They both have a good ending.
Let's take a look.
Fiji has achieved historical success.
What is the cause of the joy of the whole country?
A two-year-old British girl has an identical friend and she's happy with her.
And for what things do people spend the most on airports?
It's a Friday review from the World Wide Web.
The first medals from the Olympics.
The historic success of Fiji is celebrated by the island state.
Ragby's election won the final Olympic tournament of the seven-year-old team of the Great Britain.
It's the first medal Fiji won for herself at the Olympics.
Waiting for the profit of the first precious metal lasted sixty years since the first expedition to the Olympics.
Good luck with Coach Fiji.
It's ironic, though, that it's Brit Ben Ryan.
The team has been leading since 2013 and after the finals, the British citizen could have been satisfied with his countrymen.
"Let's play free and easy and see if we can win the biggest game in our history," the coach said in front of the finals.
Fiji finally ruled it sovereignly and a small state with 900 thousand inhabitants now survives the Olympics.
The report was delivered by the French daily Le Monde.
A new friend and good luck for a little girl.
Two-year Harmony-Rose Ivy Allen, who has been living with no arm for 11 months and has been getting a new friend.
A lady who looks like her.
"Mommy, she's like me," the two-year-old girl was happy to tell her mother about ABC News.
She added that her daughter likes to kiss her hands and legs and then sits together without a prosthetic.
Harmony was diagnosed with meningitis type B in a few years of life, and it was given by doctors only a ten percent chance of survival.
There's nothing I wouldn't love about her.
She's beautiful, smart, funny and she never gives up.
He's got surveillance.
I saw her picture of the other kids saying hello, I'm Harmonia and I don't have a hand, my mother added.
Look at the joy of the lady.
What do we spend the most at the airport?
CNN is reporting a finding that people at airports lose most of their packaging water.
The Hudson's travel essential stores have published data in the last year, where it contains 10 products that customers in its shops buy most often.
The water was a sovereign first.
The drinks were generally very popular, eight were placed in the first ten.
The ninth place had a large M&M bonus packaging with coconut touch.
And can you figure out who's closing the first ten?
As the only thing mentioned above, you can't eat.
According to CNN, it's The Wall Street Journal.
Other popular newspapers sold at airports include New York Post, The New York Times USA Today.
Among the magazines are the US Weekly, In Touch and The Economist.
The Sovereign of the Universe.
We're just gonna win, Murray and Bond laugh.
The ambassadors Eric Murray and Hamish Bond of New Zealand sovereignly rule the categories of twins without the beads for seven years and their dominants also confirmed in the Olympics in Rio de Janeiro.
At first glance, the unfavourable twins went to a smaller crew after the Beijing Olympics and since 2009 has run the competition.
In the camp of Rodriga de Freitas, in the quarter final, they scored 69th in a row.
What are we in other than the others?
We're just nicer, Murray was already joking during the Olympic regatta when he was supposed to answer questions about the domination of New Zealand's twins.
Frankly, we don't do anything different to the others.
We just practice hard, hard hard.
And we're constantly trying to improve our technique, it's our philosophy, Murray said more seriously.
Their powers are remarkable because they are physically different.
Murray is a nearly two-foot and a stochial watch, academically looking Bond is five centimeters smaller and 15 kilograms lighter.
Besides, they have a different nature.
The Bond is studying and committed to finance, Murray has for example a charity boxing game.
That's why she doesn't spend much time together.
Eric's on his way to the ship, basically, with the fact that we can't lose.
We're just gonna win.
I have a tendency to think about what can be shown, he admitted Bond, who, even at the press conference, showed that the dominant in the crew is Murray.
He always answered as the first and Bond waited for his opportunity.
But on the water, the rivals are destroyed by a calm force.
They're running their pace, and maybe they're not in the lead in half yet, and at their gradual acceleration, the opponents have not found a recipe yet.
We're running a two-kilometer track and we never wanted to go the first mile up.
We're just trying to run a pace that no one else can.
We know what we have to do to win, said Forty-four-year-old Murray.
With his four - year - old younger partner, he won seven gold medals for the world’s championship.
They also won in 2007, when both were members of the gold four without a belt.
Just after the unexpected failure of the larger crew at the Beijing Olympics a year later, they decided to relocate to two without a belt.
At the London Olympics, the biggest defeat of their careers was probably opened and the Dominants confirmed in Rio.
London was very intense.
We did everything the coach told us, and they didn't ask for anything.
This time it was a little more fun.
We knew it would be damn hard, and we had to make sure that we were doing psychologically well, brought Murray in.
We know that we all want to get out of the throne.
We still have that ball on our back.
But we're trying to be half a step ahead of everyone, he added.
Climate model according to NASA: Venus was once inhabited
According to NASA's new climate model, Venus was once inhabited.
Scientists at the Goddard Institute of Space Studies have developed a model for examining Venus using instruments and algorithms similar to those used by climate study scientists.
The model was designed to determine if ever on Venus, whose surface is hot, without water and propelled CO2, could be subject to conditions similar to conditions on Earth.
Scientists have already suggested that the low rate of turn of Venus can be explained by its dense atmosphere.
According to recent simulations, Venus once seemed to have been able to boast in a rare atmosphere similar to Earth and then turned slowly.
The model also dealt with the previous Venus topography.
On the planet, the areas were probably dryer than on Earth, but at times there was enough water and geographical diversity to control life and provide protection against rapid decomposition.
Venus was also used by the sun, which was 30 percent thicker.
"In the simulation of the GISS Venus model during a slow rotation, it shows its daily side to the sun almost two months at a time," the scientist from GISS Anthony Del Genio explained in a new report.
This results in heating the surface and raining, which creates a dense layer of clouds that act as a rainstorm and protect the surface from excessive solar heat.
The result is climate with average temperatures that are actually slightly lower than they are at present on Earth.
The model made up the story of Venus, a similar evolution that the planetary scientists had originally put together.
Although Venus was probably inhabited in the past -- over billions of years -- it was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet radiation.
Her oceans were refurbished, and the water pairs were burned with ultraviolet light.
The water has disappeared and has remained only a dense atmosphere of carbon dioxide with the deadly effect of greenhouse gas -- it's Venus, as we know it today.
Researchers published their results from the new climate model Venus in Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy registered to post team coach Colorado Avalanche
Patrick Roy resigned on Thursday to his post of coach and vice-president of the hockey operations team Colorado Avalanche, as a reason for not participating in the decision-making process on team issues.
The Executive Vice-President/General Manager Colorado Joe Sakic confirmed the move and stated that the club is immediately looking for a new coach.
"For the last three years, I have acted as the chief coach and vice president of the hockey operations for Colorado Avalanche, with energy, passion and determination," said 40-year-old Roy in a statement.
I've been thinking for years about how I can improve my team, give him the depth he needs, and get it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, it is necessary that the vision of the coach and vice-president of hockey operations be in accordance with the vision of the organisation.
It must also be possible to participate in decisions affecting the performance of the team.
These conditions are currently not met.
Sakic, who accepted on 23 May 2013, thanked Roy for his team's benefits.
"The Patrick informed me of his decision today," said Sakic.
We appreciate everything he has done for our organization, and we wish him a lot of happiness in the future.
Roy was nominated to win Jack Adams as the best league coach during his first season with Avalanche 2013/2014.
He led the team to win 112 points and first place in the Central Division. Colorado, however, had met Minnesota in the first round of play-offs and during the last two years he had not always won the season.
The Avalanche team in the 2015/2016 season reached score 39:39:4 and he missed five points to get another wild card at the Western Conference.
The company Roy, who enrolled in China's glory, won Stanley Cup four times -- twice with Montreal Canadiens and twice with Avalanche.
Workers on the oil surface in the North Sea renew talks and interrupt the event
The senior representatives of the working parties stated that the payouts for workers in the North Sea were interrupted, while all the parties to the dispute were in a new round of negotiations.
At the events against the company of services for the Wood Group oil field, sporadically arrived on the plates in the North Sea, which operates the Royal Dutch Shell.
"The Wood Group and the United Nations and the RMT Committee can confirm that they have agreed to renew the process for resolving the current disagreements," the statement states.
It starts next week, we'll have over the next few weeks a series of whole-day meetings, where we'll try to look at the problems from the new angles.
According to the board organisations, their recent actions, which were, according to their words, the first in more than 25 years, to protest against wage cuts up to 30 per cent.
Wood Group this year reduced its rates and paid its suppliers in the North Sea by about 9 per cent less due to negative market pressure.
The reduction in the company's interest is due to a ten-percent reduction for coastal companies in 2014.
The company claims that other companies would provide space to balance with a market decline.
On the other hand, Shell has disbursed thousands of people's payrolls and announced plans to abandon oil and natural gas operations to 10 countries for modernising its processes - immediately after mega fusion with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure because of low oil prices, the economic situation associated with the June decision to leave Britain to the European Union.
At the beginning of this week, a member of Parliament from Scotland, Dave Anderson, met with committee members to discuss one of the largest job accidents of the entire generation leading to the North Sea event.
The North Sea, as he stated, is vital to the economy in the region.
"In the North Sea and throughout the country, we need an economy that works for everyone, not just for some," the statement stated.
For comparison, in 2016, nearly 1.4 billion dollars of investment in new projects in the North Sea is expected, while the average over the past five years was about $7 billion.
Kepler measures the speed of turning stars in the Pleiades
The latest mission of Kepler's space telescope to help astronomers is to get an almost complete list of the speed of turning stars from the Pleiade Star.
New data helps astronomers understand why the stars in the constellation are at different speeds, and how the turn time is related to the formation of the planet.
"We hope to learn more about the relationship between the star mass, its age and even its history in its solar system by comparing our results with other stars," stated a new report by Luis Rebullova, a research workshop in the centre of Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena.
The Pleiade Star is located 445 light-years from Earth.
Many of the stars in the shell now reach the state of maturity and have been born over 125 million years.
Now it's turning faster.
At the instant maximum speed, these adult stars release a huge amount of star wind.
Because these winds are moving along the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a slowing effect on them.
Along with the age of the star, it slows down its speed of rotation.
Kepler measures the speed of turning each star so that it measures the time between the discovery of distinctive points on the stars -- similar to the solar curves.
According to the latest data on speed rotation, larger stars turn slower than less massive stars.
The revolution is comparing stars to dancers, making pirates slower than the smaller ones.
"In "ballet" Plejad we see that the slowest of the moving stars are more massive, while those that are faster are usually very light stars," Rebullova said.
Because the Pleiade is so close, it serves as an ideal space laboratory for comparing the quality of the star and the speed of rotation.
"We are provided with a cadre for theoretical models of star rotation in both directions, in younger and older stars," Rebullova said.
There's still a lot we want to know about when and why the stars slow down their turn speed and say "he'll hang his dance boots on the mushrooms".
Rebulblová and her colleagues described in detail the latest analysis of the speed of rotation of Pleiades in three studies that will soon be published in the magazine Astronomical Journal.
Is a qualification agreement necessary?
If I didn't sign up, then would the qualifying agreement not be closed and after a few months I could go to another hospital?
Is it even possible to work after graduation without a special education application?
It seems to me that in the field where I would like to work, there is now a job vacancy in some remote hospital, but almost a year and a half it would be possible to leave a place in another place where I would then like to work.
So I don't know how the situation is about to solve that half, but the question goes on.

No legislation imposes no obligation to conclude a qualification agreement with the employer - hospital.
The Qualification Agreement shall be a legal institution governed by a labour law and may be concluded between an employee and an employer in order to ensure the reimbursement of the costs incurred in connection with the increase or deepening of the qualifications of an employee.
In the field of health, a long-term pressure on non-conclusion of these agreements is therefore developed, in view of ensuring the mobility of health workers and not all hospitals at present require this agreement.
According to Law No 95/2004 Sb., the conditions for obtaining and recognising professional qualifications and specialized qualifications for the performance of medical examinations by a doctor, dental doctor and pharmacist are expressly applicable, whereas participation in special education is considered to be a deepening of qualifications (not for any increase).
This means that a qualification agreement may be concluded under the labour law only if the costs reach at least 75,000 CZK.
No legislation nor imposes the obligation to apply to special education.
The law only lays down the conditions for the application for classification in the field of specialisation training.
However, the doctor is permitted under the law to perform a doctor’s appointment by completing the required university education, even if the conditions are laid down under the law (under the professional supervision of a doctor with specialized qualifications in the relevant field).
The law provides for a situation in which a doctor's training can be included in a professional practice completed in another field of specialisation if its content and scope correspond to the relevant educational programme.
Theoretically, it would be possible to calculate the time worked elsewhere, which would correspond to the hostage situation.
However, given that I do not know the circumstances of this case, it may be recommended to consult with the competent committee of the Ministry of Health (the Scientific and Medical Committee) as the Ministry of Health provides advice and consultation services related to the classification and duration of specialized education.
The advisory service shall also be provided free of charge by the Czech Medical Chamber, each of which shall be a member.
Doctors from the Syrian Halab require an intervention in the United States.
The United States has not made any efforts to end the siege (the rest of the city by government forces) and has not used its influence to protect civilians, quoted from a letter addressed to the White House of the AFP.
"We don't need tears, feelings, even prayers; we desperately need to create an airless zone over the east of Halab, to stop attacks, and we need international action to ensure that Halab will not be surrounded again," the doctors said.
The Russian forces, who support the army by loyal President Bashar Asad, announced that they will stop every day for three hours in the Halabu area every day to allow safe passage to humanitarian convoys.
From 9:00 till 12:00 SELČ are to be stopped all military activities, air raids and fire-fighting.
The chief of humanitarian operations of the United Nations Stephen O'Brien welcomed it, but stressed the need for at least a two-day approach.
In Obama, according to the AFP, 15 of the 35 doctors who act in the eastern part of Halab, who are already in control of the rebels, were contacted in the letter.
It says that during the five years of the war, witnesses were violent, cruel deaths of countless patients, friends and colleagues.
The world looks at and finds out how complicated Syria is, but it's only doing little to protect us.
Recent offers of evacuation of residents from the Syrian regime and Russia are just as easily targeted threats, brought by pediatricians, surgeons and other doctors.
The doctors indicated that 42 attacks were reported in Syria last month, of which 15 were reported in the hospital where they were working.
We are most sad that we have to decide who will live and who will die.
In preparation for this, young children come to us with such serious injuries that we have to choose among them those with the greatest probability of survival.
And sometimes we don't even have the necessary material to help them, the doctors say.
Two weeks ago, four newborns were drowned when the explosion interrupted oxygen supply to their incubators.
They crawled after the breath and then their lives ended - before he could really start, they remembered.
The army entrusted to President Bashar Asad, supported by the Russian forces, surrounded last week by the rebellion of the ruling eastern part of Halabu, inside the food supply of more than 200,000 people.
Rebels who are under constant blows of Russian and Syrian aviation managed to break up and start anti-offensive on Saturday after three weeks.
Both sides then arrived in the city and surrounded it by forces.
