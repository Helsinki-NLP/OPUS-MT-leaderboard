28 years old spring found dead in San Francisco
This week, a 28-year-old spring was found in a magnificent staircase, which recently moved to San Francisco.
But the brother of the sacrifice said that he could not imagine anyone who would do more than his brother, saying, "His life has finally begun to improve."
The figure found Wednesday at the University of Westfield was identified as the 28-year-old Sanfrancian resident Frank Galicia, a representative of the Sanfrancian Medical Research Office.
The San Francisco police reported that his death was recognized as a murder and the investigation is under way.
Brother Luis Galicia told the San Francisco radio station ABC KGO that Franks had previously worked for the spring in Boston, but six months ago he went to his dream work restaurant "Sons & Daughters" San Francisco.
The representative of the restaurant "Sons & Daughters" informs that the news about his death shocked them and devastated them.
"We are a small team working as a united family and we miss him very much," said the representative.
During this difficult time, we are thinking about being with Frank’s friends and family.
Luis Galicia says that at the beginning of his stay in the hostel, Frank’s life has finally improved.
"He moved into a new apartment and met a girl," Luis tells the radio station to the KGO.
Luis Galicia says he does not know who would like to do something about his younger brother.
He was a good man with a wide heart.
"He always tortured his family by preparing delicious meals and preparing lunch," said Luis Galicia
He never wanted to get involved in disputes.
He was the brother who adapted to others.
"In view of all the things that happened quickly in the world, he was like an unprocessed diamond that looked at the top every day," he says.
Anyone who has information about the event is invited to call the SFPD Information Phone 415-575-4444.
New Doctor's strike: Call for new protests
New doctors' representatives ask their trade union to launch protests in the dispute about the new contract.
The British Medical Association (LMA) New Committee of Doctors (JAK) is preparing to request advice to support further protests early in September.
The JAK considers that ministers have failed to raise doubts about the contract.
In July, young doctors and medical students rejected the contract offered by LMA.
58% of all the members who took part in the vote voted against the contract.
On Thursday evening's Twitter news, JAK Council member Elén Mackorta points out that the government continues to remain silent on this issue and therefore the contract offer has been rejected.
She said, "In view of this, as a result of the JAK vote, the proposal for a contract has been completely rejected and a decision has been taken to request new formal negotiations to discuss the most important issues."
In response to the government's silence, the JAK today formally requested a meeting with the LMA Council to authorise the development of new contracts to enter into force in September.
As a result of the dispute, young doctors participated in six strikes, including for the first time in the history of NHS.
After the vote rejected the terms of the contract offered by the LMA recommended by the BMA, the new doctor’s representative, Dr. Johan Malavana, withdrew from his office.
Before meeting with 54 000 young doctors and medical students, he had told BMA members that the offer was good and will be accepted.
After the vote, Secretary of Health Jeremy Hunts announced that the contract would be concluded with English doctors.
Russia and Turkey: Away Alliance?
A hate that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to discuss and report on the end of the eight-month long term term and economic sanctions war.
However, when Vladimir Putin, congratulated the Turkish leaders in St. Petersburg's palace, it struck that this partnership is more needed for Ankara.
But they were both shocked.
Vladimir Putina’s smile looked like a puzzle and did not give rise to warm emotions, even in view of his normal resistance.
On the other hand, the view of Tayjips Erdogan at least five times mentioned Putin as his " dear friend", a review of the meeting.
I'm exhausted.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only improve to the pre-crisis level but would become even stronger.
On the next day, a newspaper reported that Erdogan had acted as if nothing had happened.
I think his enthusiasm is causing conflicting feelings.
But Putina’s beaming voice shows that the Russian leader has not forgotten anything.
The first thing he mentioned in his speech was to land the Russian plane on the Syrian border.
At that time, Moscow responded.
Putin accused Ankara of being a doll in Moscow's back.
The procedure was even more painful, given that it came from a friend.
The restoration of true trust will be very difficult, perhaps impossible.
Since November Russia's public position has changed.
For several months, government-controlled television spread aggressive accusations against Ankara.
Suddenly, it seemed that all of them were Turkish.
The most serious accusation was that Erdogan’s own family benefited from the illegal oil trade with the controlled Syrian part of the Islamic State.
He, of course, gave it up.
But the main message of the St. Petersburg meeting is that it is time to forget the past.
Finally, this meeting was only because Putin received President Erdogan's apology.
Russia could view it as a victory of its kind.
The benefits of Ankara from the peace agreement are obvious.
First, Erdogan needs all possible friends after a failed turn last month, where he tried to gas.
The countless terrorist attacks have also disrupted his position.
There are also economic motives.
Russian sanctions have caused substantial losses, especially the ban on charter travel, which usually ensures several million Russian tourists in Turkish resorts each year.
The number of tourists decreased by almost 90%.
Russian tour operators and charter companies will also be relieved when regular flights are renewed.
They look forward to the holiday season in the Mediterranean.
It is already this week that national TV plans to reduce the prices of fruit and vegetables, as Turkey's imports of fruit and vegetables will be renewed.
As the local newspaper Vedemosti reads: "Tourists for them, tomatoes for us."
However, the visit also had other political motives on the part of Moscow.
Ankara is angry at the West about, they think, a weak reaction to the attempt to turn.
There is also dissatisfaction with the ongoing negotiations on the accession of the EU and Putina, which are well-used by the situation that Turkey has recovered from the West.
The Russian leader undoubtedly obtained additional points in Ankara's eyes, expressing support for his elected government after the coup attempt.
Consider that Moscow understands this well, for it itself is deeply ingrained fear of change in the country of the regime.
The summit, which took place in this Greek port city, gave Russia and Turkey the opportunity to present, as one analyst called it, 'refugeed alliance', the two countries that feel distant from the West, join forces.
However, despite the unity publicly demonstrated, there are still considerable differences in views between the two countries.
The main disagreements concern Syria, where Russia presents itself as a peacemaker, but in fact Russia and Turkey support the opposite sides.
After more than three hours of initial negotiations, not wanting to disclose information, both presidents announced at the press conference that they had not discussed this issue.
The President of Turkey has deliberately avoided the issues of both countries, while President Putin wanted to emphasise them.
There is no clear consensus on how the two countries could find a common language on the issue of Syria.
However, after months of exposure to hostile relations and potential disasters, when NATO member Turkey hit the Russian fighter plane, the situation has improved as both leaders have at least resumed negotiations.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland
The SME brand will continue to play a role in support, announced by the Bank’s Executive Director.
Outside Scotland, SMEs will no longer be available.
Ross Makevans tells the BBC channel in Scotland that the SKB brand was associated with bank ambitions globally.
It has rejected these ambitions, as the bank was almost bankrupt eight years ago and needed financial assistance.
In the meantime, experts in the branding strategy have used the SME brand to protect other consumer financial brands.
The bank received millions of marks from international sports sponsors, starting with the rule of the Six Nations and ending with the Vimbledon tennis champion Andy Murei.
However, it is now decided to place other national brands in the foreground.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be available to Scottish customers, but it will not be initialised.
In England and Wales all references to SMEs, outside the main office and official stock exchange list, will be replaced by the name NatWest.
The Ulster Bank is already in use in the Republic of Ireland and in Northern Ireland.
Now there will also be less private financial brands, such as Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank.
Makevans was interviewed during the departure with clients and employees from Invernessshire.
He told the BBC Scotland channel: "The SKB will become a brand of our investors and with which our employees work, because now we are becoming more of a brand bank."
In time, the bank itself became a global brand and SMEs became a global brand.
Now I say that we no longer have global ambition, we have local ambitions.
Each of these brands will represent something unique in its industry and our employees will work with customers under these brands.
The SMEs have already announced that they will not continue sponsoring the Six Nations and will engage in various brands in sponsoring sport.
"It's time to become a brand bank, because we've been asking ourselves a question about how to become a better bank for our clients?" says Executive Director.
Three years ago, it would have been very cynical if we announced that we would become a great bank for our customers and develop these brands.
But thanks to heavy work and focusing on customer needs, rather than on our own needs, we have evidently made major changes.
We can revive these brands again, so I think now is the right time.
Francis Detori scored 3000, winning first place in New York City with horse Predication
Detori is rewinding champagne by winning his 3000 victory twice in the first race in New York City.
On Friday, Frank Detori won his 3000th victory in the history of Britain, gaining first place in New York City.
He achieved it by honoring the second victory in these contests that took place in his hometown, with the predication trained by John Gosdens.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth gecko, which has achieved such results in the scattered competitions of horses.
He joined Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smiths, Lester Pigs, Peter Eder, and Willie Carson.
The three-time champion, Detori, who won with the Ghayyar horse before, said, "It's something special."
I'm very excited because my family is here.
I am very happy that this happened in New York because I have been living here for 30 years.
This is not a big deal, it is not the Royal Ashkot, but it is a regular Friday evening with 20,000 people.
I feel relieved and very grateful.
After victory Detori and Predilection are faced with applause and applause.
Two goals have been achieved in these record events with obstacles - Champion Richard Jones and the 20-time champion Ser Antonius Mackoys, who has installed several records in his career, winning more than 4300.
Lester Pigots, a nine-time winner, won 4493 in his career.
France is one of the best jokes today, and there is no surprise that he has achieved success that only rarely can be achieved.
He is stylish and powerful, but his tactics make him feel different from other jacks.
He is a fantastic speaker, his enthusiasm and charm for years attracts fans of this kind of sport.
A few weeks ago, in Epsoma's competitions, I told Franky that he had already won 6,000 wins if he didn't participate only in the weekend's competitions and big competitions.
But seriously, it is a real joy that France has been winning regularly for 30 years in the UK.
He is a life - threatening man who uses the British to the best of his ability, and he is an excellent gait.
Franks Detori noted this achievement with his brand - the flying decision.
From the wind of completion to the flying decision, France Detori has been the face of British horse racing for 20 years.
This was the full path of the adventures.
He has won countless great contests, including the famous "Great Seventeenths" in Ashkot, and has also suffered a plane crash and disqualification for the use of preparations.
Three years ago, he found it difficult to return after six months of disqualification, but he demonstrated his strength by challenging those who questioned him to return to his best form.
And he could take part in the contests for a while - Detori has previously said that he would welcome continued participation in the contests for at least 50 years.
Russian President Putins resigns the head of administration Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putins unexpectedly dismissed Serge Ivanov, head of administration.
Ivanov has been in Putina’s closest company for many years.
Currently, 63-year-old politician is appointed as a special representative in the field of nature and transport.
The Kremlin statement states that Putin 'has decided to exempt Ivanov from the duties of the head of the Russian government's administration', without mentioning the reason.
In place of Ivanova, Antons Vaino, who has been his deputy since 2012.
The 44-year-old Vaino has been killed by a diplomat.
Vaino was born in 1972 in the capital of Estonia in Tallinn, a graduate of the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MVSAI) and later worked in the Tokyo Embassy.
As sent by the Kremlin website (in Russian), he later led the president's protocol and government staff administration.
After being appointed, he said to Putin, "Thank you for your trust."
In my view, the main task of the administration is to support your work as the president of the country by drawing up laws and controlling the implementation of your decisions.
On Friday, Putin told a Russian broadcaster that Ivanov himself wanted to quit his job and recommended Vaino as his substitute.
Do you believe that the smiles are true?
This step has raped Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov is a sense and close companion of Vladimir Putin and, like Putin, has at the time worked in the Security Service of the Council.
He was one of the most influential men in Russia.
At a national television session, both men announced that Ivanov was derogating from the post on his own initiative.
But despite the smiles on the cameras, which are rarely confirmed by such an explanation, especially before the parliamentary elections.
Is this the outcome of the fight for power?
No one knows.
However, the official claim that a man, who was considered a potential president, suddenly wanted to be the leader of Russian environmental policy, was considered to be a great success.
In comments published on the cream website Ivanov says to Putin: "It is the fact that at the beginning of 2012, I ask you to entrust me with this difficult job, even to say, a problematic job, for four years.
It turns out I've been working on this for four years and eight months.
Ivanov was appointed in December 2011.
He was former Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and former member of the National Security Service, as well as Putin.
By the end of 1990, Putin was the head of the Federal Security Service, who has succeeded in the VDK, Ivanov took over his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he called Ivanov among the five men he trusted most.
At the end of Putina's second term, Ivanov was considered a potential candidate for the Russian President, since Putina's transfer to the third term would be anti-constitutional.
But then the president became another close companion of Putina - Dmitrijs Medvedevs.
Putin became Prime Minister, and after three and a half years he returned to the presidency.
The appearance of soft fish in a garden in Banfas city
A man from Banfas asks for help to clarify the conditions that fish appeared in his garden in Banfa.
Kevin Beins thinks that 75 fish could be sands that have gone off with the water room.
Mr. Beina, who lives about 500 metres from the sea, published a video on the Periscope website, hoping that someone would know how this 5 centimeters of large fish had come into his garden.
Crowd crossing: the bridge is now connected to Faifu.
The projects of EUR 1.35 billion are currently planned to be completed in May 2017.
Engineers have connected the northern part of the Kvinspherian crossing and viaduct, which means that the bridge is now connected with Faifu.
The first of the four connecting parts has been completed, which means that the bridge building is approaching the end.
The construction of the Faifa bridge is 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tonnes.
It consists of 10,000 tons of steel, 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 support cables.
At present, the projects of EUR 1.35 billion are planned to be completed in May 2017.
Economic Secretary Keith Brown was on his way to the construction site today and was one of the first to climb the bridge.
He said, "This is a symbolic and historic moment in the construction of the Queensphere Bridge."
In this project we see an insurmountable engineering solution, where only more than 30 000 tonnes of cement and steel are used in the construction of this part.
Despite the huge weight and size of the bridge, the connection of the bridge and viaduct is an extremely delicate process that requires enormous precision.
In general, more than 79% of the bridge deck is already built and the last step that will be included in the connection of the bridge with Rosit today, which means that all the parts of the bridge are ready to be included.
The fourth bridge connection project director Michael Martins tells us: "The first link is a very important point in building any bridge."
In this fantastic project, the first link shows the highest-class engineering industry.
After the last phase of the road installation and its connection to the north tower support, we were left to connect the northern road phase with a part of the land or viaduct.
This was done by raising the part of the north’s junction viaduct to the south by 700 millimetres.
It was a huge and at the same time a very delicate operation.
Because the route is 222 metres long, it weighs about 6000 tonnes and was to be dragged about 3 %.
The delicacy, because the tolerance in both directions with which the team worked, was only a few millimetres.
Luckily, everything worked out fine.
Simon Bails gets gold for women.
Forget the sentence.
Forget the mess.
Simon Bails doesn't worry about it.
A dynamic leap.
Without effort, he puts his fingers on the bench.
I can't go to the floor.
Absolutely not guilty.
And finally the Olympic champion.
On Thursday, 19 - year - old U.S. winemakers beat gold medals, fully demonstrating the difference between themselves and the rest of the world on the Olympic scene.
The total number of her points was 62,198, which was more than the result of the Russian sportsman, Alia Mustafin, who won the gold medal and her team members.
On Thursday, U.S. sportsman Simona Bailsa won a win for the football win for individual final women at the 2016 Summer Olympic Games in Riodjegnairo, Brazil.
Bails became the fourth American in order to gain the title of the multi-species champion and the fifth best winner by gradually strengthening the reputation as the best winner of his generation and possibly the best winner in history.
When the final result was announced, she burst into tears, for the long journey to this moment was over.
This achievement brings them near impossible athletes such as Michael Felps, who lifts their sport at another level.
For the last three years, Balsa has dominated in his sport by winning 15 medals in World Championships, including 10 gold medals, performing such excellent, accurate and ambitious vintages that in 1984 the 1984 Olympic Championship Mérija Lu Retone called him "the best winner she's ever seen".
In Brazil, she was faced with her last test, where she had to face the hopes that lay with her rather than with other athletes.
She would be disappointed if I returned to her home in Spring, Texas, without gold medals.
The US athletes Simon Bails (left) and Alija Raismane are injured after the individual finals of the gold and silver medal winnings for women in the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, which took place Thursday.
The first gold medal was won by Bailsa on Tuesday, making special selection coordinators Marta Karolji pass away.
Even though Baals claim that there was no such expectation in their long journey to the tops of glory, it is not true.
Part of her presence in the free movement, which includes her special acrobatic transition, is accompanied by Latin music, which would perfectly fit on the street next to the arena of the Rio Olympics.
It's not a coincidence.
A girl who was adopted by her parents when she was still a child and who was discovered by coach Eimijas Būrman's mother on a sports trip to the sports hall where the Burmese courts were held, has now become a force to be counted.
She has not lost in multi-stakeholder competitions since summer 2013 and victory series can continue as long as Baals want.
Although Mustafin was slightly in control during the two rotations, it was only illusion.
The balance ball and the free movement - part of the game, where Balsa will defend her champion's title, is still just ahead.
She stood in front of the score 15,433 on the balcony and strengthened the leadership with score 15,933 in the free movement
Raismane gently examined her while waiting for the results that were just formality and she burst into tears of joy when she fulfilled the dream she had once recorded in her book.
Raismane’s result was a minor activism for four years when she shared a third place with Mustafin, but lost her fight for bronze medal.
This time 22-year-old captain of the team, who the Americans call the "old mother", stood out in a convincing direction.
After her performance in the free movement, which raised doubts about her return, she was able to devote her time to the airbending effort.
Only 19 years old, the Twitter viral record she published this week is of entirely different importance.
Six years old Mahaj Braun's "silver down" survived in Philadelphia.
The police report that six-year-old boys were shot in Philadelphia, indicating that he was already the second six-year-old who was shot in Philadelphia this week.
The parents of the child confirmed to the CBS Philadelphia news channel that it was Mahajs Brown.
The elders say that Brown was shot several times, including a circus, a leg, a hand, and a belly, but he was still aware when he was taken to the hospital.
Her grandmother Delores Melendez tells the television: "She's little body was just broken windows."
I can't believe it.
The boy has been placed in a critical condition in the hospital and has already undergone several operations.
The family informs him that he will certainly recover.
He had to start going to the first class at the local elementary school.
Brown is one of four people who were captured in the part of Germany.
Three men were also shot: two 29 - year - old men and one 32 - year - old man.
CBS Philadelphia reports that one of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition, but the other two sufferers are stable.
The canal reports that the child was found in the front seat of the car near 29 years of age in critical condition.
The other two victims were not found in the car and the police were investigating whether one of them had been shot.
The investigator informed CBS Philadelphia that several shooters were likely to be involved.
The guns are found at the scene, which belongs to various weapons.
It seems to have been a long shot.
The shoes were found on both sides of the entrance.
"So it seems that there have been several armed shooters here who were actively involved in the challenge," said Chief of Police of Philadelphia, Antonius Ginaldi.
The damage has also been caused to several homes and cars.
No one has been detained yet and it is reported that the police are checking the surveillance cameras.
On Tuesday, during the interrogation, a six - year - old girl fell into her hand while she was playing in front of her home in the Vestouklein area.
She's getting better, but the police are still looking for the guilty.
Why do we need Simon, Gabia, and Lauria?
I call it the Year's Women's Olympic Viiglated Command for several reasons.
First of all, I've been on all the summer Olympics since 1984, and the US team has never been so good.
Second, this team has three light bulbs, Simon Bails, Gabia Douglas and Lauria Hernandez, who are inspired by many new women of origin.
People may be proud that there is also Ali Raisman, a Jew and Madison Kocian, a Catholic.
Finally, this team really represents America.
It has also strengthened the participation of black and Latin American athletes in this sport.
For the last four years, the best hunter is the American of African origin.
Last year, Simona and Gabia took 1 and 2 places.
These are impressive results.
In the previous Olympics, Gabia Douglas became an exciting champion, and America was able to gloat.
Now the world has seen incredible victories performed by the three-way world champion Simon Bails, Douglas, and Lauria Hernandez, performing unimaginable, but masterful weddings.
On Thursday, Simona became the fourth American in order to obtain gold medals for women.
Their teammate Alija Raismane won a silver medal.
We have seen the best that this sport can do, but the situation in the rest of the country is completely different in the hours of the wedding.
Simona, Gabia, and Lauria joined the Olympics as well as Ali and Madison.
They are "Olympical Five", because the next Olympic Winning Team will only have four athletes, and this is Coach Marta Karola's last year's training team.
In fact, winning is a precious sport. Winnings mainly train in private light-tight clubs, and they are maintained by parents who pay for training, rooms, travel, forms, hotels (trainers, sportsmen and their families) and other expenses.
Most of this easy-to-use club is located in urban areas that can afford this sport.
In these clubs, athletes take away all their training, and it is a precious and long contribution to easy families.
Eimija Būrmana - Simona Bails trainer and Mexico Hainia - Lauria Hernandez trainer has trained his athletes since both girls started working with ease of mind.
We need to provide for new girls who are inspired by Simona, Gabia, and Lauria, who are more likely to be more successful in winning.
I set up my lighter organisation 20 years ago.
My organization is located in Harlem, and we offer more than 15,000 young people in cities (mainly black and Spanish origins) vintage training free of charge or at a low price. We have also trained national and international champions.
In September, we will discover a branch office in Detroit (in my hometown) to provide local young people with the opportunity to learn about this great sport.
Mildness develops strength, bond and body coordination, as well as learns serious work, discipline and achievement.
This combination ensures a long life with good health and success both at school and at work.
This team inspires thousands of young girls to train in light-duty and this is fantastic.
Working with this type of sport is very important, especially for young girls.
This is a very exciting time.
Thanks to Simona, Alia, Gabia and Medison for the great demonstration of the "Sweet Power" by acquiring the Olympic gold medals and motivating countless new, diverse girls of origin to become healthy, strong and successful new women.
Following the rejection of the offer by Jeremy Hunt, the young doctors plan to develop more strikes.
The ministers hoped to close the dispute by reaching an agreement on changes to the agreement with representatives of the British Medical Association, but they rejected 58% of the 37,000 new doctors who participated in the vote.
In July, Hunt announced plans to conclude a contract indicating that NHS is in a unstable state and that further delays will only harm workers and patients.
The first new doctors have already signed the new contract, which provides for changes in working conditions at night and weekends to improve working conditions at hours of work.
Yesterday, a new doctor’s representative of BMA, Dr. Elén Macourta, announced that the new doctors still have serious concerns about the contract offered, especially that it will deepen the labour crisis and that it does not provide equal conditions for all doctors.
Eight weeks have elapsed until the first group of new doctors sign the new contract, so progress is needed because the time has not left much.
The BMA's efforts to solve the problems through negotiations have met the government's will to engage and sometimes complete silence.
This happened despite the fact that in the past month, Jeremy Hunts said that his door was always open.
Jeremy Hunt must act immediately, stop the operation and cooperate with the new doctors.
If he does not, then the new doctors are ready for new protests.
At the end of April, more than 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 visits were postponed during the last strike, while sisters and consultants tried to replace the doctors who had been in the pit.
Ministers hoped to close the dispute by reaching agreement on changes to the agreement with representatives of the UK Medical Association.
BMA wants to raise the rate of work per week for 54 000 new doctors affected by the new contracts.
NHS Employment Executive Director Daniels Mortimers called on new doctors not to go to strike.
Mr Mortimera explains that the strike does not solve anything, but only increases the pressure on the staff and worries, creates stress and delays in patients, caregivers and their families.
In the last two months, we have spoken with the new Committee of Doctors, and together with the Ministry of Health and other institutions, we have responded positively to their questions about supervisors and rapporteurs.
Employers hope that active cooperation on other important issues such as placement of workers, flexible training, in addition to training for those who return after career interruptions, training costs, mutual recognition of training programmes, study leaving and gender inequality in medicine - shows that employers, the English Health Education Authority and the Ministry of Health seriously want to implement agreements concluded with the BME in November, February and May.
This medicine may reduce the risk of heart attack by 2 pounds a day.
Thousands of patients who have had a heart attack may be treated with 2 pounds a day, since the official representatives recommend that they take more people and longer periods of time.
The anti-inflammatory medicine Ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart beats in people with heart disease.
This medicine is already prescribed for use for 12 months after the heart rate by reducing the risk of a repeated heart rate.
NHS representative NICE recommends that this product be used for 4 years after heart rate to further reduce the risk of heart rate in people with heart and blood vessels problems.
However, NICE, currently under NHS, is recommended to use this medicine for 4 years after the heart rate to further reduce the risk of heart and blood vessels.
Every year, about 140,000 people experience heart attacks in England, and a fourth of them experience repeated strokes or strokes.
Cardiac and strokes are caused by the accumulation of fat in the heart walls by forming prophylaxis.
If the barrier breaks, it can cause a drum by blocking the blood flow to the heart and causing a heart attack.
However, if the thrombosis separates from the blood vessels wall, it may go further into the bloodstream and block access to the brain by causing an attack.
People who have had a heart attack have been exposed to a higher risk of repeated heart attack.
Ticagrelor produced by the UK company AstraZeneca, which is marketed as Brilique, reduces the risk of thrombosis.
The new NICE guidelines published today recommend that people take 90 mg Ticagrelor for 12 months and 3 more years at 60 mg twice daily with aspirin.
NICE Director of Health Technology Professor Kerola Longson explains: "Despite the availability of medications for the prevention of repeated heart attack, more than a quarter of the people who have had a heart attack experience another heart attack or stroke, often with severe consequences."
Fear of repeated heart beats can leave a negative impression on the quality of human life.
The evidence suggests that Ticagrelor in combination with aspirin effectively reduces the risk of recurrent heart attacks and heart attack in people who have experienced it once.
We are pleased that we can extend treatment opportunities to thousands of people who are thus benefiting from Ticagrelor.
In view of the limited information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor, in particular the risk of bleeding when taking this medicine for more than three years, the draft guidelines do not recommend that it be used for longer than that period.
A culture of policy law promotes fraud during elections in Muslim communities
According to the management report, the former mayor of Tauerhamlet, Lutfurs Rahmans, was released from office in connection with corruption.
The government report reveals that as a result of the culture of policymaking, the eyes are being directed towards widespread fraud in Muslim communities.
Former Prime Minister Sers Eriks Pilks criticises the police, election guards and city councils that they ignore signs of fraud in the election process, because "they fear to undermine ethnic and religious interests."
The former secretary of the community, who has now become the head of the anti-corruption organisation, says that the recruitment of voters for religious reasons has been so widespread that the police should allow guards to be placed at the polling stations to protect the voters.
He also suggests that voters should present a document of proof when they vote to prove their true identity.
At present, voters must only specify the name and address.
He even recommends that the votes cast by the voters should be marked with a special tone to prevent a double vote.
The rapporteurs must also ensure greater protection, says Sir Eric.
He believes that the press should ensure greater access to Council documents and decisions adopted by the informal committees and working groups.
He says: "The goal is not only to prevent fraud of will, but also to protect the local government from the wider corruption and fraud culture that goes hand in hand with it."
The report was sent by Dauningstrita after a scandal in connection with the elections of Tauerhamlet.
Last year, the Court of Special Election decided to remove the city mayor Lutfur Rahman from the city mayor's office because of corrupt and illegal activities.
The Court found that Rahman 's religious view of his Muslim community was "simply distorted" and sealed his critics by accusing them of racism and Islamophobia.
"Rahman led his election campaign with the idea that the religious duty of faithful Muslims is to vote for him."
Some 300 votes were false or questionable, for one person had voted several times.
Ser Eriks also points out that there are signs of fraud across the country.
He pointed out that it is particularly disturbing to vote in favour of a post, where the senior members of the Muslim community forced others to vote in favour of themselves.
Ser Eriks recommended a series of measures to improve the electoral system, including the presentation of a document proving the identity of the person.
His report reads: "The evidence shows that members of the unprotected ethnic minority communities, especially women and young people, are forced to vote in favour of the community's elected senior candidates, particularly in Bangladesh and Pakistan."
"There is concern that the regional authorities are not paying attention to these problems due to political correctness, because it could undermine ethnic and religious interests."
Ser Eriks made 50 recommendations to improve the electoral system, which also includes the ban on political activists working with the votes cast by mail to prevent the "collection of votes".
The Tereza Meja report also called for a more thorough registration check to prevent the use of voters' lists to fraud in the area of immigration and benefits.
To consider the possibility before the vote to request voters to present a document of evidence to persons.
Mark the fingers of the voting voters with special ink to prevent a double vote.
To systematically check the nationality of persons to ensure that the person has the right to vote.
Determine three-year limitations for requests for automatic postal voting.
To prohibit political campaign participants and active members from voting by post and election rounds to vote by post.
Ensuring the police's power to appoint a security guard to the polls.
To amend the law in order to facilitate the call for persons to be held liable under the 1983 Human Rights Act.
Refuse to photograph the elections in the polls.
Determine the requirements for the use of English only in the polls (except in Wales).
Strengthen training to ensure that the voters go to the polls by one.
Ser Eriks is criticising the Metropolis police for not being aware that the Tauerhamlet case is not accused .
He says: "The election was simply a disqualification of Lufcur Rahman and his representatives for actions related to corruption and fraud."
He was convinced that he was found guilty of a standard of criminal law based on unaccompanied evidence.
He also criticises the inefficiencies of the city council's electorate "keeks check" in the electoral polls.
Ser Eriks points out: "The court decision taken last year is a alarm call.
Our country is known as the birth of a parliament, but the disturbing and hidden elections are spreading fraud and the fact that fraud does not threaten this good reputation.
Reaction with the rider - Keitas co-workers and other Rio Olympics co-workers
In 2016, the fans of the Rio Olympics were excited about the French rider Pauline Ferrando Prevot, who were recognized by fans as extremely similar to the Hercogie of Cambridge.
However, the 24 - year - old rider is not the only athlete fighting this summer for gold, who, as the media say, boasts of his famous companion.
Therefore, for the honor of the Rio Olympic Games and all the famous faces currently visible on our screen, FEMAIL has created a list of Olympic players, which are especially similar to the Hollywood stars.
Bear and wolf: US team member Breidijs Elisons, on the left, has been compared since childhood with Leonardo Di Kaprio
Despite Keita’s companions on the bike route, many people on the Internet point out that this pilot could be Leonardo Di Kaprio’s twin brother.
A member of the U.S. men's team of shooting men, Breidy Elisons, caused a windstorm when photographs were published, where he was very similar to Volstrita Vilka.
The sportsman himself noticed the wind in social media and recognized that he had been compared to Leonardo Di Kaprio since he was a child.
"I personally don't see a big match except for the bar," Breidy tells the edition of Huffington Post.
"He's a handsome gentleman, so I think he's a compliment."
This year, even more popularity will undoubtedly be one of the most popular partners in London's 2012 Olympic Games: a disturbing similarity between British telephony Greg Ruterford and popular actors Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian light-headed Alija Mustafin is compared to Gloria Estefan, the American singer of Cuban origin, thanks to her large, expressive eyes.
Speaking of swimming, the Southern African swimmer Cameron van der Burgs has been compared for several years to the "Raditi View" star Metjū Morison.
Changes: This user has noticed that Nathan is an "Inception" actor’s version of the film.
Also, old companions are tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnet, with similar bites and lips.
Russian silver medalist, swimmer Julia Efimova and actress Annalin Mackorda can be proud not only of the skin and blonde hair that are dressed in the sun. Meanwhile, fans believe that the athletic US sportsman Nathan Adrian is like Joseph Gordon Levi.
Poor women: The football star (on the left) Hope Solo and the series "Deksters" actress Jennifer Karpenter (on the right) has a similar face shape and eyes.
Not one: some Twitter user was delighted to find out that others also see these similarities
Theory: This user considers that there may be a reason why both seem so similar
Recently, a Twitter user was very pleased to announce that "the other internet users agree that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter actually look identical."
The U.S. football star and the series "Deksters" actress are so very similar to the face and eyes.
Other popular comparisons relate to Keri Volš Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to Laura Linnie's smile. Also, the light gold medal winner Gabi Douglas boasts a beautiful, wide smile that resembles the "Bring It On" starring Gabriel's Union smile.
The CBC Olympics commentator apologizes for his comment that the Chinese swimmer has been 'end of as a pig'.
Barion McDonald's analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhas's fourth finish place in a 4x200 m free-style stadium for women, called the air pressure in CBC viewers.
Canada's CBC channel was forced to apologize, because one of its commentators commented that 14 years old Chinese swimmers had been "flighted out of the competitions that he smiled alone" and had ended up as a pig".
Commenter Bairons Makdonalds thought that his microphone had been turned off when 4x200 m of free-style stadium women finally expressed their personal opinion.
Macdonald, who was included in the CBC team of commentators to give comments on life, said: "The small 14-year-old from China cannot be held together."
"Before she fell asleep, she fled from the competitions that she smiled alone and ended up as a pig."
Thank you very much.
The result of the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhana in the second phase was 1:57.79, which is 1.61 seconds slower than the result of the Canadian Talores Ruck, allowing the Canadians to reach China.
The viewers throughout Canada responded immediately on the Internet because they were shocked to hear such sounds and statements.
Emets Makfarlains tweeted: "Did the CBC's direct comment just say that 14-year-old swimmer from China "ends like pigs"???.
Idiots don't understand that they were still in the direct ether.
Ai Yancha from China's 4x200m free-style final women were called "a small 14-year-old from China who does not live together."
Criticism against the Baron Macdonald quickly came into force, as many asked for explanations.
Twitter users were unable to trust when listening to Barion Macdonald's insensitive comments.
Twitter user Sarah Paradi wrote: "Oh, #ByronMacDonald.
You're the CBC and Canada and you're the reason we're all hearing racists.
Shortly after that, Scott Russell, who was currently running the CBC live radio, apologized for Macdonald's comments, saying, "We apologize for the comment on the result of the swimming in the direct ether."
It was a bad choice of words, and we are very sorry that it happened.
CBC apologized to more than 90 people who had responded to this comment.
McDonald's colleague Scott Russell came to his place to apologize.
Then the CBC collected an apology for more than 90 Twitter users who complained about Makdonalda's comment.
The channel also quickly published an apology and a statement.
We are very sorry that such comments were made and they came to the right place.
Yesterday we immediately responded and apologized to all online viewers and social media followers.
For the sake of clarity, it should be said that the Bairon comments were made about the performance of the swimmer, not addressed to her personally.
In any case, however, they were unprofessional and failed to choose expressions and Bairon was very sorry about what happened.
On Thursday afternoon, Macdonald personally apologized to the direct ether and tried to explain that he did not think that his comment would be considered a personal attack.
He said, "I would like to take a moment and apologize for the comment I made yesterday after the women's free-style competition."
I'm talking about the performance of the swimmer, not about him personally.
To say that I did not intend to show disrespect, I am truly sorry that it happened.
Primark the buyers are shocked by a woman who immediately fits in the basement store.
The buyers felt uncomfortable when the woman began to dress up to fit the bicycles in the middle of the shop.
Even worse, she waited for them to see if she was present and then withdrew by putting her clothes back in the shop.
She continued looking for clothes from the Folkeston Bouverie Place Trade Centre store and held four more bikes.
Primark store Bouverie Place in the center of commerce in Folkeston – the place where this woman was in the basement and then placed it back in the hair.
At the time, there were also two children’s mothers, Jenija Davidson, who said that an unknown woman, after she had put on her underwear and left the shop, did not buy anything.
She points out that people could not trust their eyes.
Standing in the middle of the shop, she took off her hair underpants, pulled off her jackets and shoes, and also put them on the spot.
She did not even try to find a more discreet place where to measure them, she simply kept them in place as well.
They all looked at the way she pulled her shirt and apparently didn't see it, because she just put it back in her hair.
She measured three more bikes until she decided that none of them liked and left the store.
He did not think that he would be attracted to someone who would look at or even think about the person who would buy the clothes he was wearing.
Davidson's novelist (33 years) from Kent says, "Someone thinks that someone will buy clothes that have been observed by another person and that are not washed afterwards."
The incident took place on Tuesday afternoon.
Davidson's novelty adds: "I accept that after her removal, the shop staff removed these clothes from the shop's hair - which is also acceptable."
I cannot imagine that I could buy a new basement and find out that another woman has kept it and then it is not empty.
The representative of Primark pointed out that Primark was aware of the incident that took place on Tuesday, 9 August.
Specific clothes are removed from the shop’s hair.
How to protect yourself from firearms using Krav Maga
The world is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it a little safer.
In order to find out how to protect ourselves in a close distance from the shooters, we spoke to the Grandmaster of Krav Maga from New York Ron Mizraki.
Regardless of whether you attack from the front or back, this video shows how to protect yourself and get over the lift.
Misraki points out that if the bumper attacks from the back, it must first be turned to clearly see the bumper and avoid any such trajectory.
Then the weapon must be held between his front hand and his shoulder and made a seat in the face of the enemy with his free elf.
Then follow the site with the goal through the circus and as long as the attacker stops in pain, he must withdraw his weapon, go on face with the gun and retreat, continue to turn his weapon against him.
If the thruster approaches from the front, the situation is similar - it must be avoided from any of these trajectorys, the weapon must be extinguished, and the weapon must be removed so that the wicked cannot be shot.
At the same time, pressure must be put on the weapon and the target must be carried out by the enemy on the chest and finally withdraw the weapon and refrain from continuing to rely on it.
Does it sound complicated?
Watch the video to see how Misraki does it.
But remember, if you're not the Krav Maga master, then it's safer to get your money back to the miner.
The family of the Waters is demolishing the social home of Saltas Kornvola and is on the street.
The flood family has been left out of the neighborhood to terrorize neighbors, causing damage to the social home to the size of 50,000 marks.
Tanja Skoldona and her partner, Sean Trebilkoks, are just a few of the property in Saltaš Kornvola, as several complaints have been made about them.
When they were pressured to leave the property, the shocked housekeepers found that the property was completely demolished.
There were holes in the floors and walls, waste washed everywhere, and walls were covered with graphite.
The family is now out of property and is likely to live in a private property.
The owner of the Cornvola Housekeeping Service Donna Makewaja says there is concern that the house will not be able to be restored.
She says that the people who lived here were extremely difficult and she feels that people cannot live it.
In this case, a number of factors must be assessed, as this property will no longer have a good reputation in Cornwall.
This family is famous and their name is well - known.
There were three boys who were periodically held in possession and the police said that their terror appeared as violence, exaggeration on the streets with baseball bats, induction of locals, use of drugs, sales of drugs, and sound abuse and laziness.
In June, 47 years old Skelton, whose name was property, was sentenced to antisocial behaviour.
In several demolished rooms, we found clean waste.
In the home, where drugs are previously marketed, there are also several grounds for the floor.
They say they've been on the street regularly, and they've been called the police all the time.
The Cornwall Housekeeping Service put them out of the property pressure when they were given 11 weeks to get out of the house voluntarily.
The missing neighbors were very happy to be left because their lives were absolute.
One said, "They didn't care about other people."
We lived with them for 20 years, it's always been crazy.
I can't believe how often I've seen the police here.
We couldn't sleep this morning.
We woke up because there was so quiet here - we didn't know it!
Now that they're finally gone, it'll be wonderful here.
Adam Fitzpatrick, who is the head of the Family Protection of the Cornvola House Service, said that the family did not cooperate with the local security authorities.
The family lived here for 20 years and here was regularly called the police.
In the adult garden, various old and unused items were found.
He also said, "It is very sad that the tenants have not shown any responsibility for their behaviour, because leaving the house is always the last step considered by the Cornwall House Service."
This was a very difficult case because their behaviour was extreme and their neighbors had been very hard to see in their behavior.
I appreciate the work that all my team, Devona and Cornvola police and members of the community have done in this case, who were courageous and cooperating with us, providing the necessary information.
I hope that this event will make life easier for the neighbours and show that anti-social behaviour is unacceptable.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons lived here for different periods of time, but they were all about 20 years old.
A dirty mattress, which was left on the floor in one of the rooms after the exit.
The service staff will now have to clean up the waste stock left at home.
In 2014, the police house was cut and found more than 70 grams of marijuana, weight, accessories and 1,700 pounds in cash.
Skelton was only recognised as a criminal in the storage of class B drugs for the purpose of their distribution.
She argued that the money was intended for the memory of her son Lee Sheldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After leaving, it is known that they are now renting a private property in Plimut.
The graphs were marked on many of the walls of the house.
The police report that they will continue to detain tenants who violate their rental contracts.
The police representative of Devona and Cornvola, Angela Krova, points out that this is a clear warning to other tenants who continue to violate the rules.
She also said, "This is a warning to those who think they can act like a will and will have no consequences."
Devona and the Crown police do not accept criminal and anti-social behaviour, and the police will continue to work with our partners to protect the local communities.
The willingness to spend can give impetus to the economy.

The cannibal measures prohibit burkina Faso from swimming in the beaches.
The mayor of the southern French resort Kannu has prohibited wearing burkini swim costumes in this city’s beaches, which almost completely ensemble the woman’s body and very resembles the water suit, local officials announced on Thursday.
Kannu Mayor David Linars has signed an order that "access to beaches and swimming is prohibited to anyone who does not have a swimwear that respects good customs and secularism" as the basic principle of the French Republic.
"Pludmala's clothes, which appear outwardly in the course of religious affiliation, when France and the places of worship are the target of terrorist attacks, can create the risk of public order disturbances (smoothing, clashes, etc.) that need to be avoided," said the order.
"We are talking, not about the prohibition of religious symbols in the beach, but about outer clothing that relates to the trust of terrorists who fight with us," explained the head of the municipal municipal services in Tjeri Miguel.
He added that the burkina Fason swimsuits in Kannu beaches have not been seen since 28 July, when the good members of the central party "Republicans" Linárs signed this order and it came into force.
This week, in the city of Marseille, the Aquapark called for a planned private Muslim event for women who would wear burkins in swimsuits, as the presence of both the right and the left-wing politicians expressed concern about such an event.
In France it is prohibited to wear headgears of Muslim women, but no religious symbols or appropriate clothing are prohibited.
On 14 July, 85 people were killed in a terrorist attack in the nearby town of Nicaea, about which the group of responsibilities "Islama state" was taken.
On 26 July, two rebels, who had vowed allegiance to the State of Islam, brutally buried priests in the church in the north-west of France.

The festival "Cubana" started in Lucavsala.
Thursday, August 11th, in the evening, Lucavsal was given a start to one of the last of this summer's festivals - there will be "Cubana" until Sunday night.
The first evening meetings were held by groups such as Enter Shikari from Britain, who were expected to be a long time ago, but from the program, the American panki "NOFX", DJ Maxim from the group "The Prodigy" and others.
Also in the following days of the festival are the words of appreciation - "Guano Apes" and "Garbage", founder of Pancrok legend "Ramones" by Marky Ramones with "Marky Ramone's Blitzkryeg", "Brutto&Lyapis" by the Baltskry Pancrok leaders Sergei Mikalok in front of him, popular Georgian actor and singer Wahtangs Kikabidze, Ukrainians "Volipli Vidoplyasova" and a variety of others, but full of the programme can be considered here.
This is the second year that the "Cubana" festival takes place in Latvia.
When this was a financial failure and huge losses, it did not stop the organizers from trying again - they added the name to a term, included a group of Latvians (on Friday evening 19:15 at the scene of the "All Day Long") and announced that the festival now became "closer and has acquired the local color alongside the symbols of Riga as its panorama and cats".
Whether these efforts will be justified, yet too much to decide, because the festival just crashed, but, as Delfi Entertainment observed in the first evening, at least temporarily, the huge efforts of people to attract were not made and the number of visitors was similar to that of a child.

The President who remained in the shadow: Gustav Zemgal - 145.
On Friday, 12 August, 145 years have passed since the birth of the second President of Latvia Gustav Zemgals.
The Landgal has proclaimed the state of Latvia, but the outstanding remains in the shadow of the most widely described first President of Latvia, Jāņa Chakste, and the last president of the pre-trial period, Karlá Ulmana.
None of our citizens have defended democracy and the rule of law as well as the book by Arnold Auziņš, published by Gustav Zemgal ten years ago.
In the conversation with the Delfi portal, Auzihs stressed that Zemgal is one of the rare high-ranking politicians who have had a sense of humor.
The rest of them are stiff, always very correct.
He taught not to be such, but it could be similar today to that of Raymond Vianius.
"He was the one who is close to the people," says Auzinh.
Today’s politicians know bad news, they refer to Karli Ulman as good leaders, but rarely anyone knows how bad he was.
The only person on the board to whom he is not a member of the government has been General Balodius.
Even if he is kind and funny in the picture, he was hysterical in nature.
"The earth with its sense of humour and democracy leaves a direct opposite impression," Auzihs says.
Professor Aivars Stranga of the Faculty of History and Philosophy of the University of Latvia, in a conversation with Delfi, agrees with the Auginė's assessment of Zemgal as a peaceful and respected national.
He also notes that Zemgals showed respect for minorities and regularly invited the Jewish representatives to the President's palace.
"At the time, it was not an act, after the Zemgal Presidency Alberts Kwiess took over this tradition," the historian says.
He was a quiet and well-known man who had to be the president for a long time.
He didn't think about it, he just didn't want glory.
He was also quite critical of himself because he did not know the French language, but felt that the President should understand it.
"At the time of the Presidency, the French language was based on both learning and learning," explains Stranga.
The earth was not allowed to be re-elected to run, and he had no such high-ranking skills.
In any case, he is a very respected person in Latvia's history, and he was in a serious position in the President's palace - he was a very demanding notary.
The Zemgals also led the famous Zemgal Kassi Suvorova Street 3, where there was a company of miners and miners, in which virtually government negotiations became a state of Latvia.
He was always progressive.
He was not a great respecter of Ulmana, but he was not publicly opposed.
"In private negotiations it has sometimes been said that real Ulman's actions are not sympathetic to him," Stranga says.
He lived a peaceful life, there is no suspicion of lawlessness or corruption.
How is Zemgal remembered today?
Sorry, but for the most part he's only associated with some street in Riga.
He was an absolute democrat, and he thought he was central.
"In his time, there were no major disturbances, i.e. he could associate with such a real stable Presidency," Stranga sums up.
During the presidency of Gustav Zemgal, from 1927 to 1930, a visit to Sweden was also made to Latvia, which at the time indirectly meant full recognition in the neighbouring country and inclusion in the family of the democratic nations of Northern Europe.
On May 28, 1929, Zemgals visited Stockholm State.
The Swedish King Gustav V's response visit to Latvia took place on 29 June 1929.
The second president of Latvia was born in 1871, but left for life in January 1939.
A simple way to help a child deal with anger attacks.
I often come face - to - face with the fact that the anger of a child, the parenting of a child, is considered to be wrong and unusual.
When the child openly expresses his anger - we don't know how to react, "Econet" says psychologist Jekaterina Kesa.
The specialist encourages a small conversation about these natural and human feelings - anger and resentment that each one experiences periodically.
Aggression - it is already a physical action directed towards other people, and it usually appears when we feel angry.
When we are adults, we are angry, upset - usually we know what's going on with us and how to end it.
We can express, suppress, conceal, keep ourselves, tell about it to our friends or other neighbors, we can be angry to sell a divan, to smoke cigarettes (it's not the best way to get angry!), go in the shower, sit on the table and do other things that we don't normally do.
We do not turn our aggression against others because we know how to deal with these emotions.
Children who experience anger do not understand what happens to them, how to name them, and how to live with them.
They can say, "Come on!", you're a fool, you're a bad mother, I'm not going to hurt you, I'm not going to threaten you - and very rarely when you can say, "I'm mad at you."
Children live literally, they are completely right here, at this moment, they are spontaneous and truly in expressing their feelings, and often they are also in a range of emotions.
It is very important that parents do not prevent the child from expressing their feelings, including anger, not being informed about it, but, on the other hand, helping the child.
Should relationships be suspended?
A long working day where everything has not always happened as you would like, or simply a bad attitude - there are so many reasons why you would want to be at the moment, day or even longer "lock" from all over the world.
Is it possible to have a relationship and a little bit of a time?
However, does this show that each partner is on his way?
In his opinion, the gentlemen are divided into different ages.
Janis (23) is short and nuclear: "In my view, if relations are necessary, then you are not with the right people".
In time, Edwards (30) discovered a scheme that could help.
If you feel that your partner is starting to get nervous about every little detail, then it's definitely the right time to look at other hunting fields to see if you miss her, or especially if she doesn't think about it or even not want to see her again.
So the answer is - yes, delaying a break can help save time and understand how important you are to the other side.
Kaspar (29) reveals its theory.
In my view, relationships must be maintained on the other hand, because if you spend time with people 24 hours a day, seven days a week, the fights are inevitable.
They are caused by the sight of every detail that the other does, and it begins to fall on the nerves.
People start to curse each other, especially when there is nothing more to talk about, just about what you did day after day.
My personal experience makes me think so, so I have not been in a relationship for more than a few months.
If you think for a moment that somewhere else or others is better - then why has this woman, with whom you are together, earned something that you can think of not being good enough and there are paradise fields behind the mountains?
Thinking is already a little useful.
If it's not, then it's not.
"I do, therefore, condemn a little of those who do not have." says Edmund (46).
Karlim (33) is a completely contradictory view.
I think everyone needs a moment to stay.
You can't look at each other every moment, all the time, from morning to evening, and look at each other's love.
Attopies!
There are so many things - friends, work, ballet.
It's all about time.
Of course, even a Witness or a wife, however, if both realize that they have a balance between family life and the rest of the world, they can live up to the edge of the grave.
That's all.
March (27) says it: "It is difficult to say - whether it is necessary or not, may or may not take a break, but one is clear - to its proponent something in relation to the end is not, something missing."
If this issue arises, then it must be calculated that there will be a change in the next time - on the right or the wrong side, it will depend on itself.
I think as long as you're young and busy, as long as you're busy, I need to - at least all the time, but when everything remains serious and the relationship goes into a completely different phase, then there can be no talking about rest.
But you decide to spend all your life together!
"If you can no longer maintain one another's company and once in a while need a room, then there will be when you will be pensioners who comment on how long-term cats die or argue about what day the garden needs to be better rooted," explains Kristaps (19).
All the words of the Lord have been changed.
With its exciting and exciting personality, Rosentāls was the first to influence the interest of the Latvian people in visual arts.
"In this sense he was the first love of the Latvian people, which, as such, will remain unforgivable," wrote Roman Suta at the same time about Latvian painting mayor Jani Rozental.

The fighters of the terrorist group Islama state, fleeing the province of Menbija, Syria, captured about 2,000 civilians, who were used as a living force, announced on Friday the US-supported Kurds and Arab alliances.

Koligova refuses to apply to the VID driver's office.
Inga Kolígova, the head of the State Environment Service, decided to withdraw his candidacy for the office of Director-General of the National Revenue Service (VID), informed the Agency in the Ministry of Finance.
Collegiate points out that her candidacy consultation has increased between the ruling coalition parties.
It seems that the real reasons for the discussions are related to the visible but more frequent, invisible interests and they have nothing to do with the assessment of my professional capacity.
"It is also unacceptable to me," he said, "that I have already been the applicant for the role of the VID leader.
In the event that her candidacy was confirmed by the government, it would be clear that it would not be a convincing vote and that it would not allow the necessary changes to the VID to be fully worked and carried out, feeling the full support of the government.
Without it, full work would not be possible, Collegiate concludes.
"I have often publicly stressed that I do not want to be politically dependent, but at the moment all my candidacy process is too politicized," explains the official.
"Thanks for the confidence and support I have shown, it is the experience I value as a benefit," Reizniecei-Ozolai writes in Colígova.
On Wednesday, the unity indicated that, at the meeting with Collegiate, there were "essential contradictions" between the explanations of the candidate and the information available in the public registers on the costs of dividends of the SIA Palogos, as publicly available decisions of the Palogus participants' meetings are intended not to divide profits.
Currently, the responsibilities of the head of the VID are fulfilled by Deputy Director-General Dace Pelæk.

The Riga Free Office has implemented all the UK recommendations on the project of the Russian island.
The Riga Free Office has implemented all of the five recommendations of State Control (VK) regarding the development of the project Infrastructure for the transfer of port activities from the city centre to the Russian island, Dina.lv informed the company.
The project is scheduled to be approved at the next meeting of the Riga Free Trade Council.
In order to implement the recommendations in accordance with the opinion of the VK, when preparing the documentation necessary for the implementation of the recommendations, the Riga Free Office also followed the conclusions of the legal and operational audit conducted by the International Auditor Deloitte Riga Free Office and the recommendations made to improve project management during the next phase of the project.
Information on the implementation of the recommendations has also been sent to the UK today.
Despite the fact that the Riga Free Office does not agree with the opinion prepared by the UK on the usefulness of the Russian island project, we are very responsible for the implementation and financing of the project - the European Commission (EC).
I would like to stress that all the works planned within the scope of the project have been completed in full within the prescribed time limits and in the planned amount.
"In order to prove to all those involved in the implementation of the project, including the EC, the UK and the Staviders that the main objective of the free country is to successfully implement the project, we have put in full implementation of all the recommendations of the UK on project management and monitoring issues," says the head of the project of the Russian island, Sanita Kaire.
The long-term action plan for monitoring and monitoring the project's objective was complemented by the most important planned actions of the parties involved and the time-limits for the necessary decisions, the definitions of meetings and regular reports and their deadlines, the tools for monitoring the planned construction process, and the most important definitions of the border points.
The approved action plan for achieving the project target by 31 December 2018, in line with the recommendations of the UK, was supplemented by the implementation monitoring activities, thereby strengthening the control of the time-limits for the activities of other parties involved in the implementation of the project on the part of the Riga Free Trade Centre.
A project management plan has been redesigned to improve project management and reduce potential risks by defining project management areas and specifying the documents drawn up that provide a control and monitoring mechanism for each of them.
To increase the project capacity, a project management framework has been developed which reflects the structure of the planned project management team, the qualifications and functions of staff.
In order to improve the communication of Riga Volunteers with the parties involved in the project, a communication plan has been developed by stakeholders, which, in addition to the parties identified in the project action plan, defines the stakeholders, the principles, types and periodicity of the project for successful completion of the project.
In order to improve the control of the use of funds, further details will need to be given to the need for the conclusion of a service contract or the start of a procurement contract, and the rule of law.
Within the framework of the project, the Russian island has built port infrastructure according to world standards – four new deep-water stations, railways and engineering communications.
Co-financed buildings of the Cohesion Fund are completed and transferred to operation at the end of the year already spent, with a savings of EUR 10.6 million.

Slovakia is the EU Presidency by January.
German researchers are discussing the number of victims of the Berlin Wall.
According to a new study, the number of people who lost their lives in the Communists ’ former eastern border could be much higher than previously thought, but doubts about the number of real victims have not yet been raised.
According to data provided by the Berlin Wall Museum Checkpoint Charlie, between 1945 and 1989, at the border with the Western public areas and later by the Western Communist authorities, 1841 people who tried to get out of their controlled territory have been hiding.
The museum has been investigating cases of border deaths for years and corrects the number of victims at any time.
This year, 11 more deaths have been added to the list, including among the victims including a six-year-old boy who died trying to reach the family through the then Czechoslovakia and Hungary.
Among the new victims of the Berlin Wall are also Soviet army deserters.
"The total amount of damage caused by the double-defence of communism and socialism has not yet been fully documented," admits museum director Alexander Hildebrande.
"Our task is to ensure that the bodies of those who have lost their lives trying to escape from the Communist-controlled state will be spared and lost," said Hildebrandt.
Other researchers, however, have already questioned the new figures.
In an interview with Süddeutsche Zeitung, Süddeutsche Zeitung, expert in Eastern History at the Berlin Free University, Johannes Statts, said.
He and other researchers at the Berlin Free University are currently reviewing possible suspected deaths at the border, and so far they have been able to confirm only 260 cases.
In the past, researchers estimate that only 138 people have been blinded by the Berlin Wall.
In view of those who have lost their lives, attempting to escape the Baltic Sea or enter the West through neighboring territory, the number of victims could be estimated to be about a thousand, according to the State.
However, the same is significantly less than 1841.
One of the reasons for the different number of victims could be different methodologies.
Checkpoint Charlie Museum also records all cases of suicide of Eastern border guards regardless of whether they were directly related to their service.
The museum also records death cases that are not related to direct violence.
"If seniors between 70 and 80 years of age have to deal with the border control mia from the heart strike, it must be considered as the consequences of this "treasure border", Hildebrande.
However, the State is convinced that it is necessary to make a distinction between the elderly people who may have died as a result of their experiences and those whose death has resulted in a long wait on the hot bus at the border.
Regardless of its victims' record, it is not easy because the Communist authorities of the Eastern East did not collect such statistics, and researchers have to select documents in various burned archives, the State states.
However, the State Group has recently produced new documents and could therefore come up with new estimates of victims in the near future.
LPF President Pone went to Rio with coach accreditation, which is a surprise.
President Kaspars Pone Riodezaneiro came to the Olympic Games with coach accreditation, but he felt surprised at it.
On Wednesday, a wide variety of adventures followed the words of the Olympic swimmer Alón Ribakov's coach, German Jakubovska, who discovered that at the last moment in Rio de Janeiro, the coach decided to go to Pona while staying at home.
The list of drivers originally approved the swimmers Alón Ribakova and Uvis Kalniņš, coach Jakubovskis and Devis Kolins, as well as the Federation President Pone.
The Latvian Swimming Federation applied five participants to the Olympics, and before leaving Aldon Vrublüvskis claimed that Germany would be and that he was being searched for tickets.
"However, apparently for objective reasons he was not," said Mr. President, expressing the view that this did not affect the outcome of Ribakov.
At the request of the federation, the Uvja coach agreed to help her.
Mr, who is a member of the LOC Executive Committee, I would like to criticise the operation of LOC by shifting blame for the Olympic Sports Supervisory Organisation.
In my view, it is not ethical for the LOC Executive Committee to approve five persons and not take any of them.
"I don't know why there was no place for the Feding Federation," said Mr. Pone that the work of the federations and their presidents was not evaluated in society, reminding us that the presidents of the Feds do not receive wages.
Pone also criticized Jakubovski himself, saying that before the London Olympics, when Ribakova was not approved among the participants, he complained about the International Water Sports Federation (FINA) and invited Latvia not to send any athletes.
However, he could not tell why he had to come to Jakobovski with coach accreditation in Olympic games.
"I was applied as the president of the federation ("team leader"), but for some unknown reason, I would have received coach accreditation and now I wouldn't be in there."
The situation changed every day, the number of accreditations available changed.
For the last minute, I thought that the German would be because I had no other information.
After the information available to the agency LETA, a few days before Ribakova started, she had had an eye-to-eye conversation with Poni and after her swimmer had had tears in her eyes, but the president of the LPF himself said that it had been a daily conversation with the desire to find a sportsman before the start.
Pone recalled that LPF is monitoring five sports types in the Olympic programme, and four of them are also training children in Latvia.
The president of the federation said that it is also very important in Latvia that he has spoken about such programmes for almost two weeks.
He celebrated the Federation's work and said that the World Cup could be held in Latvia in 2018.
Located in Riodeganeiro is not my vacation, here I work, spend my time and try to implement the four-year programmes.
In many cases, 600,000 small salmon will be introduced.
During this week's programme for the renewal of the Latvenergo fish resources in Daugavá, in Mangalsala, there is the introduction of salmon and taumes, and this year more than 600,000 single-year salmon and taumes are planned to be introduced by the scientific institute Bior Tomes and Doles in the fisheries sector.
LETA informed the Latvian agency that the introduction of fish will continue in the months to come - a total of 6,300 000 species of fish and shells will be introduced each year at the Daugavas basin.
In the spring of 2016 and early summer, there will be guided and snowflakes, in June - sigha, July - one summer salmon, in August and September - sandwiches and vimbas.
The director of Latvenergo's production, Māris Kunickis, said that the environmental concerns are one of the cornerstones of the sustainable development of the Latvenergo Group.
"In the measures for the protection and reproduction of fish resources, any action is aimed at environmentally friendly actions in close cooperation with the scientific institute Bior, both in the production and introduction of fish petals in the Daugavas basin and in the pursuit of other activities," Kunickis said.
This year, more than 600,000 single-year-old salmon and tima will be introduced into the game.
For the past two years, small fish are marked by the cutting of fat.
Today, the cargo contains 25,000 small salmon with an average weight of 31.3 grams.
Each year, the introduction of small fish and shellfish in Daugava and its swimming pools takes place in scientificly based species.
The increase of fish resources in Daugav and its basin waters under the regulatory acts shall be carried out by the Bior on the basis of the expert knowledge of the loss caused by the economic activity of Latvenergo and the conclusion of the compensation measures to ensure the diversity of fish resources.
On the other hand, the State Environment Service shall, on the basis of that expert, decide on the amount and type of compensation.
The annual amount of compensation for Latvenergo in the fish resources recovery programme is EUR 1,035 000.
In the spring of 2016 Latvenergo, in collaboration with the company "We Fish" in the fifth year, 400 artificial fish nils are located in Daugavās near Kaibala and Ikšķiles.
Cooperation with the company, in promoting the natural nerd of fish, is also supported by Latvenergo in the context of an initiative to revitalise fish resources.
The placement of artificial nests in the reservoir is an important measure that contributes to the protection and reproduction of fish resources in Daugav.
The festival "Sansusi Concerts" is a farm, a forest, a circus.
Gully in the tent, eat as a restaurant, walk in chains, and listen to researched chamber music, enjoying quiet natural peace, - such a combination offers an alternative chamber music festival in Sansus, which already invites the third summer to the Aknyeste novado.
The festival will take place in Susjas - no longer an existing village - in the former palace, next to forests and circuses.
In three days - from 12 to 14 August - five views can combine the joys of carefree nature and academic music.
Here is a music theatre and contemporary circus, performance and installation.
Opera and academic music, especially in its latest manifestations, finds new listeners in a free and open environment without concerts.
The distance from here to Riga is about 150 km, but to the smile on the face and the ease of the foot just a few minutes.
"Please do not look for the program, because we have deliberately chosen not to publish it before, so that people do not go to one particular event or artist, because the real taste in Sansus can only be absorbed by spending all three days in it," invites the festival initiator and owner, operabariton Armands Silihn.
The festival's doors are open on Friday at 5 p.m., and the first concert is at 7 p.m.
Of course, there will be programmes on the spot with all the information.
For those who have to choose one day, we recommend Saturday, because it is the most polluted - from 9 a.m. to the next morning.
"The names of artists are available on the website www.sansusi.lv", says Armands Silinh.
There is, for example, Vijolnie Eva Bindere, Kellolis Kristíne Blaumane, opera star Inga Kalna, clarinetist Guntis Kuzma, trumpeter Janis Porietis, pianist Reinis Zariņs, quartet Quartets Quadra and RIX and even Estonian air acrobat Grete Gross, who together with Latvian musicians Éric Kiršfeld, Martin Zilbert and actress Anci Strazdu has created a contemporary circus exhibition of Defines for the artist's internal struggle.
Specially, the festival has also become a new work.
In the exhibition for children "Kukuinis", which was composed after F. Kafka's révalence motifs by Olija Kozlovska and Jäkabs Nimanis, as well as with Armandus Siliņus, musicians and actors will participate entomologist (skin researcher) Ugis Peteran.
Oscar Herliņš celebrated the first Stig Quartet, while Anna Chirse - Wood opera, performance, whose main heroes in Andra Kalnozola mode with Katrina Neiburg's video projections and Andra Egliš's script will be in three small puduaries in the wide square of three hectares.
Singing in the voices of Laimas Ice, Dināras Rudanes and Zigmāra Graš, they will come into romantic relations, just as the natural scientist Karlė Linnja in the light-year study of the tree's wedding (1729).
Riodeganeiro Olympics today begins one of the greatest hopes of the Latvian delegation, sportsman Laura Ikauniece-Admidini.
Ikauniece-Admidinas at 15.35 a.m. after Latvia's time will start the game in a 100-metre barberskreijen, but at 16.50 a.m. waiting for the match to be played.

The seven-thing competition will be concluded on Saturday, when the distance, cutting and 800 meters of running will take place.
Prior to the Olympics, Ikauniece-Admidinas, who had previously won the Bronze World Championship, was referred to as an Olympic medalist.
In May, Latvia set up a new national record (points 6622) and promoted second place in the prestigious 7th race in the city of Gecis, Austria.
Ikauniece-Admidina also participated in the 2012 London Olympics, when with a repeated Latvian record she won the ninth place.
During the last half of the year, a sportsman has improved his national record four times.
Today at 16 p.m., the start is also scheduled for Latvia's jury to fight Arthur Nikiforenko, who starts in the weight category over 100 kilograms, in the first place with Azerbaijani sportsman Ushangi Kukauri.
Judith will be the first Olympic game in his career.
The LETA agency has already reported that, in the category of weight up to 100 kilograms of loss in its first battle, the Latvian junta was already suffering from a stroke by Jevgenijs Borodakko.
He joined the Japanese Hagu Rjunoski, who later won the bronze.
In the year 2000, Vsevolod Zełonijs brought the honour of the Olympic Bronze to Latvia, but in the next four Olympic games, Latvian warriors won only one victory together in seven fights, which was made in London directly by Borodak.
At 16.30 p.m. after the qualification stage of Latvia's competition, Danis Uppelnieks will start shooting, but the election will end on Saturday.
The winner of the Olympic road sign was only received on the day that the Latvian delegation was officially notified, but later he revealed to the agency that it had been quite safe to drive since April.
A sportsman instead of the Olympics came as one of Latvia's first athletes, trying to make maximum use of training opportunities in the shooting.
At 19.05 after the final three trips of Latvia time, the 17-year-old Olympic player will be the Latvian mayor, Ketia Birzule, who competes in the race for hunters in the RS:X class.

On Tuesday, on the fourth day of the final journey, she scored the fourth, from the third position that would allow her to continue fighting for the medal, leaving her for no more than 0.65 seconds.
The 13th place was fought four years ago in London, where he also represented Ireland.
Today, 24 medal sets will be distributed in Olympics - bows, light-lights, three-wheeled, necessary, riding, tramplining, jogging, academic flying, shooting, swimming, tennis and riding.
Reid claims that if Clinton is elected president, he will appoint Garland as Judge of the Supreme Court .
The leader of the Senate Democratic Party, Harry Reids, is convinced that if she becomes president, she will appoint Mariku Garland as the Supreme Court ' s chief judge.
The party of the Senate Republicans has blocked Garland's approval since March when President Obama appointed it.
Most of the Senate's leaders, Michis Maconnels, said that the next president would choose to replace the current Supreme Court judge, Antonin Skalius.
On Thursday during his conference, Reid announced that Clinton would choose Garland.
The representative of Reida later stated that he had not personally discussed this subject with Clinton and that it is only speculation.
He celebrated Garland and said that Clinton's team wouldn't want to "suck the boat" with another choice.
Garland is the chief judge of the Appellate Court in the U.S. District of Colombia.
Reid said that the Republicans blocking the Garland nomination are "integrators" and act in the interests of the President of the Republican Party candidate Donald Trampa.
He also said that Tramps was not suitable for the President's work.

Women would like to participate in this project because it is a great art work.
Models can be posted by electronic or personal boxing sessions in Los Angeles and New York.

Greenland shark is the most resident backboner - video review

The French court rejects the claim to destroy the shops in the "Jungles" refugee camp.
The French court rejected the claim of the institutions to destroy dozens of self-developed shops and restaurants in the "Jungles" camp, where several thousand refugees live.
At this court meeting in Kale this week, the authorities indicated that the State should destroy 72 self-developed shops where people in the camp market various goods such as cigarettes and energy drinks, offer hairdresser services, tea for 50 cents (40p) and simple meals for some euro self-developed restaurants.
In Kale, the Bureau of the Prefect indicated that these self-developed companies had to be destroyed because they constituted the shadow economy and did not pay taxes, as well as create fire and sanitation risks.
The representatives of the humanitarian group explained to the court that these small companies are important because the food provided by government and support groups does not provide for the needs of the camp where the number of residents continues to increase.
They also pointed out that self-developed shops and restaurants often offer free supplies and food to those who need it most.
The Court of Justice held that there was no legal basis for dismissing the people who had created 72 self-made shops, but that it understood the concerns of the Prefect.
Judge Jean-Français Molla said that food, coffee and restaurants play a greater role than simply providing food to people living in "extremely uncooked conditions".
He pointed out that these places are peaceful meeting places for refugees and volunteers.
One of the places exposed to the risk of extinction is the Jungle Book Kids, which provides more than 200 free meals a day, English and French, and provides advice on asylum issues to hundreds of unprotected minors without adult assistance.
More than 170 000 people have signed a petition for the protection of children’s cafes.

The impressive performance of the UK election at the 7th stage of the series ended on Thursday, when the state unit of Rio Fiji, at the exciting finals of Deodoro Stadium, convinced that they had been buried with the result 43:7.
Fiji demonstrated masterclasses in the management of the bomb, the bombs play with the leg, support in the game and brutal force in the game, honoring the gold - the first Olympic medal in its history.
The silver medal, which was then the third medal in Great Britain, was awarded a prize for peace. Britain's election can be proud of its achievements in the first Olympic Regbi-7 tournament in which they won New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
A heavy half-final in which the Boks team is stuck with the result on the first half of the day, possibly played for Britain at the end.
But in any case Fiji's choice is now in its best form to also win the 15 men's team.
Although it is unlikely, however, a known peace for Britain could be the fact that at least one British has won a gold medal. This is Fiji's main coach Ben Rays - former English coach from Vimbledon.
Britain had an exciting experience.
Eight years ago, under Rayna's leadership, they lost all the games in regbie-7 series in Adelaide.
This time they lost only one game.
Swelling is painful, but growth is amazing.
Fiji had a great start with the pursuit of the British forces in pursuit of joy.
It was like a meeting with several buses and the World Series champions at 5:0 when Osea Kolinisaw won the first landing.
In the last four minutes, Jerry Tuwai also increased his weight by making a landing in the right wing.
Result 12:0 and the British team had not even really hit the bomb.
Michele's great strength did not allow the typical Leoni Nakaravam to get three points, but it only slightly affected Fiji's results.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua gained a landing in the right corner, strengthening the superiority over Britain until 17:0.
After the overpowering, Nakarava even increased its weight and had remained more than a minute... at the end of the first half-time.
Vatemo Ravovou was avoided by some inefficient British forces and crossed the line by gaining points.
The landing provided the result 29:0.
It seems that Fiji is born to play regbie-7 in cats while the British are just learning.
Actually, that's true too.
The British team made a fundamental change in half-time, reviewing Fiji's line of players... full of four minutes, which was good at first half-time standards, until Joshua Tuisova, after a fantastic team match, won a few more points for Fiji's team.
Denam Norton managed to get points for the British team by taking the landing on the left corner and getting the result 36:7, but the game was already lost, while the South Sea Salinarian fans sang, approached the flags and danced in the courts.
Fiji’s life - giving attitude cannot be surprised.
Mata William made Fiji’s victory even more sweet with another landing at the end of the game.
At the end of the game, Fiji could start celebrating, but the British could only sit in the hall after the slaughter.
On the first half of the day, semi-final Fiji won Japan with a score of 20:5, while the British were too far from South Africa, where in a very intense struggle both teams were on the ground and South Africans lost only a few points.
In the first half of the year, Kyle Brown was leading the Boks team, but in the second half, Den Norton, with a brilliant skill, crossed the line and delivered a bomb between the poles, providing British victory.
Markus Vatsona, who is an English team player Antonia's brother, provided the team with a win and another silver medal at the end of the game.
Trainer's fight with cancer inspired Helen Gloves and Heteri Staning in the flying competition.
It will be the most emotional gold medal in these contests and it already says a lot.
From the first to the last, Helen Gloves and Hetres Stanings had a special role in the train of Estacio da Lagoa.
Although there are only two sportsmen on board, she was accompanied by Robin Williams' support, which inspired her to the second Olympic gold medal in the women's airing, becoming the first women in the history of British sports, who have gained such success.
They certainly dominated them, for on the 39th time, they won an unprecedented victory.
The two great athletes with the bed elegance to slide across the water surface do not fully reflect this triumph.
Behind each gold medal, there is a whole team that works hard to keep athletes constantly improving their performance and making a greater contribution to their success by a coach who didn't know or experience this day 30 months ago because he was diagnosed with cancer.
According to him, it disappeared as quickly as it appeared.
I had urinary cancer, which is one of those that can operate, and so did it.
If I didn't, it would spread all over the body.
And the situation would become uncontrollable.
It's a bit of a change in your vision.
Vilimas cancer was discovered in December 2013.
The three concluded that Williams could start the recovery procedure at the beginning of the 2014 interim season and reduce the duration of the interruption to a minimum if that could be said.
I needed income, so I had to recover quickly.
It stimulated recovery.
I was in the hospital and I got 6, 10 and even 15 meters long, even though the doctor said that I would fit in with some steps.
It all started.
Airing itself is a challenge, but this time it was even bigger.
After the victory, the first thought was about Williams, who was very concerned and attracted more than usual.
Staninga, who served at the Royal Artillery Unit in Afghanistan, said, "This was an emotional week, but it means a lot to me."
It just confirms how much it means to us and how much I, Helen and Robin have worked.
The three years spent with Helen and Robin have been great.
Without Robin, we would have achieved nothing, so thank him so much, he's the best coach in the world.
I can't imagine a better coacher or a better coach.
Helen Glovere and Hetre Staning have not been lost in any competitions over the past five years.
The pair reaches such a huge speed that a competitor cannot compete with.
Even the last 500 metres, when teams from New Zealand and Denmark began approaching, Staning and Gloves were too large.
We felt every moment.
He said, "Keep the rhythm, keep the rhythm."
It is really important not to lose concentration.
We had a good start, but at the same time we did not have much hope.
On that day, we did not intend to cast our records, but simply to fly and win the contests, and we did so too.
A few years will rest to decide what to do next.
The next month will be the marriage of the Seeker of the Gloves and TV adventures of Steve Bashal.
In the meantime, she simply wants to enjoy a moment.
I didn't mean to say that these were my last matches.
It would have been too much pressure.
In London, I needed about six months to understand that I was an Olympic champion.
It was a new experience and I was very concerned.
This time it took about four minutes.
She said, "The feeling is fantastic."

Collegiate VID's office will "go to the last".
According to him, now Prime Minister Mārim Kučinskim (Green and Agricultural Union) and Minister of Finance Dani Reizniecei-Ozolai (Green and Agricultural Union) are already "primarily important" in order to allow the candidates headed by the Finance Minister to be approved by the VID as Head of Finance.
Rajevskis estimates that both Kučinskim and Reizniecei-Ozolai in this government are "the first major decision", which may affect him as a political future.
If a change is now taking place in the choice of a candidate for the VID driver's office, it will have a negative impact on the management of their immutations.
The next week's agenda of the Cabinet of Ministers has included the question of the transfer of the Head of the VVD to the office of Director-General of the VID, the government's agenda.
Mr Reizniece-Ozola, Minister of Finance of the Collegiate VID, moved to the office of Head of the Collegiate VID after his resignation from the office of Ināra Peterson and when the competition to the VID Director-General ended without a result.
On Thursday, 11 August, during an interview with the head of the VID, Dace Pelék, the head of the team allowed the Latvian Radio - if she offered to run for the manager's office, she could agree.
The Minister of Finance also later acknowledged that there are no other candidates for the VID leader's office in the meantime.
The Head of the Saeima Group of the National Association, Raivis Dzintars, also acknowledged that NA is still supporting the Kolīgov VID.
In Spain, the possibility of reducing the budget deficit poses a threat to the inability to create a government.
On 12 July the European Commission (EC) presented an opinion that Spain and Portugal had not implemented sufficient measures to reduce the budget deficit to 3% of the gross domestic product (GDP) required by the euro area.
The calculations show that the Portuguese budget deficit, despite the savings measures, was 4.4% of GDP at the end of last year, and in Spain, 5.1%.
However, the European Commission has decided not to apply economic sanctions to both countries at the same time as setting fiscal targets for the next period.
One of the reasons why the EC did not impose sanctions on the two countries is the growing eurocepticism in many countries of the European Union.
Additional sanctions would only increase such negative conditions.
The critics point out that the EC has not consistently agreed on common rules in its decisions and then failed to apply them in life.
For example, Germany's President Jens Veidmanns pointed out that Europe thus loses confidence in itself, making it appear to the citizens that the rules of the European Union are advisable, not binding.
The EC has now proposed and all Member States have approved the extension of the deadline for the budget deficit to Portugal by the end of this year and to Spain by 2018.
The European Commission calls on the two countries to examine the progress made in the coming months, while pointing out that both Spain and Portugal must be prepared to introduce further measures of savings if conditions so require.
The initial forecasts show that Portugal's target could be achieved at a given time and that this year the budget deficit could be reduced to 2.5% of the total domestic product.
This means that, within the framework of the Stability Programme, the government of this country is to implement savings measures of 0.25% of GDP this year.
These measures should be included in the budget for this year, with a further focus on controlling the costs of purchases of goods and services.
In the case of Spain, the situation is much more complicated.
This year's budget deficit should be reduced to 4.6%, next year to 3.1% and 2018 to 2.2% of GDP.
In addition, in the next two years, consolidation measures must be 0.5% of GDP annually.
It is particularly difficult to achieve these objectives that for eight months the Spanish political parties have failed to agree on the establishment of a government, and it is becoming increasingly possible for Spain to hold the election of the early parliament in the third year.
However, public opinion polls show that the third-election political scene in the country would not change significantly.
The most popular party is still the current Prime Minister, Mariano Raho, of the nation's leading party, whose will is to regain a 33% vote.
Its popularity has increased slightly only to the socialist, until the popularity of the Podemos or "Couple we can" and "Ciudadanos" or "Pilsonis" has decreased slightly against the saving measures.
The People's Party wants to get socialist and "Ciudadans" involved in the government this month, otherwise it will not succeed until mid-October to adopt and submit to the European Commission for approval of the 2017 budget.
As the representative of the People's Party's Parliamentary Group, Rafael Hernando, announced, if the government is not successful and Parliament's election will be held for the third time, Spain will become all European fun.
The purity of the rivers in the Riga Sea is critical.
In a five-year survey of beaches, activists have found that, unfortunately, the number of found waste is increasing each year, and this is the fault of most visitors to the resorts.
The most polluted swimming resorts are directly in Riga.
In the mind of the capital city, it is clear that bathing places are being slaughtered every day, but fighting against unclean visitors is quite difficult.
In addition, waste left on land during rainfalls can be disposed of in water, thus significantly improving its quality.
With the exception of Liepaja beaches and separate locations in Kurzeme, the purity of beaches elsewhere in Latvia is critical.
This week, the volunteers of the campaign "My Sea" have distributed this message.
For the first five years of walking along the Riga Sea, activists have concluded that the number of waste left by the population has increased by one hundred metres.
Unfortunately, this year this critical assessment has come to an end.
"We see that this year will be a year when the number of wastes on the beach 100 meters, possibly even more than 200 units," says the representative of the expedition "My Sea" Jānis Ulme.
The Latvian Radio was called, he was located on the Tuya beach, where he continued his voluntary journey along the Riga Sea.
This year, between various domestic wastes and picnics, activists came to collect even the daily fires left in the sand of the sea.
The travel participant and organizer Ulme said that the population is responsible for the pollution.
"The main source is the beach visitors themselves, because more than half of the total number of waste is plastic, various waste, starting with bags, plastic pieces that are already in the decommissioning phase, they are no longer possible to identify, and for smokers, bottles, corks," says Ulme.
Among the purest beaches are also swimming grounds in Riga.
For example, in Daugavgriv every 100 meters, almost 800 units of waste have been collected on average, which is critically large.
The campaign organizers also explain that every step has been taken by smoking and not by all the signs of a warning or ban.
"The vast figures for all three Riga swimming pools - Daugavgriju, Vakburļi and Vecáči - are unfortunately meeting a great and far above the desired target, to which it is moving as Latvia moves, to reduce the number of waste units to 135 units by 2020", the environmental defence concludes.
The cleaning of the swimming grounds in Riga every day, during the hottest days of the summer, even twice, explains the representative of the mind, Ugis Vidauskis.
However, fighting with unclean visitors is quite difficult.
We return to the cultural issue of these people.
"For those who drink, drink, smoke, and do all the things that must not, even the special signs do not work," says Vidauskis.
Vidauskis therefore invites visitors to report to the police as well.
You can call the police, safely point to these violations and in this way fight everyone.
Perhaps new warnings can be put in place, but as I said, there is a lot or something that will radically change the situation.
"As all should simply turn together and be disobedient to such offenders," he stressed.
In the meantime, water quality measurements have already been carried out on the fourth time this summer, which may set a ban on official swimming grounds.
This year, as in other years, water quality has been good and satisfying everywhere.
The situation is that in all 56 bathing areas, water quality has always been good and there is no restriction on swimming.
"For the last time we will take an analysis at the end of August," says the senior environmental specialist Norman Cadicius.
During severe rainstorms, waste left on the ground may be disposed of in water.
This may, in turn, affect its quality, the environmental expert points out.
The rotations in the Russian elite will continue - the change of the manager in Putina administration.
You're going to lose your mind?
Vladimir Putin announced to the Russian media that Sergei Ivanov will leave this post on his own and will continue to be the President's special representative in the field of natural protection, environmental and transport.
In notifying about the changes, Putin's television camera quoted Ivanov as saying: "The dear Sergei Borisovic, we have been working together for many years and we have been doing it successfully."
I am satisfied with how you fulfill your duties.
I am well aware of our agreement without using you for more than four years as the head of this President's administration.
That is why I will act with understanding against your desire to change the field of activity.
And I hope that in the new job you will also make full use of your knowledge and experience.
However, management of the President's administration is a very important task and has made Ivanov one of the most influential people in the country.
Given that the election of the State Council is expected in Russia next month, it has become apparent that this step is linked to the fight for power in the political elite of Russia.
Ivanov was also referred to as the potential Vice-President of Putina, which is why the claim that he himself wanted to take over the role of the President's representative in the field of natural protection and transport has raised doubts.
As the Lsm.lv archive shows, Ivanov is the head of the VDK and the Federal Security Service.
Ivanov has been a sensible and close associate of Russian President Vladimir Putina.
In 1975, he began his career as a missionary, where he met Putin.
Later, Putin became the head of the Federal Security Service, and Ivanov became his deputy.
On the other hand, the first Russian President Boris Jelcina was appointed Secretary of the Russian Security Council at the end of his reign.
In 2000, after Putina came to power, Ivanova's "Information Security Doctrine" was approved, which included the recovery of state censorship mechanisms in Russia.
In 2001, Sergei Ivanov became Russian Defence Minister, but in 2005 he was Deputy Prime Minister Mihaila Fradkov and was responsible for the development and export of Russian defence companies.
Now, following the resignation of the President's Head of Administration, Ivanov will also be held in the Russian National Security Council, where the new President's Chief of Administration will also be working.
Vaino comes from family councils in the elite party.
Ivanov himself has been recommended by the Head of Administration of the President's Office.
Anton Edwardovic and I have known each other a long time ago.
From the time we were in your leadership, we worked in the government.
And in the last almost five years, we've met practically every day.
"That is why I am convinced that, according to all the professional and personal characteristics, he is ready for this work," Ivanov said.
Vaino comes from a family belonging to the elite of the council party.
His grandfather, Karl, received high office in the Communist Party of Estonia, including his first secretary until 1988.
The Internet edition "Meduza" with reference to the book "Iguana self-determination and independence" says that at the end of the 1980s Karls Vaino was asked to allow Moscow to use force against demonstrators.
However, he was rejected and soon lost his job.
Soon thereafter, Vaino has moved to Moscow.
Antons Vaino has graduated from the Moscow International Relations Institute and manages the Japanese language.
However, he has left the diplomatic service to work in the management of the President's protocol.
It has already been reported that in recent decades Russia has been devastated by the resignation of several high-ranking officials and even arrests, including the replacement of several district governors and federal representatives.
As politicians say, President Vladimir Putins re-elects the ruling elite before the 2018 elections.
One of the main features is that representatives of the governing bodies are increasingly involved in leading positions.
Nikiforenko is also hunted to death in the first battle of the Olympics.
This was the first round of the fight, and Latvia's jealousy for its participation in the Olympics has ended in 17th place.
Coach Olīg Baskin admitted to Latvia's TV that Nikiforenko's hope was very little, and it was already clear before the competitions.
He also discovered that he had suffered a stroke in the battle.
Significantly, to get to the Olympic road sign, Nikiforenko had to start in a weight category other than a weight category - i.e. in a weight category up to 100 kilograms.
Azerbaijani fever was more than 20 pounds [25 kg] in weight.
It has already been reported that Jevgenijs Borodakko, in the weight category up to 100 kilograms against Rjunosuki, was held for two minutes until the enemy won a year of pure victory.
Therefore, the Latvian jury competition has ended in Rio.
The frogs disappear in the sand of Rio.
The killer Jevgenijs Borodako was given on Thursday.
Yes, he had a more titled opponent, but ambition can sometimes bring a surprise.
He wasn't working.
Arthur Nikiforenko's task was even more complicated, as the experience is less experienced and the opponent is also respectful.
The result is similar, though on the tatami he stayed half a minute longer than Borodako.
Unfortunately, in recent times, Latvian hunters have just lacked ambition.
Since the Federation's leadership, Gunnars Kårs and his financial staff, Vladimir Šestakovs, took off from Latvia Aleksandr Jackevich, no longer "Golden Score", - the jujudo development moves down the slope.
Jackevich, who's here consulting Kazakhstan's hunters, and Vsevoldam Zeljona doesn't see the property.
But if he doesn't grow up, he won't.
And it's the Federation's prerogative.
Therefore, as from the other galactics in the "Tomorrow Panorama", Latvian Federation President Rio promised to beat the medals.
Flight away from reality.
In the evening, we waited for the beach volleyball cat Samilovs/Smědīņs - Evandra/Pedra Solbergs.
Intriga as already in the "death" group - the losers the games are over.
Latvia's duet was a slight derogation - it could also be lost, but not more than four points in two sets.
The tension was still growing in the delay of the previous game.
No one wanted to die - this feeling above the wind of the card all over the sword.
The twin wind caused additional difficulties for the players.
At first it seemed that it might be our - which is the most complete - society.
But it didn't.
Against the Latvian duet to play here was quite simple.
He's so fond of Samilolu and he's waiting for him to blow.
Against Canada, against Cuba at the end of the first set, and at the beginning of the third, because the load was not in vain.
At the time, he was able to fishing because the work was small, but when he was there, he did so in honor of it.
The Brazilian Samilovs and Semedin could win in two sets, because the first took over at 16:15, but also on 16 left the limit of the lost point.
But it could also be lost with 0:2, because in the second set the deficit was -4, however, thanks also to the wind, it was able to win.
The third has already been sealed by the Gospel servant.
A chain formed - unmistakably taken by a servant, the second attack often flies too close to the network and Samilova remained a very small option for a successful attack.
If there was a foreign Samoil in the Cuban countryside, he would be more successful this time, and only on Saša would be unprofessional.
Kreil also made a mistake, and quite symbolically, that the last bomb block hit him directly.
We're losing a team.
There was no success this time - in the third set only two Evandra attacks almost flew out of the card, but the bomb cut the line.
Two wheels were next to the line.
The controversial episode also featured a video about good opponents.
If in the first two games, Evandra was trained with servants, then they were very productive against us.
All of them were lost on the table.
The causes of failure must now be analysed in a peaceful manner.
Perhaps it was like many living near the stadium, not with the delegation in the Olympic village.
It's been two hours.
Perhaps a little self-confidence led to a series of seven semi-finals.
Maybe Klagenfurt should not have played, but rather get up here and better acclimatize.
Perhaps there was a mistake in finding the surface of a sports form.
Let's wait for the question more than I answered.
Our battle games are over.
The dream about the medals is over.
What's next?
There are still some World Cup tournaments and also Jūrmala Masters.
The meeting with Samuel had never been a friend or a friend, as there are too many personalities.
But it's not necessary either.
When the dream of the Olympic medals is broken, it can also be thought of divorce, as the guilt will be sought not only for itself but also for the partner.
It is not difficult to decide, but much more difficult in Latvia will be to find a decent partner.
Both brothers are playing soccer, but John and Tom have already tried and distributed, while Michael Samilovs is still too green to start picking up the world’s tops.
You can try Harald Regž, Alexander Solovej, Edgar Toču, to return to Martin Pjjvinj, but it won't be better than this option, which did not only prove itself at the World Cup.
Copacabana’s sand did not cheer them up this time.
A live one.
Of course, it is also important to take into account that the beach volleyball becomes more popular, a new pair enters the course, and only the rare growth is less than two meters.
This is not yet a success, but it is an essential argument in the fight for victory.
We don't have much longer.
Both athletes and journalists have the opportunity to swim in the places offered by the players, as well as to choose their own.
The U.S. basketball team lives on a cruise ship, but the tennis team doesn't leave in the Olympic village.
Also part of the beach volleyballist has found a hotel in Kopacaba.
This time, there was a demand for highly exaggerated prices for journalists for all decent accommodation.
Therefore, the choice also fell on the rent of the apartment.
The risk is because sometimes they can be uncomfortable from the point of view of logistics.
This time the risk is justified.
Together with Vladimir Vladimirovici we rent apartments on the Kopabana and Ipanema border.
The beach is 200 metres away, half an hour away.
The area is quite safe because the favela patal, however, must not lose courage there.
Vladimir Vladimirovich is not what some think immediately, but the most professional sports journalist in Russian media Vladimir Ivanov.
P.S. It seems that another medal dream was blown out on Friday morning.
100 meters in the barberscrew and climbing Laura Ikauniece-Admidina's retreat from her personal records.
But there are still five disciplines.
After 10 years of interruption, "Pragy and Besa" scan in Liepaja.
In Latvia, the first study of opera "Pragius and Besa" was held in the Latvian National Opera in 1973.
Since then, the internationally recognised masterpiece has not been brought back.
That is why the organizers of the Cēsu Art Festival and Liepaja Art Forum decided in close cooperation to give listeners the opportunity to enjoy the shadow of George Göršvina.
"We are very pleased that after a ten-year break, when Liepaja was last able to enjoy the opera's invention, this excellent version of George Göršvina's "Porgy and Besa" opera is a pleasure to us in the new, newly opened concert hall "Greece"", says the concert hall of the "Greece" leader Baiba God.
Opera "Porgis and Besa" is a story of love, its insatiability, its passion, and its natural tragedies and simple daily joys.
It reflects African American vitality, music and rhythm.
This is exactly the lack of political justice in this opera, this exclusion of tolerance makes it so alive.
"And yes, this love story is extremely powerful, extremely beautiful and in some way really deep," says director Viesturs Kairis.
What I like most, - by listening to or playing this opera, there are always such stop points - famous melodies, famous motifs, but these transitions from one character to another, by lighting one character or another character, or choir, or orchestra.
"It's the most exciting, this building," the opera evaluates the music director and director Andris Poga of the concert studio "Pragy and Besa".
Opera visitors agree that this is a grandiose event.
They are delighted to hear this world’s famous Göršvina opera.
Blessed for feeling the world’s breath in Liepaja.
"Performance professional", the opera evaluates visitor Edgars Lams.
The concert studio was special in that the concert hall "The Great Gintars" played the orchestra for the first time in the orchestra and for the first time the opera concert was held.
The newly renovated buildings at the Museum of Art could be named on behalf of Jana Rozental.
Riga Vice-Chairman Andris Ameris Rozental said in the opening of the anniversary exhibition that the museum's own address could in the future not be Krišijān Valdemāra Street 10a, but Jana Rozental Square 1.
The museum director, Māra Láce, acknowledged that the re-registration of the address would create a rigid bureaucratic burden, but generally this idea is appreciated and therefore agreed to the proposal of the municipality.
The city of Riga has set up its main keystone to this idea in 1936 by creating the monument of Burcard Dhen to Janim Rosental, who is standing at the museum.
The then director of the museum, Wilhelm Purvits, was one of the initiators for the creation of this monument.
In this way, this further action could be quite logical.
I don't feel like it all the time, but Wilhelm Purvitis, where are we going to leave his name?!
"But if you, Mr. America, promised to advise," said Lace.
It is reported that the National Art Museum was officially opened this May after extensive reconstruction and modernization.
This weekend will finally start the reconstruction of the VEF Cultural Castle.
Approximately EUR 11 million was recovered by SIA "Velve".
It is planned to renovate several castles, including two viewers, as well as to adapt the building to people with movement disturbances.
The Riga Council has intended to attract a project of EUR six million from the European Union funds, but the Director of the Riga Council's Property Department, Olygs Burovs, recognises that there is still no full clarity on the project's resources in the meantime.
"Despite the political desire to start the reconstruction of the VEF Cultural Capital by involving the European Structural Funds, it is, for months we await a decision, a real action from the officials of the Ministry of Finance, whether or not its money will be allocated," Burovs says.
Last December, we were told that everything depends on Brussels.
Two weeks ago, the Ministry of Finance received a letter from the European Commission that you make your own decision that Brussels does not take a decision here.
Now we see that another round of discussion is being made again, so let's see what we can expect in the next few days.
"I want to say that Riga's mind no doubt guarantees that this process will be launched and completed in time," Burovs points out.
It has already been reported that more than a year before, in March 2015, the VEF Cultural Castle was collectively organizing a holiday concert before the immediate renovation of the building.
Although the year went by, the renovation of the building was still not started and worked collectively under inappropriate conditions.
The strategy of the Riga Property Department of the University of Culture has been divided into apparently independent reconstruction teams, where each will ensure the implementation of the different functions of the city.
The first is to increase the availability of the VEF Culture Castle and improve the area.
It aims to organize environments and engineering communications and to restore the facades of the building.
Second - Improving the offer of the cultural city services.
It plans to improve the study of interiors, walls and ceiling restorations, views and sound records, as well as to arrange the interior engineering communication of the building.
Third - Improving the collective working conditions of creative amateurs, which includes plans to improve workshop equipment, space heating and ventilation systems.
Before "Livu" 40th anniversary, the legendary handcuffs can be found at the exhibition in Liepaja.
The exhibition will discuss various "Livus" features - photographs arranged in a time line to reflect the group's activities from the beginning to the year 2010 when the group's activities are announced.
Participants' audiences will also be shown, musical instruments, awards and concerts, as well as other things not yet seen to the public, which reflected the activities of the "Liví" group.
The exhibition will be complemented by the objects of the Liepaja Museum.
The exhibition's visual representation was made in collaboration with the fashion artist and painter Elitu Patmalnieci.
The musicians who had been associated with the "Liví" group and their neighbors also responded to the call and shared with both objects and memories.
The initials of "Livu" are sought in 1972, when a vocal instrumental assembly led by Juris Pavitols is set up in Liepaja's cultural house.
The assembly took part in its original composition in 1972 and 1974, as well as in the views of the city and the Republic.
In 1976, when Juris Pavitol met with Éric Chigeli and Metalurgi, a group was formed, inviting him to join Ingrid Gutmani, Andri Kruzini and Jani Grodum.
Over the years, the composition of the group has not been alone once.
The participants have joined, others have taken their way, some have returned.
However, the main thing - we want to make sure that Latvian hand music is able to live and exist - has remained unchanged.
"What not to see - ginsots, matatines and bardas, these boys felt different from the stereotype of the generally accepted creation," says music viewer Klas Vávere.
In the group without the above-mentioned musicians, such as Igo, Vilnius Krievņš, Modris Sterns, Valdis Starks, Lamis Racenės, Tális Pusbarnieks, Ainars Virga, Aivars Bríze, Guntars Mucenieks, Dainis Virga, Thomas Kleins and many others.
In the exhibition without charge.
The exhibition is held from 19 August to 30 October.
On the other hand, in the 27th of the Liepāga concert hall "Pūt, winds" will be held by the group "Livi" 40-year anniversary celebration "LIVIfest 2".
For the first time in 8 months, there is inflation in Bulgaria.
In July, Bulgarian national statistics showed 1% monthly inflation.
This is the highest rate since 2012 and the first rate above zero since October when it was positive (0.2%).
The average annual inflation after PCI in the last 12 months (August - July 2016) compared to the previous year was -0.8%.
The consumer price index in July 2016 compared to the previous year was 101.9% and the average monthly inflation was 1.0%.
Since the beginning of the year, inflation has been -0.2% (July 2016 compared to December 2015) and annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -0.2%.
Compared with the previous month, in July 2016 there was an increase in prices for the following consumer groups: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%); transport (1.8%); entertainment and cultural activities (6.3%); hotels and restaurants (1.2%); household goods and services (0.3%).
Prices were reduced for clothing and footwear (2.2%); household appliances, household appliances and regular household storage (0.5%); health (0.1%).
Prices remained at the previous month’s level for alcohol and tobacco, for management, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communications and education.
Zbignėv Stankevich: The time is coming, and the truth is on the way.
The archbishop of the Latvian Catholic Church, the metropolis of Zbigniev Stankevich, in his interview, emphasizes to the Independent that if we want to gain life, we must put the Gospel message in its centre.
For the power of truth is greater than that of evil.
Many are already on their way to the Most Holy Newest Mary’s reception feasts in Aglon.
What message will faithful ones receive this year?
In recent years, the desire to lead the main service in Aglon has been expressed by the pope’s minister.
Hence, the main message is also in his sense.
For its kind of tradition, it is also the fact that the cross leads the path of the shepherd John the Baptist.
He's gonna make his own message, too.
I was in the service of the Holy See on the last day.
Last year, I turned to the French encyclical "Laudato si" and updated the common house in it, the theme of the Earth in the context of Latvia.
This year... of course, I've been watching what's going on in the world, and I'm trying in my speech to respond to it.
My approach was to agree with the church’s recommendation that the Gospel message be put in the center of life.
It should be shown that the Gospel accounts for the most painful problems in man’s life and give him inspiration on the way forward.
Then it speaks to people.
But Cēsis, in the discussion of the Lamp, you said that "he will return to his understanding of the whole human being."
What do you understand?
Does this mean that a person is turning away from the message of the church?
And does the church today have such a return resource?
A man dying on the side of the road to the capital of India.
No one in the capital of India knows anything about a man dying on the road - it turns out he's been lying on the road for an hour and then he's gone, the BBC informs.
It has been reported that a man who was identified as Matthew went from day to day with a spear, but at night he worked as a guard.
Matthew 5:30 in the morning went home on the road when he was hit by a light car.
The surveillance camera records indicate that the driver left the car to look at the victim and then left.
After an hour when no one was left to know about the man who was bleeding, a mob surrounded him.
About 90 minutes after the incident, the police arrived and the victim was taken to a hospital where he died of the injuries.
In response to his candidacy at the post of Director-General of the National Revenue Service (VID), Professor Ojars Skudra, the head of the State Environment Service, is considered to be a member of the Social Sciences Faculty of the University of Latvia.
Collegiate's explanation of the withdrawal of the candidacy in the conflict-management coalition is linked to the fact that it has prevented the government from falling.
Skudra, in his discussion with the agency LETA, said that he found it difficult to imagine that he would be supporting the candidate for Collegiate next week at the government meeting on "Unity".
Therefore, if the ministers of the "Unity" voted against, but the Collegiates had so approved, it would lead to the government's resignation.
The expert also considers that both Finance Ministers Danu Reiznieci-Ozol and Prime Minister Māri Kučinski have been consulted before the nomination notice.
At the same time, it was also the accession of the "Unity", which strongly opposed her candidacy.
In predicting whether the invitation to tender will result in an appropriate candidate, Skudra acknowledged that there are two options - either a compromise figure will be chosen, or the institution will continue to run in the Dace Pelèé, as the director-general.
At the same time, he points out - if the finance minister has so far claimed that another candidacy is not being examined, it is home to Peläkay that he must not participate in the competition.
LETA has already announced that the Head of the State Environment Service has decided to withdraw his candidacy for the office of Director-General of the VID.
Because of the "unity" opposition, the government continued to approve Copenhagen on Tuesday per week as Director-General of the VID.
Following the decision of the government to postpone the decision, Kolígova confirmed that it is still ready to become a leader of the VID.
However, it was later changed - on Friday, in a presentation to the Finance Minister, Dan Reizniecei-Ozolai, she indicated that she withdrew her consent to transfer to the VID manager's office and this was not an easy choice for her.
President Māra Kučinska Press Secretary Andrejs Vaivars told the agency LETA that a new competition would be held at the office of the vacant Director-General of the VID.
An accident involving a police car took place in the centre of Riga.
A road accident involving a State police car took place in the centre of Riga this afternoon.
The police car with the sound and light signals on it will rush to the highest category of call, until Krišijān Baron and Dřernav have crossed the street with another car.
The police explain the circumstances, but the initial information shows that the second force has not been launched for a long time by the police car.
In an accident, a woman was arrested.
This year, the population of Riga collapses
At the beginning of this year, 638 784 people in Riga were 0,34% less than in 2015 when 641,000 people were officially registered in the capital, LETA informed the Central Statistics Administration (CSP).
On the other hand, the population of the capital of Latvia comes in 30 places between the capitals of the European Union (EU) and the major cities where the population exceeds one million.
According to data from the EU Statistical Office "Eurostat", Riga is the largest proportion of women - Latvia's capital is firmly first among the largest European cities with 127 women per 100 men.
In all three Baltic capitals, the largest proportion of women in Europe's largest cities is 123, while in Tallinn 121 women per 100 men.
Warning pictograms will be displayed at LNMM.
In the next few days at the Latvian National Art Museum (LNMM) there will be warning signs - pictograms, LETA told the agency of the Riga Council's Department of Property, Baiba Gailite.
At present, the museum has successfully completed the repair of the glass-speed damage caused by the operation of smallboardists.
Warning pictograms will be displayed in the next few days.
They will tell the people that the roof is a snowy rain and snowy weather, so it must not be moved by cars, as well as by bicycles, slippers and slippers.
On that social network, Facebook was also written by Ushakov, who pointed out that no security threats would cause damage, but "seems to be inaccuracy", and the snowboarders "will come to zenat".
Celebrations for children and parents - New children’s playgrounds in Riga are provided.
During this summer season, the Riga municipality has set up even two new playgrounds in the city, Kipsala and Čiekurkal, which are already available to children.
The Kipsala beach features a wide, multifunctional toy boat with various elements, bridges, games, pipes and ski slopes.
The playground is intended for all children of all ages.
The field also includes tubes and various balancing elements.
In the fantasy world, small shipowners are attracted to the Daugava coast with a view to the passenger port and the cruise ships that are visible there.
On the other hand, in the playground between Čiekurkkalna 4 and 5 the cross-line is equipped with a game house, a batt, a stage path, a bridge, a compass, a toy bomb and other elements of the game, as well as a fishing area with a ring of force and coordination trains, parallels, etc.
In the field, there is a covered rubber cover in different colors.
Up to the playground on the side of the street is a new colourful cloud cover.
In the honey, the reconstructed stage of the road has been discovered.
Minister of Transport Uldis Augulis, the management of the Latvian State Roads (LVC) as well as the representatives of the construction SIA Binders and municipal authorities have today discovered the Russian border of the reconstructed country (Grebnjeva) -Rezekne-Daugavpils-Lituvias border (Medumi) (A13) phase from the Medum to the border of Lithuania (156.4.163.05 km).
The roads are a national road map, especially border roads, so it is a special pleasure to discover a reconstructed stage on the border with our southern neighbours.
This is another example of the improvement of the situation on national highways through co-financing of the European Union funds.
"As forecast shows, the means available for roads during this planning period will be exhausted in 2018, and we need to think about how to continue maintaining the most heavily loaded roads in very good quality, and also to ensure the mobility of citizens in all regions of Latvia without the European Union funding," said Uldis Augulis.
The Minister of Transport also indicated that proposals made by road experts on sustainable financing for Latvia's roads will be presented to the government in the near future.
During the construction phase from Meduma to the border of Lithuania (156.4.163.05 km) SIA Binders started early and this year continued after technological interruption.
The reconstruction costs are EUR 13.5 million (including VAT), co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund (ERAF).
"The reconstructed road phase has completely renewed road construction and the next year will begin repair work from the Medum to Daugavpilij itself, thereby arranging the entire road from the Lithuanian border to Daugavpilij," said LVC Chairman Jānis Lange.
The main roads in the country are the most crowded, and by 2018 we are planning to ensure that all the main roads in the country are in good condition.
The next task will be to maintain them in good quality, while ensuring periodic maintenance and changing asphalt surface every 7-9 years.
"There, of course, will be a need for adequate funding, and all travellers with hope will respond to the proposals made by the expert group for the organisation of the road financing system," Lange noted.
As part of the project, road connections and lighting are arranged in the centre of the Medum.
Significant land works have been carried out: in four stages, large-scale cooling and large-scale loading and loading works, the long-term profile of the road has been balanced, which has so far been very uneven.
Public transport also has a refurbished area and a newly built return to public transport.
In the past, there was insufficient inability and the area relief was not transparent because of the mountain slopes and the old road of common relief.
The next construction season is scheduled to renew the road phase from the Daugavpils city border to the already reconstructed stage (144.80.156.40 km).
This year LVC plans to perform various works more than 1100 kilometres of national road.
Information on all repairs planned on the national road network this year is available on the LVC website www.lvcelli.lv.
"To achieve the desired weight reduction results, it is very important to choose the right food combinations," acknowledges Lithuanian diethologist Laura Romereite-Kukleriene.
Moreover, it is easy to accomplish during the summer period when fresh fruits, berries and vegetables grow in our own gardens.
The combination of foodstuffs of thought can help not only to reduce weight, but also to aim to promote different processes of the body.
Macaroni and etiquette are a successful combination because it provides a long-term sense of sweetness and helps to fight fat.
Studies published in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition have shown that the label has a beneficial effect on blood glucose levels and helps us to feel the walls.
Cayenne peppers and protein rich food, such as poultry meat or protein cocktails, create not only a sweet feeling, but also reduces cheese after large meals for the next meal.
The combination of such foods can also increase the amount of calories consumed by the meal to up to 35%.
Studies show that Cayenne’s peppers can help to break free from fat in the abdominal area.
The egg contains a metabolic food - choline, while the pepper is a good source of vitamin C.
Taking sufficient amount of this food can reduce the level of cortisol, which can also reduce the accumulation of fat around the middle of the body.
The golden beet attached to fresh eggs has another garden and fat burning meal for the breakfasts that are worth included in its menu.
Gold coatings and oats contain fibers that, according to Canada’s scientists’ conclusions, control the greline - an appetite-stimulating hormone - and thus also the sense of hunger.
In addition, eggs contain polyphenols that are helpful in weight loss and are not allowed to form fat.
Plants and proteins are also able to perform wonders in weight loss.
Such a combination can create a sweet feeling.
The vegetables contain water and fibers, which contribute to the feeling of sweetness.
At the same time, protein slows the digestion process and provides a sweet feeling for a longer time.
On lunch you can eat anything with salads or also make protein cocktails from the ready mix and enjoy it with your favorite vegetables.
Avoid any combination of products.
There are sugars in the fruit - monosaccharides or disaccharides - one or two molecular compounds.
On the other hand, the starch in the vegetables is polysaccharide.
The fruit is mechanically divided into the stomach, while the chemical does not divide until the third or fourth degree is reached in the digestion process that occurs in the intestines.
The prison is divided into three different stages, which are already in the mouth.
Therefore, it is important not to eat frozen food immediately after meals.
Eating sweet foods immediately after meals, it is "insulated" in the stomach with other foods, where it is not chemically dehydrated and begins to vomit.
Do not eat pasta, potatoes, eggs, bananas, dates or other products containing carbohydrates with lemons, lime, oranges, grapefruit, pineapple or other acidic fruits.
Enzyme ptialine, which is present in the shells, works only in the anaerobic environment.
Fruit acids do not only delay the removal of carbohydrates, but also facilitate their fermentation.
Do not eat eggs and meat, nuts and meat, cheese and eggs or cheese and nuts, meat and milk, eggs and milk and similar protein-rich products in one meal.
The processing of them requires different fermentation salts, each with different strengths, characteristics and time when it is necessary to get into the stomach.
Arbuz, honeymelone, muscatmelone and other melons should always be eaten separately from other foods.
Melons shall not be removed if they are in the stomach together with other foodstuffs.
Fats in combination with protein-rich products.
Fats are a successful combination of hard, but the same cannot be said of fats and proteins - fats prevent the removal of protein.
The protein can be combined with a very small amount of fat.
If a large quantity of protein-containing products is consumed, avoid the full use of fat.
It also applies to freshening - it is not recommended to combine large amounts of rice (containing proteins) with whole avocado (containing fats).
Such a combination prevents effective weight loss.
How better to prepare?
"Today's preparation, thermal treatment leads to a significant loss of nutrients - about 15% to 55% of the original food composition of the products," says the dietologist.
In most cases, food is lost by storing food in water.
However, the value of certain foods increases, directly heating.
After boiling the remaining fluids, it is recommended to use the soup for cooking - in this case you will not lose the nutrients left in the water and you will be able to eat them later.
It is recommended that vegetables be prepared, including by chewing them.
The thermal treatment significantly increases the bioavailability of the lipogen contained in tomatoes.
The amount of lycopene increased by 25% when receiving tomatoes for 30 minutes.
Thermal treatment also significantly increases the bioavailability of beta-carotene found in red, yellow, orange plants such as tomatoes, burkina Faso, sweet potatoes and spinach.
The thermal treatment of eggs and meat removes the natural properties of the existing proteins, making them easier to digest.
The thermal treatment of meat and eggs also makes the iron and other mineral substances present in these products easier to absorb.
It should also be borne in mind that freezing of the products can reduce vitamin C from 10% to 90%, although the freezing of the fibre does not affect.
In combination with tomatoes, bees may increase the iron intake in the body, which in turn ensures better brain and muscle function.
Our body takes up to 33% less non-blood-producing iron found in plant products such as bees, leaf greens, cereal products than the blood-producing iron found in animal products such as beef, fish and pus.
You can significantly increase the absorption of non-blood-producing iron in the body by using products containing non-blood-producing iron with vitamin C sources such as oranges, tomatoes and eggs.
Vitamin C helps to change non-blood-producing iron to make it easier for our body to absorb it.
Iron is necessary for the production of haemoglobin, which provides oxygen supply in the muscles and brains.
To get the maximum benefit from salads, add healthy fats such as olive oil or linseed oil.
When preparing butter with the salmon, add the vitamin D rich salmon or sardines to the free yoghurt, which is a good source of calcium.
Vitamin D increases the amount of calcium absorbed in the intestine and has a significant role in bone formation.
Gold (as well as other full grain products) along with vitamin C sources such as soils, apes, avenues and other fruits or eggs helps to stabilize cholesterol levels and avoid arterial inflammation.
Snapchat Anime's Effect Criticises for Asian Caring
Snapchat representatives say that this filter is inspired by animation, but some commentators claim it is racistally insensitive.
With this smooth effect Snapchat allows 150 million users every day to change the reality in an absurd way and play with their identity.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog or an image that would fit into Roja Liechtenstein's painting.
The lenses are cloudy, image-enhancing instruments that generate more than 30 million selves per day.
Any mistake quickly becomes public notice.
Snapchat lens effects have already been criticised by getting the impressions that the application popularizes too black or bright face tone as an ideal beauty benchmark.
This week, new lens effects were published that allow users to form soluble eyes, soluble teeth and rounds of face, and some critics referred to it as racist Asian cartoons – the yellow genes.
It was also asked whether such contradictions did not show that the company had more problems with diversity.
News and public denials were triggered on Wednesday, when the expenses “The Verge” and “Motherboard” indicated that the effects of the lenses have been removed from the application.
The company explained that the purpose of the lens is to picture the images of Anime, not to drive people of Asian origin.
But for people who have experienced racism, these effects have reminded them of painful stereotypes.
Others categorically rejected the similarity with Anime.
The entry for images by students from Korean American art students from Greece Sparapani Twitter has gained a broad resonance. In her e-mail she points out that the smooth effects are "excitable and uncomfortable to say no more".
She added that it is difficult not to understand the apparent similarity between Asian caricatures and the smooth effects of the eyes.
This shows that the smooth effect is not simply a yellow face, but a yellow face in the sense of racism.
Snapchat is not the only company that has been involved in these cultural sites.
American culture is also involved in an endless fight for diversity and inclusion, ranging from the premises of companies to Hollywood and the devices we use daily.
And Snapchat's big young audience, representing different races, unlike the elderly, is more sensitive to such things.
If Snapchat lenses create an image that offends users, then "Today such things are not noticed", 25-year-old Keitia Zhu said in a Thursday interview.
On Thursday, the leader of the product “Medium” Žou will delete his Snapchat application and advise others to do the same.
In her article "Midium" and in her phone interview, she explained that, in her opinion, racial problems arise due to Snapchat's employment policy, which does not support racial diversity.
Zuu criticised the company's management, which consists mainly of white men and then concluded his article with a reference #DeleteSnapchat.
"This means that there are no racial differences in the company, so such decisions are allowed. Or some other racial representatives are working in the company, but they do not take the job to express their views safely and comfortably," says American Zhou of Chinese origin.
Her opinion was also accepted by others, while Snapchat did not respond to her complaint.
The company does not reveal how many employees represent different races, indicating that it is a private company.
Snapchat refused to discuss the origin of his employees, but his representative found that the company had hired a staff specialist who would focus on representing the company also racial minorities, who were not widely represented and would promote the inclusion of the company.
Žou, on the other hand, will not update your Snapchat account by adding: "I wonder if they really need more users like us to understand that it's not right."
The Chamber of Congress shall state that the reports of the military officials have been corrupted by the Islamic State.
In a statement delivered on Thursday, the Chamber of Congress states that the US Central Orders have distorted reports, representing a war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria far more optimistic than is the truth.
Analysts of the Central Intelligence Service express general dissatisfaction with the interim report of the unit of task set up by representatives of the Armed Forces Committee, the Intelligence Committee and the representative of the Sub-Commission for the Protection of the Republics, indicating that their management controlled reports on the American side in the fight against the Islamic State.
The Central Command, known as Centcom, is a military base in Tampa, Florida, which oversees US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
The latest news about this report is that the survey reports confirmed by senior Centcom leaders reflect the US's fight against terrorism more positive than is true. In fact, it has been regularly distorted, reflecting better achievements than other polls have shown.
The representative of the Republic of California, Kens Kalvert, says: "Centcom's conduct is unacceptable - our soldiers are the ones who suffer if our policy makers receive false reports."
Centcom management errors are sought by organisations in the highest management.
This 10-page long report details the existing problems in the reflection of the Central Order and analyses the efforts of the Americans to prepare the Iraqi forces in 2014 and 2015.
Although this does not provide compelling evidence that the senior officials of the Obama administration had failed to break down the reports, it shows that Centcom’s management has made some pressure on analysts to reflect more optimistic views on the threat posed by the Islamic State (also known as ISIS or ISIL).
The report shows that, in the first half of 2015, the Central Management Press Releases, Communications and Reports presented the Congress with a much more positive light than it was.
For example, representatives of Centcom publicly announced that the Mosula recovery operation could begin in April or May 2015.
Mosula is Iraq's second largest city, still under the control of the Islamic State.
The representative of the Canadian Republican Party, Mike Pompeo, writes in his report: "The investigation of several months clearly confirms it."
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the main officials of the United States Central Management have broken down the reports, representing the ISIS threats in Iraq weaker than they really were.
The Republican Party established a working group to find out that the analysts are concerned that information about the Islamic State is being corrupted.
In the course of the investigation, the report published on Thursday will be followed by new findings in this case.
The General Inspectorate of the Ministry of Defence shall conduct an investigation into the activities of the investigating officer of Centcom.
On Thursday, the members of the Democratic Party of the Committee of Inquiry published their own report, which agrees with some of the conclusions of the Working Group of the Republican Party.
The representative of the Democratic Group, Adams B. Schifs, in his report, sent, from 2014 to 2015, to Centcom, too limited the preparation of the reports of the intelligence evaluations in connection with the ISIS and the Iraqi Security Forces.
Mr. Schifa explains that this process "stopped the dissemination of information", worsened analytical work ethics and "distributed false facts."
But the members of the Shifs and the Democratic Party added that there is no evidence that the White House has put pressure on Centcom analysts to draw up reports according to "pre-defined or political position".
The Daily Beast published the preliminary results of the congress investigation on Thursday.
In August The New York Times reported that the Pentagon General Inspectorate initiated an investigation into Centcom's complaints.
The Pentagon representative, Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans, announced that the Pentagon would not comment on the congress report until the investigation continued.
He also added that experts sometimes interpret complex data in different ways, and the Ministry of Defence and Intelligence calls for a constructive dialogue on vital issues of national security.
The investigation is not limited to the question of whether the US-led bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria is successful (a statement made by more and more representatives of the Ministry of Defence).
However, last year's complaints raise doubts as to whether President Obama can fully rely on reports from the Central Administration on military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan and other hot spots.
Critics regarding the Islamic State's exploration remind us of more than ten years ago events when an analyst for Centcom published a study by Gregory Höcker, claiming that the George V. Bush administration started the Afghan war, thinking too little about its possible consequences.
Hötter also played an important role in the discovery of the Islamic State’s exploration.
Last year's official representatives reported that the Hücker team found that, contrary to public reports, air raids did not significantly worsen the financial situation of the terrorist group because they had built temporary factories to sell oil in the black market.
In the September issue of The Times, it was reported that this discovery did not come outside the central management walls.
At that time, Commander Centcom, General Lloyd Ostin III, received a sharp criticism, as many lawmakers felt that the military reports described the situation too positive.
In April, General Austin retired and became General Joseph Votels.
In the US due to British women's field hockey, the U.S. wins, thus winning the fourth in turn.
The day after the victory over Japan with score 6:1, Thursday Keith Bama won the first two gates of US women's field hockey team, when the Americans launched the Indian team with score 3:0.
Five gates in two games are an unforgettable achievement, but 27 - year - old Bama said that she could not remember what had happened to her at one time.
She said, "I don't have a feeling."
I'm not one of those people who count their gates.
But she knows that the result of the Americans in the Olympics is 4:0, which gives them in their group an undecided British, which won over Japan on Thursday with the result of 2:0.
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday to play the last match in the first round.
Both teams have already qualified for a quarter final and the game will only determine which team will take the first place in the six teams group and which are the second.
The winner of the first place will be a little longer away from the meeting with the strong Dutch election, which is the leader of the second group.
Although the Saturday game has not been opened, the Americans have already called for a surprising wind, four years ago, taking the last place among 12 teams in London.
That team also had Bama.
She grew up in Blue, and for the first time in her hands at the age of 3 years (her older twin sisters were already working with this type of sport in Drexel) and joined the national team when she was 16 years old, becoming the most recent player in history.
She was not at the 2008 Olympics because she did not go to the finals.
In 2012, however, she and her team failed.
The following year, English Craig Parhams was appointed as a selection coach and everything changed on the right side.
Bama called it "cultural, mental and physical changes."
In London we did not invest as much as we do now.
We have completely changed everything.
On Thursday's game Bama discovered the result, winning doors in the first half-time with a year back from close distance.
India's game started without victory in its account, but their selection was very strong and held a minimum result 0:1 until the end of the third period when Bama regained the gates.
She entered the area of the amphibians on the left side of the field, and then noticed that she was in the middle of the field and that she was going to blow the americans at the door.
In the middle of the fourth period, Melissa Gonzales gained another gate.
This was the first U.S. Ward Briggs in the dry game, each of the first three games entering one door.
She's in a hurry.
And so is Bama.
"We are going very well now," said Pahams, but just as well, the game will appear on Saturday.
The most painful meal of the period of depression is "Satful meal"
In March 1933, shortly after the election of President Franklin Delano Ruzvelts sat in the oval room to hold the meals.
President Roosevelt enjoyed such delicious culinary delicacies as the zosus liver paste, or fuagre, and Maryland's gun soup.
But today, his meal was much more accurate: a bowl of flowers filled with eggs in tomato sauce, potato butter and in the desert.
Jane Ziegelmane says, "It's a way of solidarity in preparing meals with people who were very heavy."
Her husband, Andrø Kou, adds: "It's also a message for Americans how to eat."
A couple from the Brooklyn Heights area are food historians.
The latest book "The Garden of Life" describes the Chinese kitchen in America, but Ziegelmane describes life through food rental in the eastern part of Manhattan.
Their new joint work "Satan meal," which will be published on Tuesday by the Harper edition, is a story of American food during the Great Depression.
By showing some solidarity in the culinary, they took meals together with the reporter "Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop", a simple lunch table located in the area of Flatiron, which has been in operation since 1929, when great depression began.
54 years old, Mrs. Ziegelmane ordered butter with roasted cheese and dried olives, while 57 years old Kou ordered sweet potatoes, potatoes, and vegetable salads.
When the reporter ordered counterfeit rabbits, a couple recognized that his choice was very suitable for the conversation about the meal of the Great Depression Time .
Ms Ziegelmanes said that the counterfeit rabbit was very popular.
There was an earthquake, a liver disease, and a bee disease.
They were prepared from the basic ingredients and other ingredients that enriched the meals.
Imagine what it's like to eat so many peanuts that they'll be in half a day's place.
Mr. Kou has re-established.
"Suddenly it seemed that the belly was full of lead," he added.
In pre-depression years, the US lunch table was similar to the Swedish table, especially in rural areas.
Women were prepared to eat their men-workers and breakfasts, lunches and dinners were offered freshly prepared spices.
During World War I, Americans sent Europeans food directly. "Satan's meal" was described as adapted by Americans to conditions when the Americas were suddenly no longer a land of overcrowding.
"At that time the meal became the main focus of the people of America's day," said Mr. Kou, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write directly on this topic.
Just as important became the new budget diets: food such as falsified rabbits and spices became daily, wastes were "a great way to use surpluses," said Mrs. Ziegelmane, as the spring could hide the unattractive ingredients under the creamy measures.
Fresh fruits were replaced by cheap dried fruit.
The meat, which had been the main ingredient of the American meal for years, now became an extremely rare luxury product.
At a time when the number of calories and the nutritional value of food were more important than the taste, the gender was new, yet unforeseeable.
In an old manuscript, Mrs. Ziegelmanes found a recipe for the preparation of sheets filled with peanut butter.
Mr Kou adds: "It was not a popular lunch table supplement."
Mrs. Ziegelman said, "It was surreal."
Groundnut butter and eight soups are not compatible.
Many home food recipes were used during difficult times.
The economicists of households, such as Luíze Stenlia, head of the Federal Office of Economics, from 1923 to 1943, established national eating habits that were not experienced before or after the Great Depression.
By publishing articles and recipes in newspapers and magazines, they recommended that households become "economics" and accept challenges such as converting pasta and burkina Faso mix into a delicious meal.
"Sat of Malta" is a historic beauty.
It is particularly interesting to witness the government's attitude towards its starving citizens, such as President Herbert Hüver's "let me eat chicken" attitude.
Although he spoke publicly about his simple childhood and eating in Ajavo, he actually ate as a sweet - smelling millionaire he had become.
Mr Kou said, "He liked European cuisine, such as fish with gorilla sauce."
He eats in an almost yellow room, wearing a lunch jacket.
He had completely disappeared from reality.
President Ruzvelt would have made the same mistake unless his wife Eleonora had recommended that he set an example with his eating habits.
The book says that Ruzvelt had hired a housekeeper who did not learn to prepare to eat, so the White House became a place "where not only was one of the worst meals in Washington, but also the worst meals prepared".
As soon as the country's economy recovers, most of the ordinary culinary times of depression have disappeared.
But we continue to pay attention to calories and nutritional value, as well as to how we use science in cooking, Mrs Ziegelmanes added.
Some say that in writing the book, they gained a greater understanding of Mrs. Ziegelman’s eating habits, such as why she was unable to throw out food.
"She was really afraid to throw out the food," said Mr. Kou.
Mrs. Ziegelmanes said, "She actually cheated on people."
Once there was an accident with a windshield.
When we had eaten at Eisenberg, a couple of writers pulled the dessert from their home: a flower bottle that President Ruzvelt had lunched at lunchtime.
"It is a plumbing," said Mrs. Ziegelmanes, adding that there was a widespread tendency for decent foods to give a sleek name.
It does not contain poultry, only dried plums, a little flour, sugar, water and cane.
All of them eagerly wrapped up in the brown mass, which was on their shoulders.
Surprisingly, it wasn't that bad.
Mr. Kou ate some more coumas.
Listening to the experienced economist, he said to his wife, "Dear a piece of straw from the trunk of a fig tree."
Gilead will be reimbursed for legal expenditure in the fight against Merck for Hepatitis C patent
The District Judge has decided that "Gilead Sciences Inc" is entitled to recover the costs of the legal services it has paid for in the case of Hepatitis C patent infringement against the pharmaceutical company "Merck & Co Inc."
In June, Gilead was eligible for 200 million fines for two Merck patents, which threatened him with the successful Sovaldi and Harvoni tablets, when the US federal judge found violations in Mark’s activities, such as lying after sworn transfer and other non-ethical activities.
On Thursday, U.S. District Judge Bets Labson Freeman pointed out that Gilead was entitled to claim compensation for the legal expenses incurred by it in defending the case.
Merck tries to get positions on the market against Gilead, which dominates the market with new generations of Hepatitis C medicines that are effective in 90% of liver diseases.
The case was already started in 2013, when Gilead and Merck appealed to each other, trying to acquire ownership of the newly developed active component sofosbuvir, which is the main component of Gilead.
The US-supported forces claim that they have taken full control of the city of Manbida from the Islamic State.
The US-supported forces have completely taken over the northern part of the state of Manbidja at the Turkish border and the last Islamic state soldiers have left the city, the group's representative announced on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDS) are now cleaning the city from the last fighters who have not yet left the city.
They have released more than 2,000 civilians, who were captured by the fighters, to the news agency Reuters said Sharfan Darvišs of the Manbidja Military Council of the SDS.
"Now the city is in full control of us and we are looking for warriors," he informed the agency Reuters.
Clinton's income reached $10.75 million in 2015 and a couple paid a federal tax rate of 34.2 per cent.
On Friday, Hillary Clinton published a 2015 tax declaration showing that the Democratic Party's presidential candidate and her husband have earned $10.75 million this year and have paid a federal tax rate of 34.2 per cent, respectively.
In 2015, Clinton donated $1 million, mainly to his charity organization. Former President Bill Clinton earned about $5.3 million, acting as a speaker and former Secretary of State earned $3 million from his book on work in the State Department, which was published in collaboration with Simon & Schuster.
Clinton's election partner - US Secretary of State Tims Keins and his wife Anna Holtone have published their tax statement for the last 10 years.
In 2015, they paid a federal tax rate of 20.3 per cent.
"Hilaria Clinton and Tims Keins continue to set new financial transparency standards", in their statement, the Clinton campaign partner, Genifer Palmer, announced.
On the other hand, Donald Tramps hides behind various intents and objections in order not to fulfill his promises to disclose his tax information.
The publication of paid tax information is a record practice for the US President's candidates, but does not require the law.
New York Businessman Tramps and his lawyers min the National Revenue Service audit as a reason not to disclose tax information.
"That's a go," in his Twitter entry, about the tax information of the Democratic Party's candidate, Clinton's campaign partner, Ians Sams.
On Thursday, Special Adviser Michael Kohens told CNN that he would not allow Tramp to publish tax information before the audit was completed.
Critics, including the President of the Republican Party of 2012, candidate Mits Romnij and other Republicans, claim that his resignation raises questions about his real assets, donations and other business commitments, including those of Russia.
Clinton went to the oil fire on Friday, publishing video, where several influential Republicans demand Tramp to publish their tax information.
She returned to the matter during the economic talk in Michigan on Thursday.
She announced the effort: "He refuses to do what the other presidential candidates have done for decades."
Politico reports that during the 1990s, Tramps paid very little or no taxes, and on Friday, the author of the New York Times business column reported that many booksellers and lawyers believe that nothing has changed today.
Federal tax rates are an important issue of the President's will.
Clinton, supporting the billion-dollar Varena Buffeta proposal, popularizes the idea that every person who earns more than $1 million per year must pay at least 30%.
President Barack Obama also supports this proposal.
Last week during Clinton's speech in Omaha, Nebraska, where his Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate, Bafets invited Tramp to exchange tax returns.
Bafett said he was also audited by the Revenue Service and Tramps in fear of voters, not tax authorities.
The Clinton campaign has published tax information until 2007.
Klintoni now lives in Čakpva, New York and in the period 2007 to 2014 has paid the average federal tax rate of about 32 percent and the total tax rate of about 40.5 percent.
Clinton's 2015 tax report shows that, unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income is paid.
Their main investment was a low-cost index fund from which Clinton has received $109,000 in dividends.

Jewish film director criticises the hotel in Berlin about the closure of Israel's telephony code at an Arab request - RT News
The director of the French films of Jewish origin brought wind to the social media, when he discovered that at the "Kempinski Bristol" hotel in Berlin there is no Israeli telephone code available.
Klods Lancmans, a documentary film about the Holocaust director "Shoah", did not hide his discontent with Berlin's "Kempinski Bristol" hotel and addressed an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During recent visits, Lancmans tried to find the list of codes for Israel’s hotel.
However, this country was not included in the list of countries to which you can call directly from the hotel number.
How is it possible that in 2016 in Berlin, the new capital of Germany, Israel has been struck and destroyed?
Writing Lancmans.
Instead, the "Kempinski Bristol" hotel offers to call this country through its call center.
The Director requested an explanation from the hotel staff.
Lancman writes that the answer he received "was shocked".
The hotel administrator explained that "it was a known hotel management decision".
The reason why the code was removed was even more associated with the film director.
"Most of the guests are Arabic and they asked for the removal of Israel's code," Lancmans quoted the hotel employee's explanation.
Suddeutsche Zeitung reports that the Israeli ambassador to Germany James Hadas-Handelsman referred to this case as "great shame".
We are surprised and shocked at this incident.
The same is a great shame for himself.
And the fact that this has happened directly in Germany, just in this hotel network, there is even more humiliation.
No explanation is required.
The official said, "We hope that the hotel will make the right conclusions."
This event also gained a lot of resonance on the Internet, where people called it scandal.
Others believe that the "Kempinski" hotel has simply been issued to Arab customers.
Another entry reported "fight", indicating that the hotel is located in Kurfurstendamm Street near the synagogue.
The edition Der Spiegel reports that the hotel itself has quickly rejected all of the transfers, declaring it was all "understanding" and apologizing to Lancman.
"We have not received a direct order to remove Israel from the list of national numbers," Suddeutsche Zeitung quoted Kempinski as saying.
And it adds that the code has been added to the list again.
Police use rubber rods and gas against protesting Brazilian students.
The clash between students and police took place on Thursday in the city of Sanpaul in Brazil, where students gathered in demonstrations against government education reform.
The police used rubber rods and tear gas against the students.
The problems began when law enforcement tried to wipe out students, as a result of which the police used rubber rods and tear gas.
A number of hundreds of students participated in the demonstration to show their displeasure with the reform of the education system.
The proposal by Governor Geraldo Alckmina to close almost 100 public schools, while 300 000 students will be moved to other schools with a view to saving funds.
Some demonstrators drew graffiti on the walls with messages against temporary President Michael Temer.
This protest took place only a few days after the previous protest, when the students gathered in demonstrations with the aim of providing support to the outgoing President Dilma Rosefa, whose influence was voted on by the Senate.
Scott Kellums Skinners finished the first to deliver gold medals to Britain
Keleums Skinners from Scotland finished his first men's cycling team in a race in Rio, which took place last night. The British team saved its championship title, which it won in the 2012 London game.
The 23-year-old sportsman from Glázgova played an important role in these contests, making himself a proud legendary skut of Ser Krisus Hoy and bringing victory to the favorites of New Zealand.
Four years ago, Britain won an amazing victory when Hoys won the fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they also repeated it in the World Championship in London, although Hoys had already finished his sports career.
The problems were at the stage between Beijing and London’s Olympic Games, as the experienced starter was replaced by Jamie Staff.
They made it the last minute.
When Hoys left, he was trying to fill up Kians Emadi and Mets Krampton.
The British coaches hoped for Skinner, facing the potential he later proved.
Hindi, Kenya - a champion who started with Hoju and Skinner four years ago, who installed the Olympic Qualification Record, but the best start was for the New Zealand team
However, the British trio won gold medals.
The Hindus were close - knit, Keny took the lead, and Skinners took care of it.
The change of strategy played an important role in winning because the Hindus had a greater transfer to allow Kenya and in particular Skinner to drive faster.
Hoys was seen as a BBC representative and captured the views of Skinner, Kenya, and Hindus at the time they dug on an honorable pedestal.
23 years old, the painter said, "It was an irrevocable honor."
I'm doing my best to defend my name.
In the final, we installed the Olympic record and won the World Championships.
It was simply unbelievable.
There's no better victory.
After winning with Kenya and Hou in the 2012 Olympic Games in London, Hindus admitted that they wanted to go on the track after a failed start.
Later he gave these comments to British competitors and was not able to prove the contrary.
There was no such incident this time.
Hindus said, "The British flags in the courts refer to London in memory."
In the last 3 months, we have become a proselytized team.
We have lost so many World Championships, so winning the Olympics was really special.
One medal will be given to a country that has acquired seven of the ten gold medals in the race in Beijing and London.
If this is the progress rate of the team over the last five months, then the next five days will be very exciting.
In view of Kenya's results, he could really repeat Hoja's successes by acquiring three Olympic gold medals.
It would mean six gold medals and one silver medal for Kenya. Furthermore, Kenya is born on March 23rd (it seems to be a British holy date, as Steve Regreivs, Mo Farahs and Rogers Banisters were born on this day).
This date, too, is Hoys.
Kenya's next rounds are blown up, which starts today and will continue for the next three days.
28 years old sportsman from Bolton said, "Now I'm just enjoying it all.
The team's driving is always the best.
Because then you can win with the team members.
If you're honest, then winning one is a little lonely."
He said, "If he gets two more gold medals, he should be appointed a soldier."
That day it was the only battle for medals, but it was not the only good news for Britain.
Ser Bredley Vigins, Eds Klensey, Steve Burks and Owens Douls showed the fastest qualifying time in four kilometres.
Their time was 3:51,943
The World record that was installed in London in 2012 is 3:51,659.
The first round and final will take place today on the second half of the day, where Viggins will certainly be in the center of attention.
Yesterday before the qualifying trip, he had disagreement with the Commissioner when the judges summoned him to measure his growth.
In the women's journey, which will continue and be completed today, Laura Trota, Joanna Rovsela Shanda, Elinor Barkere and Katie Archibalda from Milgana installed a new record time of 4:13.360.
The British delegation hopes that the British Ride Team will be eliminated in the middle of the Olympic Games.
Remembering the excellent and unwary performance in Beijing and London, everyone is looking forward to the same achievements as Rio.
Until then, there have been different, after accusations of sexism and denial of respect, the technical director of Sheins Satons has resigned, and the career also ends with Hojs and Victoria Bendleton.
However, starting with the first velodromous events, Britain is expected to reach the highest level in the right time.
The future of the Portland store becomes unclear, as a vast contract is interrupted.
The future of the aluminium cassettes and hundreds of its employees in Portland, in Victoria, has become unclear as its main energy company announced the interruption of cooperation.
This Communication is based on the Victorian Government's plans to suspend the subsidy of the energy company, which is vital for the company to continue its work.
The long-term subsidies will be suspended in November.
As a result, more than 2000 jobs in the Alkoa Portland factory are at risk.
The risks could be up to 2000 in both direct and indirect jobs.
In addition, it will also have invisible side effects as the casket consumes about 10 percent of all of Victoria's electricity supply.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry cassette that led to an interruption in the operation of the British Power Station.
The Alkoa Portland shed works with losses and can be closed.
These events led to years of speculation about the rise of the value of the Australian dollar and the cost of production of the factory.
The energy supplier of the plant “AGL”, which supplies energy from its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobes Valley, says that the remaining three owners are likely to terminate their contracts.
Most of the power plants belong to the Alcoa and Alumia Joint Undertaking, in addition to the company's parts, they also belong to Chinese holding companies CITIC and Marubeni Corp.
"AGL" is looking forward to continuing the operation of the Portland plant, which would mean further energy supply to the basement," the representative said.
‘AGL’ stated that the contracts are the so-called ‘risk-restrictive contracts’ intended to enter into force from November 2016.
The contracts have a period of 12 months and will therefore be valid until 2017.
"AGL plans to receive revenue from these contracts also in the fiscal year 2017," said the company representative.
From the fiscal year 2018, the potential impact on profits is limited to favourable market forecasts for wholesale electricity prices in the future.
"AGL" claims that its forecasts have already calculated losses of $187 million , providing that these contracts will be terminated .
Alcoa submits that the decision to terminate the contracts will not affect the possibility of Alcoa continuing or supplying energy to the store.
The US company announced that in 2010 it had concluded a contract with Loy Yang for 20 years, but it would be terminated in November.
Analysts have expressed concern about both the possible closure of the Portland cassette in Victoria and the closure of the Tomago plant near Newcastle, due to the poor economy in the sector.
"AGL" Executive Director Stevens Mikelson said last week that 600 megawatts and 900 megawatts of energy were used during the year of Portland's analysis.
If both of these plants were released from the energy market, the demand for energy would be significantly reduced.
And that wouldn't be good at all.
The Community legal centre rejects 160,000 people each year.
Every year, more than 160,000 people's demands are rejected, while the budget is reduced, the situation could worsen.
Three out of five people in Queensland - mostly pensioners, immigrants, unprotected workers, victims of violence and those who do not have the means to fight illegal exclusion are denied free legal assistance and representation.
The Community legal centre, which has already been overrun, warns that reducing funding will only make the situation worse.
From June of the following year, these legal centres will receive 30% less funding than they have been up to now.
The Director of the Queensland Legal Centre, James Farels, said that the latest report of the National Legal Centres Association, says that legal aid is now being denied to thousands of people who need it.
Mr. Farels pointed out that if this decision is not repealed, the situation will only get worse.
He also says: "The Queensland's legal centre is constantly receiving insufficient funding, which means that aid is denied to thousands of people it needs."
For those who try to end violent relations, for people with deep debts, for families with divorce, for workers who are unjustly dismissed - all of these people have legal problems, and this report shows that they do not receive the help they need.
Since June 2017, the federal government will reduce funding by 30 per cent, which means that more than a thousand people in Queensland will have to deal with their complex legal problems without assistance.
We call on the Attorney General and Senator George Brandis of Queensland to stop the funding reduction immediately so that people who need legal assistance can get it.
Last year, the government opened its plans to build a level of legal aid to the national average.
It is now time to focus also on the needs of local communities and their clients and to invest in this important area for the Palestinian Government.
Donald Trampa campaign in court because one of the employees was shot
New York: The organizers of Donald Trampa's campaign have been tried in court because they have not acted on the information that its North Carolina Operations Manager has turned a suspect against an employee when they drove in a single car in February.
This incident was described in the court's request submitted to the Court on Wednesday, Vincent Bordini, the former campaign programmer.
Bordini said that he had waited months for the internal review of this case to begin, but he realized that it would not.
Leader Erl Philips "drawed a gun, placed his good scoreboard on the road and turned his back on Vincent's path," Bordini complains in his complaint.
He also claims that by submitting complaints to local and regional campaign management, Bordini learned that at least four more people have experienced the same.
"We don't have to fire weapons to cause damage," Bordini writes in her complaint.
Only two days before the submission of this case, the candidate for the Republican party to the President's office caused a scandal, informing people that "The People of the Second Amendment", i.e. the owners and the enthusiastically, could take action if his election would win his judgment by Hilaria Clinton and he would elect judges.
The representatives of the trampa campaign announced that the media had deleted his words from the context, and he had never brought anyone into violence.
Bordini wants to get compensation from campaign organizers for slow monitoring, but from the Philippines for assault, the use of illegal weapons and the creation of emotional stress.
Trampa representative Hicks immediately did not comment.
I couldn't contact Phillips.
WCCB - Charlotte's local news agency reports that Philip recently launched a campaign.
Nor has he managed to call his consulting company "Innovative Consultancy Services".
The President of the Republican Party, Donald Tramps, has carried out a controversial election campaign.

A new tradition - a holiday in Küļcie.
On Saturday, for the first time, people gathered for the holidays and sports.
This time, ten years after the celebration, it was decided that the festivals of Ezra would no longer be held.
The new page has now been changed.
The day began with sports competitions.
The competitions were not in traditional ways and too serious to be taken because, for example, bullets had to be put to a sleepy goal, the frog flew, with a man's left arm, "bubbling" was not in any Olympic game at all.
However, each participant could show how strong, courageous, weak and capable he is.
After the sports games, all gathered in the leisure work, where the holidays began.
At that time, there was also a "children's steering wheel", where the little ones could get out in the stunning attractions and get a new picture in the crimson.
The new one, which could also become a tradition, was a driver’s debt, with both tractors and motorcycles.
All of them spoke of the inga Kadiķe-Skadinja, the head of the district administration of Kūlcima, who chose a pleasant time of rest and dry, but the rains did not disturb them much.
The celebration continued with the greeting of the youngest inhabitants of Kukulcima.
Indeed, it is good that the parishioner has added five girls and one boy.
The audiences were very pleased with the performances of the old dance set "Rudens rhythm", the performances of various folk dance performers "Reds" and young dancers "Zelta Pearls".
And it's not that there was a time on the screen that was also going to slip.
Of course, local people and villagers were delighted to receive the famous actress's duet, Janis Jaráns and Danis Porgants, who were once again Mildini Nabins and Šlidrīte Kraninis, as well as the attractive women of Bärzciem from the fishing village "Diennies".
Balli played group Brugis.
Britain needs to maintain the Olympic spirit and expand Hytrova.
Hytrova will not only promote prosperity and growth in local regions and in London, but also throughout the country.
This, I think, makes Hitrov very attractive, just as in 2012 in London, where we have invested a lot of work so that all the national regions can benefit from the Olympics.
Stratford and Istanda have won a great deal of Olympics.
And we will do so again by providing local citizens and businesses with business opportunities near Hýtrov.
To the local communities alone, we will create 10,000 new business opportunities, 40,000 new jobs and finally add a point to young people's unemployment in the Hitrov area.
As in the 2012 London Olympics, there will be people who will think that this challenge is too big and that the expansion of Hýtrov is too extensive.
At that time, people said that Britain would never be able to prepare for the Olympics and that it would be a world-wide failure.
Skeptics went wrong in 2012 and in the case of Hýtrov, they will not be right.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Hýtrov has so far overcome everything.
Like the Olympic Games, Hýtrova is an infrastructure project that benefits the entire society, not individuals.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, economic growth of 211 billion, creating both employment and experience in this airport and throughout the UK.
A great team is working in HIT that has created a valuable 11-billion-billion infrastructure investment programme, including in time and in the budget, starting with a terminal 5, which has been designated as the best airport terminal in the world for five years and ending with a terminal 2, which is built between the two most intensively used routes in the world.
Now they are ready to set up a third track, which will be financed by private investment of 16 billion marks.
The 2012 London Olympics were a great success, and I am confident that this will be the extension of Hytra.
It is time to revive the Olympic spirit and expand the Hitrov by ensuring our future of trade and creating a new employment environment with which Britain might be proud.

In Switzerland, a woman climbs up the street trying to commit suicide.
In the middle of the night, it's on the big road.
The police are trying to find witnesses in a case when she was transferred by a couple of cars from early Thursday morning to the highway.
The accident took place on Thursday shortly after midnight on the A1 road near the town of Morges in Vo canton.
The Vo canton police report said that she was mistakenly willing to commit suicide, and she was on her way in the dark, where she was taken by several machines.
No doubt trying to kill yourself, the victims, 49-year-old Swiss, drove several cars, including a heavy car.
She's in place of the event.
Several of the drivers involved in the accident have already given evidence, but others involved have not yet been identified, says the police, calling on the drivers and the witnesses involved to call back.
The case has also initiated a criminal investigation, which is a logical step in this case, for the expense of Le Tribune de Geneve, the lawyer Gilles Hofstellers.
However, it is not yet known whether any of the drivers involved will be punished.
Was it possible to avoid a collision?
The judge adds, "That's a clear prosecutor."
Two similar cases that have occurred in the last 5 years indicate that none of the drivers will be called upon to take responsibility.
In both cases, the walker had gone into the middle of the night, so it was decided that drivers could not expect a walker to be in the middle of the night, a newspaper.
Last year, a policeman was justified in killing after she was unconscious when she left in August 2014, a man who slept on the middle of the night on the A1 road near Paijernes.
The court found that the 22 - year - old victim was drunk and later noticed that he was on his way.
The court concluded that the police officer who was on his way to the scene was in a proper manner and the judge recognized that the sleeping man on the road was "a completely unexpected and extraordinary case".
Anyone who has information about the incident on Thursday near Morges has been invited to contact the police by telephone 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
On the Internet, you will receive signatures for the appointment of a new VID leader.
The opening of the signatures of the petition portal "Avaaz.org" for the appointment of a new Head of State Revenue Service (VID).
The petition addressed to the Ministers of the National Associations (NA) and the Greens and Farmers' Union (ZZZS) states that the company wishes to set up transparent and professional officials.
The petition was created on the 10th of August, and it has now been signed by 55 people.
The proceedings for the expulsion of the VID Director-General of Ingas Kolīgova are transparent and non-professional.
It recalls the traditions of the Union’s top officials.
This discredits public administration and makes the public hope in government and politicians the next time.
"There is a need for a competition with clear criteria to be assessed by all candidates", the text of the petition reads.
Its author, Jānis B., indicated that the public did not know the criteria as Kolígova was chosen for the job.
Similarly, there is no clear indication of the candidate's intention to work on the VID.
The request indicates that a new open invitation to tender is to be made to the Office of the Secretary-General, which is actively addressed to the professional candidates, to the staff members and to the appropriate remuneration.
Last week, Finance Minister Dana Reiznieces-Ozola officially appointed the head of the Collegiate VID, and this week the government intended to approve him in his new position, but all the ministers of the "Unity" party voted against, so the question of the week was postponed.
Samilovs: If we lost, I played bad.
Aleksandr Samoilovs and Jānis Šmēdīņš were hoping for a prize in the Olympics in Riodjegnare, but without it, there was no difference where the competition ended, Samoilovs said after leaving the tournament.
One of the world's most powerful beach volleyball couples in the final and decisive tournament of the sub-groups with 1-2 (16:21, 22:20, 7:15) lost Brazilians Evandra Gonsalveš Oliver and Pedro Solberg Salgad, concluding their participation in the most important sports forum.
In the three sub-group matches, Latvian athletes won one victory, but the same relationship was two more pairs.
The relationship between three small points, which was the most unfavourable of Latvia's duet after the severe loss in this cat, was listed below.
"In the first set we were in charge, but from 16:15 we also stayed at 16 points", the game remembered the course of the game.
I don't even know how the rest of the set remained pointless.
It must not be played.
Then in the second set, everything was all right and the set finally managed to break the game, and it should also be a good foundation for the third set.
We started it in the same way, but after we lost the party, the result only grew for one team.
We had too many mistakes in the attack.
In the subgroup, all teams were similar, almost all of them had three sets, so small points were important.
"You should have played more like this than returning 3-4 points in a row," said the sportsman.
We knew that the Gospel could be observed.
"In the first set we met at the end of it, in the second we placed 1-2 points, but in the third at +4 he already left the game," recalls Šedīņš.
We tried to show the best game.
It's been a while, it's not a while.
I did not see the overall situation before the match, but it was known that there were as few points as possible.
"If we lost, then I played bad," Samoilov said.
We waited for a good servant from the Evandra, and with his first sets we met quite well, but in the third, he opened a servant and found it difficult to make an attack.
On the other hand, I made a lot of mistakes at Pedro’s service, but it had to be done.
Samilov said that the previous match today was not nervous.
"We lost, we played, too were protection, but we needed better service," said the sportsman.
"They played well and in the end they've already met at the hour."
Before the tournament, we just said that the breakup was as uncomfortable as it could have been.
We also had the opportunity to fight for the first place, but we did not even go out of the group.
"All of us expected medals, and so did we, but then there is no difference - 25th place or fourth," said Samilovs, who predicted that the duet will continue to play together in the future as well.
I think there will be no question and we will continue to play together, because this is just one tournament.
Samilova Riodezjaneiro was already in the third Olympic career, as in 2008 he started in Beijing with Martin Pliny, but four years ago in London he played with Russia Sorokin.
In the meantime, this was the second start in the Olympics.
"Latvenergo" follows the process of opening the gas market from the potential dealer's position as well.
The national energy company "Latvenergo" follows the process of opening the gas market both from the consumer and from the potential trader's position, the company's press secretary Ivita Bidere said.
"The decision on whether or not Latvenergo will also join the gas market as a trader will determine which gas market model and legal framework will be set up."
"That is why we are actively involved in the drafting and commenting of legislation and in submitting our proposals," Bidere said.
The agency BNS has already written that the Ministry of Economics (EM), in cooperation with the Public Services Regulatory Commission and the energy company "Latvijas Gáze", has developed draft rules of the Cabinet of Ministers "The rules on the marketing and use of natural gas" which will change the operating principles of the existing natural gas market since 3 April 2017 by providing natural gas users with the right to freely choose natural gas traders.
In the context of the new regulation of the natural gas market, the EM aims to make the natural gas trading process as simple as possible and as easy as possible for the user to understand.
Therefore, as the most efficient and user-friendly service solution is chosen as "the central model of the trader", in which all activities related to customer service are provided by the trader - one contract, one bill and one information and customer service location, leaving the technical issues of the natural gas distribution system to the distribution system operator.
A similar solution is currently being implemented in the electricity trade.
We recall that the gradual opening of the market for domestic users - even after 3 April 2017, those domestic users who do not want to choose another natural gas trader will be able to continue to receive natural gas from the existing trader at a regulated price, thus becoming related users.
"In such a case, the obligation to supply natural gas-related users with a regulated price is fixed to the public trader," the Ministry reported.
On the other hand, traders will have to choose a natural gas trader to conclude a natural gas trading agreement.
Until a certain period of time before the conclusion of the natural gas trading agreement, traders will be provided with natural gas trading at a fixed price.
The draft rules of the Cabinet of Ministers set out in detail the rights and obligations of the natural gas trader, system operator and users.
The rules shall lay down the arrangements for the supply of natural gas to users and suspend its supply, the requirements for the safe use of the natural gas system, the trader, the public trader, the system operator, the user and the gas-based object owner in the supply and use of natural gas; the arrangements for the calculation of the services received, the percentage of the loss, the arrangements for the exchange of traders and the supply of users in the event of disturbance of natural gas supply; the arrangements for the provision of natural gas to related users by the public trader.

Minister: The next week, it is planned to decide on an increase in the remuneration of the Director-General of the VID.
Minister of Finance Dana Reizniece-Ozola (Greens and Farmers' Union (ZZS)) plans to talk to Prime Minister Māri Kucinski (ZZS) and the government coalition partners next week about increasing the remuneration of the National Revenue Service (VID) Director-General.
Reizniece-Ozola told reporters on Friday that the issue of increasing the remuneration of the Director-General of the VID had to be addressed urgently in order to make this work more attractive to the possible re-applicants.
It was also discussed next week about the change in the terms of the invitation to tender.
The Minister also stressed that she had no idea of a specific candidate to be called on to apply for a vacancy.
At the same time, Reizniece-Ozola expressed the view that the Head of the State Environment Service, Inga Kolígova, had been a good CEO of VID.
On the other hand, with regard to the current executive director of the VID Daci Peléko, who has expressed his readiness to apply for this post, the Minister reiterated the view that the new Director-General of the VID should be a "side view" and should not come from the VID structure.
She also stressed that she was waiting for Saeima to return from her vacation to move as soon as possible the amendments needed for the VID reorganisation.

In her presentation, she said that it was not an easy choice, but in the last two weeks, her relatives have experienced severe emotional pressure, although they have not done any acts of law.
Kolígova also pointed out that her candidacy consultation has increased between the ruling coalition parties, which is also unacceptable.
It has also been reported that at the end of June, the former Director General of the VID Inara Peterson left office.
Oil prices continue to rise; exchange indices in the USA and Europe increase, as well as the value of the US dollar.
The world's oil prices continue to increase on Friday morning, with the positive impact of investor attitudes on the statements of the Saudi Minister for Oil Cases, which reinforces the expectation that the largest oil recipient countries will take action at the OPEC meeting in September to stabilise the world oil market.
The three main U.S. stock exchange indexes reached record levels on Thursday, which have not been observed since 1999.
The main positive factor in the market was the rise in the oil price and the strong financial indicators of several large companies.
The rise in oil prices and the strong financial indicators of several companies were also a cause of the rise in European stock exchange indexes on Thursday.
The value of the US dollar increased on a Thursday against the euro, against the UK trade mark and against Japan's fine.
In the electronic trade of the New York Stock Exchange, the WTI brand's crude oil price for supplies increased by $1.78 on Thursday to $43.49 per barrel.

The turnover of the conservative producer "Zilā lagona" per year is 33.8%.
The turnover of the conservative producer "Zilā laguna" was EUR 4,202 million, which is 33.8% less than a year ago, while the company's losses fell 5.7 times - to EUR 904.7 thousand, the annual financial report published in the Lursoft database shows.
In 2015, the company’s management report said that the company had suffered losses for several reasons, including the lack of a permanent exchangeable asset caused by the withdrawal of Unicredit Bank from the Baltic market by suspending the previous line of credit and leaving the Green Lagoon with contracts without being able to comply with them.
Consequently, the company did not have sufficient funds to purchase cheaper raw materials in large quantities and to receive a discount.
The withdrawal of the bank in question from the Latvian market also enabled the company to implement projects of the European Union Structural Funds that would enable the factory to acquire new production equipment and modernise infrastructure.
Also, the company’s financial creators in the year’s transfer had a negative impact on the price increase of raw materials and the refusal of customers to pay more for the goods produced by the company.
"Only on the second side of July 2016, customers recognized price changes and were ready to buy goods for the new - highest - prices," the company's management said.
In 2015, "Zilā laguna" also began negotiations with potential investors, including the valuation of the company's moving and untended assets.
Investors have already been with the company's largest creditor "Unicredit Leasing", where the parties have known and discussed possible investment plans.
At the same time, the company's activities and development had a positive impact on the implementation of the restructuring and optimization plan launched in 2014 and 2015.
This plan included the improvement and optimization of technological processes, which enables greater productivity and capacity to be achieved.
"Several equipment was purchased that provides a higher production speed," the company's management indicated.
The management of "Zilā lagona" notes that the equipment purchased in 2016 will allow the company's factory to comply with orders that have not yet been possible.
The first batch of production to be produced on this equipment will be ready in August.
Since the sales of the product have already been signed, all the products produced will be sold in accordance with the sales protocols.
The new product will increase turnover by about 300 thousand euros per month," the company's management says.
The company also plans to sign a cooperation agreement on supplies of fish production to Iraq in August 2016.
"Zilā laguna" in 2016 has sent the first experimental container to Israel, has expanded the market for naïte to Cyprus, and this September will sign a cooperation agreement with a new wholesale chain in the USA.
As a result of all the above measures, the company plans to increase turnover.
In 2014, "Zilā laguna" worked with a turnover of EUR 6,347 million and EUR 5,113 million for losses.
"The Blue Layer" was established in 1997 and its core capital is EUR 1,156 million.
The company is owned by two private individuals in Latvia - Mihail Kaidanova (89.1%) and Igor Širshona (10.89%).
Welcome to pl. 15 at the museum to wait for Zāra Leanderi to take part in the press conference.
Riga can be seen as a city of the beginning and inspirational career of the divine cinema.
Zāras Lendere's residence at the crusade of Rutas, who was a Swedish ambassador in Latvia, was found guilty in 1924, because she just discovered the unusual low contract with the woman of Zāras Lederes, who she tried to debit to the theater theater in Riga.
Perhaps the strange sensation in Riga became a fatal turning point in the creative path of Sarah against the world’s glory.
Rīga Zārai Leanderi was associated with warm memories, and she hoped to visit Riga’s guests, but unfortunately these hopes were not decided to be fulfilled because the Second World War began.
Using the form of the exhibition, this meeting will be possible in Riga on the weekend 2016 and the excellent role of Záras Leander will be influenced by the excellent Ieva Kerævica.
Aglons are subject to extensive traffic restrictions.

The insurer shall pay compensation for passengers on Wednesday at the airport.
If Insurance has paid a travel insurance fee to a family on Wednesday, the cancellation of the flight at Riga Airport on 10 August, which resulted in a rejection of the intended music festival visit.
On 11 August, If Insurance received an application for compensation from a client.
The family had planned to go to a music festival in Belgium, but since it was not possible because of the cancellations at the airport on Wednesday, the customer was paid compensation for night reservations that could no longer be cancelled, as well as for the tickets purchased at 204 euros.
On the other hand, the airline has promised to pay the customers the money spent on airline tickets.
If Insurance from all travel insurance benefits on average 15% has paid compensation for termination or cancellation of the journey.
"This is the time when costs are paid for the purchase, delivery or exchange of tickets, as well as for the booking of accommodation," says Dagni Rutka, head of the insurance product insurance company If Insurance Persons.
As it is known, on 10 August, a private plane stopped at Riga Airport due to technical problems, so only several departing flights were cancelled, but several incoming flights had to be moved to other airports.
Because of the repair of the fireplace, the man is at the edge of the roof and the pressure is to leave the house.
The LTV broadcast "4.Study" directed Dmitrijs Saidjašev, whose neighbor started to repair the capital in his apartment, and since then Dmitri has been wearing a shirt from the ceiling and is not sure that staying in the apartment is safe.
The problem is that my neighbors have carried out voluntary construction and my apartment has been damaged.
Then I informed the Riga Building Authority, the Home Manager and other organizations.
The Bauvwalde said that we are no operational service and we have no expert.
"The owner of the apartment must go to the Latvian Engineering Union, and there will be an expert from there," says Dmitrijs.
The guest expert came, fixed the incident and acknowledged that overcrowding was in a state of unsatisfaction.
However, since Dmitria’s first application in the construction department, it has been a month, and by the beginning of this week, it has been unable to answer whether the apartment is in danger of life.
The building council said - it's legislation, wait, if you're not satisfied, write to everyone in order.
"Then I wrote to Riga's house, but they transferred the house manager, then the house manager went back to the building, and then there was a road," Dmitry says.
After all the paperwork, it is clear that the construction work is stopped, although at any point you can hear someone working there.
For another two months, there must be expertise and for six months the owner of the apartment, who is repairing, must have all these defects removed.
The independent expert has drawn up his opinion, but the building authority considers it incomplete and superficial.
The expert did not indicate whether the metal regime contained in this non-exhaustive structure was affected, and therefore there was no certainty that the owner of the lower apartment was in danger.
"That is why we have asked for an additional explanation from this expert," said Ilze Žuka, the representative of Riga City Building Authority.
Despite the ban on any repair work in the upper apartment, we always hear that the building continues.
The penalty for voluntary construction without a building permit is between EUR 70 and 700, but in this case the penalty may be more severe.
While the expert's opinion is expected, the construction board has decided that both apartments should not operate - both in the construction and Dmitry's apartment.
"This was not the case in the construction practice when, because of their ignorance or simply inadvertentness, citizens may have created a threat not only to their property but also to the owner of the underlying property, as a result of which the owner cannot operate his property," said the representative of the construction company.
Now Dmitri is left to find another place where to live - at the radio, friends, hotels, or rent another apartment.
But the losses caused by Dmitrijs can try to get away from a neighbor's civil order, which can take a lot of time.
Because of the voluntary construction, both apartments are now prohibited until the construction site is closed, and it can be expected for even three weeks.
The damage will have to be borne by the owner of the apartment in which the repair work has been carried out.
The owner of this apartment is also threatened by a prison sentence for up to six months because the construction board has not taken into account what it said.
Oh, come on!
How many praisers in this picture?
The correct answer is five.
In Ukraine, five white lions were born in the zoo near Kiev.
Everyone feels well and sometimes gets caught up in a total, despite the fact that a total little ones feed.
The conversion of the former Chimeru sanatorium into a five-star hotel will cost 22 million euros.
The former Chemeru Sanatorium for the Park Hotel Chemeri hotel will cost 22 million euros, a representative of Gita Zelve Park Hotel Chemeri, who tells the agency of LETA's current hotel manager, SIA Park Hotel Chemeri.
The establishment of the hotel is the first phase of the restoration of the former Chimeru sanatorium.
The second stage will be "wellness" or a well-being clinic planned to open in 2022, while opening the hotel is scheduled in May 2018.
Gelve notes that the exact cost of the clinic is not yet known.
However, she points out that it will be found in the former Chemeru resort polyclinic building, with an area of about 12,000 square feet [12,000 sq m].
The clinic will be located on three floors.
The Park Hotel Chemeri and the proposed clinic owner are the international fund "G Capital Europe", which invests in European assets.
The owners of G Capital Europe are several investors who invest money in this fund, Želve points out.
As Executive Director George Jones said earlier, a former resort policy has planned to invest between EUR 12 and 15 million, with investment of more than EUR 30 million.
It has already been announced that the restoration of the cultural park in more than 42 hectares of the area, the restoration of roads and streets, the construction of an interactive natural tourism facility, the improvement of the area and the construction of parking facilities on the Emelia Darzin Street, which will contribute to the social development of the city of Jurmala and the growth of the number of tourists, the Jūrmala House plans to attract €14.5 million from the European Union funds, co-financed by between €3 million and €4 million.
The design works planned by mid-2017 will begin in the autumn of the following year.
As reported, in the historic Sanatorium complex "Chemeri" is planned to form a five-star hotel "Park Hotel "Chemeri" and "wellness" or a well-being clinic.
However, the reconstruction is delayed.
On the other hand, the 2010 report further stated that Ominais was regularly communicating with the hotel operator "Kempinski", which continues to provide daily technical control at the "Kemeri" sanatorium", and in 2011 it was determined to meet the "complete reconstruction of the boiling hotel "Kemeri"" and to start preparatory work to open the "Kempinski" chain hotel.
In October 2014, the Ominais Latvia-owned Čemeru Sanatorium set confirmed the Park Hotel Čemeri, but the month later the auction was considered not to have happened because the winner had not paid for the purchase at the time.
The sales price was set at the starting price of the last outstanding auction - EUR 2.86 million.
As LETA informed the city council representative Ieva Aile, the municipality, in signing the protocol, has confirmed that, with the support of the European Union Structural Funds co-financing, the infrastructure in the framework of the re-establishment of the historic park of Chimeru will create an interactive natural tourism facility, roads and parking facilities.

He studied with Jázep Vítola Latvian Academy of Music at the Arvida Luste class.
On the other hand, in 1997 he began singing the Latvian National Opera in Korea, but in 1998 he debuted with the role of Oberto in the "Alčina" opera in G.F.Hendeli.
He received the "Great Music Award 2003" on vocal performances in operas and Verdi in the Recquemiem.

The Russian hackers broke up with former NATO Commander Bridlov's e-mail.
The hackers, who launched the U.S. National Democratic Committee (DNC) computers, may have launched several other cyber attacks, also launched the servers of former NATO Commander Philip Brydlov and George Soros Institute of Open Society, the Bloomberg Business News Agency announced Thursday.
Hackers have published information on DCLeaks.com.
Among other things, there is also a list and information about the work of the Soros Institute.
Computers of the hacker Institute have been available all year round.
According to Bloomberg, these cyber attacks were carried out by the same hackers associated with Russian specialists who broke up DNC e-mails.
The Wall Street Journal reports in turn that the U.S. President Barack Obama's administration is currently looking at the issue of imposing new sanctions on Russia, thus responding to the launch of DNC computers.
In order to impose sanctions, the administration will have to charge the servers of the Democratic Party to officially in cybercrime against the hackers supported by Russia or the Russian authorities.
As reported, in July, the WikiLeaks website published about 20,000 e-mails obtained from the DNC computer system, of which it is clear that the leaders of the Democratic Party have tried to harm the presidential election of the party candidates, the former senior senator of Vermont Sanders, in the fight for the nomination of the Democratic Party.
As reported by US press sources, the Federal Investigation Office, which conducts investigations into the break-in of democratic servers, as well as other US specialists, considers that Russia’s relationship with cyber-attack is unquestionable.
Macartney: Yoko Ono's presence threatened "The Beatles".
Paul Macartneys admitted that the presence of Yoko Ono created a sense of the threat of the legendary group "The Beatles".
The 74-year-old rock star currently maintains a "good" relationship with the unresolved John Lenon retreat, but at the time she went to visit the group at the record study, Makartnius was concerned because Ono was the only female member of the group - George Harrison, Ringo Star, Lenon and Makartnija - between.
When the singer asked about both relationships, he told the Rolling Stone magazine, "This is really good."
At that time, we feel threatened.
While we were recording, she sat on the amplifiers.
Most of the groups could not endure it.
We were able to do this, but not quite successfully, because we were very busy.
We weren't sexists, but girls usually didn't come to a record study, they let us work.
When John began to meet Yoko, she did not sit in the control room, but in the middle of us.
The author of Yellow Submarine also admitted that he now regularly contacted a member of the former group Ringo, and every time he confirmed the work plans of the record studio "Apple", but otherwise "The Beatles" is "end of work".
The question is whether he still meets with the other one still living in a legendary hand group, Makartnijs told the Rolling Stone magazine: "Of course not."
We meet at social events and ballets.
However, I did not go to the meetings, and I felt a little limited.
I left Apple during a severe divorce.
In my place at the meetings, I sent John Istmen and said, "Tell me what everyone says, because I can't stand sitting at that table."
It was too painful to see our pet die.
The company now works so that I'll just listen to all the records.
I am part of the approval process.
NASA climate model: Venus was once a inhabited planet
Based on NASA's latest climate models, Venus has once been a inhabited planet.
Scientists at NASA Godard Space Research Institute have developed a model to explore Venus history using tools and algorithms that climate scientists also use.
The model was designed to determine whether on Venus, whose surface is hot, where there is no water and whose atmosphere consists almost exclusively of carbon, which has been similar to Earth.
Scientists have already mentioned earlier that the slow rotation rate of Venus is explained by the dense atmosphere.
However, recent simulations show that Venus once had a plan, an atmosphere like Earth, and it would be slow.
The model also looks at Venus' oldest topography.
There was more dry area on the planet than on Earth, but there was plenty of water and geographical diversity on it, so that life could be created and water would not be evaporated.
In the early days of Venus, the sun was more than 30 percent lower.
In the simulation of the GISS model, the Venus bending model reveals that the light part of the day on it lasts for 2 months, explained in the press release by the GISS scientist Antonius Del Genio.
This process warms the planet’s surface and causes a thing that forms layers of thick clouds, which act as a rain shield, protecting the planet from the heat of the sun.
The result is a moderate climate temperature, which is actually a few degrees lower than the temperature on Earth today.
The model depicts the history of Venus, which is similar to the theory of evolution that scientists have developed in their hypothesis.
Although it was once inhabited, for a number of billions of years, Venus was subjected to too much heat and ultraviolet stars.
Its oceans burned down, and the tides burned the ultraviolet stars.
When the water was completely drained, there was only a flat carbon atmosphere with a deadly greenhouse gas — Venus, which we know today.
Scientists published the results of the new Venus Climate Model in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roys is derogating from Avalanche's coach's job
On Thursday Colorado's Avalanche coach and hockey operations vice-president Patrick Roys presented an adjournment, as a reason for not having enough influence on the team's decision-making process.
The Colorado Vice-President and General Joe Sakiks confirmed this news and informed that the club was about to start looking for new coaches.
"For the last three years, I have been energetic, enthusiastic and focused on my duties as chief coach and vice-president of the hockey operations of the Colorado Club," says 50-year-old Roy in his report.
During this summer I have been thinking a lot about how I could improve the performance of the team in order to give it the necessary gear and achieve the results of a higher level.
In order to achieve this, the vision of the vice-president of the chief coach and hockey operation must be fully in line with the vision of the organisation.
It must also be able to influence decisions relating to the performance of the team.
At present, these conditions have not been met.
On 23 May 2013, Sakid, who was appointed to the Council, thanked Roju for his contribution to the team.
He said Patrick informed her of his decision today.
We appreciate everything he has done for the organization and want it to be better for him further.
In his first season with the Avalanche team in 2013-2014, Roys was recognized as the best coach in the league and won the Jack Adams prize.
He helped the club reach 112 points and first place in the Central Division, but in the first round of the exclusion games, the Colorado team has launched the Minesota hockey player. Since then, the club has not been involved in the exclusion games for two years.
Avalanche concluded the 2015-2016 season with a result 39-39-4 and left five points behind the Wild team without obtaining a second special invitation from the Western Conference organizers.
In his career, Rojs was the keeper of the Slavic medicine, and he was the winner of the four Stenley boxes - two with the Montreal "Canadian" and two with the "Avalanche".
North Sea oil platform workers resume negotiations and leave the strike
The strikers on the North Sea oil platforms have been suspended because the two parties involved in the dispute have resumed negotiations, the leaders of the mail negotiations.
On a regular basis, the Wood Group has a string against the oil processing company on the North Sea oil platforms in which the Royal Dutch Shell operates.
The Joint Communication states that the Wood Group and Unit and RMT trade unions have agreed to resume negotiations on settlement of the dispute.
A number of full-day meetings are scheduled for the following week, which will begin at the beginning of the next week, with a view to re-examineing the issues.
The trade unions indicated that their recent measures, organised after more than 25 years of interruption, were directed against the planned reduction in wages of 30 per cent.
This year, due to the negative market pressure, the Wood Group reduced the wages of North Sea workers by 9 percent.
Already in 2014, the company reduced the wages of land workers by 10 per cent.
The company explains that additional wage reductions would allow the company to survive a market decline.
On the other hand, Shell has already reduced the wages of several thousand people and announced plans to stop oil and natural gas operations in 10 countries to optimize its work by preparing for a large-scale merger with the British energy company "BG Group".
Energy companies are experiencing pressure-driven oil prices, and the situation is becoming more difficult for Britain to leave the European Union.
At the beginning of the week, the Scottish Parliament Member, Devis Anderson, met with workers' representatives to discuss one of the most important issues - the North Sea strike plans.
He said that the North Sea is vital to the region's economy.
In his report he explains that the North Sea and the State in general need an economy from which everyone, not individual, would benefit.
In 2016, the new North Sea projects are expected to invest almost $1.4 billion compared to the $7 billion invested over the last five years.
Kepler measures the speed of turning stars in the Pleiades star.
The latest Kepler telescope mission has helped astronomers collect the most complete catalogue of the speed of the stars in the Pleiades star.
The new data helps astronomers to understand why the stars in this star range at different speeds and how the star rotation rate is related to the formation of planets.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other stars, we will get more information about the relationship between the mass, age and even the history of the solar system," said Professor Luis Rebula of the Pasadenas Caltech Infrastructure Process and the Analytical Centre.
The flash star is 445 light-years away from the Earth.
Many stars in this star are only beginning to grow to about 125 million years old.
They shall be cut at the maximum speed.
At maximum speed, these rising stars emit large amounts of wind.
When they arrive in the magnetic field, they brake the stars.
As the stars grow older, the speed of their rotation decreases.
Kepler measures the speed of each star rotation by setting the time between a known area of stars, such as the solar plane.
The latest star rotation speed catalogue shows that larger stars are cutting slower than smaller stars.
The revolution compares stars to dances, larger growth meters make piruets slower than small growth meters.
Rebul is said to show that slow rotating objects are larger and more massive, while faster rotating objects are very small stars.
Thanks to the fact that the Pleiades star is so close, it serves as a great space laboratory, where it can compare the star characteristics to the speed of rotation.
Rebul says that the Pleiades star helps to form theoretical models for the rotation of stars in both parent and youngest directions.
We still need to learn a lot about how, when and why the speed of turning stars will slow down and about their complete stopping process.
Rebul and his colleagues presented in detail with the analysis of the speed of the turn of the Pleiades stars in three new publications, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
