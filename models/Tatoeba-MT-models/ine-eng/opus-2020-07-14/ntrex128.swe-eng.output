AM in Wales is anxious to "go on as a puck"
Some AM members of the Wales National Assembly are confused about a proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament – Member of the Wales Parliament).
The proposal will be designed to change the name of the national assembly to the Wales Parliament.
AM over the entire political spectrum is worried about being honored.
One AM for Labour said his group was worried because "it rumbles with Twp and Pwp".
For readers who cannot Welsh: Twp means stupid in Welsh and pwp means bajs.
One AM for Plaid said that the group in general was "satisfied" and proposed other options.
A conservative wanderer said his group is "open" to the name change, but pointed out that it was a short step from MWP to Mupp.
In this context, W is expressed in the Walesian equivalent letter U in Yorkshire.
Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation on the name change, said: "The final decision on what members of the congregation are to be called is so clear to the members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh congregation the right to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the outcome of a public consultation on the proposals, which found strong support for calling the assembly of the Wales Parliament.
The current title for AM was proposed by the Commission by Welsh Parliament Members (members of the Wales Parliament) or WMP, but MWP received the highest support in a public consultation.
Am clearly proposes other options, but problems with reaching consensus may cause problems for Presiding Officer Elin Jones, who is expected to submit draft legislation on the change within a few weeks.
The legislative framework for the amendments also includes other amendments to the work of the Assembly, including rules on the disqualification of an AM and the design of the Committee system.
AM may vote on what they are to be called when they debate legislation.
Macedonia implements a referendum on the amendment of the country's name
On Sunday, the voters shall vote if they change the name of the country to "the Republic of North Macedonia".
The referendum is an attempt to end a dispute that has been going on for decades with the neighbouring country of Greece, which has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of the neighbouring country represents a claim in its territory and has repeatedly protested against its attempts to become a member of the EU and NATO.
Macedonia's President Gjorge Ivanov opposes the referendum on the name change and has said that he will ignore the outcome.
But the supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that the name change is the price they have to pay to join the EU and NATO.
The clocks in St. Martin's silence when the churches in Harlem are in trouble
"Old people I'm talking to say that there was a bar and a church on every corner before," said Mr. Adams.
"There's neither or now."
He said it's understandable that the bars are disappearing.
"People are being surrounded in other ways now and then," he said.
"Bars are not like the living room of the area anymore, where people go on a regular basis."
He is concerned that the money from the sale of assets will not be as far as the leaders are waiting and that "before or after they are on the road again".
He also pointed out that churches can be replaced by apartment buildings filled with people who do not help the remaining churches.
"The absolute majority of people who buy apartments in the buildings will be white," he said. "This will eventually lead to the closure of all churches, because those who move into the apartments will probably not become members of the churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis – Metropolitan Community 1870, a decade later.
The original White Methodist Assembly moved out in the 1930s.
A black congregation that had a church nearby took over the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation led by pastor John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of shops on 125th Street, a shopping street in Harlem, who refused to hire or move black people.
The building was seriously damaged in a fire in 1939, but when pastor Johnson’s congregation planned the renovation, they also built the clock game.
Pastor David Johnson, father Johnson's son and successor to St. Martin's, called the proud music game "the times of the poor."
The expert who played the clock game in July had another name for it: "A cultural tax" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng from University of Michigan, also pointed out that it was the world's first watch played by a black musician – Dionisio A. Lind, who went on to the larger watch in Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Mr. Merriweather, St. Martin's didn't replace him.
The events of the last few months at St. Martin's are a complicated story with architects and entrepreneurs – some who were hired by the church's toys, others of the episcopal foundation.
The Church Assembly – the governing body of the congregation consisting of players – wrote to the Foundation in July and expressed concern that the Foundation would "try to transfer the costs" to the Church Assembly, even though the Church Assembly had not been involved when the Foundation initiated architects and entrepreneurs.
Some members of the congregation complained about a lack of transparency from the foundation.
Haj harms 13-year-olds who dive after lobsters in California
On Saturday, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy who covered for lobsters in California on the first day of the lobster season, according to officials.
The attack took place right before seven o'clock in the morning, near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told the KSWB TV in San Diego that he had dived with his friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy cry for help and packed there with a group of others to pull him out of the water.
According to Hammel, he first thought that the boy was just happy to have found a lobster, but then he realized that the boy shouted, "I've been bitten!"
"I've been bitten!"
When Hammel came to the boy, he noticed that the entire bone had been removed.
"I called everyone to get out of the water. "It's a shark in the water!" said Hammel.
The boy was flew to the Children's Hospital Council in San Diego and his condition is indicated to be critical.
It's unclear which shark it was.
The bathroomman Larry Giles told the media that a shark had seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but that it had been determined that it was not a dangerous shark.
Giles also said that the victim had trauma damage on his upper torso.
Access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami's in Ecinitas was blocked for 48 hours for investigation and security reasons.
Giles mentioned that there are over 135 sharks in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's joins Britain's beauty market
Sainsbury's takes on Boots, SuperDrug and Debenhams with similar beauty walks with beauty specialists.
As part of a significant push into the UK’s beauty market of £2.8 billion, which continues to grow despite the fall of the fashion and household market, the major beauty steps will be tested in 11 shops across the country and implemented in more shops next year if they are successful.
The investment in the beauty market is part of the quick purchase attempt to fill the boxes that were previously taken up by TV equipment, microwaves and household products.
Sainsbury's said they are going to double their beauty offer to up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Existing offers from L'Oreal, Maybellline and Burt's Bees will also get more space with selected areas, such as shops such as Boots.
The store chain also re-launchs its boutique retail brand so that most of the products are vegan – as many young customers require.
In addition, the perfume seller Fragrance Shop will test the condition in two Sainsbury's stores – the first condition opened in Croydon in southern London last week and the second will open in Selly Oak in Birmingham later this year.
Shopping online and the trend to buy less food every day in local stores means that fast shopping needs to do more to attract customers.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, has said that their stores will look more and more like a storehouse in an attempt to fight cheap stores like Aldi and Lidl with more services and products than food.
Sainsbury's has Argos stand in hundreds of stores and has also acquired a number of Habitat stand since they bought both chains two years ago, which they believe has increased the sale of food and made the acquisition more profitable.
The early attempts to give the beauty and pharmacy departments a facelift failed.
Sainsbury's tested a collaboration with Boots in the early 2000s, but the cooperation ended after a dispute about how the revenues from Boots' sales in the fast purchases would be distributed.
The new strategy will come after Sainsbury's selling its pharmacy business with 281 stores to Celesio, who owns Lloyd's Pharmacy chain, for £125 million three years ago.
They claim that Lloyds would play a role in the plan by adding an expanded range of luxury skin care products, including brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial manager, said: "We have given our beauty walks a new appearance and a new feeling to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained employees who can provide customer advice.
Our range of brands has been designed to meet all needs, and with an attractive environment in slippery places, we are now a promising destination of beauty that challenges the old way to shop."
Peter Jones' "breathing" after Holly Willoughby gets out of business at £11 million
Dragons The Star Peter Jones is "bright" that the TV performer Holly Willoughby pulls out of a deal of £11 million with his brand of life to focus on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't bother with their brand True, with leisure clothes and accessories.
Their activities have been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
This Morning representative, 37, announced his decision on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has made Dragons The Star Peter Jones furious by withdrawing from their luxurious lifestyles in the last minute – to focus on their new agreements with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones became "racing" at an exciting meeting at his business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire on Tuesday when the TV favorite admitted that her new deal – worth up to £1.5 million – meant that she no longer focused on their brand Truely, with leisure clothes and accessories.
The activity has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and is expected to double Willoughby's estimated capacity of £11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, announced that she was leaving Truely on Instagram, Jones flew to one of his holiday homes.
One source said, "Truly was clearly Holly's top priority.
It would be her long-term future for the next decades.
Her decision to withdraw shocked everyone involved.
No one could believe it happened on Tuesday, so close to the launch.
There is a stock full of goods ready to be sold in Marlow's headquarters."
Experts believe that this Morning representative's decision to withdraw could cost the company several million because of significant investments in everything from leather and light to clothing and the risk of further delays in the launch.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
Your mother Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby started True with Capp 2016 and Jones, 52, took the role as president in March.
The couple travel together and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will become brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host for "I'm a Celebrity" on ITV.
A source near Jones said last night: "We don't comment on his business."
Tufft talk "and then we fell in love"
He was ashamed that the media would criticize him for a comment that some would consider to be "invalid a president" and that he was so positive about North Korea's leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
The trumpet said in a "new voice":
"I haven't given up anything."
He said Kim wanted a second meeting after Trump celebrated their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step for North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
But the negotiations on nuclear disarmament have taken place.
More than three months after the meeting in Singapore in June, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told the leaders of the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea did not see a "responsibility" from the United States after the first collapse of North Korea.
He noted that the United States, instead, continues sanctions designed to maintain the pressure.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech to his followers.
"It's going great with North Korea," he said.
"We were on our way to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a sovereign relationship."
He said his attempt to improve Kim's relationship has had positive results – an end to rockets, free hostages and returned remains of American soldiers.
And he defended his different way of talking about the relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to act like a president, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to get into this full-packed arena, we would have about 200 people here," Trump said, pointing to the audience in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquakes destroy islands in Indonesia, hundreds of deaths
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were told that they were not needed.
Despite the fact that more than 10 per cent of the Lomboks population had lost their homes, there was no exception, which required international assistance.
"In many cases they have been very clear that they do not ask for international help, which complicates it all," said Ms. Sumbung.
The saved children gather a team to go to Palu, but it is still unclear whether foreign personnel can work there.
Mr Sutopo, spokesman of the Natural Disaster Agency, said that Indonesian officials assessed the situation in Palu in order to determine whether international organisations should be allowed to participate in the assistance work.
In view of Indonesia’s constant earthquakes, the country is still desperate to prepare for the wrath of nature.
Tsunami protection has been built in Aceh, but they are rare on other coastlines.
The absence of a soundproofing siren in Palu, despite the fact that a warning had been issued, likely contributed to the loss of life.
Even under perfect conditions, it is a challenge to travel between many islands of Indonesia.
Natural disasters complicate logistics further.
A hospital ship that has been anchored in Lombok to treat earthquakes victims is on its way to Palu, but it takes at least three days to reach the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo focused on the promises to improve Indonesia's worn infrastructure in his election campaign and has spent large sums on roads and trains.
But lack of funding has plagued Mr. Joko's administration before the next year's election.
Mr. Yoko is also pressed by persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands lost their homes when Christian and Muslim gangs fought on the streets with machetes, arrows, and other primitive weapons.
Look at: Liverpools Daniel Sturridge tweeted in the last minute against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge rescued Liverpool from a Premier League loss against Chelsea with a goal in 89 minutes in Stamford Bridge in London on Saturday.
Sturridge got a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 metres from Chelsea's goal when his team lay behind with 1-0.
He transferred the ball to the left and shot a kick at the far pole.
The attempt flew high above the target area towards the top right corner of the network.
The ball finally fell over the hope of Kepa Arrizabalagas and got online.
"I just tried to get in a position to get to the ball and players that Shaq always plays forward as much as possible, so I just tried to give myself as much time as possible," said Sturridge to LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante approaching and I didn't think so much about it, but I just threw it away."
Chelsea led with 1-0 after the first half after a target in 25 minutes from the Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The blue stripe held a pass back to Mateo Kovacic, stretched from close to the middle and sprinted to Liverpool's side.
Kovacic did a quick give-and-go at the middle field.
Then he got a sovereign kick that brought Hazard into the target area.
Hazard ran away from the defense and got the ball in the net at the far pole with a left shot past Liverpool's Alison Becker.
Liverpool fights Napoli in the champion league group stadium at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy at 3:00 p.m. on Wednesday.
Chelsea is addressed to videoton in Uefa Europa League at 3:00 p.m. on Thursday.
The number of tsunami deaths in Indonesia rises to 832
The number of deaths of earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia has risen to 832, according to the country’s disaster agency early Sunday.
Many people were reported to have been trapped in the caverns of buildings that collapsed in the earthquake of 7.5 that hit in Friday and triggered waves up to six metres, said the bureau’s spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho at a news conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was full of broken buildings.
Police arrest, 32, suspected of murder after the woman was killed
A murder trial has started after a woman's equal was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44th was found at 7:55 p.m. with a knife year on Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested suspected of murder.
The police have asked people in the area who saw or heard anything coming forward.
Criminal Inspector Brian O'Hagan said, "We're at an early stage of the investigation, but I'm asking everyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard something suspicious about contacting us.
I also ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have filmed something with a car camera to contact us because they can have information that is crucial for our investigation."
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman found lives in Birkenhead and that the body was found inside a property.
During the afternoon, friends who think they know the woman came to the place to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and the police inform the victim's nearest relatives.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to get into his apartment, but the police said no one can get in or out of the building.
He became aimless when he found out what had happened.
The residents of the building have been informed that it will take several hours before they can come back in.
A police assistant told a man that the whole area was treated as a crime scene.
A grueling woman appeared on the spot.
She says, "It's so terrible" over and over again.
At 14:00 there were two police cars inside the lockdown and another just outside.
A number of police assistants were inside the lockdown with an overview of the apartment building.
People with information are asked to send a DM to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 and enter log 247 from 30 September.
Parliament's statue of Cromwell's latest victims for the rewriting of history
A banishment would be poetically fair for his talismaning destruction of so many of England’s cultural and religious artifacts carried out by his fanatic Puritan followers.
But Cromwell Society called Mr. Crick's proposal for "gravity" and "try to write about history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was inevitable that the state of Oliver Cromwell outside the Westminster Palace would be dragged into the ongoing debate on the removal of statues."
The icono class during the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Fel Cromwell might have been offered for what his father Thomas did 100 years ago.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent representation of Cromwell shows the opinion of the 1800s and is part of the history of a man who many consider to be still to be praised.
Mr Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: "Many, perhaps more at the end of the 1800s than now, believes that Cromwell defended Parliament from pressure, in his case from the monarchy.
If this is a correct representation, it is the subject of an ongoing historical debate.
But the conflict in the middle of the 1600s has undoubtedly affected our nation's development, and Cromwell is a well-known person who represents one side of the matter.
His companies as Lord Protector also deserve to be praised and celebrated.
Killer Griss Kills Bunde
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in southwestern China, according to local media reports.
The man, only identified with his last name Yuan, was found dead with a broken artery and covered in blood in a path on the market in Liupanshui in the province of Guizhou, South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig breeder prepares to inject the vaccine in pigs in a pigsty on 30 May 2005 in Xining in the province of Qinghai, China.
He is reported to have been traveling with his cousin Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, the cousin found him dead and discovered that the door to a pig's nest was open nearby.
He said there was a big grizzard in the pig's stomach with blood on his mouth.
A legal investigation confirmed that the 250 kilos of heavy pig had killed the farm, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were bloodthirsty and twisted," said the cousin identified by the last name Wu to Guiyang Eventing News.
A surveillance camera filmed Yuan when he came to the market to feed his pigs at 4:40 p.m. on Thursday.
His body was found an hour later.
The pig who killed the farm didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig had been locked in to avoid more attacks while the police collected evidence on the spot.
The Yuan family and the marketers are reported to negotiate compensation for his death.
It's rare that pigs attack people, but it's happened before.
In 2016 a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts and seriously injured the man.
Ten years ago, a 300 - pound [300 kg] pig pressed a pawn in Wales against a tractor until his wife scared it away.
When a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012 a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs normally are not aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a "catalyst".
"They're just playful.
They're nafs and they're very curious, they don't want to hurt anyone.
You just have to show them respect," he said.
Residues of the Orkan Rosa for extensive heavy rain to the south-west USA
As expected, the hurricane will become weaker when it travels over the cooler water at the northern coast of Mexico.
But Rosa will carry the floodwaters to northern Mexico and southwestern America in the coming days.
Rosa had a wind power of up to 135 km/h, category 1, 5 EST in Sunday and was located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to travel north on Sunday.
In time, a drag begins to form over the Pacific and travel east towards the western coast of the United States. When Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula as a tropical storm on Monday it will force deep tropical moisture north into the South-West USA.
Rosa will carry up to 25 cm of rain in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then tropical moisture that interacts with the nearby grass will create a vastly strong rain in the south-western United States in the coming days.
Locally, 2.5–10 cm of rain will cause dangerous flooding, larynx and possibly earthquakes in the desert.
Deep tropical moisture will lead to 5–7.5 cm rain per hour in some places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 5-10 cm of rain is expected in some places in the South-West USA, especially in large parts of Arizona.
Sudden flooding is possible with rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the widespread tropical rain.
It is certainly not recommended that anyone go out in the desert to foot when tropical rain is expected.
Powerful rain can make canyons for shipping rivers and storms lead to strong local winds that blow around sand.
The approaching drought is, of course, locally strong rain to parts of the southern California coastline.
It is possible with a total of over a cm of rain, which can lead to clay flow and halal roads.
That would be the first rain in the area during the rainy season.
Some snowy tropical rainstorms will approach Arizona late on Sunday and early on Monday before the rain becomes more extensive later on Monday and Tuesday.
Strong rain will spread to Four Corner on Tuesday and continue on Wednesday.
October may mean intense temperature changes throughout the United States, when the Arctic is cooled down but the tropicals remain warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic temperature changes on short distances.
There is a good example of the dramatic temperature differences in Central America on Sunday.
It is almost ten degrees between Kansas City in Missouri and Omaha in Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa.
During the coming days, the remaining summer heat will try to spread again.
Large parts of Central and Eastern USA are expected to get a warm start in October with about 30 degrees from Great Plains to parts of north-east USA.
New York can get 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about five degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast suggests a great chance of warmer temperatures than the average in the Eastern USA during the first half of October.
Over 20 million people looking at Brett Kavanaugh's interview
More than 20 million looked at the Thursday's arresting testimony from Brett Kavanaugh, who was nominated to the Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of having committed sexual assaults in the 1980s, on six TV networks.
In the meantime, the political situation of death continued and the normal shipment was interrupted for the last minute of Friday’s tweet – Senator Jeff Flake’s agreement with the FBI, where they were able to investigate the charge for a week.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was absolutely sure that Kavanaugh had lost her when he was full and tried to take off her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh gave a passionate witness and said he's absolutely sure it didn't happen.
It is likely that the number of viewers in Friday was greater than the 20.4 million reported by Nielsen.
They calculated the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN; Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The number of viewers was not immediately available for other TV networks that showed the interview, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen often has trouble counting people looking from the office.
At the same time, there are as many spectators as for a football match in the final game or Oscarsgalan.
Fox News Channel, whose presenters have shown strong support for Kavanaugh's nomination, had most viewers with an average of 5.69 million during the day-long hearing, according to Nielsen.
ABC had almost 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
The interest was still high after the interview.
Flake was focused on Friday's drama.
After the Republican office issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh filmed CNN and CBS demonstrators who shouted at him when he tried to take a lift to a hearing with the Judiciary Committee on Friday morning.
He looked down on the floor for several minutes while the demonstrators shouted at him, which was shown in direct transmission by CNN.
"I'm standing right in front of you," said one woman.
Do you think he is telling the truth about the land?"
They also said, "You have power when so many women are powerless."
Flake said that his office had issued a statement and before the elevator doors were closed, he said that he would have more to say after the committee's hearing.
The TV network sent live several hours later when the Judiciary Committee voted if they were to carry on Kavanaugh's nomination to a vote with the whole Senate.
But Flake said that he was just going to do it if the FBI were to investigate the charges against the nominee in the coming week, which the minority Democrats have been calling for.
Flake was partly convinced by his friend, the democratic senator Chris Coons.
After speaking to Coons and several senators later, Flake took his decision.
Flake's decision had a major impact, as it was clear that the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "political toys" around Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union for "political games" about Britain's future and undermine the nation's interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
UK Prime Minister Theresa May arrived at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK on 29 September 2018.
In another interview next to her on the front page of the newspaper, her previous foreign minister Boris Johnson continued his attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit and said that the proposal that the UK and the EU should collect each other's customs duties was "completely unreasonable".
Shooting Wayde Sims: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson for the LSU player's death
The police have arrested a suspect for the killing of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and put in custody for murder, said the police in Baton Rouge.
The authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson and the police saying that Sims lost his glasses in the fight.
The police found the glasses on the spot and found Simpson's DNA on them, according to CBS subsidiary WAFB.
After the interview with Simpson, the police said that he recognized that he was killing Wayde.
His debt was set at $350 000, according to Advocate.
The doctor in East Baton Rouge Parish released a preliminary report on Friday, according to which the cause of death was a shooting year in the head and neck.
The police thank Louisiana State Police for the intervention of the police, the state law firm of the police, the South University police and residents in the area for the assistance of the investigation leading to the arrest.
LSU's athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the local police for their "flight and effort for justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 1,98 meters long forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played the basketball for LSU.
He had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per match last season.
On Friday morning, LSU's basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "crossed" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
"You're worried about this all the time," Wade said.
The volcano asks ash over Mexico City
Aska from the volcano Popocatepetl has reached the southern part of Mexico’s capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned on Saturday Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after the activity had been detected in the crater and the recorded 183 emissions of gas and ash over 24 hours.
The Centre discovered several women and scavengers.
Pictures on social media showed thin layers of ash on wind turbines in the areas of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicians have noted increased activity in the volcano, which is 72 km south of the capital since a 7.1 earthquake hit central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano called Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police strike with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote
Six persons were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after independence demonstrators met with the army police while thousands of people took part in rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarising vote on secession.
A group of masked separatists who were held back by the beads cast eggs and color powder on them, leading to dark dust in streets that are usually filled with tourists.
Killers also broke out later during the day and police used their batons to stop them.
For several hours the independence groups called "never forget, never forgive" while the unionists called "long live Spain".
14 persons were treated for minor damage caused by the protests, according to local press.
The vote is still tense in the region, which longs for independence one year after the referendum on the first October which was considered illegal by Madrid but was celebrated by Catalan separatists.
A vast majority voted for independence, but participation was low when most of those who opposed the section boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured in violent clashes last year when the police tried to stop the vote by countries in the region.
Self-reliance groups camped during the night on Friday to prevent a demonstration of support for the national police.
The demonstration still took place, but it was forced to take another route.
The electrician Narcis Termes, 68, took part in the separatists' protest with his wife and said that he no longer believed that Catalonia would become independent.
"We had one of our best moments last year.
I saw my parents crying with joy to be able to vote, but now we have run fast," he said.
Despite a decisive but marginal gain in regional elections in December, Catalan parties, which are for independence, have found it difficult to maintain their driving power up to this year, as many of their most well-known leaders live in self-held exile or are in wait for their role in the organisation of the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protests in support of the police on his cell phone, said that the conflict had been fuelled by politicians on both sides.
"It's getting more and more excited," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who had been in custody since the end of last year, announced that he was going to apply for the European Parliament's election next year.
"Registering the European Parliament is the best way to condemn the return of democratic values and the subjugate we have experienced from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men seize after driving a car into the house
Three men — 33, 34 and 39 — have been arrested after driving a car into a house in Londonderry repeatedly.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent, around 19:30 BST on Thursday.
Criminal Inspector Bob Blemmings said the walls and the building itself were damaged.
An armbrush may also have been fired against the car.
Add Livingston 1-0 to Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured profit
Livingstone shocked Rangers and sentenced Steven Gerrard to his second loss of 18 matches as manager of the Ibrox Club.
Dolly Menga's strike turned out to be the difference when Gary Holt's side was shared two with Hibernate.
Gerrard's side still hasn't got a win in Premiership this season and meets Hearts, with eight points more, next Sunday.
Before it welcomes Rangers Rapid Vienna in Europe League on Thursday.
Livingston is extending its winning track to six matches – Chief Coach Holt has still not experienced a loss since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston misses chances against two visitors
Holt's law should have taken the lead long before they did the goal; their justice gave Rangers all possible problems.
Scott Robinson broke through but threw his performance across the target, and then Alan Lithgow could only shoot flat after he had slipped in to measure Craig Halket's nibbling across the target.
The home team was pleased to let Rangers play in front of them, as they knew they could attack in certain games.
And that's how the decisive goal was made.
Rangers gave up a fresh park and Livingston took advantage of an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson collaborated to give Menga a chance, which made goals from the middle of the target area.
In that situation, Rangers had dominated the ball, but the defense of the home team was unbearable and the target guard Liam Kelly was largely left in peace.
The same pattern continued in the second half, but Alfredo Morelos forced a rescue from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was denied by Ranger's target guard Allan McGregor's feet and Litgow shot wide from another game of Livingstone.
Crossings were constantly entering Livingston's target area and handled without problems. Two criminal requirements – after Halket's challenge by the exchanger Glenn Middleton and one by hand – were dismissed.
"Fenomenal" by Livingston – analysis
BBC Scotlands Alaskar Lamont on Tony Macaroni Arena
The phenomenal performance and results for Livingston.
Each one was outstanding and continued to exceed expectations on the way up.
Their game style and staff have barely changed since they returned to the top level, but Holt deserves honor for having galvanized the team since its arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was outstanding and led a well-organised defense, and Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on the whole range right through.
But Rangers lacked inspiration.
They've had their moments in Gerrard, but they didn't live up to the standard.
Their last ball didn't keep it – they just opened the home page once – and it's something of a wake-up clock for Rangers, located in the middle.
Erdogan receives a mixed welcome in Cologne
On Saturday, on the afternoon and blue sky (29 September), Turkey's and Germany's leaders offered breakfast together in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany – to repair the relationship between NATO allies.
They have become isolated over human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's entry into the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population in the world outside Turkey.
The police claimed that they prevented 25 000 spectators from gathering outside the mosque for security reasons, but many supporters were gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan demonstrators – many of them Kurdish – also heard their voices and condemned both Erdogan's politicians and the German government's decision to welcome him to Germany.
The duplicating protests show the split views of a visitor who is considered to be a hero of some German Turks and condemned as a violent warrior of others.
Road accident in Deptford: Cyclists die in the hail with car
A cyclist has died in a hook with a car in London.
The Krocken took place near the intersection of Beswod Street and Evelyn Street, a well-traffic road in Deptford in southeastern London, around 10:15 BST.
The driver stopped the car and the nurse was called there, but the man died on the spot.
The crocken takes place a few months after another cyclist died in an accident at Childers Street, about 1.5 km from the crock on Saturday.
Metropolitan Police said they were trying to identify the man and inform his closest relatives.
Roads have been blocked by and buses have been redirected and drivers are surrounded by avoiding the area.
Long Lartin prison: Six guards injured in Tumult
Six prison guards have been injured in anxiety of a high-security prison for men, according to Prison Office.
The riots broke out at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 9:30 BST on Sunday and still on.
Specialized "tornadvots" have been called there to deal with the concerns, involving eight prisoners on a plane.
The guards were treated on site for minor damage to the face.
One spokesperson for Prison Service said: "The specially trained prison staff have been sent there to handle the ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members have been treated for damage.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and are clear that those behind this will be linked to the police and may receive increased prison sentences."
HMP Long Lartin accommodates over 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous offenders.
In June, it was reported that the director of the prison was treated in a hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October of last year, the guard police were called to the prison to deal with serious concerns where personnel were attacked with billiards.
The Orkanen Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flooding (dry areas can benefit)
It is rare that tropical low pressure reaches Arizona, but it is exactly what will happen at the beginning of next week when the desert of the desert of the Western United States of America, with the risk of sudden flooding.
National Weather Service has already issued alerts for sudden flooding for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona and into south and east Nevada, southern California and Utah, including the cities Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to travel directly over Phoenix on Tuesday, and bring rain late on Monday.
National Weather Service in Phoenix said in a tweet that only "twenty tropical cyclones have maintained status as a tropical storm or low pressure within 320 km from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 65 km of Arizona border".
National Hurricane Center's latest models predict 5-10 cm of rain, with isolated quantities of up to 15 cm in Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
Other parts of the desert in the south-western United States, including central Klippiga mountains and Great Basin, are likely to rain 2.5–5 cm at a risk of up to 10 cm.
In areas where there is no risk of sudden flooding, the rain of Rosa can be a blessing, as the region is affected by drought.
Floods are very serious, but some of the rain will probably be useful because the South-West United States suffers from drought.
According to U.S. Drought Monitor, over 40% of Arizona suffers from at least extreme drought, the next highest category reported weather.com.
The Orkan Rosa will first be traveling across the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, still with energy in the Sunday morning with a maximum wind power of 135 km/h, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and is travelling north for 20 km/h.
The storm blows on cooler waters in the Still Sea, which calms down it.
It is therefore expected to reach Mexico's land mass as a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
Parts of Mexico can get heavy rain, which is a significant risk of flooding.
"Total 7,5–15 cm rain is expected from Baja California to northwestern Sonora, with a risk of up to 25 cm", weather.com reported.
Rosa will then travel north across Mexico as a tropical storm and reach Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical low pressure, which will then be traveled through Arizona and into south Utah late Tuesday evening.
"The biggest danger from Rosa and its remaining energy is very strong rain in Baja California, north-west Sonora and the desert in the South-West USA," said the National Hurricane Center.
The rain is expected to lead to life-threatening sudden floods and floods in the desert, as well as earthquakes in mountainous terrain.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: Four arrests for attempted murder
Three boys in the teen years and a 20-year-old man have been arrested suspected of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with knives in Somerset.
The teenage boy was found injured in the area of Excelsior Terrace in Midsomer Norton, around 4:00 BST this Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital and the situation is reported to be "stable".
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old were arrested during the night in the Radstock area, police said in Avon and Somerset.
The police are asking anyone who might have filmed what happened to the cell phone to proceed.
Trump says that Kavanaugh "led, wickedness, hatred" from the democratic party
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the democratic party's indifference and scandalous tactics," Trump told his supporters in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh had "belonged to the evil, hatred" of the democratic party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified in front of the assembly on Thursday and refused strongly and emotionally to Christine Blasey Ford’s accusation that he had committed sexual assault on her several decades earlier when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified in front of the Congress about his accusation.
The President said on Saturday that "the American people saw the brilliant and the quality and the courage" at Kavanaugh that day.
"A voice to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is a voice to confirm one of the most effective legal meanings of our time, a lawyer with a first-class history of serving the public," he told his followers in the audience in West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to Kavanaugh's nomination when he spoke about the importance of Republicans voting in the upcoming mid-term elections.
"We are five weeks from one of the most important choices in our lives.
I'm not running, but I'm running," he said.
"That's why I go around and fight for sovereign candidates."
Trump claimed that the Democrats are trying to "stand up and stop".
The first ruling vote in the Senate on the nomination of Kavanaugh is expected to take place on Friday, according to information to the CNN from an assistant to an older Republican leader.
Hundreds of deaths in earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia, number of increases
At least 384 people died, many were drowned when giant waves crashed against the beaches, when a large earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, according to the authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had been gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday when up to six meters high waves crashed against the beach in the cloud and drowned many into a safe death and destroyed everything in its path.
Tsunamin came after an earthquake of 7.5.
"When the tsunami came yesterday, people stayed on the beach instead of running away from it immediately, and they fell victim to tsunamis," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman of the Indonesian disaster agency BNPB, at a meeting in Jakarta.
"Tsunamin was not alone, but was driving cars, stock and houses. It hit everything in its path," Nugroho said. He also said that Tsunamin had been traveling on the open sea for up to 800 km/h before the affected coastline.
Some climbed up into trees to get out of the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 facilities in Palu.
Flying photos released by the disaster agency show that many buildings and shops are destroyed, brothers are destroyed and have collapsed and a mosque is surrounded by water.
After-scave still hit the coastal town on Saturday.
The range of earthquakes was felt in an area with a population of 2.4 million.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology BPPT said in a statement that the amount of energy released in the huge earthquake on Friday was 200 times as large as the nuclear bomb released at Hiroshima in the second world war.
The city is at the end of a long, narrow bay, which may have made tsunamin larger, according to the agency.
Nugroho described the destruction as "absolute" and said that thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels have collapsed.
The dead victims were found under the ravages of collapsed buildings, he said, and 540 people were injured and 29 are missing.
Nugroho said that the victims and the injuries could be even worse along the coast line 300 km north of Palu, an area called Dongala, which is near the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communication from Dongala "was completely paralyzed without any information," Nugroho said.
"It lives over 300,000 people there," said the Red Cross in a statement, and its staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, but it can be much worse," they said.
The Agency was criticised on Saturday for not informing that Tsunamin had attacked Palu, but the authorities said that the waves had appeared within the time the warning was issued.
In an amateur video shared on social media, a man on the top of a building is heard screaming frenetic warnings about tsunamin to people on the street below.
Within a few minutes, a wall of water breaks down against the beach and sweeps out buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately authenticate the video.
The earthquake and tsunami led to a widespread power breach that interrupted all communications around Palu, which made rescue work more difficult for the authorities.
The military has begun to send your cargo flight with the help of Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, but evacuated persons are still in great need of food and other necessities.
The airport has been opened for assistance and remains closed for other traffic until October.
President Joko Widodo planned to visit facilities in Palu on Sunday.
The number of deaths in tsunamis in Indonesia exceeds 800.
It's very bad.
Co-workers from World Vision in Dongala have gone to Palu where they seek protection under appearances at the farm outside the office, but they saw pollution along the way, according to Mr. Dosebah.
"They said they saw many destroyed houses," he said.
It's very bad.
Aid groups have begun the obvious aid work, but some complained that foreign aid workers with extensive expertise were prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies and employees from abroad may only be used if an exemption permit is issued after a disaster.
This hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a regional disaster," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the authorities say it is a national disaster, we can release international aid, but that status has not yet been declared."
When the second night fell in Palu after Friday’s earthquake and tsunamis, relatives and friends of missing persons were still hoping that their loved ones would prove to be the miracles that shed light on wild natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was rescued from a bunny.
On Sunday, the rescue workers rescued a woman who had been stuck under a brawl for two days with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandano, Indonesia's national flight trainer, had trained two of the missing aircraft in front of the Asian Games, which ended in Indonesia earlier this month.
Others who were stuck at Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
"As the flight vet, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Gendon said that the hours after the displays heard that Roa Roa Hotel had collapsed, he sent whatsApp messages to the Palu participants who participated in the beach festival.
But his messages only got a grey box, instead of two blues.
"I think it means that the messages were not delivered," he said.
Thieves take $26,750 under ATM refill at Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, the thief stole $26,750 from a Brink's employee who filled a ATM at Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport police.
The driver had emptied a ATM in the entertainment facility and would deliver more money, said criminal Dennis McCarthy in the message.
While he was busy, "another man jumped up behind the Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money that would be delivered.
The witness saw several suspected flights from the scene, according to the press release, but the police did not indicate how many were involved in the incident.
All who have information about the identity of the perpetrators shall contact the police in Newport at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes name – to Ye.
He announced the name change on Twitter on Saturday and said, "The thing that is formally known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has been called Ye for a long time and used the nickname as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The name change comes before his participation in Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to launch his new album Yandhi.
He replaces the singer Ariana Grande in the program, which he introduced for "sensitive reasons" according to the program's creator.
Ye is a shortening of the current professional name of West, but he has also said that the word has a religious significance for him.
"I think 'ye' is the word most used in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'du'," said West earlier this year when he spoke about the title of his album with the radio values Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, I'm us.
It went from Kanye, which means 'the only', to just Ye – a reflection of our good, our evil, our confused, everything.
The album is like a mirror of who we are."
He's one of a number of known rappers who's changed names.
Sean Combs has previously been called Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers to be called Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who previously collaborated with the West, has previously written his name with and without string and verses.
Mexico's AMLO promises not to use the military against civilians
Mexico's newly elected President Andres Manuel Lopez Obador has promised never to use the military against civilians now that the country is approaching the 50th anniversary of a bloody revenge against students.
Lopez Obador promised at Tlatelolco Plaza on Saturday that "never used the military to oppress the Mexican people".
Troops fired weapons against a peaceful demonstration at the square on October 2, 1968 and killed up to 600 people during a era when left-wing student movements broke in Latin America.
Lopez Obador has vowed to support young Mexicans with monthly contributions to students and by opening more free public universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attract young people to criminal groups.
USA should double AI funding
Now that China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the USA should double the amount they spend on research in the field, according to the inventor and the AI user Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments will follow that several parts of the US government have made statements about AI, although the US does not have a comprehensive formal AI strategy.
China presented its plan last year with the goal of becoming the leader of AI innovation by 2030.
"It would be a good start to double the budget for AI research, given that all other countries are so far behind the United States and we are looking for the next breakthrough in AI," Lee said.
A double budget can double the chance that the next big AI is made in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview earlier this week.
Lee, whose book "AI SuperPowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was previously published in the month of Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Synovation Ventures, who has invested in one of China's most prominent AI companies – Face++.
At Carnegie Mellon University in the 1980s, he worked on an AI system that beat the top-ranked American Othello player, and later he was in charge of Microsoft Research and was CEO of Google's China Department.
Lee mentioned earlier technology competitions from the U.S. government, such as the Robot Challenge from the Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked what would be next in order to identify future visionaries.
In the United States, researchers often have to work hard to get government funding, Lee said.
"It's not China that takes the academic leaders from us, but the companies," Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have employed leading personalities from universities to work on AI.
Lee said that new immigration policies can also help the USA with the AI innovation.
"I think green cards should be offered automatically to doctoral students in AI," he said.
The State Council in China issued its development plan for next generation artificial intelligence in July 2017.
In China, the National Natural Science Foundation makes contributions to people in academic institutions like the National Science Foundation and other government organizations to distribute money to researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defence set up a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to bring together partners from industry and the academic world, and the White House announced the formation of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And earlier this month DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative they call AI Next.
NSF currently invests over $100 million a year in AI research.
American legislation that would create a National Security Commission on artificial intelligence has not made any progress in several months.
Macedonia's referendum on the name change
The people of Macedonia voted on Sunday in a referendum on the name of the country to be changed to "the Republic of North Macedonia", which would resolve a decade-old dispute with Greece that has prevented the country's attempt to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province called Macedonia and claims that its neighbour's name in the north is a requirement in its territory and has therefore prevented Macedonia from joining NATO and the EU.
The two governments concluded an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claim that the name change would undermine the identity of the Macedonian slave majority.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said that he does not intend to vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has led to doubt as to the minimum participation of 50 per cent required for the referendum to be considered valid.
The question of the ballot in the referendum is: "Are you a member of NATO and the EU with the approval of the agreement with Greece?"
However, the name changer, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claims that it is worth changing the name if it does so so that Macedonia, one of the countries formed when Yugoslavia was split, can join the EU and NATO.
"I am here to vote for the future of our country, for young people in Macedonia so that they can live free under the umbrella of the European Union, because it means safer life for all of us," said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
The referendum is not binding, but enough Members in Parliament have said that they intend to follow the outcome for it to be considered crucial.
The name change requires a majority of two thirds of Parliament.
According to the State Election Commission, no irregularities had been reported at 13.
However, participation was only 16 per cent, compared with 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66 per cent of registered voters voted.
"I vote for my children's sake, we belong to Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, who voted in Skopje's capital.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko vote in the referendum in Macedonia on the country's name change, which would open the way for membership in NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
Outside the Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, organized a small stage and set up stands in front of the tents set up by those who boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to go with our head in the air, not sneak in through the back door," Kavardarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they do not welcome us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of a Euro-Asian integration."
According to Prime Minister Zaev, NATO membership would lead to adequate investment in Macedonia, which has a unemployment of more than 20 per cent.
"I think that the absolute majority will vote yes, for over 80% of our citizens are for the EU and NATO," Zaev said when he voted.
He said that a "Yes" result would be a "confirmation of our future".
According to a survey published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Investigation, between 30 and 43 per cent of voters voted in the referendum, which falls under the minimum participation required.
According to another survey conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia, 57 per cent of participants thought to vote on Sunday.
70 percent of them were going to vote yes.
In order to count the referendum, 50 per cent of registered voters must vote.
If the referendum fails, it will be the first serious backbone of the Western-led government policy since it took over in May last year.
Look at: Manchester City Sergio Aguero takes over the entire Brighton defense to make goals
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling beat Brighton's proposal in Manchester City's victory at 2-0 at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England on Saturday.
Aguero got it to look ridiculously simple when he made goals in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker got a pass from the middle field at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran between Brighton's three defenders and went out on the open field.
Aguero was surrounded by four green trees.
He went around a defender and ran away from several others at the edge of Brighton's target area.
Then he pushed a passage to Sterling on the left.
The English advance used its first kick in the target area to give back the ball to Aguero, who used the right foot to hit Brighton's target guard Mathew Ryan with a shot at the right side of the network.
"Aguero has a problem with his feet," City's manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about him playing for 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he made a target at that moment."
But it was Sterling who gave Sky Blues the initial takeover in the Premier League campaign.
The target came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep inside of Brighton's reverberating on that game.
He sent out a nice kick along the left side of Leroy Sane.
Sane took a couple of kicks and led Sterling to the far hill.
Sky Blues pushed the ball into the net the moment before it got out of range.
City meets Hoppenheim in the team game at Champions League at Rhein-Neckar Arena in Sinsheim, Germany at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday.
Scherzer wants to play against Rockies
Nationals have been eliminated from the final game, so there was no reason to force one to begin.
But competition-oriented Scherzer wants to throw on Sunday against Colorado Rockies, but only if Rockies, who is a match before Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West, still has a chance to finish the game.
Rockies got a wild card slot with a 5-2 win over Nationals on Friday night, but is still out after its first division title.
"We play nothing, but we can get a chance to bang rubber in the knowledge of the atmosphere here in Denver with the audience and that the second team would play higher than any other team I would meet this year.
Why wouldn't I want to be there?"
Nationals have not yet announced their launch on Sunday, but according to reports, they intend to let Scherzer drop under the circumstances.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th start, heated up in the bullpen on Thursday and would throw on his normal rest day.
Washington's right-hand thrower is 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 200 2/3 in this season.
Trump is calling in West Virginia
The President referred indirectly to the situation about Brett Kavanaugh, who is nominated to the Supreme Court, when he spoke about the importance of the republican voting in the upcoming mid-term elections.
"All we've done is at stake in November.
We're five weeks from one of the most important choices in our lives.
This is one of the great, great... I'm not running, but I'm running. That's why I'm going around fighting for sovereign candidates," he said.
Trump continued: "You see a terrible, terrible group of radical democrats, you see it happening here and now.
They are determined to take back the power whatever it takes, you see their wickedness, their horror.
They don't care who they have to hurt, who they have to run over to take over power and control. That's what they want, power and control. We won't let them get it."
Democrats, he said, are fighting to "stand up and stop".
"You've seen it in the last four days," he said, and called the Democrats "arga and evil and terrible and false".
He mentioned the democratic Senator Diane Feinstein, who is in the Senate Judiciary Committee, which was met by a high wave from the spectators.
"Do you remember what she said?
"Did you close the document?"
'Eh, uh, huh?
No, no, no, I'm waiting for a... 'It was really bad body language, one of the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer a broad church.
They don't tolerate people who say what they think.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, I was hardly surprised.
After all, I'm the last one in a series of MPs from Labour to hear that we're not welcome, just because we say what we think.
My colleague in Parliament Joan Ryan was treated similarly when she stood up against anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticised for not keeping Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of a responsible economic policy, of the security of the nation, of Europe – ironically similar subjects for which Jeremy previously criticised leaders.
In the statement on the meeting with Nottingham East Labour on Friday it was said that "we want the meetings to be welcome and productive".
During most of my eight years as Labour's local MP, the GC meetings on Fridays have been just that.
But now, unfortunately, many meetings are not, and the promise of "friendlyer, more careful" politics has been forgotten long ago, if it ever started.
It has become increasingly evident that divergent views are not tolerated in Labour, and each opinion is judged on the basis that the party's leaders accept it.
This began immediately after Jeremy became a leader, when colleagues I had previously thought had a similar political view that I expected to make a full reversal and take positions that I would never otherwise have agreed on – whether it was the security of the nation or the EU's internal market.
Every time I speak publicly – and it really doesn’t matter what I say – I follow a dozen ovets on social media that require me to be postponed, criticise my policy and say that I shouldn’t even be in Labour.
And this isn't just killing me.
In fact, I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments directed at me are mostly political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of these colleagues when they are faced with a stream of seismic and racist insults every day but never give up.
One of the biggest disappointments with this policy of yours is the level of insults now considered normal.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that Labour would promote a culture of tolerance.
In reality, however, we are no longer this broad church and with every mistrusting and change in the rules of choice, the party is becoming ever more narrower.
I've been given a lot of advice over the last two years on flying under the radar and not being too straight, so "it's okay."
But that's not why I became a politician.
Ever since I joined Labour as a school student 32 years ago, provoked by the neglect of thatcher's government, which literally got my elementary school class to collapse, I have tried to fight for better public services for those who need it most – both at local level and as government ministers.
I have never hidden my political views, and that includes the last choice.
No one in Nottingham East may have been confused in some way about my opinions on policies and topics where I am not in charge of the current leadership.
To you who promoted the profession on Friday, I just want to say that when the country goes towards a Brexit that will harm households, businesses and public services, I don't understand why anyone would want to waste time and energy on my loyalty to Labour's party leaders.
But my main message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituency – both Labour members and others: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no amount of threats to postpone me or political comfort will prevent me from doing what I think is best for you all.

Ayr 38-17 Melrose: Oswalna Ayr on top
Two attempts in the last minute may have distorted the result a mind, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to triumph in this wonderful entertainment Tennent's Premiership match.
They're on top now, the only unbeatable side of the ten.
In the end, it was their superior defense, as well as their ability to take chances, which gave the home team the win, and coach Peter Murchie has every right to be satisfied.
"We have been tested under our matches so far and are still unsatisfying, so we are so clearly happy," he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said, "Ayr deserves it, they took better chances than we did."
Grant Anderson's attempt at the 14th minute, which was converted by Frazier Climo, gave Ayr the leadership but a yellow card to Captain Rory Hughes of Scotland, who was released by Warriors for the game, let Melrose speak the figures and Jason Baggot did an unconverted attempt.
Climo expanded Ayr's line with a penalty, and at the end of the first half he scored and converted a solo attempt to give Ayr a line of 17-5 in the pause.
But Melrose got a good start on the other half and Patrick Anderson's attempts, which were converted by Baggot, reduced leadership to five points.
It then became a long wait for a serious damage to Ruarihid Knott, which was struck by the plan, and after the resumption, Ayr's leadership increased again with a trial from Stafford McDowall, which was converted by Climo.
Ayr's acting captain Blair MacPherson then got a yellow card, and Melrose again forced the extra man to pay with an unconverted attempt from Bruce Colvine, at the end of a period of intense pressure.
But the home team recovered and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card to have hit Climo without the ball, McPherson made a touch down from the penalty line-out behind Ayr's maul.
Climo converted, which he did again almost immediately after restarting, after Kyle Rowe collected David Armstrong's box kick and sent the flanger Gregor Henry for the fifth attempt of the home team.
Still Game stars seem ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
Still the game star Ford Kiernan seems ready to join the restaurant industry after it has been discovered that he has been designated as the CEO of a licensed restaurant business.
The 56-year-old Jack Jarvis plays in BBC's popular series, which he writes and plays in conjunction with his long-term comedy partner Greg Hemhill.
Duon has announced that the next nine season will be the final of the series, and Kiernan seems to plan ahead of life after Craiglang.
According to official register, he is the CEO of the Agriturismo Limited.
The actor refused to comment, but a source of Scottish Sun indicated that Kiernan wanted to join the Glasgow "flowering restaurant industry".
"The Sea belongs to us": Without coast Bolivia hopes that the court will open the way to the Still Sea again
The seamen patrol a rich high-rise for the fleet in La Paz.
Public buildings have a blue flag.
The fleet's bases from the Titicacas Sea to the Amazon bear the motto: "The sea belongs to us.
It is our duty to recover it."
In the barren Bolivia, the memory of the coastline lost to Chile in a bloody resource conflict of the 1800s is still strong – and it is also the desire to sail again on the Pacific Sea.
This hope is higher than in several decades now that Bolivia is awaiting a decision by the International Court of Justice on the first October, after five years' consideration.
"Bolivia has the operation, a voice of unity and peace, and expects so clearly the result with a positive attitude," said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the decision of the International Court of Justice on large screens across the country, hoping that the Hague Court will judge in favour of Bolivia's demands that Chile, after years of irregular discussions, have to negotiate with Bolivia to allow them to have their own exit to the sea.
The decision of Monday is also important for Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatically native president who faces a controversial fight for the election next year.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will judge Bolivia’s benefit, and that it would not be much changed even if it does.
The United Nations Court of Justice, based in the Netherlands, has no right to allocate Chilean territory and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the decision is announced only six months after the final arguments indicates that the case was "not complicated", said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And the last four years may have hurt rather than promoted Bolivia's chances.
"The question of access to the sea has been tackled by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
She claims that Morale's aggressive rhetoric has touched Chile's remaining goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will soon continue the discussion, but it will be extremely difficult to do so after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Prior to this President, Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, did not consider that the court’s decision had been taken unusually quickly.
The Monday will give Bolivia "an outstanding opportunity to start a new era for the relationship with Chile" and a chance to "stop 139 years of differences of opinion with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America – used the question of the sea as a political crack.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific," he said.
"The decision is a chance to realize that we must move on from the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament requires trust in the United States
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says the nation won't destroy its nuclear weapons unless they can't trust Washington.
Ri spoke to the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to fulfil the promises made at a Singapore summit between the two rival leaders.
His comments came when US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo seems to be on the verge of solving the death situation for nuclear warshipplomatin more than three months after the meeting in Singapore with North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it's a "desirable dream" to continue sanctions and US protests against a statement that ending the Korean war will ever cover North Korea.
Washington hesitates to join the statement without Pyongyang starting major nuclear disarmament first.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a summit.
But there is widespread skepticism against the fact that Pyongyang is really going to get rid of a weapon that the country probably sees as its only chance of guaranteeing its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion displays latest line huge main floors on the way to shops near you
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or completely block the sun, we have the right thing for you.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne have revealed a range of clumsy, oversized capitals for their SS19 collection on the catwalk, which blended the stylicons on Paris fashion week.
Incredible opactical hats have taken over Instagram this summer, and the designs have sent away their striking creatures on the catwalk.
Valentino’s main creation was an excessive beige had with a birdlike board of hats that completely took over the heads of the models.
Other oversized accessories included jewelwashed watermelons, a trolley shell and even a pineapple – but they are not intended to keep their head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of birch masks, in a good time for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had mixed lips and resembled Hannibal Lecter rather than haute couture.
One creature resembled a wet cloth with snorkel and thick mask, and another looked like a narrow glass layer.
And if you keep going, you're lucky.
Fashion experts predict that the huge hats can be on the way to shops near you.
The oversized hats come immediately after La Bomba – the helmet hat with a 60 cm strap that has been seen on all from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cold brand behind the incredibly aggressive hat that has taken over social media sent out another great creation on the catwalk – a helmet beach bag that was almost as big as the model in the bath suit that held it.
The Raffia bag in the terracotta, with Raffia francs and a white leather handle, was excellent in Jacquemus La Riviera SS19 collection on Paris fashion week.
The famousist Luke Armitage said to FEMAIL: "I expect to see large hats and beach bags in the shops next summer – the designer has had such an impact that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for oversized accessories."
John Edward: Language skills for global citizens
Scotland's independent schools maintain outstanding academic results and this continued in 2018 with another set of outstanding test results, only strengthened by individual and collective progress in sport, art, music and other social aspects.
With up to 30 000 students in Scotland, the schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), aim to provide the best possible service for their students and parents.
Independent schools strive to prepare their students for further education, their chosen career and their role as global citizens.
As a education sector that can design and implement adapted learning plans, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and demanding subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands it goes to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it will go to his heart."
It is a powerful reminder that we cannot trust only in English when we create relationships and trust with people from other countries.
This year's test results show that the language is the highest in the list, with a maximum number of approved results in independent schools.
A total of 68 per cent of students who studied foreign languages received A in the final test Higher Grade.
Data collected from SCIS 74 member schools showed that 72 per cent of students who studied Mandarin received an A in Higher Grade, and 72 per cent of those who studied German, 69 per cent of those who studied French and 63 per cent of those who studied Spanish also received an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as key skills such as children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Language as a matter of course is now considered to be as important as natural knowledge, technology, engineering and mathematics on learning plans in independent schools and beyond.
A survey carried out by the UK Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 found that employers for various reasons had difficulty filling their vacancies, with 17 per cent attributed to a lack of language skills.
In this way, language skills become increasingly necessary to prepare young people for their future careers.
With more and more future jobs requiring language skills, these skills are needed in a globalised world.
Regardless of their career choice, they will have a real advantage in the future if they have learned a different language.
To communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives a multilingual person a competitive advantage.
According to a survey of more than 4,000 adult British published by YouGov 2013, 75 per cent replied that they could not speak a foreign language well enough to keep a conversation in it, and where French was the only language that totaled in a two-digit percentage (15 per cent).
Therefore, it is so important to invest in language teaching for our children.
To speak several languages, especially those used in developing countries, gives your child a better chance of finding meaningful employment in the future.
In Scotland, each school will learn different combinations of languages.
A number of schools will focus on more classic modern languages, while others will teach in languages that are considered to be most important for the United Kingdom by 2020, for example Chinese or Japanese.
Regardless of the interests of your children, there will always be a number of languages to choose from among school-leaving teachers who are specialists in this field.
Scottish independent schools strive to provide a learning environment that will prepare children and provide them with the skills required to succeed, no matter what the future holds.
In a global economic environment, there is no doubt that languages continue to be crucial for the future of the country, so it must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be considered as "international communication capacity".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence for Scotland's youth.
It's a good thing to do.
John Edward is head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron makes Lakers debut on Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans looking forward to seeing LeBron James do the debut for Los Angeles Lakers.
Laker's coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play on Sunday's first season match against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how many minutes he plays has not yet been determined.
"It will be more than one and less than 48," said Walton on Laker's official website.
Laker's reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for Lakers" pre-season scheme.
"I don't need puzzle games at this stage of my career to get ready," he said.
Trumps West Virginia campaign, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is making his first campaign event tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is Trump's first of five planned performances next week, including events in places he has great support, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
In anticipation of a confirmatory vote by its candidate for the Supreme Court's release, Trump aims to build support for the upcoming mid-year elections, as the Republicans are at risk of losing control of the congress before the current elections in November.
What time is Trumps West Virginia rally tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trumps Wheeling, West Virginia campaign events are scheduled until 19:00, tonight Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trumps West Virginia-rally online below via live stream on YouTube.
Trump will probably deal with this week's hearing by the candidate to the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh, who was charged with his sexual assault, with an expected delay in the vote from the Senate for up to a week while the FBI's investigation of the case is under way.
But the primary purpose of these events is to help the Republicans get some meat on their legs before the November elections.
So President Trump said that these five meetings next week are intended to "engage volunteers and supporters where the Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority of the Senate and the House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
"Congress control is so important for his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible when we enter the hectic campaign period," said one speaker for the Trump campaign that would not be named to Reuters.
The night event, scheduled at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, can take fans from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and draw attention from Pittsburgh's media", according to West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday the second time during the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state where he won with more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican latent date for West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who has been looking for the opinion polls.
"It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come there to try to give him an increase in the polls," says Simon Haeder, a statesman at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA is fighting to keep the hopes of living in front of Sunday's singles
After three one-sided sessions, the parties could have been what was required for this Ryder Cup on Saturday afternoon.
The moment's turning pendulum is a completely invented sport concept, but something that players really believe in, and more than ever before in competitions like these.
So what time is this about now?
"They had a six-point line and now it's four, so we carry it as a little moment I guess," said Jordan Spieth when he finished for the day.
Europe has the advantage of, of course, four points in advance with twelve more to win.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel that they have some wind in the sail, but they have a lot to encourage, not least in the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and came home three points of four each.
Speeth has been washed from tea to green and preceded by good example.
The wintrop stepped higher when his round continued and he lowered a decisive pit to take the game four all-squares when he and Thomas had laid after with two after two games.
His putt that won them the match of 15 is met with a similar wreath, with conviction that the American team is not yet out of the game.
"You really have to dig deep and worry about your own match," Spieth said.
It's all that all these players have left now.
18 holes to win.
The only players with more points than Speeth and Thomas during the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, Ryder Cups' unmistakable story.
Europe's exodus but mating couples are four from four and now nothing can go wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't make a bogey on Saturday afternoon and they also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back nine on Friday morning.
These performances and public reactions confirm that they are the players to strike on Sunday and there are no more popular players who could come home a potential European victory when the sun goes down over Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Predisposed both, at the same time at different holes.
However, it is too early to talk about European victories.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made the process short with Sergio Garcia, the morning's four-ball hero, along with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on front nine dropped the Spaniards and the Swedish in a hole they never even came close to crawling out.
On Sunday, however, no one will help you out of the hole.
Fireball and foursome are so fascinating to watch closely because of the interaction between the couple, the advice they give, the advice they do not give and how a strategy can be changed at a moment.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has taken a significant lead over the last day, but this foursome session has also shown that Team USA has a struggle that some, especially on the US side, had doubted.
Europe takes the lead with 10-6 in Ryder Cup last day
Europe will have a strong advantage on Ryder Cups the last day after coming out of Saturday's fireworks and foursomes match a 10-6-lead across the United States.
The inspired duon Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led two victories over a well-known Tiger Woods and came home all four points at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European law, which fought to preserve the pocal that they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an American law that never really began during the morning's football with 3-1.
The United States offered more resistance in the foursome and won two matches, but it was not enough to win.
Jim Fury's team needs eight points from Sunday's 12 single match to keep the bag.
Fleetwood is the first European beginner to win four points in a row while he and Molinari, baptized to "Molliwood", after a sensational weekend, is only the second pair to win four points from their first four matches in Ryder Cup's history.
After crossing Woods and Patrick Reed in a fireball, they beat an exhausted Woods and American smoke Bryson Dechambeau with an even more impressive 5 & 4.
Woods, who went through two matches on Saturday, showed a sample of unique moments of brilliants, but now he has lost 19 of his 29 matches in fourballs and foursomes, and seven of them in row.
Justin Rose, took a nap during the morning and returned to partner Henrik Stenson in foursomes to a 2 & 1 victory over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koopka - ranked one and three in the world.
Europe did not have the whole way, but it was a pleasant, blasphemous day in the south-west of Paris.
Three-fold winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the target for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They came home victorious with 2 & 1 over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in a fireball and returned later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 & 3 in a foursome after losing the two opening holes.
Only two times in Ryder Cups history a team has come back from a base on four points in single games, however, Fury's side only needs an unprecedented result to keep the pokal.
After having been the next best for two days, it looks like a counterattack on Sunday can be difficult to get through.
North Korea says that the "never" will disarm unilaterally without confidence
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea told the United Nations on Saturday to continue sanctions further deepened their opposition to the United States and it was not possible for the country to surrender its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Organisation's annual General Assembly that in recent years, North Korea had taken "significant steps to show its goodwill", for example by stopping nuclear and missile testing, disassembling nuclear testing facilities, and by promising not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"But we don't see any corresponding response from the United States," he said.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances there is no chance that we will unarm ourselves alone first."
While Ri repeated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's resistance to a approach divided into stages of the nuclear power that would lead to North Korea being rewarded when it took progressive steps, his statement seemed significant, as it did not reject a unilateral nuclear solution entirely like Pyongyang previously done.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between a President-in-Office of the United States and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, where Kim promised to work against "the disarmament of nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea has sought a formal end in the Korean War 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first unload its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also given no thanks to negotiations to facilitate severe international sanctions against North Korea.
"The US insists on "decoupling first" and increases the pressure through sanctions to achieve its purpose by force and even against the "declaration of ending the war", says Ri.
"The idea that sanctions can get us on our knees is a dream for people who lack knowledge of us.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions deepen our mistrust."
Ri did not mention plans at a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leaders highlighted earlier in the United Nations during the week.
Instead, the Minister pointed out at three meetings between Kim and South Korea's leader Moon Jae over the past five months and allowed: "If the party on this issue of nuclear disarmament was South Korea and not the United States, the Korean semi-military would not have come to such a state of death."
Nevertheless, the tone in Ri's speech was dramaticly different than last year when he told the UN General Assembly that North Korea's future ability to reach the US's mainland with rockets was inevitable after "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim a "racetman" on a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, who promised to "completely destroy" North Korea, commended Kim for his courage to take action for disarmament, but said that much work remains and that sanctions must remain until North Korea is disarmed.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time for this and said that "if it takes two years, three years or five months", it doesn't matter".
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that: "The maintenance of the Security Council's sanctions must continue with force and without fail until we realize a complete, final, verified disarmament."
The Security Council has unanimously strengthened sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to undermine the financing of the Pyongyang nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met Ri in conjunction with the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said that progress had been made, but North Korea accused him a few hours later of putting "ghast demands".
North Korea promised a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle a missile plant and also a nuclear complex if the United States took "consistent measures".
He said Kim had told him that the "consistent measures" he was seeking were security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and was moving towards normalization of relations with Washington.
Hardship students take the course to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has been given to all doctoral students to improve their sleep habits in an attempt to combat the growing macho culture to study through caffeine-filled "divings".
An academic study found that students at the world’s leading university are often unconscious about the very basics of how to deal with themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he considers to be the first in his battle in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after discussing the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
At the end of the day a girl came up to me and said, "Why shouldn't I know this until now, in my last year?"
She said that no one had ever told her about the weight of sleep - which surprised me, he told The Telegraph.
The course, which was organised for the first time this year, explains to students the importance of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance and improve their general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health care services, said that the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students suffered serious sleep deprivation during the week.
The hourly course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In part of the course there is a picture of a student's room, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, trainers and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, how athletic performance is affected by sleeplessness and the weight of good sleep habits.
In another part, participants may know how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
A map of campus, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that it will not change the behavior of students directly.
But we think they have the right to know - just as you have the right to know the health effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes," Professor Czeisler said.
The credibility culture in that there is still "dignity", he says and allows modern technology and constant increasing pressure on students to mean that sleep deprivation was a growing problem.
To ensure that you have enough sleep, of good quality, should be the student's "secret weapon" to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said - also to avoid weight gain because insomnia puts the brain in a state of hunger and makes them hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student of chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to design the course and has read one of his courses last year in his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course was an eye-opener and inspired him to campaign for a campus course.
He hopes that the next step is to ask all doctoral students to complete a similar study program before they begin their studies at the institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that the students consider putting an alarm for when to lay down and when to wake up and be aware of the harmful effects of "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which may cause you to turn on the day, leading to insomnia problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: My goals are lowering Gerard's men
Rangers led another loss today when Dolly Menga's strike sent Steven Gerrard's uneven side to a 1-0 defeat in Livingston.
The Ibrox side was out after taking home its first victory on the road since February 4-1 triumph at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's law delivered Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as manager to leave his law eight points after Ladbroke's Premiership leader Harts.
A lot of hits to seven minutes before half-time and Rangers never evened out the result.
While Rangers now falls to the sixth place, Livingston climbs to the third and is just behind the Hibernian on the target.
And there may be more problems on rangers after lineman Calum Spence had to be treated for a year after an object was thrown from the far end.
Gerrard made eight changes in the semifinal of Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Livi 11 went with the same point of Heart last week, and he would have been happy about the way in which his murdering game overcomes the opponents every time.
Rangers must have dominated, but Livingstone did more with the ball control they had.
It should have been a goal already two minutes in the game when Menga's first pass released Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's goal, but the middleman lost his big chance and shot outside.
A fresh park at the depth of Keaghan Jacobs then reached the captain Craig Halket, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow only reached the back column.
Rangers took control of the game, but it seemed to be more hope than faith in their games during the last third of the game.
Alfredo Morelo certainly felt that he should have had a punishment when he and Steven Lawless were colledging, but Judge Steven Thomson fancied the Colombian invitation.
Rangers only managed to achieve two goals in the first half, but the former Ibrox target guard Liam Kelly took easy against Lassana Coulibalys Nick and a tam spatter from Ovie Ejaria.
Livis' opening shot in the 34th minute must go against the spirit of the game, but no one can deny that their genius deserved it.
Once again, Rangers failed to manage Jacob's situation.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher went to Scott Robinson, who remained calm and chose Menga for a simple conclusion.
Gerard acted at the break when he switched Coulibaly to Ryan Kent and the switch gave almost immediate effect when the outside hit the ball to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly jumped from his line to block the attempt.
But Livingstone continued to get the opponents to play exactly the type of game they like, with Lithgow and Halket who swung up a long pass after a long pass.
Holt's side could have strengthened his lead in the last step, but McGregor managed to prevent Jacob's before Lithgow went out after the corner.
Rangers' replacement Glenn Middleton had another late penalty claim when he met with Jacobs, but he looked back at Thomson.
Almanac: Founder of Geiger Counter
And now a page from Sunday's almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today ... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the manicure called Geiger Meters.
Geiger meters have become a foundation for science since then and also represents great in pop culture, as in the 1950s "Bells of Coronado", with the main role in them seems to be unparalleled cowboy researchers Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
MAN, "What in the whole world is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger meter, used to locate radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put on these hearing aids, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms emitted by the radioactivity in the minerals. "Evans:
Evans: "Yes, it's popping now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, only a few days before his 63th birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune defense that "see" cancer cells
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune defense to "see" cancer cells and kill them
Vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells as part of treatment
The method is to extract the immune cells from a patient and modify them in the laboratory.
They can then "see" a protein that is common to many forms of cancer and then reinjected
A test vaccine shows promising results in patients with different cancer forms.
A woman treated with the vaccine, who learned the immune system to know cancer again, saw her ovary cancer cells disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein that is common to many forms of cancer called HER2 and then reinjecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "promots the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovaries, lung and thick intestine cancers," explained Prof. Berzofsky.
A similar method of taking immune cells from patients and "learning" them how to address cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West supported Trump by wearing a MAGA hat, after his SNL performance.
It didn't go so well
Kanye West was expelled from the studio during Saturday Night Live after a stunning performance where he praised US President Donald Trump and said he himself would run for the post 2020.
After performing his third song for the evening, called Ghost Town, where he had on himself a Make America Great-Keps, he slowed down against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
So many times when I'm talking to a white person, they say, "How do you like Trump, he's racist?"
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have moved from America a long time ago, he said.
SNL started the show with a sketch with Matt Damon where the Hollywood star made a joke about Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate's legal committee on the charges of sexual assaults committed by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not sent, the recording of the West's exhibition was uploaded on social media by the comicist Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock tried to drive with West with the post.
West had also complained to the public that he had been harassed for his master's estate.
"They mobbed me backstage.
They said, "Don't go out there with that hat on."
They raped me!
And then they say I fell low," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to go down too?" and said that he would "put my supermancape on, because that means you can't tell me what to do.
Test with love."
His comments attracted more desks at least twice from the audience and employees from SNL appeared to be generated, reported Variety. One person said: "It became the death button in the studio."
West had come in as a late replacement for the singer Ariana Grande, whose previous boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller had died a few days ago.
West broke many with its appearance of the song I Love it, dressed in a Perrier bottle.
West received support from the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest souls: TACT FOR YOU TO BE KEEP ON YOUR MOBBEN."
But the host of the chat show, Karen Hunter, tweeted that the West simply "was himself and it's absolutely wonderful."
"But I chose not to reward anyone (by buying his music or clothing or supporting his "art") who I think embraces and spreads an ideology that is harmful to my society.
He's free.
We're with her, let her.
Before the show, the rapper on Twitter announced that he had changed his name and said that he was now "the former known as Kanye West".
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow in Diddy's footsteps, even known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The Rappar collegar, Snoop Dogg has called himself Snoop Lion and, of course, the lost musical legend Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then to the artist who was previously known as Prince.
Dom for attempted murder by knife cutting at restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been accused of attempted murder after a man was cut off at a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The event happened in Ballyhackamore, the police said.
The hearing is expected to be held at Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday.
The prosecutions will be examined by the Prosecutor's Office.
Game of Thrones Star Kit Harington beats to toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his sword-fighting role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, has spoken negatively about the stereotype of the macho helmet and says that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel that they have to be tough to respect.
In a statement to Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed that "something has gone wrong" and questioned how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity under the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his co-sponsor in Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, even she 31, admitted that he felt "strongly strong" to deal with the problem.
"I personally feel pretty strong, right now--where have we gone wrong with masculinity?" he said.
"How have we raised men with regard to the problems we see now?"
Kit thinks that TV may be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to its very masculinity characteristics.
He continued, "What is innate and what is learned?
What is taught on TV and on the streets, which makes young boys feel they have to be in a certain way to be a man?
I think it really is one of the big issues of our time - how do we change it?
It is clear that something has gone wrong for young men."
In the interview he also acknowledged that he would not make any Game of Thrones followers when the series comes to an end next summer and says that he is "clear with battlefields and horses".
From November Kit will play in a new recording of Sam Shepards True West, which is the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that he felt that the meeting with his wife Rose was the best experience of Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife thanks to the series, so she gave me my future family and my future life," he said.
Rose played Ygritte, as Kit's character Jon Snow in love, in Emmy's winning fantasy series.
In June 2018, the couple married Leslie's family owners in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has reported an increase of 14 % of the population living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people have been killed in the country, says the health authorities.
About 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the new cases were transferred through sex and marked a change from previous years.
Traditionally, HIV is rapidly spread through certain parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way had been reduced to almost zero, the Chinese health authorities said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 from year to year.
HIV infection is an acute issue in the Chinese HBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination by HBT people is said to be widespread.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will marry women sooner or later.
Many of the infections are due to insufficient protection in conjunction with these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese Government has promised universal access to HIV medicine as part of its efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters refuses staff to miss the tasks of the GOP senator, signs on "dangerous liars" and "conspiration theories"
U.S. Congressman Maxine Waters condemned on Saturday the claim that one of her employees had posted personal data to three republican American senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that these claims were spread by right-wing extremistic websites.
"Losts, lies and more disgusting lies," said Waters in a Twitter statement.
The released information included addresses and telephone numbers of Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
Information appeared online on Thursday, posted by an unknown person at Capitol Hill during a Senate panel questioning the charges of sexual assault against the nominated candidate to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came sometime after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites like Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the post was associated with the Waters office and released the information about a member of Waters staff, reported Hill.
"This baseless claim is completely false and an absolute lie," the Waters continued.
"My staff - whose identity, personal data and security are threatened by these misleading and false claims - were in no way responsible for the leaking of this information.
This unsubstantiated claim is completely false and an absolute lie."
Water's statement was quickly criticized online, including from the former press secretary Ari Flescher.
"This negotiator is angry," Fleischer wrote.
"This indicates that she does not have the temper to be a member of the Congress.
When accused of something they did not do, they must not be angry.
They mustn't be proud.
They must not question the motives of the defendant.
They must be calm and sensed."
Fleischer seemed to try to compare Water's reaction to the democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who critics accused of having seemed angry during Thursday's interrogations.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who applied to postpone Waters in the middle of the term of office, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"The place of truth," he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said that her office had warned "appropriate authorities and criminal beings for these misleading demands.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators will be revealed," she continued "and that they will be held legally responsible for all their acts that are destructive and dangerous to all my employees."
Review by Johnny English Strikes Again - Powerless Spy Parade by Rowan Atkinson
It is now traditional to look for Brexit meanings in every new British film, and the same works for this new recording of the latest Johnny English action comedin - a series of spy parodys that were launched in early 2003 with Johnny English and received new life 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will we be aware of how clearly bad we are to become the nation's new export goods?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English with the rubber face has been given his license to make a new customer for the second time - his name signals more than anything that he is a broad comic creation intended for biopublic even in non-English-speaking countries
He is, of course, the clever secret agent, who has received a little bit of Clouseau, Mr. Bean and a measure of the guy from the opening ceremony to the OS in London 2012.
He is also originally based on the traveler and the international mysterious man who Atkinson once played in the now forgotten Barclaycard TV ads that create chaos wherever he goes.
There's one or two nice moments in the latest JE film
I loved it when Johnny English approached a helicopter dressed in a medieval armor and when the rotor blade struck his helmet for a short time.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is shown, but humor feels rather low and strangely overwhelming, especially because they are the "serious" film brands such as 007 and Mission Neus itself now offer comedy as an ingredient.
Humour feels as if it is adapted for children instead of adults and for me Johnny English is not as curious as the invention rich and focused as Atkinson's silent film bravades in the role of Bean.
The permanent subject is now that the United Kingdom is in serious problems.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated the UK's super-secret web network of spies, revealing the identities of all UK agents out in the field, to the agent of great dissatisfaction - an extremely small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last line for a Prime Minister who is a Pompeii and hard-working figure, who already suffers from a complete collapse of his political popularity: Emma Thompson does his best with this quasi-Teresa-May character, but the manuscript does not offer much to work with.
Her informant informs her that when each individual active spy is busy, she must use someone who retired.
And that means the native Johnny English in his own high person, now employed as a teacher in a well-known institution, but offering unofficial lessons in art to work undercover next to it.
English was sent back to Whitehall for an acute meeting and reunited with his former long-lived sidekick Bough, again played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a boutique, a jolly-hockey-sticks roll where Vicki Pepperdine is close to the city.
So Batman and Robin are back after everything went so terriblely wrong on Her Majesty's Secret Service and kicking on Olga Kurylenko's beautiful woman fatal Ophelia Bulletova.
In the meantime, the Prime Minister will fall hard for the charismatic tech-military, who claims that he can solve the UK's computer puzzle: the unfortunate Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their odyssé of farts: dressed in servants, they put fire on a flashy French restaurant; they create chaos when they dive on Volta's luxury boat; and English triggers clean anarchy when he tries to use a VR headset to meet the inside of Volta's house.
There's probably a lot of work behind the last sequence, but although the film is both charming and fast-filled, it has an air of children's TV around it.
Pretty much everything like everything.
And like the other Johnny English films, I can't let myself think: Can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that matches his talent?
Labour refuses to draw up a plan for British workers to work a four-day week but get paid for five days
Jeremy Corby's part of the Labour Party is considering a radical plan that appears to be working for the British for a four-day week - but gets paid for five.
According to the party, corporate leaders want to leave savings made by the revolution in artificial intelligence (AI) to workers by giving them an extra day off.
It would see employees enjoying a three-day weekend - but keep the same pay.
According to sources, the idea would "pass" with the party's financial agenda for the benefit of the workers.
Switching to a four-day week has been approved by trade union Congress as a way for workers to benefit from economic change.
A higher representative in Labor said to The Sunday Times: A review of the policy is expected to be published before the end of the year.
"It will not happen in one day, but a four-day working week is an effort that fits the party's attitude to balance the economy for the benefit of the worker and the party's overall industrial strategy."
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, even the party The Greens who promised a four-day work week during its 2017 election campaign.
However, this goal is not marked by Labour as a whole.
One spokesman for Labour said: "A four-day work week is not the party's policy and it's nothing the party agrees about."
The shadow cans John McDonnell used last week's Labour Conference to communicate his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said that he was determined to withdraw the power from "unfaced leaders" and "strangers" on state companies.
The plans of the shadow cankers also mean that the current shareholders of the water companies cannot regain their full efforts, as a Labour government can make 'deduct' because of what they believe has been wrong.
He also confirmed plans to place employees in corporate boards and create so-called Inclusive Ownership Funds, where 10% of the private company's own capital is transferred to its employees, which then has annual distributions of up to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell in the TV program "60 minutes" whether the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh could change their views
The FBI's investigation of complaints against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court with at least one week and raises the question of whether the Agency's investigations could allow some Republican senators to change their position.
In an interview sent on Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked the Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could reveal something that would lead to their change of opinion.
Kennedy seemed more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Of course," said Kennedy.
"I said when I went to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, that the claim came out, and he said, "Have you done it?"
He was determined, convinced, uncertain."
Graham's voice, however, seems unbearable.
"I've already decided on Brett Kavanaugh and it would take a dynamism statement," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it," Graham admitted, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And all her names couldn't verify it.
It was 36 years ago.
I don't see anything new changing."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that has an enormously impressive composition of stars that perform and an equally impressive mission; to combat world poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people going to Central Parks Great Lawn, not only to enjoy artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to increase awareness of the real goal of the event: to fight extreme poverty before 2030.
Global Citizen Festival is, according to a 2012 statement, an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international pre-accession group that hopes to be able to combat poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (if you were not ready to pay for a VIP ticket), the concert guests would perform a series of tasks, or "actions" such as volunteering, e-mailing a world leader, calling or other meaningfully contributing to raising awareness about the goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been for 12 years to achieve its goal?
Is it the idea to reward people with a free concert a genuine way to convince people to act, or is it just about so-called "clickivism" people who feel they make a real difference by signing an online application or writing a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has reported that more than 19 million "documents" have been registered from its supporters who have fought for a number of different goals.
It is said that these measures have helped to spur world leaders to announce commitments and policies corresponding to more than $37 billion, which will affect lives for more than 2.25 billion people in 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the Group quoted 390 commitments and announcements arising from its actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid out or financed.
The group estimates that the resources collected so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the most important commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a partnership based in the United Kingdom between investors and actors who are committed to "helping children to develop their full potential", promising to give Rwanda $35 million to help fight poverty in the area after having received more than 4,700 tweets from global citizens.
"With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and global citizens, just as you are, we can make social injustices as undernourished as a footnote in history," said Ambassador of the Tracey Ullman Partnership to the crowd during a live-on in London in April 2018.
The group also said that, following more than 5000 measures, which require the United Kingdom to improve the cost of mothers and children, the government announced financing of the project, Power of Nutrition, which includes food programmes aimed at 5 million women and children.
In response to one of the common questions on your website, "What makes you think we can fight extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen replied: "It will be a long and difficult way - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are some of the artists who perform at the event of the year in New York, whose host is Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use its fleet in a "blocked" to prevent Russian energy exports indicated by the Minister of the Interior
The government can "if necessary" seize its fleet to prevent Russian energy operators from entering the markets, including in the Middle East, has revealed US Interior Minister Ryan Zinke, quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia's commitment to Syria - particularly where it operates at the invitation of the legitimate government - is a prerequisite for exploring new energy markets.
"I think they are in the Middle East because they want to sell energy, just as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern parts of Europe," he said.
And according to him, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The US has the ability, with our fleet, to ensure that the waterways are kept open and, if necessary, to apply blocked, to ensure that their energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke spoke to participants in the event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance, an ideal group called "the voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approach to managing Russia and Iran, and noted that they are really the same.
"The economic alternative to Iran and Russia is to exploit and exchange fuel," he said, while referring to Russia as a "day country" with an economy dependent on fossil fuel.
Statements will follow that the Trump administration has aimed at increasing the export of its liquid natural gas to Europe, to replace Russia, the far cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump's officials, including President Donald Trump of the United States, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "unappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which according to Trump made Berlin a "capture".
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North Stream 2 pipeline of $11 billion, which will double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
They claim that Washington’s opposition to the project is driven only for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we share the idea that energy cannot be a tool to exert pressure and that consumers will be able to choose suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position was replaced by Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industry organisation, Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I strongly deny that a third party is disrupting our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a meeting between Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russia's President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will take a "ordinary thinker" if she sets up in the 2020 presidential election," says Massachusetts Senator
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said on Saturday that she would take a "ordinary thinker" about her participation in the presidential election after the U.S. mid-year election.
At a meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider putting up as a candidate.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our dirty government and it includes a woman at the top," she said, according to The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will take a lot of thinkers to run for the President's post."
Warren turned to President Donald Trump at the council meeting and said that he "took this country in the wrong direction.
"I'm deeply concerned about what Donald Trump does for our democracy," she said.
Warren has been free in his criticism of Trump and his candidate to the Supreme Court, Kavanaugh.
On Friday's tweet, Warren said, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote."
However, a vote released on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's own supporters did not believe that she would be the candidate for 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of "trustful" Massachusetts voters said that the senator should not run, according to a survey conducted by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two per cent supported the candidacy.
The survey showed more support for a candidacy of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 per cent for a potential candidacy and 48 per cent against.
Other highly-profiled democratic names discussed with regard to a potential 2020 candidacy include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would decide officially in January, reported Associated Press.
Sarah Palin quotes Track Palins PTSD at Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after taking over in September.
He was arrested and accused of violence at home on Monday night.
"What my own son goes through, what he's going through now when he's back, I can relate to other families that have experience of PTSD and some of the trauma our soldiers return with," she told the audience at a gathering meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arresting "the elephant in the room" and said about his son and other war veterans that "they will return as other people, they will return hard, they will return and wonder if there is respect for what their colleagues, soldiers and pilots and all other members of the military have given the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and accused of domestic violence against a woman, trying to prevent a report on domestic violence and possession of weapons in a guilty state, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, as well as District of Columbia support the question of a new asylum policy
Arton states and District of Columbia support a legal test aimed at a new American policy that denies asylum to victims who flee from gang-related violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and the district submitted a friend-of-the-court application on Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker challenging the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the cores of the Grace v. Sessions case submitted by the American Civil Liberties Union in August has not been disclosed.
She said that her partner "and his violent gang members," abused her, but American officials refused her asylum application on 20 July.
She was imprisoned in Texas.
State lawyers who support Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, countries that produce a large number of asylum seekers, such as nations that face major problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy amended a 2014 decision by the immigration authorities which enabled illegal immigrants to seek asylum to flee from domestic violence.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law."
"The Federal Law requires that all applications for asylum be assessed on the basis of specific facts and circumstances of the claim and that such a provision is contrary to that principle", according to the Friend-of-the court report.
Advocates further argued in the report that the policies that deny immigrants' entry harm the US economy, and argue that they are more inclined to become entrepreneurs and "deliver necessary labour".
Justice Minister Jeff Sessions ordered judges in June in case of asylum to no longer grant asylum to victims of domestic violence and gang violence.
"Asyl is available to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political opinion," the Sessions said when the policy was announced on 11 June.
Asylum was never meant to alleviate all the problems - even all the serious problems - that people face every day throughout the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu when the number of deaths doubled in the search for survivors
For the survivors, the situation looked more and more disillusioned.
"It feels very excited," said the 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, who comforted her feverish boy in an evacuation center in the city of Palu.
"The Ambulance brings dead bodies all the time.
Pure water is a missing product."
The inhabitants were seen returning to their ruined homes, rotting through damaged properties and trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, which were damaged in the earthquake of 7.5 were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who were affected by a broken back and shoulder, were wandering outside the hospital Palu's Army Hospital, where the patients were treated outdoors due to continued severe post-mortem.
With tears filled, he told us that the violent earthquake shook the room on the fifth floor of the hotel, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
"We won't let him go.
I was pushed into the ruins of the wall, I think," Haris told the Associated Press and allowed his family to be in the city for a wedding.
"I heard my wife screaming for help, and then it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they're safe."
US Ambassador accuses China of "mobbing" with "propaganda ads"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a quarterly newspaper in an American newspaper on the mutual benefits of trade between the US and China, the US ambassador accused China of using the US press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump referred to last Wednesday that China Daily paid a supplement in Des Moines Register - the state of Iowa's best selling newspaper - after accusing China of trying to participate in the 6th US Congress election, something China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing tried to interfere in American elections marked what American officials told Reuters where a new phase in a escalating campaign from Washington was to put pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to use advertising to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in a escalating trade war with high rates of each other's imports.
China’s recovery rates were designed early in the trade war to kill exporters in countries such as Iowa, which support Trump’s Republican Party, according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, US Ambassador to China and the former long-term governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said that Beijing had damaged American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in a debate article on Sunday's Des Moines Register, "now doubles the mob by posting propaganda ads in our own free press."
"The Chinese government uses American loving tradition of freedom of opinion and a free press to spread the propaganda by publishing paid advertisements in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, in the newspaper room on the street here in Beijing, you will find a limited number of divergent votes and will not see any true reflection of the different views that the Chinese people may have about China's worrying economy, because the media is controlled by the Chinese Communist Party's iron-hand," he wrote.
He allowed “one of China’s most prominent newspapers to call on the offer to publish” his article, even though he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans scare away female voters from the mid-year election through Kavanaugh-fiascot, warns analysts
Since many top Republicans defend the Supreme Court’s appointed Brett Kavanaugh, who is facing several charges of sexual assault, analysts have warned that a relapse will occur, especially from women, during the upcoming election.
The feelings about this have been extremely high, and most Republicans have already shown where they are in the elections.
Grant Reeher, professor of state science at Syracuse University Maxwell School, is not allowed to turn back the clock, says The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts Senator Jeff Flakes (R-Arizona) the last attempt for an FBI investigation will suffice to calm angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow and not in November," says Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the Progressive Group MoveOn on Friday, according to Washington, DC.
On Friday morning, the protesting "November come!" when they demonstrated in the hall to the Senate building when the Republicans controlling the Court Committee chose to proceed with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will go to the roof," said Stu Rothenberg, a neutral political analyst, for the news story.
"People say it's already been high, it's true.
But it could be higher, especially among still indistinguishable female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18- to 29-year-olds, who, although they do not like the president, often do not vote."
Already before Ford's public record of sexual assault against the nominated candidate to the Supreme Court, analysts suggested that a delay could follow if the Republicans pressed for confirmation.
"This has become a confusing move for GOP," said Michael Steele, former president of the Republican National Committee, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"This is not only about the Committee's vote or the final vote or the Kavanaugh coming through, it is also about how Republicans have handled this and how they have treated it," said Guy Cecil, Head of Priorities USA, a group that helps democratic election campaigns, for the news channel.
But in general, the Americans seem to be divided over who they should believe in in the cold water of Fords and Kavanaugh's testimony, and the latter seems to be the one they believe most in.
A new opinion poll by YouGov shows that 41 per cent of respondents definitely or probably believed in Ford's testimony, while 35 per cent said that they definitely or probably believed in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that they thought that Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the claims made by Ford, as well as from at least another prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford testified to the Senate's court committee during the past week that Kavanaugh violently attacked her at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the candidate to the Supreme Court exposed his sex organs to her while attending a party during their time as students at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to start a new internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a startup that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology agency, Inrupt, is a company based on Berners-Lees open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which persons get access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt is "world domination".
"We have to do it now," he said about the startup company.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solids technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data size" or a POD.
It can contain contact lists, make-lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in a browser at the same time.
What is unique with the personal online data storage is that it is up to the user who can get access to which type of information.
The company calls it "personal authorisation through data."
The idea of Inrupt, according to the CEO of John Bruce, is to include resources, processes and appropriate skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some programme developers to work with the project and a group of volunteers.
From this week on, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralised apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team don't talk to "Facebook and Google about whether to introduce a complete change where all business models are placed on the top of a night.
"We don't ask for permission."
In a presentation on the Media published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new web created by Solid.
In 1994, he converted the Berners-Lee Internet when he established the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on net neutrality in recent months.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and head of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am very optimistic about this new era on the web," said Berners-Lee.
Bernard Water: Priest rewarded with Victoria-Curs during World War I
The only priest in the English Church who was rewarded with a Victoria course during the first world war is now celebrated in his home city 100 years later.
Lt Col Reverend Bernard Water was awarded the award for his action during the attack on Bellenglie and Lehaucourt on September 29, 1918.
However, he was killed four days later, and he never learned that he had been awarded the most prestigious prize of the British military.
A memorial stone was discovered by his two children during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his children, Michael Vann, said it was "bright symbolic", that the stone would be revealed exactly 100 years after his grandfather was rewarded with the prize.
According to London Gazette Lt Col Water on September 29, 1918, its battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a very thick dima and under heavy fire from field and masking winds."
He later moved up to the shooting line and led the "great bravery" line forward before he alone decided the battle.
Lt Col Water was killed by a German doll on October 4, 1918 - a little more than a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "something I know I could never live up to, but something I am very humble in front of."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also put down a crown after the parade, led by Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he "was very honored to play a role in the parade" and allowed "a true hero to be demonstrated by the support that will be given by many people".
MMA fans stayed up all night to look at Bellator 206 and instead got to see Greta Gris
Imagine this, you've been standing up all night to see Bellator 206 just to be refused to look at the main event.
The show from San Jose contained 13 matches, including sex on the main card and was shown live at night in the UK on channel 5.
At 06:00, just like Gegard Mouusasi and Rory MacDonald prepared to meet each other, the British viewers were surprised when the program suddenly changed to Greta Gris.
Many were amazed at their keeping awake to the early morning hours to watch the game.
A Twitter fan described the change in the program to a child program as "a sick joke".
"It was the government's decision that the content was not appropriate so early in the morning, so they had to switch to child programs," said Dave Schwartz, Vice-President of Bellator for marketing and communication when he was asked about the shipment.
"Grey grey, yes"
Bellator's CEO Scott Coker said they will work with their schedule to better include British viewers in the future.
"I think we'll be able to find a solution to the review," said Coker.
"But it's sex in the morning on a Sunday there and we won't be able to solve this until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, the exchange of programs has disturbed many.
We tried to do it, we thought it was a technical mistake.
But it was actually a government issue.
I can promise it won't happen next time.
We will show five matches instead of sex - as we normally do. We took water over our head in our effort to satisfy the fan.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "substance" due to sexuality
The Olympic divers Tom Daley says that he felt the support of his friends during his upbringing because of his sexuality - but it also spurred him to be successful.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize he wasn't like everyone else until he went to high school."
When he spoke in the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke about homosexual rights to give others "hop".
He also said that he cared less about winning OS after becoming a parent.
The popular show's regular program leader, Kirsty Young, has taken off for a few months due to illness.
During his one-time performance at Laverne's first program, Daley tells how he felt "less worth" than others during his upbringing, because "it wasn't socially acceptable to like boys and girls".
He said, "This feeling of feeling inferior and feeling different has been a real source of strength and strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that he was "someone," he said, so he didn't let everyone down when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The dual Olympic bronze medalist has become a highly profiled advocate for HBT rights and has taken advantage of his performance at the Commonwealth Games of Australia in order to convince more countries to criminalize homosexuality.
He said that he spoke because he felt he had the trip to live openly without restrictions and wanted to give others "hop".
The three-fold world champion said his love in a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "came as a surprise".
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscarswinner last year, but he said the age difference had never been a problem.
"When you go through so much at such a young age" - he participated in his first OS as a 14-year-old and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was difficult to find someone at the same age with similar life experience.
The couple became parents in June to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that his "all life perspective" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, it was just about winning gold," he said.
"But you know, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My gold medal is Robbie."
His son bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that Dad did not accept that he would die and one of the last things he had asked about whether they had received their tickets to the 2012 London Olympic Games - where he wanted to sit on the first row.
"I couldn't tell him: you won't be able to sit on the front row of Dad," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and it was not until he had actually stopped breathing and he was dead as I finally admitted that he was not invincible," he said.
The year after that, Daley competed at OS 2012 and won bronze.
"I only knew that this was what I had dreamed of my whole life - to appear before a home audience on an Olympic arena, there was no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired his first song - Proud of Heather Small - a song that had followed him up to OS and still gave him cracks.
Desert Island Disks is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson from the shape of the bench during Saturday's Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson will hit the record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but then he has to fix the form to avoid an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who played for the 12th time in a row, was hanged by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being in the centre of the events, which he has often been for the United States, the five-fold winner spent his day between acting hejaclack and practicing his game in hopes of getting a chance to show up his ability.
He has never been the fastest of drivers, not even at the top of his career, and the 48-year-old is not in the shape of the tough track on Le Golf National, where the long call often disappears severely.
It's not just the stage that scares, in the ninth game on Sunday, Mickelson meets Master Francesco Molinari, who won all four games this week together with the novelist Tommy Fleetwood.
If the Americans, who are 4 points below the 12 single players, have won at the beginning, the Mickelson match can be absolutely decisive.
Fury expressed confidence in his player, not because he could say much else.
"He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a kick on my back and laid his arm around me and said that he would be ready tomorrow," Fury said.
"His self-esteem is not wrong.
He is a famous and has added so much to these teams during previous seasons and last week.
I probably didn't think he'd be able to play two games.
I thought he could do more, but now it's what it is and we're gonna enjoy it.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else."
On Sunday, Mikkelson Nick Faldo's record passes for most Ryder Cup matches played.
It can mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that never fully lived up to the heights of its individual results.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halfs, but Fury said his presence brought other qualities to the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he likes to joke with people and he's a good guy to have in the team," he explained.
"I also think that the younger players felt it was fun to play against him this week, which was fun to see.
He adds so much more than just games."
Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the great leadership can soon be a memory just
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant lead in the last few days in Ryder Cup can quickly be turned into an unpleasant experience.
Dane made his debut in 1997 game at Valderrama, where a team under Seven Ballester's leadership held a five-point advantage over the Americans but as a final water with the least possible margin with score 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"It reminds you that we led a great deal on Valderrama, we led a great deal on Brookline where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won with distress and nudge," said Bjorn (on the photo) after seeing the 2018 class win 5-3 both on Friday and yesterday and leads with 10-6 on Le Golf National.
So the story will prove to me and everyone in the team that this is not over.
Tomorrow we'll do everything.
He's going out and doing everything right.
This is not over until we see the point on the table.
Our goal is to try to win this cup and that's where our focus is.
I have said it all the time, I focus on the 12 players that are on our side, but we are well aware of what is waiting on the other side - the best players in the world."
Björn was satisfied with the performances of his players on a tough golf course and allowed: "I would never succeed in this myself.
Tomorrow, new challenges are ahead.
Tomorrow, it's the individual performances that apply and it's a completely different thing.
It's fun to be out with a partner when it's good, but when you're out there on your own, your capacity as golfers is tested out.
It is the message you need to convey to the players, to get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind you and he must also go and get the best out of himself."
Unlike Björn, opponent Jim Fury will want players to perform better individually than they did as partners, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who came home three points of four.
Fury himself has been on both sides of big turns during the last days in a competition, both in the winning team in Brookline before he ended up losing when Europe ran "Miracle at Medina".
"I remember every fucking word of it," he said in response when he was asked how Ben Crenshaw, captain of 1999, had gathered his players before the last day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you would like to go out as quickly as at Brookline, as at Medina.
Once the speed starts at once, there will be a lot of pressure on these mid-games.
We made our stand and placed the guys we wanted to, you know, create some magic tomorrow."
Thomas was given the task of trying to lead the fight and meeting Rory McIlroy in the top game, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are meeting the other Europeans in the upper half of the scheme.
"I went with this group of guys in this arrangement because I think it's going all the way," Bjorn said about his single choice.
Germany's new warships are being re-established
The German fleet's latest cargo would have been set up in 2014 to replace warships from the time of the Cold War, but it will not be set up until at least next year due to incorrect systems and high costs, reported local media.
The deployment of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the whole new Baden-Wuerttemberg team, has now been shot up to the first half of 2019, according to the Die Zeit newspaper, which quotes a military speaker.
The ship should have joined the fleet already in 2014, but the problems that arose after the delivery were destroyed for the ambitious project.
The four vessels in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class that the fleet ordered in 2007 will replace the old Bremen ferries.
They will contain a powerful cannon, a series of air protection and maritime targets, as well as some jewellery techniques, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signature.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to station the newest rails for up to two years without contact with home ports.
But continuous delays mean that the railways - which allow Germany to design power abroad - are already obsolete when they are in operation, writes Die Zeit.
The lost F125 fleet created the headlines last year, when the German fleet officially refused to put the ship in service and returned it to Blohm & Voss ship in Hamburg.
This was the first time the fleet returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the causes of the return, but the German media indicated a number of important "software and hardware goods" that made the warship valueless if used for a war mission.
Lacks in the software were particularly important because vessels in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors - only half of the crew of older frigates in the Bremen class.
It was also found that the ship has a significant overweight, leading to deterioration of performance and limiting the marine capacity to carry out future upgrades.
The 7 000 tonnes of heavy "Rheinland-Pfalz" are assumed to be twice as heavy as similar vessels used by the Germans during World War II.
Apart from the wrong hardware, the entire price tag of the project - including crew training - will also become a problem.
It is said to have turned to EUR 3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) - compared to EUR 2.2 billion in the start-up.
The problems affecting the newest freighters will be particularly important in the light of the recent warnings that Germany's maritime power will be reduced.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's Defence Committee, acknowledged that the fleet "starts to lack fully equipped vessels".
The official said it was a growing problem, as old ships were being dismantled but no replacement ships were provided.
He regretted that none of the girls in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could join the Navy.
National Trust Earrings for the Secret Life of the Flemish Müssen
New research carried out on a property in the Scottish High Countries aims to reveal how flatmöss uses the landscape in its hunting for food.
We hope that the results will shed new light on the behaviour of unique flying mammals and help manage future conservation activities.
The study, carried out by researchers at the National Trust for Scotland, will follow the southern and southern pipispistrell as well as the brown lengthened and Daubenton flatmöss at Inverewe Gardens in Western Ross.
Special players will be placed in important places around the property to track field mouse activities throughout the season.
NHS personnel and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using hand-held detectors.
Expert audio analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of flatdermus sounds and what species does what.
A life map and report will then be produced to create a detailed area picture of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, NTS natural care advisor, hopes that the results will reveal what areas of life are most important for the bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of environmental management such as the creation of frogs and the best way to maintain forest areas for bats and other related species.
Flemish populations in Scotland and the United Kingdom have decreased significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects the bonds and losses of living environments.
Wind turbines and lighting may also pose a risk, such as aircraft and certain chemical treatments of construction materials, as well as home tax attacks.
Fleddermöss is actually not blind.
But because of their nightly hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use sophisticated eco-location technology to find insects and obstacles in their flight.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, takes flat moustache seriously.
The organisation has ten trained experts, who regularly carry out investigations, check the bonds and sometimes perform rescue operations.
The organisation has also established Scotland's first and only dedicated flatdermuse reserve at Thrave Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten flatdermuses.
The real estate manager David Thompson says the property is the ideal area for them.
"Here at Thrave we have a good area for flat moustache," he said.
"We have the old buildings, lots of vets and a variety of favourable living environments.
But there is much about flat moustache that is still unknown, so the work we do here and on other properties helps us to understand more about what they need to thrive.
He stresses the importance of searching for flat moustache before performing maintenance in properties, as it is possible that unintentional destruction of a single dwelling could kill up to 400 honors and young people, and possibly rob an entire population.
Fleddermöss is peaceful and it is illegal to kill, trouble or disturb them or destroy their bonds.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish Officer for Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and too many of our species we don't know how their populations live."
Ronaldo rejects violence while his lawyers threaten to agree to the German newspaper
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the charges of violence against him for "false news" and says that people want to "market" by using his name.
His lawyers will vote in favour of the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
Portugal and Juventus have been accused of rapeing an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, at a hotel in Las Vegas in 2009.
He claims to have paid her $375.000 to keep quiet about the event, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
In a live video on Instagram Ronaldo (33) from his report as "false news" when he spoke to his 142 million followers, only hours after the requirements were reported.
"No, no, no, no.
What they said today was false news," said the five-fold Ballon d'Or winner to the camera.
"They want to market themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be known by using my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything's good," said the player and log.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to vote in favour of Der Spiegel's claim, which they have called "an unauthorised reporting of suspicions of integrity", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player would seek compensation for "moral damage to an amount corresponding to the seriousness of the infringement, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged event was said to have taken place in June 2009 in a sweat at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga went back to the player's room, where he was supposed to have raped her anal, according to documents submitted by Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged event and told her that he was "99 percent" a "good guy" failure of the "last percent".
According to the documents, Ronaldo had confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was in agreement.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and took photographs of her injuries at a hospital, but later agreed on a settlement because she felt "fear of revenge" and was concerned that "be humiliated publicly".
The 34th year says that she is now trying to undo the reconciliation because she continues to be traumatized by the alleged event.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and in summer he moved to the Italian giant Juve in an agreement of EUR 100 million.
Brexit: Britain "comes for ever regret" to lose car manufacturers
Britain "should regret it forever" if you lost your status as world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, Business Minister Greg Clark said.
He admitted that it was "surrounded" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, they would temporarily stop production at the factory in Burnaston near Derby.
"We need an agreement," said Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer announced that the effects of delays at the border in the event that no contract could finally result in lost jobs.
The Toyota's Auris and Avensis factory produced nearly 150 000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the EU.
"My opinion is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March we will see production stop in our factory," says Marvin Cooke, Toyotas CEO of Burnston.
Other British car manufacturers have communicated their concern about leaving the EU without an agreement on how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says it will close its Mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main problems concern what car manufacturers say are the risks of the supply chain in the event of a Brexit without settlement.
Toyota's production line is run on a "just-in-time" basis, with parts coming 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for cars ordered.
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, it may lead to disturbances at the frontier, as the industry says, can lead to delays and a lack of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than one day's consumption in stock at its Derbyshire factory, the company said, and it would force production to stop.
Clark said theresa May's Chequer's plan for future relations with the EU is "exactly calibrated to avoid border controls".
"We need a settlement. We want the best agreement that allows, as I say, not only success at the moment to be appreciated, but for us to take this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4:'s program Today.
"The statements from not only Toyota but other manufacturers are that we absolutely have to be able to continue what has been a very successful set of supplier chains."
Toyota could not say how long production would be stopped, but in the longer term it warned that increased costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and thus slow down the cost of work.
Peter Tsouvalaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and is the leader of the Unite trade union at the factory, said that his members are increasingly concerned: "My experience is that these jobs will never come back.
One government official said, "We have presented an accurate and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein can be delayed again, says the White House
Donald Trump's meeting with Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein could be "shooted for another week" while the fight against the Supreme Court appointed Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein monitors the work with Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian involvement in the election, the relationship between Trump and Russia and the President's potential obstacle to justice.
Whether Trump will kick the Deputy Justice Minister, thereby endangering Mueller's independence, has fueled Washington Squares for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of wearing cancellation equipment to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of decommissioning the president through the 25th addendum of the American Constitution.
Rosenstein rejected the report.
But on Monday he went to the White House and reported that he was going to leave.
Instead, a meeting was announced with Trump, who was then in the United Nations headquarters in New York, to be held on Thursday.
Trump said he'd "behead" not to kick Rosenstein but then the meeting was delayed to avoid a conflict with the Senate's legal committee hearing where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation of allegations against Kavanaugh, which further delayed a full vote in the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, spoke at Fox News on Sunday.
When she was asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "A date for it has not been set, it can happen this week, or a later settlement with a week in mind of all other matters that occur at the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I always like to keep the press up to date."
Some reporters would argue that Sanders has not had a press conference from the White House since 10 September.
The value of Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of press conferences was not due to anything unpleasant to TV reporters who "play for the gallery", even though she said, "I agree with the fact that they play for the gallery."
She then said that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
"The President holds several questioning sessions than any president before him," she said, and she allowed without quoting the evidence: "We have been looking at these figures."
Conferences will still take place, said Sanders, but "if the press gets the chance to ask questions directly to the President of the United States it is infinitely much better than talking to me.
We are trying to do this often and you have seen us do a lot in the last few weeks and it will replace press conferences, and then you can ask questions directly to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Solo-press conferences are rare.
In New York this week, the president may have shown why, with spontaneous statements and sometimes bizarre appearances in front of the assembled reporters.
Minister of Health writes to EU employees at NHS Scotland taking into account concerns about Brexit
The Minister of Health has written to EU staff working in Scotland's NHS to express the country's gratitude and wish to remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent a letter less than six months before Britain left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already undertaken to cover the cost of terminated status applications for EU citizens working in the country's decentralised public sector.
In the letter, Freeman wrote: "In the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on exit continue, before decisions expected to come in autumn.
However, the British Government has also intensified its preparations for a possible scenario without agreement.
I know that this must be a very worrying time for all of you.
That is why I would like to reiterate how much I value the efforts of each employee, regardless of nationality.
EU-wide colleagues, and the rest of the world, provide valuable experience and expertise that strengthens and improves the work of health care and benefits the patients and societies we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes acute surgery after being hit by the head injury
Tennessee State Tigers lineback Christian Abercrombie underwent an acute operation after having been hit by a major injury on Saturday's loss by 31-27 against Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessee's Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State's chief coach Rod Reed told the reporters that the damage occurred immediately before half a time.
"He came to the sideline and just collapsed," said Reed.
Trainers and medical personnel gave Abercrombie acid on the side line before placing it on a bar was carried out for further evaluation.
A representative from Tennessee State told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie was operating at the Vanderbilt Medical Center Hospital.
Harris admitted that "there is no information on the type/range of the damage yet" and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the damage occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year student, is in her first season with Tennessee State after a transfer from Illinois.
He had a total of five picks on Saturday before leaving the game, which gave him a seasonal count of 18 picks.
Foreign buyers will be debited higher stamp tax when they purchase a property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers may pay higher stamp tax when they purchase property in the United Kingdom, and the extra money is used to help homeless people, according to Tory's new plans
The action should neutralise Corby's success in attracting young voters
The increase in stamp tax will apply to those who do not pay tax in the United Kingdom
The UK Department of Finance estimates that up to 120 million pounds a year to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will be paid a higher stamp tax when they buy property in the UK. The extra money will be used to help homeless people, which will be announced by Prime Minister Theresa May today.
The action will be seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corby's successes by attracting young voters with promises of more affordable housing and targeting high-income people.
The increase in stamp tax will be taken out of individuals and companies who do not pay tax in the United Kingdom.
The additional fee is in addition to the current stamp tax, including the higher levels imposed two years ago on holiday homes and dwellings purchased to rent out, which may amount to up to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance believes that the measure will cover up to 120 million pounds per year.
It is estimated that 13% of the newly built properties in London are purchased by people living outside the UK, which drives prices and makes it harder for first-time buyers to get a foot on the housing market.
Many well-charged areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become ghost cities because of the high number of foreign buyers spending most of their time abroad.
The new game will only come a few weeks after Boris Johnson requested a reduction in the stamp tax to help more young people buy their first apartment.
He accused large construction companies to keep prices up by buying up land without using it, and called on Theresa May to abstain from housing allowances at affordable prices to solve the "necessary housing situation" of the United Kingdom.
Jeremy Corbyn has launched a strikingly large range of proposals for housing reforms, including rentals and an end to rents without the tenant's fault.
He also wants to give municipalities greater opportunity to build new homes.
Theresa May says: "In the past year, I said that I would spend my time as Prime Minister to restore the British dream, that life will be better for every new generation.
This means solving problems in the housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
But it cannot be right when it is as easy for people who do not live in the United Kingdom, and for companies who are based abroad, to buy homes as hard workers in our country.
The dream of owning its home has become too many people just a distant dream, and homelessness is still an unworthy fact."
Jack Ross: "My final goal is to train Scotland"
Sunderland leader Jack Ross says his "final goals" is to ever become Scotland's coach.
The 42-year-old shooter looks forward to the challenge of blowing up life in the club from northeastern England, which is currently in third place in League One, three points from the top.
He moved to Stadium of Light in the summer after taking St. Mirren back to Scottish Premiership last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I played a game in the B-country team, and that's all," says Ross to BBC Scotland's Sports Sound.
"But when I grew up, I looked a lot at Scotland at the Hampden with my father, and it has always drawn me back.
But that chance can only come if I manage to lead a club."
Among Ross' representatives as Sunderland's coach are Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former leader of Alloa Athletic says that he was not worried about leaving so established names in such a large club. He has previously thanked no for offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Just now, I assess the success of the answer to the question, 'Can I get this club back to the Premier League?'
This club is absolutely home to the Premier League, given its structure and talents," he says.
"It's not easy to get there, but I'd probably just see myself as a success here if I could get the club back there."
Ross has only been a coach for three years, after a period as an assistant coach in Dumbarton and a 15-month period as a member of the Heart's training team.
Then he helped Alloa come back from the descent to the third division, and lifted St. Mirren from being close to the descent to become the winner of the championship title then.
Ross says he is more satisfied now than ever during his career in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"That was probably a reason," he remembers and aims when he took command of Alloa.
"I really thought leadership was absolutely right for me, in a completely different way than playing.
That sounds strange, because I had good results and could live hard on it, and I also had some great success.
But playing can be tough.
It's a lot you have to go through every week.
It's still stress and pressure at work for me, but training feels absolutely right.
I've always wanted to train, and now I'm doing it. I feel better than I've ever done during my adult life."

A study shows that the perfect time to take a beer is 17:30 on a Saturday
The summer heat bubbles have included increased revenue for the country's fighting pubs, but the restaurant chain has got more pressure on itself.
Figures showed that pubs and bar groups increased sales by 2.7 % in July, but the revenues of restaurants decreased by 4.8 %.
Peter Martin, from the company councillor CGA, who has compiled the figures, said: "Continued the beautiful weather and the fact that England remained in VM longer than expected meant that we had seen a similar pattern in July compared to June, when the pubs went up by 2.8%.
The decrease in the turnover of restaurants by 1.8% in June was only worse in July.
Pubars and bars, which in particular offer drinks, showed the absolutely best result with figures for the same period last year that had gone up more than the restaurants had gone down.
Pubar offering food was also difficult in the beautiful weather, even though it was not as dramatic as for restaurant owners.
People seem to have just wanted to go out and drink something.
The output of managed pubs and bars went up by 6,6 % that month and the food sale went down by 3 %."
Paul Newman of the service and entertainment industry analyst RSM says: "These results are a continuation of the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and major sporting events are still the most important factors for wholesale sales.
It is no surprise that restaurants still have difficulties, even though a decrease in sales of 4.8 % per year is particularly difficult to manage beyond current cost pressure.
The long warm summer could not have come more uncomfortable for companies driven by food sales. Time can show whether the more moderate temperatures we have had in August give any proper respect."
The total sales increase in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened facilities, was 2.7% in July. It reflects the fact that fewer new brands are now being launched.
Industry sales monitor Coffer Peach Tracker for the pub and restaurant industry in the United Kingdom collects and analyzes information on how 47 active groups with a total turnover of over 9 billion pounds, and is an established benchmark in the industry.
One of the five children has secret accounts on social media they hide for their parents
A survey shows that one of five children, sometimes as young as 11 years of age, have secret accounts on social media they hide for their parents and teachers
A survey of 20 000 students at high school and high school shows an increase in the number of fake Instagram pages
The result has increased concern that sexual content is put up there
20% of students reported that they had a "main account" they showed to their parents.
One of five children, some as young as 11 years of age, creates social media accounts that they keep secret for adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students and gymnasium showed a rapid increase in the number of "false Instakontons", a reference to the screenshot service Instagram.
The result has a lot to worry about because it's sexual content that's posted there.
20% of students reported that they have a clean "main account" that they can show to their parents, and they also have private accounts.
A mother who sneeze over the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who urged others to "violate me."
According to the study carried out by the Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters and Headmasters' Conference (HMC) of independent schools, 40% of the children between 11 and 18 years of age had two profiles, and half of them admitted that they had private accounts.
The president of HMC, Mike Buchanan, says: "It is worrying that so many teenagers are attracted to creating places on the Internet where parents and teachers do not find them."
Elidh Doyle will be "the voice of the athletes" in the board of the Scottish Free Sport Association, Scottish Athletics
Elidh Doyle has been elected to the Scottish Athletics Board as an external board member at the annual meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland's most prized free queen, and President Ian Beattie describes the election as an excellent opportunity for those who lead the sport to benefit from her wide experience at international level over the past decade.
"Eilid has gained great respect throughout the Scottish, British and international sports world, and we are sure that the athletes in Scotland would benefit greatly from becoming a member of the board," Beattie says.
Doyle says, "I would like to be a voice for the athletes and I hope I can contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won 200 meters and 400 meters at OS in Atlanta 1996, has a total of four Olympic gold and is now an expert commentator on BBC. He lost his ability to go after a mini-stroke.
He writes on Twitter: "Today a month ago, I got a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors said that it was time for me to recover, and to what extent.
It's been hard work, but I've recovered completely, learned to go back and now I'm doing mobility exercises!
Thank you for all the encouragement!"
Advertising for breast pumps comparing mothers with internet shares
A company selling breast pumps has caused Internet differences of opinion with an advertisement comparing breast-feeding mothers with cows being milked.
In order to pay attention to the launch of what is said to be "the world's first silent portable breast pump", consumer technology company Elvie has released a music video-inspired advertising film with a humorous estimate to show the freedom that the new pump gives to mothers who pump breast milk.
Four real moms dance in a hemp full of cows to a song with lines like, "Yes, I'm milking myself, but I don't have any soap" and "If you didn't know that, this isn't a javelin, it's a tuts."
The frenzy goes on, "Spring out, pump out, I feed the babies, pump out, pump out, I milk the ladies."
But the advertising film, which has been published on the company's Facebook page, has caused conflict on the Internet.
The film has received 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, and has received mixed reactions from the viewers. Many say it sheds light on the "fasor" of the dairy industry.
"A very bad decision to use cows to market this product.
Just like we have to get pregnant and feed to produce milk, but their young are taken from them only a few days after birth," writes one person.

Another commented: "You understand that it is traumatic for both mother and child.
But of course, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who can keep their children?"
Someone else adds: "What is the reality of using advertising?"
Others defend the film, and a woman admits that she thinks the song is "historically fun."
"I think this is brilliant.
I'd have gotten one if I was still angry.
Pumping made me feel just like a cow.
The advertising film is a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
This is a brilliant product," someone writes.
Another commented: "This is a fun commercial that turns to moms as pumps (often at the workplace or at the toilet) and feels like 'cossor'."
This is not a film that praises or condemns the dairy industry."
At the end of the film, the women reveal that they have all danced with the discreet pump stopped in need.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the fact that many women who pump milk say they feel like cows.
But the Elvie pump is completely quiet, has no cables or pipes and can be worn discreetly in a breast-feeding diet, which gives women the freedom to move, keep their babies and even go out while they pump.
Ana Balarin is co-owner and ECD at Mother, and she says: "The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between women pumping breast milk and milk, we wanted to shed light on breast pumping and the challenges with it, while maintaining and easily recognising the incredible feeling of freedom that the new pump provides.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump creates headlines.
During London's fashion week, a two-child mom appeared on the catwalk with clothes from designer Marta Jakubowski while she used the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent camp near the border in Texas
The number of refugee children deprived of liberty has dropped significantly even though the number of persons crossing the border each month is relatively unchanged, partly due to the violent rhetoric and harsh policies introduced by the Trump government has made it more difficult to place the children with the reference persons.
In the past, most referees themselves have been paperless immigrants, and fear to put their own opportunities to stay in the country at risk by explaining themselves willing to receive a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential referees and other adult members of the household would be forced to leave fingerprints and that the data would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official of the Immigration and Customs Authority, testified before the Congress that the Authority had arrested dozens of people who had applied for membership of a single minor.
The Authority subsequently confirmed that 70 % of those arrested were not known by law enforcement authorities since.
"Approximately 80% of the persons who are either referees or family members to referees are illegal in the country, and a large part of them are criminal aliens.
So we continue to persecute these individuals," Albence said.
In order to deal with children's issues more quickly, officials have introduced new rules requiring some of them to be in court within a month after they were deprived of their liberty, rather than after 60 days, which was earlier practice, according to staff in the federations.
Many of them are present on video link rather than personally to bring their statement of legal status before an immigration judge.
Those who are not judged to have the right to protection are deported quickly.
The longer children are deprived of freedom the more likely it is that they are affected by anxiety or depression, which may lead to violent outbreaks or refugee attempts, according to staff at the settlements and reports that have come from the system in recent months.
Proponents say that ozone rises at larger plants such as Tornillo, where signs of a child being more likely to be ignored, due to the size of the plant.
They add that if children are moved to the tents without having enough time to prepare emotionally and take good care of friends, the traumas can worsen many already.
Syria requires US, French and Turkish "occupational forces" to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also urged Syrian refugees to return home, despite the fact that the war in the country is in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also Deputy Prime Minister, said that foreign forces are illegally on Syrian territory, under the pretext of combating terrorism, and "will be dealt with accordingly."
"They must return immediately and unconditionally," he said to the General Assembly.
Moualem stressed that "the war against terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have died since 2011, and millions have left their homes.
He said that the government in Damascus would continue to "fight this sacred battle until we have freed all Syrian territories" both from terrorist groups and "all illegal foreign presence".
The United States has some 2,000 soldiers in Syria, who primarily train and advise both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are opponents of President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground in the war- hardened country.
As for the refugees, Moualem said that the circumstances are good for them to come home, and accused "some Western countries" of "distributing irrational fear" which enables refugees to stay away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate their return," he said.
"They're policing something that should be a purely humanitarian issue."
The US and the EU have warned that there will be no help in rebuilding Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say that a fresh agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major rebel Idlib has created an opportunity to move on with political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement halted a massive attack by Russian-supported Syrian troops against the province, which has three million inhabitants.
Moualem stressed, however, that the agreement had "clear deadlinelines", and expressed hope that a military intervention would be directed against jihadists, including warriors from the Al Qaida-connected Nusrafronten, who would "come to be executed".
The UN envoy, Staffan de Mistura, is hopeful to soon be able to convene the first meetings of a new committee consisting of members of government and members of the opposition, in order to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and track the way for elections.
Moualem set up conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in the Committee and said that the group's work would be limited to "the review of the articles in the current constitution", and warned of interference.
Why Donald Trump will win a round
With that logic, Donald Trump would win the 2020 elections unless his presidency was completed in the past through the rule of law and scandal, which many liberal spectators are likely to hope for.
In what would no doubt be "the most dramatic final of a presidency ever!"
Now there's no sign that the viewers are tired.
Since 2014, the number of viewers at best broadcast time has doubled to CNN 1.05 million, and is almost three times as high, 1.6 million, on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at best broadcast time, which is an increase of 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has toped the lists for cable channels with as many as 3.5 million viewers during major news events.
"This is like a fire that people are drawn to, because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, who runs the show for ABC's drama "Designed Survivors", who is about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack has destroyed Capitolium.
Nell Scovell is a versatile comedy author and has written "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club". She has another theory.
She remembers a taxi trip in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told me he was going to vote on Donald Trump.
Why? she asked.
"He said, 'To make me laugh'," says Nell Scovell to me.
There's a entertainment value in the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, Washington's report can determine the future of abortion law, Roe vs Wade, whether immigrant families can be restored and the prosperity of the global economy.
Closing off is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
However, it goes beyond being an informed citizen when you suddenly sat down and watched for six hours on an expert panel discussing Bob Woodward's use of "deep background sources" to his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's bomber jacket for $15,000 (a plague filled with hybrids", as Washington Post said) and the meaning of Stormy Daniel's macabre descriptions of Donald Trumps, hm, anatomy.
I'll never look at Super Mario myself the same way again.
"Part of what he does that makes it feel like a reality series is that he comes with something every night," said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", about Trump's rotating roll crew and daily intrigues (very grueling with NFL, praised Kim Jong-un).

When I spoke to the TV producer Mr. Fleiss this week, it was sun and 27 degrees outside his house in northern Kauai in Hawaii, but he sat and huddled indoors and looked at MSNBC while he recorded a broadcast from CNN.
He couldn't get tired, not when Brett Kavanaugh would be brought before the Senate's judicial committee and the future of the Supreme Court was in the vault.
"I remember when we made all those crazy programs back in the day and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization'," said Mr. Fleiss to me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turned out they were right."

Money from currents into the smoothest race ever before the mid-year election
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania 17th Congressional District accepts a lot of money. It is thanks to the restructuring of a Congressional District that has made two members now competing for the same place.
This recently surrounded rural district in Pittsburgh is represented by the Democratic Conor Lamb, who took his place in another district at a special election last spring.
Lamb campaigning against another member, Republican Keith Rothfus. He is currently representing the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which largely overlaps the new 17th district.
The maps were drawn after the decision of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in January that the old districts were constitutionally changed to the benefit of the Republicans.
The leadership of the new 17th district has led to a campaign financing dispute between the major economic sections of the parties, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee, (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a well - known name in Pennsylvania after a short victory in a wide - guarded special election in March to the 18th Congress district of Pennsylvania.
That place had been held by a republic for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district with 20 points.
Political experts had given the Democrats a certain advance.
USA considered seizing El Salvador for China's support but then backed up
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little resistance from Washington.
Donald Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017, and had a hotel in Panama until the shareholders hired the team of the Trump organization.
Officials of the U.S. Department of Foreign Affairs decided to call home the heads of the US administrations in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of the "now decided to no longer recognise Taiwan", said the department's spokesman Heather Nauert in a statement earlier this month.
But only sanctions against El Salvador were planned, which was estimated to be $140 million in American aid 2017. The money would, among other things, go to drug control and development and constitute financial support.
The proposed sanctions, including reduced economic assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have severely affected the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder statistics.
At the same time as the internal meetings continued, US and Central American officials launched a high-level conference focusing on security and economic prosperity to follow up a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step in the right direction to prevent migrants from moving to the United States.
But in mid-September, high officials in the administration made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, which in practice put an end to considerations of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence will now speak at the conference, which will take place in mid-October.
And the three American envoys returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new hard messages or punishments from Washington.
One spokesperson for John Bolton from the White House refused to comment on the details of the debate, which was described by the three American officials, two of them diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal negotiations against the promise of anonymity.
Their statements were confirmed by an external analyst who is close to the administration and who also expressed himself anonymously.
Study history
The next inevitable step can be the special investigator Robert Mueller's report on the alleged abuse of Donald Trump in legal proceedings, as there is now tangible evidence in public records.
Mueller is also reported to direct its investigation into whether Donald Trump's campaign collaborated with Russia in its attack on the US elections.
If the assembly were to change the majority, Trump would be held accountable to that congregation just when he was preparing to stand up again in the election, and perhaps finally to a civil jury.
There are many uncertain factors in this, and I do not want to say that Trump will inevitably fall, so neither will his colleagues in Europe.
We all have to face different choices, on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect how the struggle can be drawn.
In 1938, German officers were ready to launch a coup against Hitler, if only the Western countries had stood against him and stood behind the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed, and we missed an opportunity to avoid the years of bloodbath that followed.
History revolves around such decisive events, and the inadvertent progress of democracy is either accelerated or broken.
The Americans are now facing several of these crucial events.
What should we do if Donald Trump gives Deputy Justice Minister Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls what will happen to the Mueller investigation, the shot?
Rosenstein has been in trouble ever since this newspaper reported that he has proposed to record the president in secret last year, and speculated that he would not be fit for the office.
Rosenstein says the Times reporting doesn't match.
"How should we respond if the recently requested FBI investigation by Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or unfair, or if he has access to the Supreme Court in spite of credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, in the middle of the year, are we going to vote on a congress holding Donald Trump in charge?
If we fail in these tests, democracy faces a dark period.
But I don't think we're going to fail because of that lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech-Slovak Jew and was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy residence.
She survived, migrated to the United States, and 60 years later, she sent me on her way to light the Saturday lights on the table decorated with the hacker.
With what I inherited, how could I be anything but optimistic about the future?"

Graham Dorrans in Rangers is optimistic about the Rapid Wien meeting
Rangers take on Rapid Wien on Thursday. They know that they are winning against the Austrians after the impressive Spanish match against Villareal that ended unexpectedly earlier this month will put them in a strong position to qualify from Group G of the European League.
A cracker prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance for the season, up to 2-2-game against Villareal. But he believes that Rangers can use the result as a leapboard against greater success.
"It was a good point for us, because Villareal is a good team," says the 31st.
"We went into the game in faith that we could get something, and went from there with a point.
We might have got it in the end, but in the vast majority, it was probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half, and we came back in the second half, and it was better.
Today, on Thursday, it will be an important evening in Europe again.
Hopefully, we can get three points, but it becomes a tough match. They got a good result at their last match, but if we have the audience with us we can certainly get up and get a good result.
Last year was very hard, with everything that happened to my injuries and changes in the club, but now we have a good feeling.
The troops are good and the guys are fun, the training is good.
Hopefully we can move forward now, put the last season behind us and succeed."
Women sleep badly because of fear of pension savings
Despite the fact that participants in the survey had a clear picture of how they wanted to be treated, few spoke with their family members about it.
About half of the people who participated in the countrywide study said that they had talked to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10% said they had talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't step up and talk about it," said Holly Snyder, Vice President of Life Insurance at Nationwide.
This is how you can start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can't prepare your family to care if you don't talk about how you want it in good time.
Work with your advisor and your family and discuss where and how you want to care. Your choices may be of great importance to the costs.
Get help from your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you find a way to pay for the costs.
Your choice of financing for long-term care may include a traditional long-term insurance solution, a hybrid life insurance solution with cash value to cover the costs, or self-insurance with your own resources, if you have advice.
Establish legal acts: Avoid legal disputes from the beginning.
Create a care authority so that you can appoint a trusted person who looks at your medical care and ensure that your health care personnel follow your wishes, if you are unable to communicate.
Consider, too, a mandate for your economy.
You then choose a trusted person who can make economic decisions instead and make sure that your accounts are paid if you are unable.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that you have an elderly parent who is in an acute medical condition and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medicines and allergies?
Write down such details so you're ready.
"It's not just the economy that's at stake, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What kind of medicine is that?
Who's taking care of the dog?
Make sure the plan is ready."
You've been shot several times with air rifles in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with a gun when he walked home from one evening.
The victim, who is 40 years old, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe in Devon when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
The police describe the shooting, which took place around 02:30, as a "unique event".
The victim didn't see his attacker.
The damage is not life-threatening, and the police call for witnesses to hear from themselves.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the city of Palu in Indonesia on Friday.
The communications are off-limits, and rescue personnel have not yet been able to obtain any information from the management area of Dongala, a north area of Palu, which is located near the epicenter of the earthquake. The earthquake measured 7.5 on the Richterskalan.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu after the disaster.
Here are some facts about Palu and Dongala, located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, located in a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi. The city's population was estimated to be 379,800 people in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Dongala is a management area extending over 300 km from the north-west coast of Sulawesi.
The administrative area, which is an administrative region in a province, in 2017 had a population estimated to 299 200 people.
The pillars of the Central Sulawesi economy in the province are fisheries and agriculture.
Nickel mining is also significant in the province, but it is mainly concentrated in Morowoli, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Dongala have been hit by tsunamis several times over the last hundred years, according to the Indonesian disaster management authority.
In 1938 more than 200 people were killed by a tsunami that destroyed hundreds of houses in Dongala.
Also in 1996 the West Dongala was killed by a tsunami that killed nine people.
Indonesia is located in the circulatory seismic fire, which is often hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the largest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A large earthquake at the western coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra on 26 December triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries. 226,000 people died along the coasts of the Indian Ocean. More than half of them were in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, outside the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A earthquake with magnitude 6.8 on the Richterskalan struck south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, and triggered a tsunami that struck the southern coast and killed almost 700 people.
2009: A earthquake with magnitude 7.6 struck near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of Western Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: An earthquake with magnitude 7.5 struck one of the Mentawai Islands outside Sumatra. A tsunami of up to 10 meters was triggered. Thousands of cities were destroyed and about 300 people were killed.
2016: An earthquake hit the Pidi Jaya administration area in Aceh and caused destruction and panic, as people were reminded of the destruction of the deadly earthquake and tsunami 2004.
This time no tsunami was triggered, but more than 100 people were killed by broken buildings.
2018: Great earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island Lombok. More than 500 people died, most of them on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings, and thousands of tourists were temporarily beached.
Sarah Palin's oldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the oldest son of the former Alaskan governor and Vice-President Sarah Palin, has been arrested for abuse.
Palin, who is 29 years old and from Wasilla in Alaska, was arrested suspected of domestic violence, for having filed a report on domestic violence and for having opposed the arrest, according to a report released on Saturday of Alaska State Police.
According to the police report, he should have taken the phone from a female acquaintance who tried to call the police and report the alleged crimes.
Palin sits in the Mat-Su harbor and is held against the $500 debt to be paid if the suspect breaks against the conditions of the prison, according to the TV channel KTUU.
He appeared in court on Saturday and declared himself "guaranteed not guilty" when he was asked to give up his position, according to the TV channel.
Palin is suspected of three cases of minor criminal offences under Class A, which means that he can be imprisoned for up to a year and $250,000 in fines.
He has also been accused of a case of minor crimes under Class B, which is punished with one day in prison and $2,000 in fines.
It's not the first time Palin's been charged with crime.
In December 2017 he was accused of violence against his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged crime.
The case is now handled by Alaska's veterinary court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, for having reported domestic violence and for the possession of weapons under the influence of that incident.
His girlfriend accuses him of beating her in the face.
Sarah Palin received criticism from veteran groups in 2016 after she had linked her son's violent behaviour to post-traumatic stress syndrome, which stems from his military service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia on Friday.
The earthquake, measuring 7.5 on the Richterskalan, triggered a tsunami and destroyed hundreds of homes.
Electricity and communications are down, and death figures are expected to rise in the next few days.
The earthquake struck immediately outside the central Sulawesi, northeastern of the capital of Indonesia, Jakarta.
Films that show when it hit it now on social media.
Hundreds of people had been gathered to a beach festival in the city of Palu when Tsunamin crossed the coast.
Federal prosecutors rarely practice death penalty for a suspected terrorist attack in New York
Federal Prosecutors in New York are practicing death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the terrorist bombing in New York who killed eight people. It is a rare punishment that has not been committed for a federal crime in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, was to have used a rental car from the construction and construction chain Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bicycle road along the West Side Highway on lower Manhattan. He took down pedestrians and cyclists on his way to the attack, which took place in October.
In order to justify a death sentence, the prosecutors must prove that Saipov " purposely" killed the eight victims and " purposefully" caused serious bodily harm, according to the death penalty bill filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both points of appeal may constitute a death sentence, according to the case-law.
A few weeks after the attack, Saipov was accused by a federal jury of 22 points, including eight cases of murder to support protection activities, often used by federal prosecutors in the aims of organised crime, as well as trafficking and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack demanded "absolute planning and intention," the prosecutors said, while describing the way Saipov carried it out as "disgusting, cruel and inhuman".
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused family and friends to Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco's damage and loss," says the statement of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
New York's South District has not been charged with a death penalty target for a decade.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was killed by two drug addicts, but was finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last death penalty was executed in a federal goal in New York in 1953. The married couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being sentenced to imprisonment for spying on the Soviet Union during the so-called war two years earlier.
Paret Rosenberg was executed both in the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Saipov, a Uzbek citizen, showed a lack of anxiety during the days and months following the attack, according to the court document.
According to the police, he told the investigators that he was satisfied with what he had done.
According to the statement, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired by the attack after watching IS films on his phone.
He also asked for the IS flag to be set up in his hospital room, the police reported.
He has not declared himself guilty of the 22 charges in the case.
David Patton is one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, and he stated that they are "probably disappointed" in the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to pursue death sentences instead of going to life imprisonment without the possibility of conditional release if the accused confesses only prolongs the trauma that these events have caused for all those involved," Patton said.
Saipov's team of defenders had previously asked the prosecutors not to pursue a death penalty.
Mr Tories said that NIGEL FARAGE should be held responsible for the Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the army of the people" today during a protest at the Torres conference.
The former UKIP leader said politicians must "know the heat" of the EU skeptics when one of Theresa May's own parliamentarians proposed that he lead the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative member Peter Bone said at the March in Birmingham that the United Kingdom "should have gone out" if Nigel Farage had been Brexit Minister.
However, the challenge faced by Theresa May in getting the deeply divided followers to be reconciled has been exacerbated by positive tory members of the EU, who have joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is fighting to keep his compromise plan, the Chequers Agreement, alive under attack from Brexitan supporters, people who want to stay in the Union and the EU themselves.
Her allies have insisted that she should press and try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the back-up, and force EU skeptics and Labour Party to choose between her package solution and "chaos".
Bone said at a mass meeting organized by the Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he wanted to "sola Chequers Agreement".
He indicated that Nigel Farage should have been made equal and given responsibilities in the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had stood by the wheel, we would have been out by this team," he said.
Peter Bone, who represents Wellingborough District in Parliament, admitted: "I will stand up for Brexit, but we must sell the Chequers Agreement".
He clarified his resistance to the EU and said: "We have not fought world wars to be undercover.
We want to establish our own laws in our own country."
Bone dismissed the claims that the public opinion would have changed since the 2016 referendum: "The view that the British would have changed and now want to remain is completely inconceivable."
Brexitan Hanger Andrea Jenkyns from the Tory Party was also on the march and spoke to the journalists. "I just want to say, 'Minister, listen to the people.'
The Chequers agreement is unpopular in the public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is impopulent in the party and in our election workers who are out in the streets and ensure that we are elected.
Get out of the Chequers deal and start listening."
And she allowed a sharp message addressed to Theresa May: "Ministers can keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Nigel Farage said at the meeting that politicians must get to know the heat if they would fail the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"Now it is about trust between us, that is, the people, and the political class," he said.
"They're trying to cheat Brexit, and we're here today to tell them, "We're not going to let you get away with it."
In front of the enthusiastic crowd, he admitted: "I want you to get our political class, which is close to betraying Brexit, to feel the heat.
We mobilize the armies of the people in this country that gave us victory in Brexit, and we will not rest until we have become an independent, self-government and proud United Kingdom."
At the same time, EU supporters marched through Birmingham and then held a two-hour mass meeting in the city centre.
A group of activists fanned with paths with the text "Tory members against Brexit" after the group was launched this weekend.
The Labour Parliamentarian Lord Adonis of the Overhouse boasted the conservatives of the security problems they encountered with a party when the conference opened.
"It is these people who say they can have on-site IT systems and all technology for Canada plus plus agreement, for wireless borders and free trade without borders in Ireland," he admitted.
"It's a pure father.
There's no good Brexit," he allowed.
Warren is planning a "ordinary thinker" to run for the President's post.
US Senator Elizabeth Warren says she's going to take a "ordinary thinker to run for the President's post" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Democrats from Massachusetts spoke about their future during a cityhouse meeting in Western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren has often criticised President Donald Trump, and is now re-electing the Republican State Representative Geoff Diehl, who was the deputy president of the Donald Trump campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
She has been subject to speculation that she may be taking Donald Trump 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th city house meeting with the electors since Donald Trump came in.
A person asked her if she was planning to run for the president's post.
Warren said it's time for women to go to Washington to repair our dirty government, which means a woman at the top.
A person arrested for shooting the basketball player Sims from LSU
The police in Baton Rouge in Louisiana announced on Saturday that a suspect had been arrested for shooting the LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge police announced that Dyteon Simpson, 20, had been arrested at a press conference at 11:00 for ET.
They had released a film of the shooting on Friday to help identify a man who sees the images.
Twenty-year-old Sims was shot to death near Southern University campus early on Friday.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head and eventually died of this," police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday through the news show 247 sports.
Wayde went to the e-mail to defend his friend and got shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted that he had been in the scene and had a gun, and he admitted that he had shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without any incidents and taken to the police station in East Baton Rouge.
Sims was a junior player, 198 cm long and grew up in Baton Rouge. He played in 32 games with 10 starts last season, and cut in 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 returns per match.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world champion after the theater gave him a victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment that Valteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was clear that Mercedes' teammates would play a major role in the race.
Bottas got a good start and almost hung Hamilton on a torch when he defended his position under the first two bands, and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went up first and let Hamilton drive back into the hill, which should have been crucial.
The Mercedes went in there a ship later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton went forward after a little wheel-mot-wheel action where the Ferrari driver reluctantly left the inside free with risk to invite in a double suit to defend himself in the third curve.
Max Verstappen started in the rear row and was seven at the end of the first row on his 21st birthday.
He then led a large part of the race and held in the deck to reach a quick target and run over the Kimi Raikkonen and become four.
Finally he arrived in the 44th row but failed to raise the speed during the remaining eight rows when the Raikkonen went up in fourth place.
It's a difficult day, because Valteri did a great job all weekend and was a real gentleman who let me through.
The team has done an exceptional job and got one and two," said Hamilton.
Pretty bad body language
President Donald Trump denied Senator Diane Feinstein at a mass meeting on Saturday, because she maintains that she has not leaked the letter from Christine Blasey Ford in which Brett Kavanaugh, who is appointed judge of the Supreme Court, is accused of sexual assault.
The President, speaking at a mass meeting in West Virginia, did not raise the testimony directly from Ford in front of the Senate's Justice Committee. Instead, he commented that what appeared in the Senate showed that people were "illegal, undiscovered and false."
"The only thing that could happen and the nice thing that has happened in the last days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry, angry, undiscovered and lying," he said.
"You see the press messages and leaks, and then they say, 'No, I haven't done it.
I haven't done it.'
Do you remember?
Have you been late, Diane Feinstein?
Do you remember her answer? 'Have you leaked the document?' 'Oh, what?'
Oh, no.
I haven't missed it.'
Wait a minute.
'Have we leaked... no, we haven't leaked anything',' he admitted, and he imitated the senator.
The letter with details of Ford's charges against Kavanaugh was sent to Feinstein in July, and was dropped in September, but Feinstein refused to have the leak from her office.
"I haven't obscured Ford's accusations, I haven't missed her story," Feinstein told the committee according to The Hill.
"She asked me to keep this confidential, and I kept it confidential as she wanted."
But her dementia does not seem to have passed the president, who, during the Saturday evening's meeting, commented: "I'm going to say you're a thing. That was really bad body language.
She may not have done it, but that's the worst language I've ever seen."
The President continues to support the candidate to the Supreme Court, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by three women, and he pointed out that the Democrats used the charges for their own purposes.
"They are determined to withdraw the power by all necessary means.
They don't care who they're hurting, who they have to run over to get power and control," said the president, according to the digital news magazine Mediaite.
Elite League: Dundee Stars-Belfast Giants 5-3
Patrick Dwyer made two targets for Belfast Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars played Friday's loss in Elite League against Belfast Giants by winning the return match with 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
Belfast Giants received an early two-way tour through Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie huddled for the home team before Dwyer rebuilt Belfast Giants' line.
Francois Bouchard's tweeted for Dundee before two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen assured the victory.
It was the third loss in Elite League for the season of Adam Keef's law, which came from behind and beat Dundee with 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth season meeting for the two laws, and Belfast Giants had won the three previous matches.
Dwyer's opening target came in the fourth minute at 3:35 on an assistant from Kendall McFaul, and David Rutherford gave an assistant when Beauvillier doubled the leadership four minutes later.
During the intense first period, Sullivan brought the home team back into the match at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt delivered to Cownie, who tweeted at 15:16.
Dwyer saw that Belfast Giants was in the lead at the first break when he made his second goal for the evening at the end of the first period.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard huddled again with a goal in power play at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran cooperated to help Nielsen give Dundee leadership for the first time in the match at the end of the second period, and he secured the win with his team's fifth half-way through the final period.
Belfast Giants, who has now lost four of their last five matches, will play home against Milton Keynes at his next match on Friday.
Flyers died so that hundreds of people on a plane could flee from the earthquake
A pilot in Indonesia is now hailed as a hero after he was born when he made sure that a plan with hundreds of people could lift safely.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a large earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continue to plague the area and many are stuck in the bustle of the city of Palu.
But even though his colleagues fled for their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunavan Agung refused to leave his post in the wild waving control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He stayed to make sure that Batik Air's flight 6321, which was then on the runway, could lift safely.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he thought it was going to rage.
He was born later in a hospital.
The spokesperson for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirat, said that the decision could have saved hundreds of people's lives, according to the Australian TV channel ABC News.
"We arranged with a helicopter from Balikpapan on Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived at Palu.
We're confused about hearing this," he admitted.
At the same time, the authorities are threatening the death rate to reach more than a thousand people. The disaster relief authority says it is limited access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Boutong.
"The mortality rate is likely to continue to increase as there are still many bodies left in the ruins, and many have not been able to achieve it," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesperson for the Authority.
Up to six meters high waves have destroyed Palu, where a mass burial will be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial planes fly in aid and supplies.
The 35-year-old mom Risa Kusuma said to Sky News: "Every minute an ambulance comes with dead bodies.
It's bad about clean water.
Mini-markets are plundered all over the world."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is fighting to help survivors, but we do not know what they will be faced by there.
This is already a tragedy, but it can be much worse."
Indonesia's President Joko Widodo arrived at Palu on Sunday and said to the country's military: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to evacuation.
Are you ready?" according to CNN.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
A plane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now indicates that a man is missing after a plane crashed in a lagoon
The air carrier responsible for the plan that crashed in a plane in Micronesia in the Pacific now indicates that one man is missing. Earlier it was said that all 47 passengers and crew had been evacuated from the descending plane and were safe.
Air Niugini said in a press release that a male passenger was still missing on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it worked with local authorities, hospitals, and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately answer the questions about more details about the passenger, such as his age and nationality.
Local boats helped save the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed in the water when it tried to land at the airport at Chukören.
On Friday, officials indicated that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline reported that six passengers were staying at the hospital on Saturday and that their condition was stable.
It is still unclear what caused the crash and how the event unfolded.
The airline and the American fleet both indicated that the plane landed in the lagoon without reaching the runway.
Some Witnesses thought the planet was passing the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane flew very low.
"It's extremely good," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and others managed to swim through deep water to the emergency exits on the descending planet.
He said the cabin crew got panicked and screamed, and he got a little shoulder injury.
The U.S. fleet said that seamen who worked nearby to develop a shipyard also helped in the rescue work by using an inflatable boat to drive people in the country before the planet fell in the deep water in the 30 metres.
Data from Aviation Safety Network shows that 111 people have suffered accidents with airlines registered in Papua New Guinea in the last two years, but Air Niugini has not been involved in any of them.
Analysts draw up a timeline for the night when a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the Åklaggarside concluded its complaint in the second trial against a man accused of burning a woman in Mississippi living in 2014.
The analyst Paul Rowlett of the U.S. Department of Justice spoke for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he had used mobile phone lists to push together the 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chamber's movements that night she died.
Rowlett said that he had received location information from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers that night she died, which contradicts his earlier claim, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chamber's cell phone during the time he said he had been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "laughing, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another objection was that Tellis indicated that he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Cell phones showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that Tellis once after Chamber's death deleted Chamber's text messages, conversations and contact information from his phone.
"He sucked her out of his life," said Hale.
The defence is scheduled to begin its final submission on Sunday.
The judge said that he expected the trial to be handed over to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is the conscious hippop?
A hipop-trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling its music with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol believes that the hipope has come far from its origin in political messages and to address social issues.
They want to go back to the roots and make conscious hippop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Commons have recently received a resurgence in the United Kingdom through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
A black one again?
A child girl in New York agrees a couple due to rejection after a "racist" text message
A child girl in New York agrees with a couple for discriminatory rejection after having received a wrong text message from modern, who complained that she was "a black one again".
The couple denies that they would be racist and compare the vote with "expression".
The twin mother Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman expressed fear when she realized that the new girl Giselle Maurice was black when she came to her first working day 2016.
"NOEEEEEEEEEEEEIJ NOT A SVART IGEN," Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a text to her husband.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Giselle Maurice, twice.
After she realized her mistake, Plasco-Flaxman was "ill into fashion", and gave Maurice the shot, and claimed that their former African-American child girl had done a bad job and that she was expecting a Filipino woman, according to New York Post.
Maurice got paid for one day's work and was sent home by taxi.
Now she agrees with the couple to get compensation for the cancellation. She asks for compensation in the size scheme $350 per day for the job she was originally hired to do, which would be for six months and where she would live with the couple. However, she had no contract.
"I want to show them you don't do that," she said to New York Post on Friday. "I know it's discrimination."
The couple beat off the charges of being racist and said that the only reason for them was to end Giselle Maurice's job, and they were worried that they could not trust her when they had persecuted her.
"My wife had sent her something she didn't mean.
She's not racist.
We're not racist," said fellow Joel Plasco to New York Post.
"But would you entrust your children to someone you had been rude to, even if it was a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Seriously speaking."
Plasco compared the vote to "pressuring" and said that his wife would have children two months later and was in a "very difficult situation".
"Should you give yourself to such a person?
It is not particularly pleasant," the investment banker Plasco allowed.
The legal process is still under way, but the public opinion has quickly condemned the couple on social media and criticises them for their behaviour and reasoning.
The Paddington publishers did not think the readers could relate to a speaking bear, revealing a new letter
The writer of Paddington, Michael Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was adopted, commented: "It's hard to think about how it was for a person who read it for the first time before it was released.
It is very fun, given what we now know about the great success of Paddington."
She told her father, who had worked as a cameraman on BBC before he was inspired by a small toy bear to write the children's book, had been optimistic when his work was rejected. She allowed the 60-year-old ticket of the first edition to be "bitterly loving" after his death last year.
She describes Paddington as a "very important member of our family", and allowed her father to be proud of his final success in silence.
"He was quite quiet of himself, and not a funny person," she said.
"But Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child who succeeds in something. You get proud of the child even though it is not the man who has done it yourself.
I think he saw Paddington's successes a little bit like that.
Though it was his creation and his imagination he always used to give Paddington his own honor."
My daughter was going to die, and I was able to say good-bye on the phone.
When she landed, her daughter had been taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors worked hard to save her life.
"Ned called regularly to say that it was really bad, and that you didn't expect her to succeed," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperous.
"Then I got a call from Nad who said she would die in two minutes and that I had to take care of her.
And I did.
I said, "I love you so much, Tashi, my dear.
I'll come to you soon.
I'm coming to you.
The medications the doctors had given her to keep her heart alive were slowly ebbed out and left her body.
She had died just before, and now everything went down.
I just got to sit there and wait and know that all this happened.
I could not woo or scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to get together."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperous, who now cared for the loss of her daughter, went to the planet along with the other passengers, who was completely unaware of the difficult test she went through.
"No one knew about it," she said.
"I bowed my head, and the tears fell all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the flight, I felt an overwhelming compassion for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Grieving women set up road maps to prevent suicide on bridges
Two women who have lost loved ones because of suicide work to prevent others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have put up cards on a bridge in Wales with inspiring messages and telephone numbers that you can call to get support.
Sharon Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he began to suffer from depression, and he took his life when he was 18.
"I don't want any parents to need as bad as I do every day," she says.
Sharon Davis is 45 and lives in Lydney, and she tells us that her son was a promising cook who had a contagious smile.
"All of them knew who he was because of his smile.
They said his smile lit up the room."
But he stopped working before he died, because he was "in a very dark place."
Tyler’s brother, then 11 years old, was the one who found his sister when he took his life in 2014.
Sharon Davis says, "I worry all the time for consequences."
Sharon Davis created the map "to make people know that there are people you can go and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't be quiet, talk about it."
Kelly Humphreys, who has been friends with Sharon Davies for years, lost his partner for 15 years, Mark, a time after his mother died.
"He had not said he felt embarrassed or depressed or anything," she says.
"Some days before Christmas, we noticed that he was different.
On the Christmas day, he was on the bottom, and when the children opened their Christmas cupboards, he had no eye contact with them or anything."
She says that his death was a very severe blow to them, but they have to get through it. "It's tearing up a wound in the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we have to fight all over."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake when the FBI launches an investigation
"I thought that if we could achieve something similar to what he asked for - a study that is limited in time and extent - we might have a little agreement," Jeff Flake said on Saturday, and he allowed him to fear that the committee would be split because of deep-rooted party differences.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate the case?
Their contradiction is entirely due to the time.
The mid-year elections will take place in just five weeks, on 6 November. If the Republicans make a bad choice, which is expected, they will be severely weakened in their efforts to get the one they want to choose to the country's highest court.
George W. Bush has taken the phone and called senators to influence them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for Bush in the White House and through him met his wife Ashley, who was personally secretary to George W. Bush.
What happens after the FBI submits its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are now 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh can have at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice-President Mike Pence to break the death line and confirm his invasion of the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean dehumidifiers under Kim
The number of North Koreans jumping to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, says a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-seug, which quotes data from the Ministry of Association of South Korea, says that 1 127 people jumped last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park says that stronger border controls between North Korea and China and higher taxes on human migrants are important causes.
Pyongyang has not come with any public comments.
The vast majority of North Korea's freelance is finally offered by South Korean citizenship.
According to Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them fly through China, which has the longest border to North Korea and whose border is easier to cross than the severely monitored demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Korean states.
China sees the riots as illegal migrants rather than refugees and often sends them back with violence.
The relationship between the North and the South, which is technically still in war with each other, has improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two Pyongyang countries met for talks focusing on the ongoing negotiations on nuclear disarmament.
This happened after the historic meeting in June between President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed in general terms to work to free the Korean peninsula from nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, the Foreign Minister of North Korea, Ri Yong-ho, accused the US of the failure to succeed since then.
"Without confidence for the United States, there is no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we can absolutely not disarm ourselves unilaterally first," Ri said at a speech in the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical", and says that he is unfit to serve in the Supreme Court
The Minority Leader in the Chamber, Nancy Pelosi, called the candidate to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said that he was inattentive of temperament to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosis comments came in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin in Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman had said so, she would be called 'hysterical'," Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony in front of the Senate's justice committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh became emotional when he denied the charges of having sacrificed Dr. Christine Blasey Ford sexually when they were both teenagers.
During his opening presentation, Kavanaugh was deeply touched, and then he cried almost, and the voice stopped talking about his family and his years in high school.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in the Committee, and said that the charges against him were a "great and coordinated murder" organised by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she felt that Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not serve in the Supreme Court because it showed that he was partial to the detriment of the Democrats.
"I think he's disqualificating himself with his statements and the way he attacked the Clinton and the Democrats," she said.
Pelosi hesitated when she was asked if she would try to put Kavanaugh in court if he was attacked and if the Democrats get a majority in the House.
"I can say this - if he does not tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he is not only inappropriate to sit in the Supreme Court, but also to work in that court he is at the moment," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge of the Court of Appeal in Washington D.C.
Pelosi allowed her as a democrat to be concerned about what decisions Kavanaugh may have to take against the Affordable Care Act or the abortion of Roe vs. Wade, as he is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmatory inquiries, Kavanaugh avoided questions as to whether he would change certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
It is not an opportunity for a hysterical and partial person to sit in the courtroom and expect us to all applaud," Pelosi said.
Women have to stand out.
It is a just criticism, months and years of anger that boils over, and she cannot get it out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," said Ms. Steinem to me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's unusual.
And she continued, "I got good help from a woman who was a CEO somewhere. She said she also cried when she got angry, but had developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and started crying, she said to the person she spoke to: 'You might think I'm sorry because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then she went on.
I thought it was bright."
Tears are allowed to get out of anger in part because they are often misunderstood at the bottom.
One of my most clear memories of one of my first jobs in a man-dominated office, where I once wept of indescribable anger, was that I was taken in the arms of an older woman. It was a cool boss that I had always been a little scared of, and she dragged me into a stairwell.
"Let them never see you cry," she said to me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sorry, and they're happy that they were able to pressure you."
Patricia Schroeder, then Democratic Congressman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Hart was caught up with an out-of-court business on a boat called Monkey Business and got out of the campaign, a very frustrated Schroeder felt that there was no reason not to investigate the idea of putting himself up in the presidential election.
"It wasn't a well thought-out decision," she said with a laugh to me 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates, the last one they needed was another.
Someone called it "Snow and the Seven Dwarves."
Because she was late out, she was lying behind with the money collection, and promised not to go in as a candidate if she didn't get $2 million together.
It was a project that was doomed to fail.
She discovered that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men just gave her $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she wondered.
When she announced in a speech that she would not start a formal presidential campaign, she was so overwhelmed by feelings, gratitude to those who had supported her, frustration over the system that made it so difficult to collect money and address the electorate rather than delegates, and hatred of sexism, that the voice got stuck.
"You could have believed that I had had a nervous breakdown," recalls Schröder near the press.
"You could have believed that Kleinex was my business sponsor.
I remember thinking, "What are they going to write on my grave?"
"She cries?"
Why the US-China trade war can be good for Beijing
The opening era of the US-China trade war was ear aggravating. The war is far from over, but the gap between countries can benefit the Chinese government in the long term, according to experts.
US President Donald Trump launched the first warning squad earlier this year by covering important Chinese exports such as solar panels, steel and aluminium with customs.
The most important hit came this week, with new customs duties on goods for $200 billion. This means in practice that half of all goods coming into the United States from China are taxed.
Peking has responded with the same coin every time, and recently, between five and ten percent of American goods were dropped for $60 billion.
China has promised to match the US's action. The world's next largest economy will probably not step down within an overtime period.
To get Washington back means to bow to demands, but to make the U.S. public cry would be enough for China's president Xi Jinping.
However, experts believe that if Beijing plays its short right, the US trade war can provide positive support to China in the long term by reducing the mutual dependence of the two economies.
"A quick political decision in either Washington or Beijing can create conditions for economic panic in the country, and it is actually much more dangerous than the viewers have previously wanted to recognize," says Abigail Grace, a research assistant focusing on Asia at the New American Security Center.
Syria 'redo' for returning refugees, according to the Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria says that the country is ready to receive voluntary return refugees and pleads for help to build the country, which lies in ruins after more than seven years of war.
In a speech before the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in the country are now improving.
"The situation in place today is more stable and secure, thanks to our success in combating terrorism," he said.
The government continues to build the areas that have been destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normality.
There are now all conditions for voluntary return of refugees to the country they were forced to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and livelihood.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have moved the country since the war began in 2011.
More than six million people still living in the country need humanitarian support.
According to Al-Moualem, the Syrian regime would welcome help to rebuild the devastated country.
But he stressed that it does not receive conditional support or assistance from countries that have supported the rebellion.
Europe won with the victory in Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe has won the 2018 Ryder Cup by winning the US team with the end of 16.5 against 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris in France.
The United States has now lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won again when the Danish captain Thomas Bjørn's team reached the 14.5 points required to beat the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who was able to fight hard during most of the tournament, landed in the water at the launch of the 16th pair of holes, and lost against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari shined in all rounds and became one of four players who ever made 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament was introduced in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth released 5 & 4 of the European team's lowest ranking players, Thorbjørn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's highest ranking player, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 & 1 against Ian Poulter from England, who could have made his last Ryder Cup.
The Spaniard Sergio Garcia, who is a veteran with eight Ryder Cup behind him, became the most successful European ever with 25.5 career points.
"I don't use crying, but today I can't help it.
It's been a tough year.
I'm so grateful that Thomas chose me and believed me.
I'm so happy, so happy to win back victory.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I could be of help," said a touched Garcia after the European team won.
He left his countryman John Ram to defeat the American golfer Tiger Woods 2&1 in a single Sunday.
"I am raised to look at him," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France, and now has the result 13-21-3 for his career in Ryder Cup.
A remarkable statistics for one of the world's best players ever, who have won 14 major titles, which has only been surpassed by Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA fought all weekend to find fairway, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-class golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk said after the team's downfall performance, "I'm proud of these guys, they've fought.
It was the day of the morning when we increased the temperature in Europe.
We took the trap.
Hated for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players played really well.
We're going to regroup, I'm going to work with the U.S. PGA tour and our Ryder Cup committee, and then we're going on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be the captain.
You get bows and bows.
They played better than we."
Algae flowering: The stops decrease in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report from the Florida Fisheries and Forestry Commission shows a general decrease in algal flowering concentrations for parts of the area around Tampa Bay.
