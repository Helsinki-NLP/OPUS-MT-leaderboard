He's stronger than I am.
I'm the last one to see them.
I'll keep it.
That man is a soldier.
I thought Tom was guilty.
I played that song so much I could do it while I slept.
I want to borrow his car for an hour.
I can't stop laughing.
South Africa became independent in 1961.
I think Tom's eating right now.
I could have done better.
I have some English books.
Can you make them smile?
Tom can go if he wants to.
I want to work with you.
I love wearing sports clothes.
Why were you so shy?
Tom and Mary bragged about each other.
I don't even have a job.
I like to imitate Queen Elizabeth.
We should have told him the truth.
I'm so proud of them.
Who is he?
Is the supermarket open tonight?
I told Tom exactly what I saw.
Mr. Suzuki teaches us English.
What is the best way to travel?
Tom lives here with you?
What's the matter, honey?
I don't want them angry.
Is Tom really sick?
You didn't wash your hair.
I read your letter yesterday.
Go to the supermarket once a week.
Can I marry my aunt's husband's nephew?
I believe them.
She was fun with her son's bag.
I said it was okay.
I have no reason not to trust Tom.
He was the first to help her.
Are the kids already asleep?
We have to wait here.
I'm Chinese.
Tom wasn't very active.
We cleaned the way from the snow yesterday.
I'm not busy right now.
Tom doesn't think he'll win.
Maybe he should listen.
He's a brilliant artist.
Give me a move, guys.
I like your painting.
I waited an hour and a half.
I'm not good at math.
Tom refused to say what he did.
I don't like his hat.
I can't be happy when Tom's so sad.
I want to share this with you.
Study at the University of Hyogo.
We'll take part in the marathon.
Maybe you should tell her.
I know what to study.
His life went on without problems.
Nobody wants to help.
They speak very quickly.
Tom was lucky at first.
It's urgent to go to the bathroom.
Mary really looks like her mother.
He didn't have any money to buy the farm.
How often do you go to the movies?
Are you religious?
Did he talk to you?
Is there a lot of sharks in these parts?
Tomorrow, if God wants, we'll be with your parents.
It comes from Sweden.
He didn't have any money to buy the farm.
Did you really believe that?
Tom decided to sell his car.

I feel protected.
You're the tallest.
Isn't this fun, Tom?
Tom was born in October.
It's a nice picture.
I'll leave her alone.
Tom won't even look after me.
We humiliated them.
He's already here.
I know who my enemy is.
Tom needs to sleep now.
Tom's not honest.
Tom's father is a cop.
Tom's working here?
That's what Tom was looking for.
What did you do to her?
Tom wanted to send a message.
I wasn't happy to see you.
Don't break my heart.
I don't have plans for tonight.
Stop being sarcastic!
She was crying.
I wish I could be rich like you.
We're having fun.
She's dissatisfaction.
I often read books.
Tom and I want to talk to you about something.
I can meet you at 2:30.
Tom got upset.
I'm already old.
I've got the dirty criminal fidin.
Good night, my friends.
I bought a book in English in a library.
I'm going to the library tomorrow to buy books.
What would the world be without women?
They tell us funny stories.
Can you hear what Tom's saying?
What's your favorite historical movie?
We can't see her.
Tom and I still love each other.
Tom needs to eat.
Come on, everybody.
Giant pandas live only in China.
I'm being followed.
Don't say anything like that.
Bad ass!
Jim's Canadian.
You did well here.
Where did all the others go?
I'm relaxed.
The animal was walking in the field.
He entered his private life.
Can I borrow your knife?
I'm late for an appointment.
Tom's still absent.
I ate all the apple.
Swallow the bakri while the pen is heated.
Is the park open today?
We only cook eggs.
We're leaving Boston tomorrow morning.
We can't leave you there.
Tom was playing football.
Stop whining.
I know her.
The real heroes are us.
We're waiting for Tom.
Unfortunately, my birthday is only once a year.
Put your bike away.
I understood it as a compliment.
They called President Roosevelt a pirate.
I could go to the movies.
It's not an appointment.
It makes me nervous.
Who do you think you told them?
Why did Tom give it to Mary?
Listen to her!
It's good in this game, isn't it?
Take care of them.
I live on the Fiji Islands.
You want to eat with us?
It doesn't seem too surprised.
I'm not going to school on Saturday.
It's my job to protect you.
Tom's engaged, isn't he?
Does this cage have the purpose of protecting against sharks?
Tom wants to know Mary better.
I'm very disappointed.
Tom wants more coffee.
Who do you think is the author of this novel?
I wish you had called me.
Don't you want to use it?
I played the trumpet when I was younger.
I'm faithful.
Do you want to write it in your brain?
I don't know what happened to him.
I'm free today.
Why do you want to kill us?
He ate a apple.
I caught him.
He adopted the orphan.
I guess they speak French.
Take a step forward.
You have to get more active.
Tom and Mary are joking?
She broke out of the smoke.
I don't have an alternative.
I think Tom knows who lives in that house.
He's smarter than he is.
What's he gonna do this summer?
He's getting irritated.
Can you speak Shanghai?
It was restricted because I washed it.
Tom was wearing an old pair of shoes.
Tom wondered what happened to Mary.
Something bad happened to them.
How much was paid?
They didn't touch anything.
Do you like horror movies?
I know a lot about animals.
Don't hold the fiat.
Am I in London?
She's still there with you, isn't she?
This will make a big difference.
Tom didn't have much money with him.
Tom doesn't have a great appetite.
Were you with them that night?
I was running.
The village was dead after the sunset.
What's your favorite rapper woman?
Say hello to Tom on my behalf.
It's nice to see her so happy.
I usually swim in summer.
Why are you leaving soon?
I'm pretty proud of it.
I smell gas.
I'll tell them it's not true.
Here's your picture.
I can depend on my friends.
The experiment confirmed his theory.
Tom's lucky.
Pass me the ketchup, please.
It happened that I sat next to her at a convention.
There are no furniture left in the room.
Tom soon presented himself for the lesson.
It's a little overcrowded, isn't it?
Who's the man playing the piano?
I decided not to do it again.
No, I haven't written it yet.
You have to listen to Tom.
I slept in the car.
Tom and I are going to Boston with Mary.
He spends all his income on drinking.
Search harder on Google!
It's not the only problem with your idea.
You talk like I'm the boss.
You want me to go with you?
I came to see her.
Does it look familiar?
I'll check your game tomorrow.
So, what should I tell him?
It's starting to rain.
Do you play any instruments?
Will they die?
I really like it.
You're coming in?
Tom killed her.
I don't feel it.
She's incredibly stupid.
We're landed on a lonely island.
He wants us to be patient.
He convinced the teacher.
When's your new novel coming out?
I would never betray her.
Are you aware of any problems?
The mystery remains unresolved.
I will never forget Germany.
Why didn't you call a doctor?
You're good.
How would you like to change it?
It's snowing today.
He made a promise to write me every week.
I'm not born deaf.
We should leave you alone.
I can't raise our son alone.
Go get some milk.
Tom seemed surprised.
I love to be right.
Tom married a rich girl in Boston.
I forgot if you drink wine or not.
Who warned them?
Have faith in God.
"I'll give 50 grand for this statue. "Who will offer more?"
Why would anyone want to kiss her?
He should have bought a used car.
I intend to stay at the hotel.
I didn't grow up like that.
You can park here.
Please tell him to take care of himself.
Tom hated them.
I love it almost every day.
I'm not gonna apologize.
We really like picnics.
I haven't talked to him yet.
It was a hot summer night.
I always walk.
It's decisive.
You're not very fun at parties, are you?
He searched his pocket for the keys to the car.
I really don't want to talk.
So he must be Argentine.
I really like my job.
I'd suggest you be more careful.
It's off.
He should have done it yesterday.
I'm a big fan of American cuisine.
Tom's dancing with Mary.
Your destiny is in my hands.
No, you don't have to go now.
Nobody wants to help you.
She'll be out in the afternoon.
He's blind.
We subscribe to a newspaper.
I thought it was a combination.
What images do you see when you look at that picture?
How many continents are in the world?
It's good to sing, isn't it?
Tom's mad at Mary, isn't he?
Your idea is superior to yours.
Tom never forgave me.
I'm the expert.

We're losing blood.
Chaucer and Boccaccio are two writers. The first is English, the second is Italian.

I'm still busy.
I appreciate your intuitions.
I went to the park this morning.
Tom loves fish on the fly.
We have no choice but to risk it.
I don't want to play chess.
Mary's jealous.
I should have changed the oil.
Do you have a calculator?
I asked him to stay.
If you really want to know, all you have to do is ask.
We need to inform Tom.
Tom's still asleep.
Tom's a little impulsive, isn't he?
You agree with Tom, right?
Tom didn't take much money.
Tom calculated his expenses.
It's not my idea of fun, but whatever you want.
Can you ask Tom to stop after work?
He sounds like a drummer.
It must be hot.

He took care of me.
I said I'd take it.
I knew they were watching me.
I have plans with them tonight.
I could meet someone who can help you.
You want to ride a bike?
These shoes are too small for me to wear.
I see a model.
You brought me a cup of tea without sugar.
It was published in 1969.
We've got to relax, and that's enough.
He's talking Chinese.
Tom told me he wanted to go to Boston.
London is smaller than Tokyo.
I'm three years older than you.
Look, I'll show you.
I said it was innocent.
Fear of failure is one of the most widespread fears in the world.
Why are you so jealous?
You think Tom killed Mary?
How come you never have anything to say?
Scandalous!
Come on, Tom, aren't you curious?
Keep your tongue in check.
I drank the wine.
He's more popular than I am.
When can I get out of here?
You're back in the early hours.
We left this.
All I want is fishing.
Do you want to take this?
Tom didn't want to go back to the orphanage.

I don't need your help anymore.
The problem is we don't know where Tom is.

She's full of bad news.
This car doesn't belong to me.
Are you listening, Tom?

Aren't you surprised?
It only costs one coin.
I hope Tom and Mary make a mistake.
My kitchen is too big!
Give them a moment.

I'll buy some flowers.
We're just making yummy food.
Pay attention to them.
She doesn't respect him.
I just told you the truth.
I'm no longer a teacher.
