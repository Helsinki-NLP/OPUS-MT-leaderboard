Foods due to European inflation
The main reason for the rise in inflation measured in the Eurozone is the rapidly rising food prices.
In the 13 Eurozone countries, fatigue was higher than expected in November - after 2.6 percent in October, an annual inflation rate of 3.1 percent was recorded, as reported by the EU Statistical Office in Luxembourg.
Official forecasts are only 3 percent, Bloomberg reported.
Unlike the U.S., British and Canadian notary banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not reduced the number of pipelines. According to their estimate, the increase in raw materials prices and the slight decline in unemployment would benefit the emergence of an inflation spiral.
The ECB seeks to keep the inflation rate below two percent, or at least close to the two-percent mark.
According to an analyst, the ECB is in the mill: inflation must be "resolved" in order to exclude the later need for action.
By 3.3 percent, the inflation rate in November in Germany reached a 12-year record height; in Spain, the rate increased from 3.6 to 4.1 percent.
The increased food and energy prices are responsible for the rise in inflation in the euro area.
The MATIF weight scores increased by 88 percent, and the Soya beans course also reached a record roof since 1973.
There was also a significant deterioration in food oil and milk products in 2007.
The world market price for crude oil increased by 52 per cent this year - in the past month, the price reached by a fraction of the black gold almost 100 US dollars.
According to the ECB, inflation will rise from 2.1 to 2.5 per cent in 2008, but it will fall to 1.9 per cent in 2009.
For the next 3-4 months, analysts go from a 3-percent inflation rate, but the annual average rate is 2.1 per cent.
For 2008, experts expect the ECB to reduce its interest twice.
Gallup faces government crisis
After a long period of stagnation, the number of Fidesz sympathies has grown significantly by the beginning of December. For the first time since 2002, the party has the largest base camp, while according to Gallup, the consent for the Socialists has reached a never-existent 13 percent threshold.
In the party voters, the difference is clearly due to the high determination of the opposition advocates: more than two thirds (71 percent) have a fifth (20 percent) agreement for the MSZP.
The MDFs and SZDSZ are based on a survey under the parliamentary approach: they come in the total population by two percent.
The number of party voters has increased by one percent in both camps.
Compared to the last depth, the general economic mood has continued to deteriorate - never before has the share of those who consider the country's economic situation to be "declared" was so high (41 percent), while another 46 percent considered them to be "degradable".
With more hopeful prospects in the spring and summer, families see the change in their financial situation again more pessimistic.
For the next year, the majority of the population will face a further deterioration in the situation; only a tenth will be improved.
A Gallup survey carried out in December revealed that 71% of respondents - a historical high - assessed the work of the Prime Minister as "more bad than right".
Thirty percent of the respondents have great trust or trust generally in Ferenc Gyurcsány, while the number of supporters for Viktor Orbán is 38 percent.
About 54% do not trust the head of government at all, compared with 27% mistrust against the head of Fidesz.
One of the indicators of the political mood is the number of those who think you could get the dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister even without government change.
After the disturbance in October, 35% of the government and the head of government had spoken of the rest of the government, this share is only 20% today, while the relative majority (33%) sees the solution only in new elections.
In response to their interest in the referendum, 60 percent replied that they would participate "in security", and another 20% would vote "probably".
For comparison: Parliament's elections would take place on Sunday, only 55 percent would go "safely" to the polls, another 15% would hold their participation for "probably". In view of these trends, the outcome of the referendum would be apparent.
74% would vote against the study fees, 79% against the practice fees, and 84% against the hospital tabloid.
Based on the group of participants in the "safety" referendum, even 81, 84, or 89 percent of the opponents of the study, practice and hospital fees would be included.
Auchan the most expensive, Tesco increases by almost a fifth
The hypermarkets in the Buddhist trading area have also maintained the average price increase of 16% this year, with the difference that there was no increase in VAT this year.
Article from Napi Masterság
The price of the usual Christmas basket of the "Nappi" has also increased by 16 percent this year in Buda’s trade triangle, however, price increases of over 1,000 HUF have been recorded in all hypermarkets.
After the prices in the food markets have been "davongaloped" in last December, the poisoning is not 100% sharp, compared to the high, earlier level of output.
However, it certainly seems frightening to consumers that what they had paid for in the last year much less than 9,000 HUF is not even available for 10,000 HUF this year.
The price of the "Nappi" basket exceeds the magic 10,000 HUF limit at least 91 HUF in the markets under investigation.
The highest price was 10.573 HUF.
(The price was 6800 HUF.)
The prices for Unicum and living fish remained almost at year-old level, but prices for Putenbrush, Nuss and Mohn have increased greatly.
Prices for flour and bread correspond to the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary, but at Auchan there were 1kg bread weeks for 139 Forint.
There was no competitive price shock in the product at less than 200 Forint.
Also surprising was the price of a two-litre bottle of Coca-Cola Pfand bottle of less than 200 Forint, which cost the drink including Pfand only 257 HUF.
However, this year's "Nappi" comparison cut Auchan the most expensive, and Cora cut off the cheapest.
Our calculations have shown that Cora has increased prices in the "Nappi" shopping cart compared to Christmas prices last year by 15, while Tesco and Auchan have increased by 18 percent each.
The difference between the cheapest shopping cart of the previous year and the most expensive of the current year was 12%, while the increase between the cheapest shopping cart of the last year and the most expensive of the current year was 21%.
The average price increase was 1,480.00 HUF.
The average price increase was still at 1,206.00 Forint in the previous year, however, the increase in VAT at the last Christmas prices was noticeable.
That is exactly what the trade is all about: it seems that the goods houses were not able to decide exactly what price range they should apply to the individual articles, since the effects of the price increase on consumer behaviour were invisible.
(If the trader plans the turnover of a product bad, it may fall for substantial gains in the price range which is based on the traffic intensity.)
The value of the "Nappi" basket fell radically last year, so that the most expensive basket exceeded the value of 2006 by 1720 Forint, whereas the price difference in the cheapest basket was only 844 Forint.
This year such extremes were not observed, as the most expensive basket at 1.630,00 Forint cost more than in the previous year, and even at the cheapest there was a price increase of 1.284,00 Forint.
Compared to the last two Christmas season, a catastrophic price increase was shown, the price of daily consumer goods in the hypermarkets increased by more than 30 percent in less than 20 months.
(In turn, this does not necessarily confirm the data of the Central Statistical Office of Hungary: In some basic foods, the Statistical Office established a more than 30 per cent increase over a 12-month period.
The same is true in the case of eggs near mel.)
However, if you take a look at the "Nappi" shopping cart, it seems almost impossible for the latter, since the price level of the product already present in the previous year has hardly increased by more than 10 percent in the worst case.
Apparently, the suppliers are in a stronger position than the suppliers - however, they were able to deny the drastic price increase on the multis.
In the golden trade triangle, the hypermarkets do not complain; it is reported over the years.
Our experience shows that the majority of customers in the three goods houses don't even look at the prices anymore.
It is purchased from all large quantities, durable food goes into pallets over the chargers.
On Wednesday morning, in all three stores there were endless snakes at the Kassa, as the number of customers exploded suddenly.
However, a lower customer frequency is reported from the country, so that many multiples complain about the opinion researchers, they could not even reach the planned turnover, not only for food, but also for sustainable consumer goods.
Variety is delivered to disinfectants
Today, more than a thousand infections have been recorded in hospitals that have resulted in inappropriate treatment of antibiotics.
The hygienic conditions in hospitals, the overcompensation of beds, the overload of staff - all factors that are not directly relevant to the eradication of infections, so the leading physician of the National Epidemiology Centre.
Various sites are also saved by disinfectants.
In the traumatology department of the János Hospital, a MRSA infection was recently diagnosed.
The antibiotic resistant bacteria were found in a male patient who was delivered to the hospital after a serious accident.
The patient was isolated.
At the beginning of the year, there was already a similar infection.
The injury of a serious car accident was released from the hospital, however, shortly thereafter the man had to return with a MRSA infection. An important operation has since been unable to be performed due to the bacteria that are still in the patient's body.
By December 10th of this year, infections caused by multi-resistant miscarriage were reported to the National Nosocomialis Surveillance System, so the leading doctor of the National Epidemiology Centre, Karolina Böröcz.
So many infections caused by multi-resistant insects were safely registered in the hospitals, but the number of darkers may be higher.
About two thirds of the infections (683 cases) were triggered by the MRSA, which is produced by staphylococcus aureus resistant to methicillin-oxacillin.
The Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria carry about one third of the people in their nose without causing a disease.
SA-conditioned infections (such as throat inflammation, mandel inflammation, inflammation of the skin or wounds) usually respond well to antibiotics, they are well healthy.
However, if the drugs are too high or used inadvertently, they are produced from the well-responsive bacteria antibiotics that spread rapidly under appropriate conditions in the hospitals.
In particular, in patients with weak, or permanently poorly functioning immune system, but also in older, or in patients with low body weight, these bacteria can cause severe infections such as wind infection or blood poisoning, i.e. sepsis.
According to the medical director of the János Hospital, the MRSA infection is nothing special, such events are part of the hospital day.
The infection should not be confused with the epidemic, encouraged by Tibor Nyulasi - MRSA there is only where it is not sought.
Antibiotic resistance
"So many patients are isolated, the care staff wear rubber gloves and masks in the supply, and we have the antibiotics needed for treatment" - said Tibor Nyulasi.
Although patients are being investigated for MRSA during their hospital delivery, an infection cannot always be avoided.
Samples too rare
Most of the infections caused by MRSA in hospitals would be preventable, however, the current prevailing conditions and circumstances are unfavourable for preventing the emergence or spread of the multi-resistant breeder, says Karolina Böröcz.
After this infection occurs mainly in hospitals and nursing homes, the hospital should examine the patients who have been delivered and isolate MRSA infected immediately.
However, in Hungarian hospitals, microbiological sampling is not so often practiced.
Not least because there are no subsidies for this investigation on the part of the State Hospital.
Most of the cases, therefore, come to light on a daily basis only if the patient already has a significant MRSA infection, the medical head of the epidemiology centre.
On the European Union side, there are strict recommendations for the appropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine, but there are also guidelines in Hungary for the treatment of certain infections and disease images.
Antibiotic therapy should be targeted, i.e. microbiological tests are necessary in order to prevent resistance to the drug, however, this directive is not always respected by hospitals.
Among the ambulances, or in the basic care patients, microbiological samples are even more rare, according to Karolina Böröcz.
Disinfection medicines are used.
Scientific evidence is that MRSA is transferred from one patient to the other by the most frequent maintenance staff.
This is why the washing of hands, or the wearing of gloves and masks is of great importance, but there are also significant deficiencies in the hospitals in this area.
MRSA is transmitted by foot-and-mouth infection or contact, but in home hospitals there is not always the possibility of insulating the infected patients.
The rooms are often filled, the beds are hardly arranged, although from an epidemiological point of view there should be a distance of at least 1.5 meters between them.
As Karolina Böröcz further notes, unfortunately, in the less well-funded hospitals, there are few caregivers, many patients - all factors that just favour the emergence of infections.
Such infections are proven to be much less frequent, or the further spread of the breeder may be stopped where these protective measures are taken, says Karolina Böröcz.
Government programme against MRSA
MRSA infections in the grip cause the health insurance enormous costs, so they are fought everywhere.
In England, for example, the prevention of MRSA, or its exclusion, was established in the government programme.
After first signs, the program is successful - as published data are presented, the trend of MRSA infections in England is slow.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention (ECDC) has declared prevention of the emergence of multi-resistant agents (including MRSA) and prevention of infections in hospitals as one of its priorities.
Deadliner policy was not drunk
In the case of the car accident caused by the police chief of the XXII district with a fatal outcome, the official opinion is now available.
Attila Morvai, who was the press speaker of the Budapest Supreme Prosecutor on Friday after the official hearing of the case, was neither alcoholized nor under drug influence.
The opinion confirmed the results of the first investigation, according to which the police officer had not consumed alcohol before he was taxed.
The former police officer, with his own pkw in the XXII district, entered the Kossuth Lajos Street and had passed over a 55-year-old man who crossed the road to an unmarked place.
(In the opinion of StVO, however, this is not a mild situation - the linker has, even if pedestrians do not cross the road on the Zebra Strip, the example .)
After his delivery to the hospital, the pedestrian suffered his injuries.
According to police reports, the Linker suffered a shock, then withdrew his functions and sought retirement.
The Budapest State Prosecutor has initiated his investigations as a matter of fact.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former police chief had cooperated with the investigators from the beginning.
Another EUR 400 million for infrastructure
Finance Minister János Veres and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB) signed three credit agreements in Budapest on Friday at a total of EUR 400 million.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) approved a EUR 300 million framework for the financing of transport and environmental protection projects implemented with Cohesion Fund grants.
The amount of EUR 150 million agreed in the loan agreement should also be applied to the budgetary financing of education projects.
The EIB has approved a total of EUR 300 million for this purpose for Hungary; the use of the remaining EUR 150 million will be decided later in the context of the extension of the credit agreement.
In the area of innovation, the Contracting Parties have signed an agreement of EUR 50 million, which will flow mainly in research and development programmes at the University of Debrecen.
At the meeting, the 4 U-Bahnline also came into the language.
It was agreed that as soon as Hungary clarified the details of the EU's U-Bahn financing, the original contract and possible modifications will be re-examined.
According to János Veres, this would be possible in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed 113 projects totaling EUR 8.4 billion in Hungary.
Credit interest is linked to EURIBOR, the loan is provided by the EIB with an eight-year increase, free of commission.
Bulgaria, the EU's real estate paradise
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is fabulous - the whole of Europe is paying attention to the recently mentioned Balkan state.
What, where, and who buys the EU's even cheaper market, but more rapidly?
An analysis of the Bulgarian Re/Max Division.
Bulgaria is currently the most desirable patch for real estate purchases in Eastern Europe, with cheap ski apartments and houses on the sea.
Among the mountains, the regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pamproro and Vitosa are the most popular, on the sea are Albena, the "gold coasts", the "sun coasts", and the historic cities of Sozopol and Nessebar the riders, however, property around Kavarna and Balcik are still more and more asked.
According to estimates by Re/Max analysts in Bulgaria, the country's interior also attracts investors sooner or later, such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, and Triavna, as well as the prominent economical areas of Russia lists more buyers.
The capital of Sofia also offers promising offers - trade and office areas offer the highest returns.
Bulgaria is the best way to become one of the most attractive European golf paradises, thus attracting tourists in the two other seasons, in addition to the summer and winter season.
Therefore, prospective investors are already buying in the big style, for example around Bansko.
According to analysts, people who acquire properties in Bulgaria also seek to change their lifestyle.
Most buyers are English, but there are also interested people from France, Belgium, Spain, and more from Romania.
Investors from Malta and Cyprus are also present, while in the Black Sea and in the ski areas there are mainly Russian buyers.
There are three groups of foreign buyers, says Georgi Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Those who want to go down buy either revitalised properties by 50-100,000 euros, or down the houses by 5-15.000 euros, which they then renew themselves.
Good connectivity and accessibility as well as communication opportunities are written large, but also the proximity to a big city, shops and doctors are crucial for the buyers.
The second category includes those who are looking for a holiday destination (Bulgaria was listed under the top ten holiday destinations of the Germans in December).
The third group consists of business people who invest in medium to long-term value increases.
Real estates in the capital are becoming more expensive in the process, conditional on the ever-growing demand.
In the EU, real estate prices are the lowest in Bulgaria, but in the past five years there has been a price increase of 21 per cent per year.
The depreciation at the real estate prices is far higher than the increase of the salaries.
Fodor and the six Hungarian percentages
As Minister of the Environment Gábor Fodor announced, the expert meetings will end on Tuesday, and the debate on the international climate regime after 2012 will continue by the ministers on Wednesday after the official opening.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries advise on the Bali Roadmap, which sets the emission reduction measures for the period after 2012, i.e. after the end of the Kyoto Protocol.
At present, there is a strong debate between industrial and developing countries.
The US has already signalled that they do not want to negotiate concrete figures, but would be ready to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 by 25-40 percent compared to 1990.
The other major question of the conference is whether the industrial states are willing to support the developing countries financially and technologically, in addition to reducing emissions.
An agreement was also reached on the support of developing countries.
The adaptation fund submitted to the Kyoto Protocol is to be managed by a 16-capable Council, expected at the Global Environment Facility (GEF) of the UN, as is to be read in the "Piac es profit".
Hungary 6 percent
On behalf of Hungary, Minister for the Environment, Gábor Fodor supports the EU's efforts to maintain its leadership in global climate protection measures and to reach a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister explained that by 2020, the EU will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 20% (in line with the 1990 values), whether the 2012 Agreement is successful or not. The Union would even be ready to use for a 30% reduction if other major industrial countries of the world, or developing countries, are also willing to comply with their obligations by force and responsibility.
Gábor Fodor stressed that the goal of the countries that had acceded to the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 was only 5.2 percent reduction, whereas the EU, with its 15 Member States at the time, had already committed itself to a 8% reduction.
The target for Hungary is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 6% compared to the years 1985-87 - a requirement that the country will fully comply with as reflected in the Ministry of the Environment's press release.
The use is high in Bali - however, the long-term international climate policy agreement must be completed within two years, otherwise it would enter into force with certainty only after 2012. In this case, the reduction projects set out in the Kyoto Protocol would not follow a new, international emission reduction system, whose importance is also the IPCC, the international scientific climate change committee of the UN in its latest report, with the prize of peace.
This would delay the emission reduction, and the increase in the average temperature of the earth at more than 2°C would be inevitable, which, according to scientists, would have extremely severe and irreparable consequences.
British Army on YouTube
British Army units have published recordings of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan for the purpose of increasing popularity on the video portal.
First of all, the British Air Force (RAF) has discovered YouTube for itself: Special units stationed in Afghanistan have been uploading videos on the Taliban-led operations network since March 2006, reports the BBC.
The footage of the helmen-based miniature cameras are controlled at the Kandahar Air Force Base and then sent to London, where they are placed on the Internet.
Political message inescapable
Air Force soldiers have already completed 139 such recordings, their "channel" has been seen more than 75,000 times.
The British Ministry of Defence was registered under "defencehead quarters" in spring 2007 to publish videos about Iraqi and Afghan operations, but also the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Commonware Office) and the international peace troops (MNFIs) stationed in Iraq have their own YouTube channels.
Use in Afghanistan
The Air Force originally published the videos aimed at recruiting soldiers and, as the Ministry of Defence says, the contributions also serve the purpose of informing the population about the actual objectives of foreign interest.
Such a kind of propaganda published is almost free of charge compared to conventional television advertising, so defense expert Gordon Mackenzie to BBC, however, these videos always have a certain degree of political message in their own way, as they affirm the right of existence of the military measures decided by the government.
Advertise Americans with game
However, the army also has to fight amateur recordings, which, in addition to carefully processed, create censored recordings in the network - such as those that show the death of soldiers: in the somewhat hypocritical, "official" propaganda films are spoken of the greatest loss, but the bloody sides of the war are not shown.
From the war scenes in Iraq and Afghanistan, many of the videos that have already been used have been uploaded to the platform, but these "gattung" have only recently been discovered for themselves.
The Americans are throwing something else, namely with the free downloadable shot "American Army", in which the player can slide into the soldier's skin as part of a more or less live-stream simulation.
Christmas party with Tombola and Pogatsche in the Ministries
Minister of Labour Monika Lamperth is not shy: instead of a Christmas festival, she holds a working conference where her employees can let the year 2007 off with coffee and potion.
Some ministries celebrate with live music, other charming Christmas moods with tombola or attacks into the officials' hearts.
Party, Christmas mood, concerts and buffets - so the power celebrates.
The Christmas fever has already taken over the offices.
The largest holiday of a ministry will be held in the defence resort today, but the employees of the Ministry will not be expected to do so.
At the "Winter Festival of Waiss" children are donated by fallen soldiers, at which "Mission Festival" family members are assessed by soldiers currently stationed abroad, but there is also a reception for the press.
The resort provides about 25 million for the holidays.
Compared to other resorts, the National Agency for Development (NFC) and the Ministry for Economic and Transport on the strands.
The 4.32 million Forint expensive Christmas celebration of the Ministry of Economic Affairs is held in the house of the future, about 350 of the 600 employees are expected.
The focus of the celebrations is on Christmas, but there will also be live acts and a tombola release.
The National Agency for Development (NFÜ) held its 4.7 million forint expensive Christmas celebration at the National Court of Justice (OIT) on Wednesday, with concerts and a party.
The property was 1 million Forint, the rest was issued for the more than 400 guests loaded.
According to our information, an NFC department is also invited to another Christmas celebration organised by the Hungarian Economic Development Centre (MAG Zrt) from EU money.
For the festival, the building of the play theatre ("Vígszínház") was rented.
The MAG Zrt has not confirmed this information since we have not reached the competent authorities.
What's the suit?
The ILO building was open not only to the guests of the NFÜ, but also to the Ministry of Justice and Police, which held the Lucia ball there instead of a Christmas celebration on 7 December.
They did not have to pay rent to the ILO for the use of the premises.
Around 500 visitors came to the ball.
The celebrations were opened with a speech from the Minister, after which the dinner was performed live music.
At the request of [origo] one reported: There was no ball dress or dress obligation on the ball.
The ministries of health, work, and self-government are preparing for Puritan celebrations.
The Ministry of Health organizes the celebration for employees in their own four walls for about 400,000 Forint.
Minister Monika Lamperth officially invites her employees not to a Christmas party, but to the conference on the occasion of the year.
It is estimated that there are about 180 guests, who - so the press department - are treated only with coffee and pogatische, and the celebration is 350,000 forint.
Minister of Management Gordon Bajnai will simply strike with his colleagues in the Department's Chamber.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) organizes a Christmas celebration in its own living room, to which 436 employees are expected.
The expenditure was measured with 2,500 forint per head - for this money there is a buffet receipt with subsequent attacks.
Since the beginning of the term of office of János Veres, the PM staff have been celebrating this way every year.
However, there will not be a proper party vote - not only because of the Minister's official speech but also because the afternoon celebration was set up.
On 20 January, the Ministry of Agriculture invites a New Year's reception, the Ministry's Christmas celebration falls this time.
Hundreds of guests are asked to the Vajdahunyad Castle in the city park ("Városliget"); according to the location, the costs are estimated with 1,000 Forint per guest.
As the press department reports, it will be a very simple step forward to which only foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary will be loaded.
The receptions that will be held each year are traditionally starting with a short address by the Minister and sounding with lagging ears.
As the relevant press outlets report on [origo] demand, there will not be a Christmas celebration at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or at the Ministry of Education.
Asked for the cost of Christmas celebrations, there was no information available at the Department of the Environment.
In any case, more than 400 guests were invited to the festival, which will be held in the Museum of Art.
More and more forces mobilized for giant strikes
The League trade unions and the Hungarian trade union federation form their coordination committee on Friday for the indefinite period beginning on Monday.
A protest assembly will be held on Saturday, on Monday - on the day of the national vote on the Health Insurance Act - the job is beginning to fall.
It is calculated with strike-conditions, significant traffic barriers, as rail traffic is almost completely adjusted, and also the Budapest public transport companies (BKV) are closing until 13 o'clock.
Details about the strike on Monday will be shared by the League of Trade unions and the Federation of Trades on Friday afternoon.
A LIGA - MOSZ strike committee is also established, which is responsible for coordinating the actions on Monday.
A protest assembly will be held on Saturday, and from Monday all the organizations that have joined the strike will be putting down the work for an indefinite period, unless agreement is reached with the government.
In other words, the end of Parliament's vote on the Health Insurance Act was not defined.
If the National Council does not adopt the Health Insurance Act, trade unions shall withdraw the call for strike immediately.
However, if the law is passed, the strike committees will come together to discuss further action.
Due to the agenda of the National Council on Monday, it is even likely that it will come only in the late evening hours, or even at midnight, to vote on the Health Insurance Act.
The strike starting on Monday will have to take account of significant traffic barriers: the railways are putting their work down for an indefinite period, the majority of public transport and more than half of the Volán companies remain silent.
At the same time, there will be a lot of road closures in a direction.
The call to strike is followed by numerous trade unions and civil organisations - the list of participants is being updated on the Liga website.
Some organizations have announced strikes at an indefinite time, others are planning a long-term downturn.
Until Thursday afternoon, between the Hungarian railway MÁV and the free trade union of the railway VDSZSZ, there was still no agreement on adequate services, although around Christmas, more and more people are traveling with the train.
According to previous reports, the BKV from the start of operations is reached at 13 a.m., at Budapest Airport between 7 and 9 a.m., the LIGA power and heat trade unions are putting down the work for four hours, and the teacher trade union, for example, has called for 2 or 2-8 hour strikes.
The Hungarian Association of Doctors extends across the country at different times, the EDPS, the Democratic Union of Health and Social Workers, a sub-organisation of the SZEF, the Forum for Cooperation of Trade Unions, holds a two-hour warning course.
The most important of the four points required by the League is that the government takes back the draft for the reform of health insurance and submits a new concept for social discourse.
The second claim concerns the gradual introduction of the new pension calculation model, which will be due from next year.
Claim number three means that the eligible occupational group will be able to access the early retirement system before 2010.
The fourth point is that the VDSZZZ, which belongs to the Liga trade unions, did not accept the offer by the Ministry of Transport and is now calling for a new concept.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guard Increases State Risk
According to the Risk Analysis Division of Political Capital, the activities of the Hungarian Guard established in August with the support of the "Moving for a Better Hungary" have increased the risk of Hungary and the region in several respects.
The Institute's "risk warning report" includes: In connection with the activities of the Hungarian Guard, the highest political risk is the "enhancing of the already existing ethnic tensions between the Roma and the non-Zieun population in Hungary, which could lead to even short-term violent ethnic conflicts".
The main reason for this is the strategy of the Hungarian Guard, which is probably aimed at the provocation of such conflict, is the research institute.
As reported, this will be seen as a failure by the political leaders: "People of public life have left the discussion of the Roma question representatives of radical political groups who have now built their political strategy on the Roma-Hungarian opposition."
This is supposed to reinforce the problem, make it impossible to dialogue, favour extremes, and increase the likelihood of violent conflicts.
In addition, the research institute believes that the activities of the Hungarian Guard, not least thanks to the enormous attention of the domestic and foreign media, "the image of Hungary abroad has been seriously damaged, in particular with regard to confidence in stability and democratic maturity".
We remember: Since autumn 2006, the reorganisation of radical and extremely right groups in Hungary has been continuously underway, so since summer 2007, several organisations have been established calling themselves "national self-defence association".
"These groups are meant to define themselves as a civil organization each while they openly urge their members to prepare defence tasks (catastrophe protection, national defence, law enforcement), calling for the inviolability of the police, the army, or the state itself," it said.
And further: This is all done according to the method that tries to make different political and party-based efforts as a citizen initiative based on the political and political crisis of the population.
The emphasis on the civil character and the form of the association is therefore not just the conversion of legal courts that could occur in the course of the registration in court - it is a political strategy at the same time.
As the analysis is to be taken, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are also a risk-increasing factor for relations with neighbouring countries.
"In recent months, the Hungarian Guard has been cited as a potential risk source in several neighbouring countries, so some ultra-nationalist politicians of certain neighbouring countries see the confirmation of its own anti-Hungarian policy in the formation of the Hungarian Guard.
All of this has an impact on the political stability of the region" - it was called.
From the perspective of the Institute of Research, the establishment of the Hungarian Guard is not a single phenomenon in Central Eastern Europe, so the political risk for the entire region is growing.
As reported, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are comparable to those of the Bulgarian National Guard, whose foundation was announced in August 2007 by the right-wing Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
In the background of the emergence of the Bulgarian Guard, the Roma mass explosions took place in a city district of Sofia (Krasna Poljana).
The UNB has taken the occasion to establish the National Guard, with the argument that the "national protection" organization is the goal.
In your opinion, in the past 17 years, a legitimate "significant error" was felt in Bulgaria, but the state remained silent and independent - so political capital.
And further: the initiative would have left a strong debate in the Bulgarian public.
As said, the increased risk of ethnic conflicts is also demonstrated by the fact that some Bulgarian Roma organisations have announced to establish their own garden for resistance purposes.
Since the activities of the Hungarian Guard have so far shown many similarities with those of the Bulgarian National Guard, it is not to be excluded that the Hungarian Roma also respond to threats by organizing their own protection, it is the risk warning report of Political Capital.
Attila Juhász, Director of Research at Political Capital said at the request of the news office: The risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
Annual risk analysis reports would be published and risk-modifying trends should be recognised, the public opinion will be informed as in the case of the issue of the risk warning report.
Holidays are not everywhere
In Hungary, celebration is regulated by law, so that the practice of redisposing the working days around the holiday has been established at the same time, however, it protects us in the coming year less than that.
In the EU and in America, there is something else that is understood under "Fairday".
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes between public holidays and working days.
Working days are usually church holidays, or are associated with significant historical events.
For example, we also celebrate New Year: both the last day of the old, and the first day of the new year are working days - the last to be able to rest the Silverster celebrations alone.
Throughout the year, we have a total of fourteen days of celebration.
The State Celebrations are the 15th of March, which reminds the Revolution of 1848, and the 23rd of October, the Memorial of the Revolution of 1956.
On August 20th, the State founded, on May 1st, the work is celebrated, and on November 1st and 2nd, we remember our death.
In addition, there are two holidays to Easter, Pingsten, and Christmas.
Since our national, national or religious holidays rarely fall on a weekend, the practice of "working days shift" has proved to be in cases where we would work only one day before or after the holiday.
However, the price of extended weekends is that we have to work very well on Saturdays before, or go to school.
Where this day, before or after the holiday, is finally to be completed, it shall be laid down by the Minister in his own Regulation for years.
The legislation applies equally to all employers and entrepreneurs, to public employees and public servants.
Only companies and facilities in which the operation is continued without interruption, i.e. on holidays, are excluded.
Today, the working order will only be brought about by the holiday of the end of the year: from December 24th, life will remain formal, since most days between Christmas and Silver will be equal to or the holiday that has been cancelled.
The next year more holidays will fall in the middle of the week, or at the end of the week, so that there will be fewer redistributions on working days than this year.
The calendar is first set on the day of work so that people can stay at home for four days.
Saturday, April 26 will be a working day so that Friday, May 2 can be a rest day.
The second re-disposal depends on the holiday on 23 October: on Saturday, 18 October, you will have to finish on Friday, 24 October.
The end of the year, however, will remain silent in the sign of the celebration, after the 24th of December everything will lie and will remain, even if Silverster falls on a Wednesday.
Six scary minorities to upset colleagues
E-mails that we forget to send, language messages that we never get - harmless lies that don't even happen to us anymore: they bring "color" to the workplace every day.
The question is whether to get used to these small inconveniences, or to be better faced with the challenge, and try to avoid these misunderstandings consciously for other bitter situations.
Tips.
"Sorry, I forgot to tell you that someone called from the marketing department" - says a colleague.
That you missed a meeting?
Best of all, you regret it and try to make it good again by perhaps calling at the marketing department and being humorous, you would have forgotten to post the message (this is the less common method).
Most of the time, it's done with an apology.
Before you sit down in a painful speech, you should think about how you can prepare your colleagues for a really unpleasant moment and try to avoid these situations consciously.
You want to borrow something that doesn't belong to you?
There's hardly anything more nervous than getting a document, office equipment, or the phone, but it's not there.
Yesterday the lifting device was still on the desk - is it out early today?
Or is the lost bullet writer discovered on a colleague's desk?
Without asking, you should not borrow anything from your colleagues, because they will be rightly angry if they find that something has gone away.
So, don't put envelopes or post-it out of the office in the bag, because it could meet one of your own: no more if you need it urgently.
Are you talking about the privacy of your colleagues?
There is no effective means to stop a trachea that has already been put into the world.
Who's with who, what's he doing?
Where and why?
The information (or suspicions) on the privacy of colleagues should not, as far as possible, bind everyone to the nose!
And if anyone opens and betrays his inner secret to us, we should not abuse this trust!
The best thing is to hesitate like a grave, instead of just pointing out those who are not present, even if others know about the problems of the colleague as well.
No reason for being ill?
If you are called to the office to report to you when calling on painful headaches, because you just feel uncomfortable, or just want to rest, you should be clear about one thing: your own work, unmoveable experiences, projects with fixed dates now have to be done instead of yourself.
So don't play bad with your colleagues!
If you already know on the morning that you will not be able to make it to the office the next day, or that something could happen between you, because you have to stay home, you should report it in time so that neither the colleagues nor the boss are unexpectedly confronted with the absence.
Total, Faces, Telephones
It is only in his work that he has been deepened, but is he suddenly disturbed by the voice of the colleagues?
Did you not want to hear a telephone conversation that you shouldn't have heard?
You should not talk to your colleagues with sums, singing, loud conversations (which are carried over their heads), drumming, persistent swimming or nuggets.
All of this can be very disturbing, even if they are not exactly in a task (writing, planning, organizing).
Is it always the other people's fault?
If a project is not completed within a time limit, if you have forgotten an important letter or message, you should not look for the fault of your own forgetfulness in others!
As far as possible, you should not talk about the chaos in the office or the loud colleagues!
The best thing is to admit his mistakes, and apologize if others have been affected!
The question of how to make the mistake again, or how to make the mistake, is just too much!
In the office - a feeling like home?
Training pants and sleeping: Comfortable for home, but has lost nothing in the office!
Not even then should you dress so badly if it would actually allow the workplace!
Just don't get too sloppy - you should respect your colleagues as well as yourself so that you dress properly in the office - if desired, also nice and elegant!
Everyone wants to make it right - or how to become uninterested for others
Stop and go traffic, the car in the middle of the morning.
The radio produces a rare melody: the sound of a ghost, paired with electronic effects.
I'll turn the volume up.
The tempo changes, to the previous sounds comes the bass, and as a real sound jewel a female choir.
It's the song "Wings of Love" by Zagar, which turns out to be mr2.
The home music scene hasn't just ravaged us for a long time with a qualitative electrotropical.
But now you even see the statue differently when you hear Zagar's new album.
The appearance of Yonderboi, so many new and exciting productions from the home digital underground scene slowly contribute to a change in the overall picture, and even though the Garagenrock with its guitar runquite is again "in", the home electrotropic proves: There are new under the sun.
Balázs Zságer started in Pécs, himself musicd in the band Yonderboi, before he - perhaps because a shop does not have two peppers - began to spread his own way.
The breakthrough with his project (Zagar) and his music, which melts elements from Jazz, Electronics, and Pop, was only when he was introduced to him when he was asked to compose the soundtrack for a film (e.g.
"season" by Ferenc Török).
The formation that began in smaller clubs was only known to the wider audience when the magazine "wan2" chose its first album from 2002 under the top 50 domestic albums and Zagar, together with Yonderboi, was almost the only marketable trend set in the West.
No doubt Zagar and his band "trendy", but it was not interested in whether they would carry this brand as well.
The band has responded how it should: with a new, even better album.
The new album now published with the title "Cannont Walk Fly Instead" could open up new ways for them, but the title already expresses the desire for continuity with the Pécser years.
The expression came from the time when Balázs Zságer was still on the way with another band.
The airy, flying performance would also be in order, however, in addition to the essential character of the music, which corresponds to the spirit of time and the trend - louder guitar, the influences of the rock'n'roll.
With these songs, the singer György Ligeti, who lives in England and works with the band "The Puzzle", presented himself at the premiere in the Millennium.
A song from the album has even made it a radio slogan - which has been recorded with the number "Wings of Love", with the participation of six domestic singers ("underground Divas"), successfully placed the earworm since the beginning of the song.
So, everything's fine (?).
The hvg.hu has asked for Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: This new hit raises the question: How far does your music remain a certain layer?
Balázs Zságer: The term "Schichtmusic" does not mean much to me.
In my opinion there are two boxes in pop music, not mainstream and underground, or alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
Even the so-called alternative or underground music can be sequencing, but they can also be produced only for the sale that makes it commercial music.
A good pop number can also come from an honest motive.
The audience's reception is also functioning independently of language and country boundaries.
hvg.hu: Do you see a difference in the openness of the Hungarian and foreign audience of your music?
B. Zs.: In the rest of the world, especially in the western part of us, pop music has a greater tradition.
There not only teenagers or Twens go to concerts, but also the older audience.
They follow the trends in pop music that go around them, much more attentive, because they also hold them for a part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role does the audience play in your work?
Does it matter who, where, how many of your music do you hear?
B. Zs.: Of course it is a good feeling to see that more and more come to our concerts.
But we never made up for the market.
With us, music does not come to serve a purpose, but for a certain reason.
The role of the public is mostly felt by the concerts, where there is already a mutual interaction, but there is, in turn, only in the inevitable changes of the moment.
However, one thing has happened to me: If you want to make it all right, you're not interested anymore.
hvg.hu: How far do you want to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He's on his way as a soloist, and he's built his career in the West.
B. Zs.: We really don't go his way, once in a while away from the fact that you're always trying to get this into our music.
We see ourselves as a teamplayer who trust in the musical presence of the other and let them develop.
At first, comparisons of our work with that of Yonderboi were inevitable, as several of us came from his band and took another route.
hvg.hu: "Wings of Love" is the first place in the charts of Mr.
Many have only heard the name Zagar in connection with this number.
Was the opening with a slightly more popular style deliberately staged towards a wider audience?
B. Zs.: We had no plans to write a hit, which should then be held as a trainee for the album.
This song is about more.
It was thought to be the finals of the album, with which we wanted to solve the sound agency and the somewhat more difficult topics.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six singers?
Why did she just say what the guiding principle was?
B. Zs.: The basic idea was to make a gospel-like choir.
Then came the idea of bringing together the chorus from the solstice of the home music scene.
This is how the six-headed choir was created - so Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikˈ Hodosi [Neo], Juci Nemeth - which we then baptized on the grounds of "underground Divas".
hvg.hu: Did you want the song the same way, or did you design it for the girls?
B. Zs.: The number was already in the instrumental version, but when the material was finished for the album, we thought this number was "something else needed".
The succession of accords has formally required a voice.
I went into the melodies the same night, and later they learned the girls.
It all came in handy and scary spontaneous.
I can remember, I was pretty electrical at the time, but it's already needed the "Divas".
With my voice alone, the song would never be so strong.
hvg.hu: Both on the record and at the concert had the impression that the girls would be in the background.
There is no Solo party (except the short Solo by Judy Jay), they have no own role, they sing perfectly and are not louder than the music, so their music is not just accompanied.
They also stood behind the stage.
Is it intention?
B.Zs.: The fact that they stood behind was because of purely technical problems.
However, we deliberately did not want to let them get solo rolls.
The number also means that you should forget your ego a little, forget who came here and where it is going, let's just let these certain birds push the wings of love.
I would like others to feel this euphoric state, which we have felt when the song was created.
hvg.hu: What was the most exciting song?
B. Zs.: In the field of musical creation, there has been, in fact, no more difficult tasks in mixing.
For example, at "Dorian Gray's Dilemma", in which I play on a concert piano, or at "Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls", where Groove no longer wanted to work, but after and after everything has been put together, like at a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite number from the new album?
B. Zs.: This changes with the concerts and even now, where I have the album "losgelassen".
Currently it is "Prophet Is A Fool", "Escape From The Earth" and the number "Never The Same".
Unfair brokers risked billions due to feelings of inferiority
Non-grounded fraud
Thus, his former employee Jerome Kerviel of the French banking company Société Générale, owner of the commercial bank.
It has reached almost five billion euros in its path.
But it seems that Kerviel was just a big player who wanted to do it to his colleagues, and he certainly wasn't incapacitated.
Unlike all large banking houses, he recognized the crisis in the US mortgage market in time.
"He is mentally rather weak," was heard from the mouth of his superiors who showed him at the police station.
But according to the Kerviels statements published by the French media, such as the Le Monde daily, he was a man who had achieved a profit of 1.6 billion euros at the end of last year's business.
Crisis Not Just in America
"All I wanted was to earn money for my bank," he claims in his statement.
In the summer, he was able to earn half a billion euros just in the US crisis.
The opportunity to do so had already been mentioned by the beginning of the year.
In February, the first news was that so-called sub-prime mortgages, such as low-income customers or those who had previously had payment problems, would be in trouble.
However, this crisis should not have an impact on the whole economy.
Kerviel didn't believe that and kept it right.
At the end of the year, he had gained up to 1.6 billion euros.
"Even though I had earned the first half billion, I didn't know how to explain it," Kerviel adds, saying that he definitely didn't keep anything for himself.
During the entire hearing, he admitted that he had faked documents so that he could not be found on the stakes.
He even managed to lead his bosses behind the light, even though the Eurex stock exchange was equally interested in his business.
Risk profit
Was he afraid to fly?
I don't think so.
"I thought she was satisfied with the simple fact that I earned 1.6 billion for the bank."
How did he take the courage to risk so much?
He had to develop his position gradually.
He joined the Société Générale in 2000, immediately after finishing his studies at the University of Lyon.
Its annual volume was about $51,000.
After two years he was already an assistant to a broker and in 2005 he became an independent broker with an annual amount of $90,000.
Yet he knew that he would not earn as much as others.
"Even at my first conversation in 2005, I knew that I was being watched.
Because of my training and also because of my professional and personal development," Kerviel told the investigation officers.
But soon after his entry, the first big success came.
With the shares of the Alliance, he earned a lot by putting half a billion euros at the London bombings on the price loss of this title.
And that was the trigger - now he wanted more.
As long as you win, we'll let you win.
"It's like a snowball," he told the police.
But the bosses probably knew of everything, or they noticed it.
"If I earn money, you close your eyes."
But then at the beginning of this year came the great blow.
One day he lost a billion euros.
At a weekend in mid-January, he wanted to compensate.
When he came to work on Monday, he was no longer an employee of the bank.
And a few days later, the bank announced that it had lost five billion euros because of it.
And how did they get to him?
He probably took a vacation.
"I've only taken four days from the previous year.
A maker who doesn't take a vacation is one who doesn't want to be looked into the cards," Kerviel said.
Czech Republic has the chance to come to 365 billion
The Czech Minister and representatives of the European Commission signed a total of nine development programmes yesterday, allowing the Czech Republic to reach EUR 14 billion in the coming years (approximately SEK 365 billion).
This is about half of the amount that the Czech Republic can receive in the years 2007 to 2013 from Brussels.
About 125 billion crowns come from seven regional development programmes.
Czech companies will be able to receive about 100 billion crowns from the company and innovation program.
Most of the money, about 150 billion, will flow into transport.
The transport programme is the largest development programme and covers up to 22 per cent of the funds available to the Czech Republic from the Fund.
This money will increase according to the budget of the State Transport Infrastructure Fund, which will have over 90.8 billion next year.
The "Company and Innovation" programme is intended to serve entrepreneurs and companies to earn money for innovative enterprises.
This will help companies to earn funds for the introduction of new technologies, for business research, but also for the introduction of more efficient organisational methods.
The previous acquisition of EU funds by the Czech Republic is among the least successful among the new accession countries.
Nicaraguan Court Approves Twenty Years of Prison Penalties for Presidents
A court in Nicaragua confirmed on Thursday the twenty-year prison sentence for former President Arnold Alemán, to which he was sentenced in 2003 for financial fraud of $100 million (approximately 1.8 billion crowns).
Later, however, he was released from prison and lived under house arrest on his hazienda at the Nicaraguan metropolis.
Whether the former head of state (1997 to 2002) of this Central American state comes back behind bars is currently unclear, according to the news agency AP.
According to the President of the Court of Appeal, Ileana Pérez, it is now up to the prison officials to decide whether to leave his sentence at home, or whether he must go to prison.
A court ruled four years ago that Alemán had regularly moved money from the government to accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
These companies were fictional and the accounts actually belonged to their relatives and closest supporters.
Some of this money ended up in a fund set up by Germany to finance its 2001 election campaign.
Budget is by
Yeah, it's done.
The State budget is approved.
What is special about this budget?
It is the first budget that this government has designed and adopted without the support of the opposition by the coalition majority.
The ČSSD (Social Democrats) has been approved for the current year because it was submitted by Minister Sobotka (of this party), and therefore the ČSSD could not allow it to be rejected.
In contrast to the lively debate before the vote on the motion for a resolution against the Government, nothing has been dramatic this time.
The House of Deputies appreciated this traditionally little respect, but the law is very important in all peace.
That's a paradox.
All government starts and ends with the individual chapters and posts of the budget, whether or not one of them does.
The budget is an essential part of the policy, but it is covered by the government's struggle for power and opposition.
This is a more grateful subject for the media, and therefore they pay more attention to it.
A dispute among politicians is much more interesting to the public than nurturing numbers.
The state budgets are left to the past social-democratic governments under three vulnerabilities, which cannot eliminate the budget for 2008 at once:
The first is the high proportion of expenditure that is compulsory by law, which is not only about pensions, but also about social expenditure, which has been decided in the last year before the elections by ČSSD and KSČM (communists).
The second is the deficit budgetary policy as a result of the first weakness.
The third restriction is in the deficits of public finances, i.e. the budget deficits of the municipalities.
However, the greatest risk is not the state budget deficit.
This budget is under public control and in a number of ways.
A real time bomb, however, is the budget deficit of the municipalities.
Many mayors gave in order to exclude income from taxes, taxes and bank loans from other sources of investment, often excessive debt claims by which they owed their councils in excess.
In recent years they have managed to pay these debts by massive sales of shares of energy and other supply networks that they have received in the course of privatization from the State.
Now this source is already promised.
To the extent that we only hold to official and verifiable facts, we note that:
our economy has been going through a growth phase for a few years, like the rest of the world, where the ČSSD is famous without neglect.
This was a unique opportunity for their governments to put public finances in order.
Instead, these governments owed the State even more.
Other countries, apart from a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have managed much more wisely than our Republic.
This is a huge shame which is primarily attributable to the former governments.
We are among the countries that are at least at risk of poverty in the global context.
Therefore, there is no need for massive social programmes which, unfortunately, have been over-exhausted in recent years.
Even if it is possible to cover some of the foolish populist expenditures that were adopted this year before the elections, it is clear that if it does not come to a shift of the retirement age and to a pension reform, then practically every policy in this country will end, and, just as he is in power, nothing will remain to him as a mere administrator.
It is only easily exaggerated when it is said that it will be made up of ruling politicians who divide the majority of tax revenue mechanically into rent and social expenditure.
Therefore, this year's budget cannot be a revolution, but it can only provide for the reduction of normal expenditure through compulsory expenditure.
The deficit of 70 billion crowns for 2008 would have been quite overwhelming if previous governments had not spent in the last ten years what just went on.
If we do not want it really to become purely administrative officials from politicians, then we need to be patient and not that very strong coalition government, which is aware that the state can only spend as much as it can to accept taxes and fees as it is able to wish for peace in the preparation of further reform laws.
Only these enable a balanced state budget to be implemented gradually.

Banks want to deal with the crisis
The US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the Central Bank of Great Britain, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight together against the crisis in the financial markets.
In this way, more than $100 billion will be achieved through auctions on the currency markets.
In these auctions, banks increase interest rates to which they are willing to lend each other money.
For example, the US Fed sends 40 billion dollars to auction, another 24 will lock it for the European and the Swiss Central Bank.
It is the first time after the attacks of 11 September that the central banks of each country agree on such a coordinated approach to combating the effects of a financial crisis, namely, decommissioning.
"This step is intended to eliminate the biggest difficulties of the economy, so the growing lack of freely available capital that banks can lend," wrote Bernard Baumohl of the Economic Outlook Group in a report to his customers.
"The coordinated action of the central banks has reduced the probability of a recession in the US from 65% to about 50%," Baumohh added in his report.
Banks have already lost around $60 billion due to unserviced loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts expect further billions of losses.
"The central banks must have really been afraid of what could still happen when they decided to do so," said the chief economist of ABN Amro, Kieran Davies.
"It looks like the situation is really bad," he continued.
The central banks are afraid that if the banks themselves have difficult access to loans, credit will also become more expensive for their customers.
This would reduce consumption and cut the US economy into a recession, possibly with effects on economic growth worldwide.
The central banks have decided to reduce the so-called LIBOR interest rate for London interbanks, which is used for lending between banks.
This means that the banks were always afraid to lend money to each other, although the central banks of the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom had reduced their interest rates several times during the fall.
"This will have the same effect as another reduction in interest rates," said Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting of the Agency Reuters.
Some analysts believe that this step of the central banks contributes to the warming of the crisis because it does not solve the basic problem, namely the case of the real estate market in the USA.
Klaus: Ecologists' debates are unbelievable
Global climate change is likely to harm most developing countries.
President Václav Klaus spoke again about the problem of global warming.
The criticism now focused on the UN international conference on climate change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book "A Blue, No Green Planet", he claimed that the debates of Ecologists were incredible.
Klaus says that not only the structure of the conference is unacceptable, which is a rare mix of government representatives and such non-governmental organisations, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric that it is accompanied by and the reality.
"The debate there is unstructured, it is a work of fire, which is only a substitute for a real solution to current problems," Klaus said.
The Czech President stressed in his presentation that his topic was very important to him and that he was so committed to it.
He also expressed his satisfaction that his book appeared in German translation, because "I often encounter cartoons in my views."
So now interested people could read his attitude undisclosed.
Klaus recalled that he was not a climate scientist, but he felt that he had sufficient conditions to write such a book.
Finally, he is academic, capable of understanding and evaluating professional negotiations, has experience with statistics and is also a national economist.
As the main statement of the book, he referred to the fact that the climate is constantly changing and that its changes are so normal that there is no consensus among scientists on global warming that the consequences of the current changes are not too large and serious and thus no threat, and that efforts to influence the development of the climate are overwhelming, ineffective and unacceptable.
In addition, he held it as someone who has experience with totalitarian systems to make it impossible to impose other unproven views, he sees it as a dangerous restriction of freedom.
He repeatedly stated that he was not against "a reasonable environmental protection, but against militant environmental activists who did not take into account the relationship between effort and income."
Klaus had spoken about the same subject in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
600000 people were unable to exchange their driver's license
600,000 drivers missed the deadline to exchange their old driver's license, whose validity expires at the end of the year.
Today is the last day where you can apply for the exchange so that the authorities can create a new driver's license by the end of the year.
However, the Ministry is not afraid that hundreds of thousands of drivers will be on the streets without valid driving rights after the year.
According to the authorities, mainly those who do not want to drive have not changed their driving license.
While small places report a strong decline in interest in the exchange of lead, the city's officials are being overstated with requests, and the interest in exchange is still growing this week.
The city administration manufactures around 2000 customers daily.
You have to stand for about half an hour.
In Prague, about 140,000 drivers have not changed their driver's license yet.
The exhibition will take 20 days for a new driver's license.
But it is possible to apply for the exhibition with a shorter period of five days.
In this case, the driver must pay 500 crowns.
Car drivers who do not create the prescribed exchange until the end of the year without a valid driver's license are threatened with a cash penalty from January.
The offender pays no more than 2000 crowns.
However, the police can also use a reminder in the case of the breach.
In the event of an infringement, the penalty may be increased to 2500 crowns.
According to previous information, those in the community may also be sentenced to a fine which is not at all carried out.
He could, so it was called, threaten a punishment of even 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry has already called on the officials to allow mildews and to impose a fine of at least 1000 crowns.
According to the spokesperson of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka, no one threatened to punish a thousand crowns.
The driver's license is a document in which everyone can decide whether or not to own it.
It is not a personal statement that everyone, and a valid one, must have.
People who don't want to drive should give their driver's license.
It is enough to bring him to the competent authority or to send him there by registration.
At the end of the year, licences issued between 1964 and 1993 will be invalid.
However, drivers must be able to exchange other types of driving licences.
People with driving licences from 1994 to 2000 have three more years to change.
The validity of licences issued in 2001 to 2004 expires in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, it is about 2.6 million additional driving licences.
Court of Justice lowers penalties for detectives associated with Berdych
The former policemen Josef Opava and Petr Konňarík, who are accused of having made a joint case with the band of David Berdych, received 13 years of imprisonment, respectively.
In a judicial judgment, the Prague Oberlandesgericht decided to reduce its sentence by one or two years.
At the beginning, 14 years were threatened by the detectives of the "Office for the Fight against Organized Crimes" or 12 years.
Against today's judgment there is no appeal, only revision is possible at the Supreme Court.
Berdych himself is also accused in this matter, but first he has the first sentence before.
In other cases, however, he had already been sentenced to 16 years in total.
He cannot be condemned any more.
A District Court in January 19 people blamed mainly for the involvement in robbery, the Supreme Court today negotiated the appeal of 16 of them.
Most of the accused argued from the outset on the ground that it was a constructed case.
According to the Central District Court, police members provided information from police sources in consultation with Berdych Crimes, covered various robbery incidents and helped members of the gang to withdraw from prosecution.
The band left Opava and Konňarík 30 percent of the bet for this.
The prosecution is a criminal offence of the gang from 1999 to 2001.
Especially in cases of robbery, the victims of which often suffer serious injuries, but also in the case of official measures and illegal possession of weapons.
In domestic investigations, the police discovered illegal guns, ammunition with steel cores, a laser target tube and a machine gun.
According to their robbery, the gang has enriched itself by many millions of crowns.
Except for almost 20 men in this process, Berdych and a number of others were found to be legally guilty because of other thefts.
Other men from Berdych's district must be responsible in another process, and other cases have not yet been brought before the court.
The main negotiations have so far been held by Tomáš Póta and Maroš Šuljej, who are in Irish prison and are awaiting the final decision on their extradition for prosecution in the Czech Republic.
Children exchange - Account: 12 million
For the exchange of children in a decommissioned clinic, the lawyer of the injured parents, Igor Veleba, wants to require compensation from the hospital in Trebíč 12 million crowns plus court costs.
For each mother every three million, for the fathers every two million, and for the children every one million.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200000 for each parent couple.
The representative of the hospital, Ondřej Dostál, therefore did not agree fully with the Velebas proposal.
"We reject such a proposal, it is too often too high," said Dostál after today's negotiations.
"But in order to be able to give us an opinion on this opposite proposal, we need the opinion that made the opposite.
We will see if it has any value.
But we believe that this should be for all in the hundreds of thousands," said Dostál.
According to him, the amount should be between 100,000 and 200000 crowns for each of the four parents.
At first, the family from Jabloňov wanted a million crowns for each month that she had not raised her biological daughter.
For Veleba, it served as the basis for compensation negotiations, which had been prepared for him by the University Hospital in Prague Motol.
The parents of the children suffer from psychological and psychiatric damage and stress symptoms in different strengths and depth, according to experts.
The men were better aware of the stress situation, even if they saw proposals in front of them, they could have prevented the change of newborns.
The women come back with the consequences of the trauma experienced worse, as well as with what is just going on, Veleba stuck the contents.
Veronica and Nikola sold the hospital in Trebíč last December.
Last week, the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to the Čermáks in Zámbyslavice, and Veronica to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanová to Jabloňov.
The district chief of the Vysočina (Böhmisch-Mārische) handed over at the end of October every family of 100,000 crowns as a substitute for expenses incurred by them through the error of the hospital in Trebíč, which is subject to the district.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are covered by laws due to liability insurance.
In the event of doubt, they must take part in a reserve fund, only exceptionally they can apply for assistance from the carrier.
The courts have so far made a relatively low amount of damages, the amounts were determined by tables and moved in the area of hundreds of thousands, with the exception of millions.
Polívka came around his kingdom of Walachei
Bolek Polívka lost the battle over the brand "Kingy Walachei".
According to the judge of the District Court in Ostrava, he used the term "Walachic King" as the first one, but the project had built a team for a long time in collaboration with the actor, Tomáš Haraiš.
Polivka did not participate in the negotiations today.
According to his lawyer, however, this is probably not the end of the case and his mandate will probably be called in.
"The dispute is that Mr. Harabiš and his team want to participate in the popularity of Bolek Polívkas parasitic," the lawyer said after the discussion.
All presented themselves with the words "Walachisches recherche" just these actors and comedians.
The same opinion is also Harabiš.
"We have almost ten years of work behind us.
Money-saving and business concepts," he said.
According to him, the cause is dispute about money.
"After years they found that the project was successful and that they could also have something of it.
They want to win parasiticly at our work," he continued.
Larkatives Business
According to the court, Polívka used the term "Walachische King" for the first time in one of his broadcasts.
In 1993, he was crowned by the actor Radoslav Brzobohatý.
But that was not the case at the time with the intention of establishing a fictional kingdom.
A few years later, Haraish came to think of the release of wave legs.
From an original fun action, a business and a business activity was crystallized and joined by Haraish, then the founding of the company "Walachisches Kingdom".
In 1997, Polívka agreed to the use of his name and signature in the plays and even offered her owners reductions in visiting his farm and his theatre performances.
Who's going to sit on the throne?
The judge also stated today that Harabiš only used the only idea that Polívka made public in the "Manege" mission for his business intentions.
"The popularity of Polívkas has certainly helped the project of the Welsh Kingdom," the judge said.
She added, however, that the soul of the Harabiš project and his team were devoted to him.
The cooperation of the parties currently in conflict lasted until the year 2000, when Harabiš for Polívka in Vsetín organised the official crown.
Since then, however, the conflicts between Polívka and Harabiš have begun to rage, which have been included in the sentence "King Boleslavs I. chosen until the Holy Nimmerleins Day".
The role of leadership was then challenged by Harabiš Jarmila Šuláková as a mother of queens.
In 2002, Polívka filed a complaint against Haraiš and his company, which was rejected by the Court today.
Clearness in the dispute could bring the battle prepared by Haraish around the throne and half a princess.
A new king should come out of this.
He didn't want to talk about details and an appointment yet.
"We don't want to believe anything.
It's supposed to be something like the King's Hall in Walachei.
The king should be elected for a certain time.
Mr Polívka can also log in quietly," Harabiš added.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: Pre-fed
To tell the truth, I was never a special fan of Peugeot 206.
Its characteristics were not very valuable, the quality of the switch, the drive and also the processing could be described as below average.
But now he is his successor, the Peugeot 207, on the market, and he is much better.
The combo with the name SW is still a piece, and I just have to review my opinion.
When I tested the classic Hatchback of 207, for example, I had to complain about the too low freedom of head on the back seat.
These complaints are no longer available, because the body of the van is so designed that no two-meter men will suffer.
Continue
I'm just going through the interior just so I don't have to repeat myself too much.
It is a very successful design, where I am opposed only because of the worrying middle tunnel.
There I would welcome some more design design where the car makes such an elegant impression.
The seats are comfortable, and past the times where we may complain about too short seats or headrests.
The content of the page has also improved significantly compared to 206.
With regard to the range offer, you can also see here the increased dimensions of the body.
In the van, the already mentioned lack of freedom of head is also eliminated.
Cached in the cached space
The main thing about this car is the shop.
I have to name it (also because of the climbing back window) as a very good loadable and space-saving one.
The rooms are equipped with locks that represent an ideal compromise.
They don't interfere, they can separate, and they also hold heavy objects.
But let's talk about the volume of charge.
It is, according to the table in the basic equipment 428 litres, which is a rather average value compared to competition.
However, it is not compared with the most-selling vehicle in the Czech Republic, Škoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the product from Mladá Boleslav, we note that the peugeot remains at a noticeable rate of 52 liters.
This value is already critical for a vacation abroad or when a child car is invited.
But in order to highlight the positive, I still have to mention the very flat load room or the very low load edge after the cover of the back seat.
120 PS in four rows
Our test car was equipped with a four-wheeled petrol engine with a hub of 1,6 litres and a power of 88 kWp.
And frankly, it should look like a 1600-cubic engine that drives a family hatchback.
He's quiet, he's having a low consumption and he's getting away well.
When I compare him to his opponent at Škoda, who sometimes acts as if his exuberance would be covered with a pencil, then I can only be thrilled by him.
The Price List Speaks Bonds
The price of this car is not exactly universal.
But we must remember that we tested a well-equipped car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with the 1400 petrol engine of 329900 crowns is still high.
With our engine it costs from 410900 crowns, which is already quite a lot.
The premium equipment of the test car once again hits with 80,000 crowns in addition to book.
However, we had headlights, automatic air conditioning, automatic disc wiper, electric window lifts and...
This is how the car costs a total of 531900 crowns.
This is a lot, but once you calculate the additional equipment of a Fabia and you will arrive at a similar sum.
So there's only one choice left which brand you want to choose.
Integration of Slovak students into British schools failed
In British schools, the number of children from Eastern European countries is increasing, which in the case of local fears is causing further development of local education.
The integration of Eastern Europeans has so far been hampered by a number of obstacles.
British schools even identify cases where disputes between immigrants and children of the original residents increase in violence.
The problem with the integration of children from Eastern Europe into British schools is illustrated by the case of North Kent, where the clashes between native and Slovak immigrants are increasing steadily.
Struggles, scissors and robbery among students have shifted to the relationship between parents.
The situation has developed so far that the police in Chatham arrested a Slovak woman who had hit a ten-year-old boy with an iron rod.
The accused defended himself for the young man had attacked her with racist assaults.
The police also had to join a Slovak immigrant after a two-year-old attack.
The girls had apparently made racist remarks against the man and thrown him with stones.
"When we went home, a boy climbed into a bus house and spit on us.
When I told him that he was going to stop, he grabbed us with apples and beers and then blew off his seat," a mother of Slovak students in The Times described another unpleasant incident.
Complaints come from both sides.
One of the indigenous peoples referred to the struggle with immigrants from Eastern Europe even as the struggle for survival.
The above cases prove that the mood between natives and immigrants at British schools is becoming increasingly tense.
In the United Kingdom, 70,000 Slovaks have been reported looking for jobs here.
About 30000 Slovak students then visit British schools.
Cuba - the most beautiful island of the Caribbean
For visitors it is really an island of freedom.
Whatever you expect from your holiday, it will be fulfilled if you just choose the right one.
Golden and white beaches, high waves or a sea that is quiet like a pond.
Palms and all inclusive with cellars that offer on the beach pizza, ice and surrounding cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands of the Caribbean you will find it to a great extent.
But only on one island you will find much more, and this island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the Great Antilles.
At the time of the Spanish, Cuba was their base for the conquest of America.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place ever seen in human eyes.
Havana was once a warehouse or passage camp of treasures that had robbed the Spaniards in America and then transported to Europe.
And then came the American epoch.
The National Hotel was created at the end of the 20th century.
Building it was one of the leaders of the American Mafia, Lucky Luciano, because everything that was considered a crime in the United States (especially during the ban) was seen and supported in Cuba - drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests were others.
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In Havana highhouses, over the broad Boulevards, drove cars, which included the cultural symbols of the 15th century.
Ernest Hemingway bought a property in San Francisco de Paula, near Havanas, and in Cojímar he had his hunt.
On the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio, stars of the show business and politicians from all over America left their signatures.
And today?
On the walls of Havana's Bodeguita you can also leave your autograph.
At the bar at the Hotel Nacional you can mix cocktails as you wish.
And the cult cars of the Fifteen go around Havana to this day, because the once imported schiguli and fiats in the salty and wet air have long fallen apart.
Havanna, especially his oldest part, has come down hard, nowhere in the area is there as many wonderful colonial sights as just here.
Other places are just thrown out, such as Trinidad.
In view of the urgent need for tourism, there was a green light for this development.
In the last 15 years, not only new hotels have been created in Havana, but also in Varadero, on the coast of the province of Holguín and also on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba also offers a marathon that is unique in the world and attracts, above all, railway lovers.
The sugar pipe from remote plantations brought steam and the same operated narrow-purpursues to the sugar factories.
Your car park has not been renewed for decades, and you can see well-functioning and fully-functioning locomotives whose peers are in the museum for the longest time.
Expiration objectives
Most important places do not leave the majority of visitors in Cuba.
So you don't have to write about Varadero or Havana in detail anymore.
It remains to be mentioned that there is a museum in Hemingways already mentioned, whose visit should not be allowed to leave the writer.
The Vignales valley in the western part of the island is one of the most picturesque corner of Cuba.
The steep vegetation grows on limestone soils.
The Mogotas, Kalkhügel, and Rocks, rise from the valley floor, in their caves, collected fertile soils, through which also welded rock areas are covered by dense vegetation.
This valley is where perhaps the best Cuban tobacco is grown.
In its final form, you can meet him when you visit one of Havana's cigarette factories.
It may also seem interesting that the Chilean consequences of the "Mayor Zeman" television series were turned around there.
Trinidad
An ancient city, which was established shortly after the Spanish colonized the island.
Rum and wealth brought her the trade with slaves and sugar.
The richness was incorporated into the beautiful beauty of the small city.
The Spanish colonial architecture, strongly influenced by the later French settlers, has barely changed since four hundred years.
Trinidad, situated between the sea and the Escambray Mountains, is such a remote place that in the last fifty years there was no road that would have connected the area with the rest of the country.
This isolation contributed to a lack of attention.
Nothing was built there, but that's why nothing was torn off, everyone was happy that he had a roof over his head.
If you have more than one afternoon time for Trinidad, then it is worth seeing interesting places in the area, such as the beach Playa Ancón or the "Tal of Sugar Factorys".
In the evening you should go to the Casa de la Música, which lives after the darkness, and where the music does not sweat until the morning.
Baracoa
These cities in the East of Cuba are some of the most beautiful of the islands.
Surely this view is also influenced by the way there.
Both streets leading by Guantánamo there have to overcome high and steep mountains and go through a landscape that is barely affected by human intervention.
This eastern preposterous Cuba took the UNESCO into account thanks to its unaffected nature in its world heritage directory.
The best chocolate is produced there, in the church you can see the cross of Columbus (in reality it was about a hundred years after the journeys of Columbus), and from the hill where the former castle, the current Hotel El Castillo, stands, are several tablestops, of which El Yunque is the most famous.
About the coffee, the room, the cigars, the Sierra Maestra mountain, the pigbeach and the island of Isla de Pinos, about the Tropicana Cabaret, the sanctuary of the Cuban patrons Caridad del Cobre, about the Santeria, an African religion to which the descendants of slaves confess themselves, about all that many pages could be written.
But, as you say, look better with your own eyes.
United in Afghanistan are passive, alleged Americans.
Too few soldiers and the lack of necessary equipment affect the United States as a result of the mission in Afghanistan.
NATO should develop a concrete plan for the coming years, according to Defence Minister Robert Gates.
The mission in Afghanistan did not go according to its ideas, about which in Scotland the representatives of the countries that have stationed units in the south of the country agreed.
In addition to the growing resistance of the Taliban sides, the eight participating States also discuss further coordination plans among the allies.
While the United States, through its defence minister Robert Gates, called the NATO units more active, Britain sees the priority in strengthening the authority of the Afghan government and in intensifying development aid.
"In Afghanistan, a forward-looking development is noticeable, but military power can only be part of the solution.
Another part is to enable citizens to start a further development of the economy and security," says British Defence Minister Des Browne of the BBC.
Ninety percent
The activity of the Afghan rebels has reached the highest level, according to the US Army, for five years.
The number of acts of violence has increased by 27 per cent compared to the previous year, even by sixty per cent in the southern Helmand Province.
The NATO countries have stationed some 40,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, about a quarter of them in the southern territory.
According to the United States, however, the alliances have reached an absolute limit as regards the organization and equipment of the units.
In particular, they require further helicopters, soldiers and experts to train the Afghan units.
"We will have to seriously think about the concrete goals for the next time and how we can achieve them," Gates said.
Similarly today, NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop expressed himself.
"I am not happy about what we have available in Afghanistan to countries and in the air.
We have about ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment we need, and that's too little," said De Hoop of the Agency Reuters to conclude three-day talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
In the last few months, there has also been a dispute among the participating countries as to whether all the allies in Afghanistan are giving their best.
For example, due to passiveity, Germany has been criticised.
"The Germans are relatively numerous in Afghanistan.
But they are stationed in areas where there is only a minimum of violence and the fighting requirements for them are not as high as for us in the southern and eastern part of the country," Gates said.
The British Boulevard newspaper "Sun" this week referred to the German soldiers as faulpelze.
"Afghanish non-student: The Germans make games while our boys fight," wrote the "Sun" in a contribution that was supplemented by photos of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German newspaper went against the attack and printed a picture of a British unit in a Rugby competition in southern Afghanistan.
State debt will be accelerated to a billion in 2009
Each Czech country has a public debt of 84000 crowns.
The total debt rose to 842.7 billion crowns by the end of September.
This year, the government had planned to borrow 159.2 billion women.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion thanks to the better development of State budgetary policy.
The State debt of the Czech Republic rose to 842.7 billion crowns by the end of September.
Within the first nine months of this year, they have risen by 40.2 billion.
Since June, however, they have fallen by 13.4 billion.
The Ministry of Finance thus confirmed its statement of State debts from the beginning of October.
On each of the Czechs, a debt of 84000 crowns is eliminated.
Over the last year, the state owed more than 111 billion crowns.
"Now it seems that, thanks to the lower deficit for the coming year, we may be exceeding the limit of a billion crown by 2009 only.
The next year, the debt should move between 900 billion and a billion crown," said David Marek, analyst of Patria Finance, the iHNed.cz server.
Similarly, Vladimir Pikora, analyst of the Next Finance, sees: "To exceed a billion we could come in the course of 2009.
If that is the case, it depends on the next budget, which we do not yet know.
If it should be shown that the situation on the political stage is changing, and politicians should be willing to save more, it could last until 2010.
But I don't go out of such a change," he remarked.
Increased debt
The debt is borne by the government's debts and comes primarily from the accumulation of government deficits.
State debt is financed by securities, government debt claims, direct bonds or, for example, by the European Investment Bank.
This year's domestic debt rose to 719.4 billion crowns.
The State's foreign debt now increased by 1.7 billion crowns to 123.3 billion.
The so-called marketable state debt reached the end of September 803.3 billion crowns and fell by 13.7 billion since June.
The average rate of government debt increased to 6.5 years.
"The total debt rose by 13 percent over the year from the first to the third quarter, which is really much in view of how good the economy is.
It is interesting that growth is primarily recorded in debt securities, where the increase is 20 percent.
It is bad that the debts are rising, but on the other hand this shows that you can do something before the pension reform comes," Pikora commented on the data.
Better Than Expected
The financing strategy and the treatment of government debt for 2007 indicate that the government had planned to take 159,2 billion crowns this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to $152.8 billion due to the better development of State budgetary policy.
This amount is mainly due to the State budget deficit, which will obviously reach 76 billion crowns this year instead of the proposed 91.3 billion.
This is also the maximum planned funds for the consolidation agency of 13.3 billion krona, a ten billion reserve for the payment of the rent, the financing of government debt for 43 billion and the European Investment Bank's loans of 1.8 billion.
For having given a name to a Teddybyre, she was brought before a court in Khartoum today.
According to her lawyer, the British teacher, who was accused of insulting Islam in Sudan, was sentenced on Thursday evening from a court in Khartoum to 15 days in prison and subsequent trial.
The British was accused of having allowed six to seven-year-old students to give a Teddybary the name Mahomet, although any representation of the Islamic prophet is forbidden.
She would have deserved to be eaten.
After several times the parents of students had complained to the Sudanese Ministry of Culture, the 54-year-old elementary school teacher who was working at the Unity High School of Khartoum was arrested at home on Sunday and, in accordance with Article 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Law, was accused of insulting Islam.
In fact, this issue takes its start in September when the teacher invites her six to seven-year-old students to choose a name for the classeddy.
The children propose eight names, including Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed, school leader Robert Boules reports.
Finally, when the class votes, 20 of 23 children will choose Mohammed as the best names.
Surely, Mohammed is the name of the Islamic prophet, but above all a very common name in Sudan.
Then the children have created a book for the class, with the photo of the bear on it and the image signature My name is Mohammed .
The bear itself did not bear a sign with this name, but the problem is simply that the representation of the Islamic prophet is viewed as a insult to Islam.
One of the Muslim colleagues of Gillian Gibbons, who taught at the same school in Sudan, explained that he knew her well, and she would never have done anything to bring her closer to a religious faith, I regret that she only prayed to the children to vote for a name, his opinion is only an innocent mistake.
An opinion shared by many of the teachers, who are very attentive to their students and as a person who never talks in class about religion.
It is recalled that the first name Mohammed is also the second most common name given in the United Kingdom, for which there are different spellings in English 14.
This common name chosen by Muslim families is considered a kind of privilege to the prophets (it is often given to the first-born of a family).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this name?
Can you, for example, give him a toy?
This, of course, is a question of interpretation.
On Wednesday, at the last negotiating session in Vienna, no agreement was reached on the future status of the province.
At the end of the problem
The Serbs and Albanians from Kosovo have concluded a sixth and last discussion session on Wednesday morning in Baden, Austria, without being able to overcome their controversy about the future status of the separatist province.
It is regrettable that the parties could not agree on the status, the European Ombudsman Wolfgang Ischinger explained at a press conference in Vienna.
With emphasis on the fact that the peace in the region was at stake, his American counterpart Frank Wilsner Belgrade and Pristina called on them to fulfil their commitments to maintain peace, and to continue the talks beyond the end of the negotiations.
No violence is expected in the immediate future, but at the beginning of a very difficult time, he added and indicated that there are quite significant tensions.
End of negotiations on 10 December
Troika's mediators, who unite the European Union, the USA and Russia, will meet for the last time on Monday in Serbia and Kosovo.
The future of the province inhabited by Albanians could be clearer if Ischinger, Wilsner and the Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko submitted their report to the UN Security Council by 10 December.
The talks of Baden, near Vienna, formed the sixth and last negotiating session since August of the UNO had been commissioned to a new mediation.
Americans and Europeans are expected to complete their mediation mission on 10 December.
The Russians who had already blocked Kosovo's independence from the Security Council are out of the process of continuing negotiations beyond that deadline.
Russia was and remains advocate of a negotiated solution, a mutually acceptable solution, said Botsane-Khartchenko.
A unilateral declaration of independence?
After Kosovo has been under UN administration for eight years, the Western countries maintain their independence under EU supervision for the only solution in the future.
Pristina is prepared to announce this unilaterally if the Security Council should not decide on its merits.
Belgrade is based on stronger autonomy
Unfortunately, no agreement could be reached, the President of the Kosovo Autonomous Authority, Fatmir Sejdiu, announced at the Hotel in Baden, where these negotiations have been held since Monday for the last time.
Hashim Thaci, former leader of the Kosovo rebellion and future Prime Minister of the province, shared his regrets.
He added , however , that the plan proposed by Belgrade belongs to the autonomy of a past that has led to murders and deportations .
Domino-Effect
Serbian President Boris Tradic felt that a compromise should always be sought, and warned the Albanian majority from Kosovo against the consequences of a unilateral declaration of independence of the province.
Belgrade believes that it is particularly "Domino-Effect" in a region that is still so weakened by the independence wars of the 1990s.
For Serbia, this does not mean that a compromise would be impossible, he said.
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that any decision should be taken solely and exclusively in the Security Council, where their Russian allies had a veto right.
Parliament of Kosovo will have the last word
Only one decision of the Security Council is acceptable to Serbia, Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said.
These negotiations have lasted for two years.
They must end as they have begun: in the Security Council.
The journalist Fatmir Sejdiu replied that Kosovo's Parliament would have the last word on the status and added that each unilateral declaration of independence of the Albanian-speaking population would be in agreement with the Western countries.
Bush uncovers an agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
At the opening of the international peace conference, which was held in Annapolis, Maryland on Tuesday, President Bush announced that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed to a joint declaration.
He further stated that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to begin negotiations immediately to find a final settlement of the 60-year-old disputes between their two nations.
In the presence of the two men Bush promised that he would do everything to help them to conclude a peace treaty by the end of 2008.
In the meantime, the Palestinians must destroy the terrorist infrastructures and Israel must set up its colonization work, Bush explained, recalling the two parties' commitments to the roadmap for peace that they had agreed to in 2003.
The Head of the White House stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority under Abbas last sought a peace treaty, which should clarify all open issues without exception, including the central issues.
This term covers the three serious problems that are mainly affecting the disputes between Israel and the Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of the Arab refugees, who were driven out of their homes in the course of the 1948 conflict in the present state of Israel.
After the U.S. President Abbas took the floor and insisted that the upcoming negotiations be conducted comprehensively and thoroughly and provide for all points, including Jerusalem, the refugees, the borders, the colonies, water and security.
When Olmert took the floor, he committed himself to conducting the upcoming ceasefire negotiations directly and without interruption and to trying to bring them to an end by the end of 2008.
Bush has set the deadline for the implementation of his vision of two states, a Palestinian and an Israeli, which is next to each other, for the end of 2008.
Saudi Arabia has revealed that it has received an assurance from Bush in this sense before it decided to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a great success for Washington, has led a plan taken by all Arab countries in the way that Israel offers peace, in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the war in 1967, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis is a milestone in the history of the Middle East, especially because it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central points of view, the Saudi Arab prince in his interview with the Arabic daily newspaper funded by Saudi money.
According to the prosecutors, the police are not responsible
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As always with this kind of local news, official versions and rumors are facing.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first findings of the National Disciplinary Authority of the Police (IGPN), a police car was launched on Sunday, shortly after 17 a.m., on the Rue Louise-Michel towards Villiers-le-Bel.
He had no use, but he was on strips, and drove with 40-50 km/h, without bluelight, explains a speaker of the police.
A green motorcycle of the Kawasaki brand, without permission, so not released for public road transport (see below), came, controlled by two young people without helmet, with very high speed.
It hit the left side of the police car after it had failed to move to the right, a policeman further explained.
The alcohol checks carried out by the vehicle passengers are very negative.
The condition of the car (painted catflies, split wind protection disc, torn rod) is evidence of the suspense of the spray.
Very fast, already yesterday morning, the prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérèse de Givry, announced that she had entrusted the IGPN with an opinion on "the facts of the illegal murder and the lack of assistance to persons at risk", in accordance with the main public safety management of Val-d`Oise.
In the afternoon, on the occasion of a press conference, the prosecutor explained that she was excluding the responsibility of the police officers to investigate the IGPN at this stage.
According to the Magistrate, three witnesses of the accident, who were heard on Sunday evening, confirmed the version of the police, namely that this small power wheel had arrived relatively quickly on their left side.
Yesterday, a kind of reels showed, surely caused by the friction of the treadmills on the ground, that the two vehicles were stuck together until the police made it stop.
The vehicles have been seized and will be subject to a technical assessment.
The bodies of the two victims were obduated yesterday.
What happened next?
Yesterday in Villiers-le-Bel, a rumor quickly made the rounds, which led the police to leave the accident very quickly, and that without the help of the two young men.
Although the IGPN remains very careful, it would also exclude any serious errors in this matter.
According to a police source, this is a difficult aspect of the investigations that are necessary for further investigations and in which one must take very careful action.
Libération has struck a glimpse of these few moments shortly after the accident.
From one of his windows, he had a direct view of the scene.
We immediately went out with my cousin, the nurse in the hospital, to try to live her again, these witnesses tell us.
There was nothing to do.
Then he saw a completely ruined police officer who walked away.
Two others tried to relive one of the young, the fourth phoned.
In view of the tension that had quickly developed around the event and, as it seems, because of the certainty that the present people had about the unexpected situation of the young people, the police of colleagues who were in the accident were taken into the car.
Still, according to this testimony, the rescue forces met about twenty minutes after the police left.
They have also used heart massages, but indiscriminate.
I will not allow it to be claimed that the police had not helped young people.
This young man was the first to be helped.
The firefight has arrived immediately.
Everything was done to try to save her, the prosecutor stressed it.
In Pakistan, tension is rising
On Monday, the Pakistani police have defeated the first demonstrations since two days before General Musharraf was called out.
According to the testimony, approximately 2,000 lawyers in Lahore, east of the country, who demonstrated the measures taken in the emergency, were injured by the train gas grenades that put in place the order forces there.
Then they threw stones with which they injured the police.
At least 350 lawyers were arrested temporarily.
There were similar scenarios in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police lawyers attacked and injured.
Several would have been arrested temporarily.
In Islamabad, the prosecutors of the Supreme Court have called for a general strike and announced demonstrations, as a result of a wave of approximately 500 arrests by opposition, human rights defenders and lawyers during the weekend.
On Monday morning, the streets leading to the Supreme Court were blocked to prevent the assembly.
Further demonstrations had been found in Multan (Mitte) and Peshawar (Northeastern).
On Monday, the prosecution received the support of the religious parties united in the powerful Muttahida Milis-e-Amal, whose president urged the population to send flowers to the judges who had spoken against the need, and to those who had cast an oath before the Musharraf.
The promise of Musharraf is no longer valid
The Supreme Court of Pakistan is directly affected by the special measure announced on Saturday evening.
In the following days, he had to refer to the legality of President Musharraf's re-election in a direct election on 6 October.
The President of the Court of Justice, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, was removed and dismissed.
All that we represent is illegal, anti-constitutional and contrary to the decisions of the Supreme Court, the Magistrate of The News explained.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to give the Supreme Command over the Army and become a civilian president is no longer valid since the call for emergency, Deputy Minister for Information Tariq Azeem stated on Monday.
It was expected that he would give up his military uniform by 15 November, the date on which his first term of office ended as president.
The Deputy Minister for Information also confirmed that January's elections could be moved.
In addition, the Pakistani government deplored the allegations that the country had been held by President Musharraf, who had been assigned a place of residence by his deputy leader.
Still more than a third of pregnancy is not planned
This calculation takes into account the unwanted pregnancies (24%), as well as the poorly planned or unforeseeable births.
Even today, 40 years after the adoption of the Neuwirth Act, which allowed the prohibition of reception in France, one of three pregnancies (36%) is not planned, as shown by a study by the National Institute for Demographic Studies (Ined).
This calculation takes into account the unwanted pregnancies (24%), as well as the poorly planned or unforeseeable births.
The Ined estimates that the different methods of prevention such as the pill or the spirals still have a 5-6% loss rate.
According to the Institute, which notes that the percentage of pill users between 20 and 40 years of age who use the pill has increased from 5% in 1970 to 60% today, the liberalisation of the prevention of seizures has nevertheless allowed for better control of fertility.
In any case, eight of ten births are carefully planned today.
At one of five couples even calculated exactly on the month, and, if possible, in the spring, the season in which it seems most pleasant to have a child.
Spectacular repair at the space station
Astronaut Scott Parazynski and his comrades from the occupation of the International Space Station (ISS) will need more than seven hours in space to perform the spectacular repair of a defective solar collector that is essential for the continuation of scientific work at the station.
A sudden exit, which, due to its duration, has achieved several records of the removal of habitable modules, the speed with which it was organized, and the tools built by the astronauts to perform the repair.
The problem arose on Wednesday, when the astronauts had downloaded the harmony module from the spacecraft Discovery, a large cylindrical part that was soon to take up the European and Japanese scientific laboratories.
This module is a kind of landing bridge for the module laboratory.
But you have to be able to supply them with electricity.
The second task of the crew was therefore to implement a 17.5 tonnes heavy module for electricity generation over solar collectors already on the ISS to bring it to its final position.
After she had moved it, the occupation took place to restructure the solar collectors of the module, which is 76 meters wide.
And it happened that one of the collectors who let themselves up like chords was damaged by a wire attached to a length of about a meter.
The restructuring was stopped in order not to harm the collector again.
The astronauts, who originally left the spacecraft Discovery and then had to repair another solar collector whose rotation system was faulty, were forced to devote themselves to the damaged collector.
And Scott Parazynski was chosen to walk around to carry out the repair at the end of the 30-metre remote-controlled arm of the space that was placed at the station.
He's one of NASA's best spacewalkers.
Large, resistant, very sent, he has a well developed upper body and long arms.
The 46-year-old doctor was therefore selected to operate the injured solar collector.
After carefully examining the damage, he cut the faulty cable and secured a kind of rail on the damaged site.
He was supported by a second spacewalker who remained near the castle, and, from inside, by the other astronauts, among them Peggy Whitson, commander of the occupation.
The tool used by him to convert a mini-hockey hose into an insulator to prevent the solar collectors that produce several hundred volts of electricity, the astronauts had thought and built on board the station.
When the action was over, Scott Parazynski waited until the collector was fully exhausted before he counted his tools and returned to the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts enjoyed a half-day relaxation before seven astronauts returned to the spacecraft Discovery today, likely to arrive on the way back to Earth in the middle of the week.
The title of EADS on the stock exchange is sanctioned
After the Air and Defence Group announced that it would have to spend between EUR 1.2 billion and 1.4 billion in order to counter the rest of the A400M, the EADS shares are currently showing a significant decline in the Paris Stock Exchange.
Currently, EADS loses 4% to 21.96 euros at the Paris Stock Exchange.
The Group was forced to review its business forecasts for 2007 once again referring to the delays caused by the slow development of the engine of the A400M which delay the flight of the aircraft.
The costs announced in October to compensate for the delay in the delivery of their military aircraft amounted to between EUR 1.2 billion and EUR 1.4 billion, more than one billion for Airbus, announced by the European manufacturer EADS' parent companies.
As a result of this cost, EADS will be forced to announce new operating performance targets (EBIT) for 2007, when presenting its quarterly results on Thursday, he added no further details.
The group also indicates that the estimate of the new costs is related to the six-month delay.
To remember, EADS' business performance fell by 86% in 2006, largely due to the delay in another programme, the costs of the very large A380 vehicle.
Originally, the group had scheduled the first delivery of the A400M to the French army for October 2009.
The choice of status quo
On Sunday it will not be exciting to count the Urn: the mass of the Russians will decide for President Putin's party, United Russia.
After a very successful election campaign, she confirms her efforts for stability, even for authoritarianism.
Three days before the parliamentary elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin sends a message to the voters who have already been recorded, but whose contents are kept secret.
He does this in his capacity as the top candidate of the United Russia, the Pro-Kreml party, for which he announces an overwhelming victory.
Yesterday, the President did not let anything go as soon as he received the foreign ambassadors, and he was pleased to provide a new attack on the West Powers who were accused of interference - his favorite theme during the election struggle.
We know the price of true democracy and hope for honest elections, extremely transparent and open, elections without fraud, he added.
From the point of view of the opposition, they have gone there.
It slows down a campaign of repression.
The Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says there would never have been such dirty elections, not even in the time of Eltsin.
After the repression of the demonstrations last weekend, ex-Schachweltmester Garry Kasparovder was sentenced to five days in prison for unauthorized demonstrations, according to his lawyer, continued to be banned.
The Russians have preserved the mentality of Homo Sovieticus
After these parliamentary elections without tension, two questions were raised:
Who will succeed Putins as president?
The Official Journal announced yesterday the date of the first election of the presidential elections on 2 March 2008 and the candidates have to make themselves known by 23 December.
Since he was elected 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot proceed for a third term.
And now there's no successor.
What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
Will the President of the majority of Parliament and the Almighty Party elect Russia, the Government and the President?
Whatever is going to be, in the parliamentary elections or in the presidential elections, the previous power will triumph.
It's tradition.
The Russians have preserved the mentality of Homo Sovieticus, they are not the Lord of their fate, according to sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the Independent Centre of Levada.
The historian Nikolai Kokossov from the State University of St. Petersburg goes back even further: the bourgeois society has grown very slowly in this country, which has been Christianized for five centuries to Europe; the famous community spirit has slowed the development of individuality.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, Putin again linked to the model of a paternist state, which was fully accepted by the population, more so, since this new paternism was not a terror, but a certain economic prosperity, says Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians from free pieces ignore the personal responsibility they have placed on the day after the collapse of the USSR.
What are you thinking for a long time?
This phenomenon concerns all the history of society, including the business world.
And the administrative unit understands how to maintain the status quo: 65 Governors (of 85 Russian regional presidents) run the local electoral lists of the United Russia.
The new, coming freedoms from the west are often the same as chaos, as in the 1990s.
The general public prefers stability.
In this sense, the Russians will not vote for the extremist parties either.
Conclusion of Tamara Cherednitchenko, a 54-year-old professor: Why do you think for a long time?
Those who are in authority are not so bad as to turn them away.
A Hard Think
After more than 60 years of confidential treatment, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which document the fate of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are now freely available.
The 47 million documents of the archive, which are stored at a total length of 27 km in Bad Arolsen, have not yet been viewed, unless it is with a humanitarian intent, that is, individually and by name, on the request of a former victim or his family.
In May 2006, eleven States, including Germany, France, Israel and the United States, agreed to make them available to researchers and historians.
After the ratification process has been completed, the opening has been valid since yesterday.
Helicopter Information
The access of historians to Bad Arolsen will allow for research, especially on the deportations of prisoners, the detentions of concentration camps and the health status of forced workers, explains Reto Masters, head of this archive, managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (CICR).
Until recently, several States, including Germany, have been able to make these name-related documents available to the public because of the very high level of information.
For example, the alleged homosexuality or the mental disability of some deportation victims.
The list of the concentration camps or the prison orders issued by the Gestapo had been compiled after the war for a practical reason: to find civilians who were deported or subjected to forced labor, and possibly to provide them with evidence of their arrest in order to justify their way to their compensation.
Today, more than 300 fixed staff are still processing tens of thousands of personal requests in Bad Arolsen.
However, part of the scientific community shows only a limited interest in access to Bad Arolsen.
No fundamental news could be expected in these documents, Pr. Wolfgang Benz, head of the Research Centre for Anti-Semitism at the Technical University of Berlin, 2006 explained.
The EU and India want a free trade agreement in 2008.
Today, trade between India and Europe is already reaching the 60 billion euros a year.
The EU is India's main trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
European Trade Minister Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nat, pointed out that the European Union and India hope to sign a free trade agreement in 2008.
The EU Foreign Ministers gave the European Commission a green light last April to open negotiations to sign free trade agreements (ALE) with India, South Korea and the Association of South-East Asian Nations (Asean).
The EU is India's first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but according to the figures of the European Commission, India is only the ninth trading partner of the EU.
A free trade pact will greatly advance the two economic areas and India would improve its access to a market of 450 million well-being Europeans, Peter Mandelson confirmed.
Europe is the first or second market for the ten most exported products from India, the European Commissioner continued to declare. Asian and European giants exchange goods of EUR 47 billion each year and services worth EUR 10 billion, Dálle Smadja, President of the European Commission's accession to New Delhi, said, and regrets that trade has not yet exhausted its potential. The EU and India meet on Friday with their eight diplomats in New Delhi, with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and European Commission President José Manuel Durao Barrosso.

The Bank of England takes note of the dissatisfaction and offers 10 billion pounds for five weeks
On Thursday, the Bank of England expressed concern about the current recurring concern over credit conditions and announced an offer of ten billion pounds with a basic interest rate of 5.75% for five weeks, an offer with unusual duration.
In order to mitigate the fears that the conditions on the financial market will be particularly hard at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty about how to organise their liquidity positions at that time, the Bank has the intention to offer them a significant part of its savings investments during the maintenance phase beginning on 6 December in the form of an open market operation for five weeks.
The Bank further states that on 6 December at 12.15 GMT 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be converted into the basic tax rate and only until 10 January.
This is apparently the first time that the BoE runs liquidity in an open-market operation for five weeks.
This usually happens for a week.
In its Communication, BoE adds that it is prepared to take further steps to obtain the different interest rates of the interbank loans from day to day with their basic interest rate.
The different interbank interest rate from day to day was 5.829% on Wednesday.
The three-month interest rate has fallen to 6.6%, slightly higher since 18 September.
Since the beginning of the financial crisis in the summer, the sums charged by the Bank of England have been linked to criminal charges that the banks have refrained from applying.
In the light of certain rumors, strengthened by the development of the pound price in contrast to the euro, many proposed to sign up for the sums put in circulation by the European Central Bank to more favourable interest rates and to be more discriminating.
UMP and NC refuse to review PS's proposals for purchasing power
On Thursday, the UMP and Nouveau Centre groups refused to discuss the articles of the socialist bill on purchasing power, which is similar to a rejection of the text.
The text of a socialist niche (meeting on the initiative of a parliamentary group) identified about ten measures adopted by the National Committee of the PS on Wednesday, most of which amounted to 50% for employment, for the re-introduction of the TipP fleet, for a transport check or for the limitation of rentals.
After the UMP and NC had voted against the review of the articles (180 votes against 115), the meeting was dissolved after the main discussion, which resulted in a partial exchange of words between the majority and opposition, a few hours before Nicolas Sarkozy’s TV contribution on purchasing power.
The rapporteur of the MEPs, Jean Marc Ayrault, announced that his group would present the whole of its proposals as an amendment to the draft law for the adjustment of the finances, which had been examined last week by the Assembly.
A new festival will be born
As a result of numerous reports about the creation of a new music festival in Philadelphia by C3 Presents, the Promoter/Producer announces the Wineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with the Festival Republic of the British producer Melvin Benn.
It is an honor for our company to work with a person who, no longer and no less, served as an example for the current festival movement in America, Charlie Jones from C3 shared on Bilboard.com.
C3 hosts the Lollapalooza Festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Wineland, New Jersey, is a summer destination for camping holidays.
The festival will be held from August 8-10 on a 500 Acre large private farm about 40 minutes away from Philadelphia.
The leader of the Festival Republic Melvin Benn, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the world's most renowned festival producers.
In 1989 he took over the leadership of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts 80,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Ben added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio, and then, 2006, Festival Republic created the Latitude Festival in Henham Park in Suffolk.
Since 2002, Melvin Benn has also taken care of production, licensing concessions and organizational tasks at the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Charlie Jones of C3, the Glasstonbury describes as the most inspiring event in which he has ever been, says that his company and Melvin Ben work side by side to offer the area a festival event in European style.
We have chosen Philadelphia as a market and work closely with the Fairmount Park Commission to create a festival in the city centre of Philadelphia, says Charlie Jones.
We conducted negotiations in the city and the Commission was motivated and excited about this project.
Unfortunately, we are stuck in police debates with regard to the current administration, and Charlie Jones continues.
" Fortunately, we were able to discuss with Melvin Ben and we are preparing to create a great festival in an extraordinary place that will ultimately benefit the population."
C3 Presents, the Lollapalooza -Festival 2005 in Grand Park Chicago, has been brought back to life after it was profiled in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival in the world of the festival.
In 2007, the two events amounted to $9.8 million and $11.8 million for gross tax purposes.
These two festivals take place in the urban environment.
"The European model of Melvin Benn is a rural festival, against which the unrest takes place rather on the urban green areas," says Charlie Jones.
"The aim is to combine these two concepts with one another in one way or another, at the same time to convey the impression of a rural festival to the European and a urban American."
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
"The community of Vienna, including the mayor, takes on the burden of this event with joy," says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to award the terms of the agreement, but he confirms that "they are sufficiently interesting to invest in such an event and to take up a festival that will hopefully have a long life."
Charlie Jones says the recording capacity of the festival is "very large", in about 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says that the invitations were sent to the groups, but that nothing could be confirmed when they were printed.
"Vineland will offer tasteful rock, but the music will be very diverse in the hope of attracting all kinds of spectators," says Charlie Jones.
His partner from C3, who received the Top Independent Promotion Award of the Last Ballboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal meets the Terminator.
It is not easy to get the main platform for Hollywood films to Montreal if no less than the terminator is faced.
These locks are part of the tasks of the delegates.
A political "heikles Mandat", because the Governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, is attacking Runaway Productions.
Is it hard to negotiate with the Governor?
"You must be careful, because it is the industry that decides where it goes.
If she finds that the conditions in Montreal are favourable, she'll go there.
Our role is to offer those who are best held for the best," he says.
The run to the festivals.
For Denis Turcotte, however, at the moment is the top priority of the cinema.
The hunt for the Oscars has begun.
At all the festivals on the west coast, although the Sundance, that of Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, will be about to introduce the films from Quebec, to evaluate them and to ensure that the producers provide interviews.
The dark age at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival had a successful performance a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake hands with the Devil is on the poster in Santa Monica and is presented at the 30th Star Denver Film Festival in November.
This month Quebec also presented four long and four short films at the American Film Institute Festival.
Is the stock exchange a final year-Rally? Ununity among experts due to the US mortgage crisis
With almost five weeks to the end of the year at the stock exchange, investors are already laying their hands on the next year's rally.
However, experts are not able to create secure forecasts in this regard.
Banif believes that it is purely statistical that the month of December at the stock exchange usually involves a positive market development
Nevertheless, it is not advisable to create forecasts in the short term and only on the basis of statistics, especially if serious tensions determine the current market situation.
While other experts do not welcome such a strong increase in the last few weeks of the year, they note that the stock exchange rate is determined by the given liquidity of the market and the market participant. These investments are mainly affected by the lack of safe equity funds, which is strongly affected by the prevailing trend in assets.
According to these experts, the stock exchange will have a rather lateral trend, influenced by market fluctuations, especially because we are not yet able to estimate the extent of the possible decrease in the interest rate of the US notary bank, which is due mainly to increased crude oil prices and the risk of an increase in inflation rates.
Javier Barrio, president of the sales department at BPI in Spain, agrees that it is a waiting time to announce a leading market rally.
The chances are not very good, the expert assures.
The Spanish stock index Ibex has already lost 4% since its highest mark on 8 November of 15.945.7 points.
But not all experts share the same negative opinion.
According to Juan Solana, an analyst at Intermoney, Ibex 35 could successfully close the year with almost 16,000 points due to the restructuring of the investment funds and the traditional one.
However, the expert points out that this year things could develop differently; especially because of the fact that they were already in the second week of December, and then immediately after the bridge day of the Constitution, which took place at the end of the year.
According to the analyst, price fluctuations would not affect market trends.
According to Federico Olucha, an analyst at the Investment Bank, the previous market assessment is at an almost technical level, which could lead to an early deviation from the index values, the extent of which depends on the consequences of the US mortgage market crisis.
The analyst trusts that these are positive.
When selecting the values that should lead to Ibex to new maximum levels, the analysts agree.
Solana by Intermoney estimates that this year are the main values in the series.
For the value winners, the expert would be the two large banks and some real estate companies, as the electricity sector will be too expensive at the given time.
In the meantime, Federico Olucha from the Bank Inversions ensures that the increase in the banking and industrial sector will be achieved.
If the Rally actually happens, the real estate companies will benefit from it.
In the last few months, the ACS has been on a stock exchange and we hope that other real estate companies such as Ferrovial and FCC will take the same route as the expert.
With regard to increased consumer behaviour during the Christmas season, the market situation will be determined in the last half of the year of regular consumption.
On the other hand, the expert believes that the technologies will also achieve positive sales results, even if they are only represented on the Spanish market in a small number.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, only two declines have occurred in December.
At the end of 2003, this led the stock exchange from its crisis and at the same time initiated the last real year's rally.
This year, in which Ibex raised 35 by 28.17 percentage points, December showed a rate increase of 6,68%.
Whether 2008 will follow the fifth year of winning (Ibex has risen by 8.36% since January) and can also present a final year's event will be shown.
Popular will have opened its 200 credit institutions from Monday to Friday 12 hours a day.
Popular has decided to modernise a large part of its branches.
A total of 200 of these are located in the strongest economic regions of Spain.
For the Institute, which operates under the brand name Popular Max, these branches represent a large milestone.
But also for the remaining Spanish institutions, as Popular as the first banking group represents the spring to extend the opening hours of its branches by 20.30 a.m. and to apply from 10 a.m. to 20.30 a.m. on Saturdays.
The Banking Group BBVA, which has also repeated the extension of its opening hours in the Netherlands, has not yet reached a final decision.
The Bank's current negotiations with trade unions seem to aim at an agreement that closes 75% of all branches on Saturdays and opens at one weekday in the afternoon, even if not for the customer.
If other banks join the new initiative that adapts to the opening hours, the experience of the Bank will depend on the experience.
And that is also the intention that the popular pursues with their project.
The aim is to extend the opening hours of those branches, which, because of their position, can capture the purchasing power of independent, small and medium-sized enterprises, but also those of large buyers.
The Bank wants to open up the new 200 branches over the next 18 months, as it is not a new, modified opening time.
For this purpose, the Bank will redesign the premises of those branches which are already in business zones and at the same time compare them with the individual customer profile of the different zones.
The extension of the opening hours is thus linked to a new space design of the branches, which is characterized by a more modern, colourful design.
The responsible bank representative, Ágel Rivera, ensures that restructuring does not require greater investment, but involves an increased staffing position, as a branch now needed no more six, but eight or nine employees.
The discounts that are even equipped with additional space for SMEs will not be sold.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has already tried his concept at nine branches in Madrid.
And the experience was positive, so Angel Rivero.
The branches of the streets Bravo Murillo, O’Donell and Gran Vía have been chosen for what seems to have been a clever decision.
People are currently looking for about 2500 discounts.
And another 60 that operate under the name of Mundocredit. These are specialized on immigrants and also show extended opening times, even on Sundays and holidays.
In these branches of PopularMax, the BBVA model is not used, as most of them are offered a wide range of non-financial services for sale instead.
We don't want to be competitive for our customers, says Rivero.
With phoneica they have provisionally agreed to sell mobile phones using external bank staff.
The Spanish private player Telecinco doubles its stock exchange value for the first time and thus takes over his rival Antena 3.
We did it.
With this sentence, the manager of Telecinco, Paolo Vasile, expressed his satisfaction at the closing of the stock exchange. The sender led by him had increased his value for the double of his rival Antena 3.
One aspect, however, dampened his joy: that's exactly what hurt me; not that we have a higher growth, but that we had lower losses, he established.
He stressed that despite the weak market, they were not too weak.
Telecinco ended the day yesterday with a plus 2.54%.
This profit reduces its previous losses to 15.66% this year.
According to Bloomberg, the company's value now reaches EUR 4,488,88 million, with the media controlling the main share of the capital (52%), and Vocento is only 13% involved.
The Rivale Antena 3 lost 1.52 percentage points yesterday and has reported a total loss of 40.5% since January so that its market value is 2.193,46 million.
On the other hand, the market value of other listed communications companies increases, in the case of Sogecable to 3,571 million, in Prisa (the author of Cinco Días magazine) to 2,518,53 million and in Vocento to 1,779 million.
The comparison with Antena 3 can be illustrated by the fact that it is two similar companies, so Vasile.
Of course, the question still arises, to what extent can we actually act brush-technically, at what price and how we can make it at customer level lucratically.
Telecinco announced a week ago his plan to raise this year’s first television broadcaster with more than 1000 million gross profits from advertising revenues. This assured Guiseppe Tringali, the manager of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the group’s advertising company.
If the project was to be implemented, the sender would increase its advertising revenues by 3.6% compared to the 965.4 million from the previous year.
In the case of Antena 3, net sales increased by 1.6% in the first nine stock exchange months (up to 734.4 million), while net revenues from the TV business could only increase by 0.7% (630.4 million ).
The main factor for telecinco’s better exchange rate comparison is that analysts at the high payout ratio that the company could have so far: in 2006 the company led by Alejandro Echevarría launched a 100-percent dividend discount.
Vasile assures, however, that after buying 33% of the shares of endemol, with mediaset as a parent company, the ratio could still vary, even if it is too early for an official notice.
We are committed to the official compromise to pay at least 50% of the shares, even though we have so far made a significant increase.
I hope that we can satisfy our shareholders this year, whose share values we have already been able to increase by buying 33% of the endemol shares.
According to the analysts, the market is currently showing certain losses.
Lehmann Brothers only recently reduced its profit calculation at Telecinco for this year by 4% and 7% for 2009.
This is the result of the reduction in expected growth rates, which will fall from 10.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
This also reduced the forecast profit estimate of Antena 3 for 2008 by 4.5% and 7.5% for 2009.
3 options.
1.
Ibersecurities: sets on its high effective income and its sustainable potential and therefore recommends the purchase of both shares.
2.
Caja Madrid: measured Telecinco (purchase) due to the numerous incentives and the prospering market a more favourable position with antena 3 (holding).
3.
JPMorgan: it is recommended to reduce expectations in both cases in view of the similar threats (market and poorer economic climate)
The Congress agrees with the MIFID Directive, which entered into force on 1 November.
In parallel to the parliamentary drafting, which ended its session today with the Assembly decision in the Senate on the additional/amending proposals to the project, the Government published the provisions of the new law with a view to enabling the entry into force of the two rules by the end of the year.
The representatives of the various companies unanimously praised the efforts of the Congress and Senate members who had pursued the objective of establishing the best possible regime to ensure investor safety and regulate individual business activities in order to guarantee a generally efficient market situation.
In addition, the MIFID, which re-established the Securities Services Regulation, aims to modernise the financial markets, improve investor protection, increase the control claim of the Spanish Securities Commission (CNMV) and promote cooperation between the various control authorities of the European Union.
The new Directive enables both specialised companies and natural or legal persons to offer financial advice and also contributes to the creation of new financial services undertakings (ESIS) to the consultancy companies that are associated with the investment and brokerage companies of securities.
In addition, it extends the number of financial transactions systems so as to add to the regulated markets the multilateral efficiency trading systems and the internationalisation of trade orders, which would eventually compete with the current economic operators.
The law obliges investment firms to take into account the priorities of their corporate profile, the confrontation and the forms of risk management on the market and to register all the projects carried out to facilitate the CNMV's control task.
The Economic Commission of the Congress saw further changes in the future, with the decision that the debt provision provided by titles should now be considered as complex funds for the investor due to its high risk rating, as confirmed by the U.S. mortgage and banking crisis. (US mortgage crisis)
In addition, the entry into force of the directive on the legal restriction of the working areas of diplomats; 30 years after 1977 the regulation which restricted the working areas reserved for them was adopted.
The Senate, on the other hand, established new positions in the financial sector, how the economic intermediary working abroad does not require authorisation from the CNMV and can offer its services for the commercialisation of products and for the profit of several investment firms at the same time.
The harmonised consumer price index (IPI) rose by five tenths in November and is now at 4.1%.
The indicator used by Eurostat to assess inflation rates within the European Union provides the average price developments in Spain in November.
Its publication complies with the principles of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB), which seek to compare local and quality data with US products by making it known.
The forecast for the indicator can be drawn up in advance by applying the same approach as the harmonised consumer price index, but at the same time using various other statistical modelling methods to estimate the information not available at the time of calculation.
However, the Spanish Statistical Office (INE) advised that the indicator previously identified should not be in line with the final result announced on 14 December.
The consumer price index (VPI) will continue to remain at a relatively high level
According to the Deputy Head of Government and Minister of Economic and Financial Affairs Pedro Solbes, the increase in the IPR in November was a temporary development, while ensuring that the price index would continue to remain at a relatively high level in the coming months.
However, Solbes found in the halls of the congress building that even if the current number is not good, the Spanish inflation gap to the other members of the monetary union has remained more or less equal in recent years.
He also stated that there were fewer surprises in November than in the previous month, in which the government did not expect such a high increase.
We expected a value of around 4%, the Minister of Economic and Financial Affairs announced the forecast published today.
Virgin is counting on Northern Rock revenues of over 42 billion euros in the next three years
The assets of Northern Rock are reduced by more than half, after the Bank in mid-September of last year had been in crisis, the British notary bank had requested an emergency credit, and they now account for only 12,000 million pounds (which corresponds to EUR 16,800 million).
At that time, the bank's assets recorded at 25,000 million pounds, a sum which has been significantly reduced by the loss of trust of customers within two and a half months, and despite the 100 percent guarantee of the government that the money will be safe until the end of the crisis is gone.
Virgin, who would continue the group after the acquisition under the brand name Virgin Money, has to bring about a quarter of the British banks' income, which will be made up of the facilities of the next three years, to acquire exactly those 18 billion pounds that are still needed to achieve their goal of 30 billion.
The Group of the Multimillionaire Richard Branson, known for its sudden advertising campaigns in the United Kingdom, intends to make 50,000 million pounds (approx. 70 million euros) flow in advertising and marketing campaigns annually to achieve its goal.
Northern Rock this week named Virgin Group, where three other companies are still involved, as his favorite bidder to lead it out of insolvency.
The mayor of Totana was arrested for alleged suspicion of involvement in urban corruption
This morning, the Spanish police arrested the current mayor of Totano (Partido Popular) of the city of Murcia, due to the urgent suspicion of urban corruption that was discovered this week.
In addition, one of the secretaries of the municipality and the head of the community police were arrested.
Last May, José Martínez Andreo represented the office of Juan Morales, current MP of the Popular Party and then President of the Municipality of Totana, and could, according to the information of the Cadena SER, be the original runner of the plot.
The officials will continue to search for the community and the Ministry of Urban Planning and will not exclude further arrests in the coming hours.
In addition, the lawyer of Juan Morales was accused, the chief suspect in the case of urban corruption discovered at the beginning of this week.
According to Cadena SER, the lawyer of the popular, and consequently privileged MP Juan Morales was arrested when he left the residence of his commander on the basis of important supporting documents to be associated with the plot.
In addition, other sources of information from the alleged orders Morales to a Galician construction company providing for the conclusion of a urban contract, in which the construction of a 200 hectares of large area was decided.
Eight people are currently in investigation.
Bono agrees to accept the candidateship of the PSOE in Toledo and, in the case of an election victory, in Congress.
Former Minister of Defence José Bono has accepted the offer of the President and Secretary-General of the Socialists, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, who will then present the list of PSOE candidates in the upcoming General Elections in Toledo and, in the case of an election of the Socialists, take over the office of the President of Congress.
This was announced by José Blanco, the organisation secretary of the PSOE, and Bono at the press conference, after a meeting with Zapatero was held at the party's headquarters today.
According to the Head of Government, the offer to the former Minister is justified, since it is important in politics to be able to count the best and Bono is among the best.
In addition, the politicians from Mancha, in the case of a victory for the Socialists in the upcoming elections, would appear to have been the chairman of the Congress for the party.
Bono would replace Manuel Martín as president of the Congress, which announced last November 15th, that the next general elections would no longer take place, that he would end his career in public policy and instead put himself in the university field for climate protection.
The former minister had to agree that since his resignation two years ago, the President of the Government had constantly forced him to return to political affairs.
Furthermore, he pointed out that, as with the appointment of the Vice-President for Economic Affairs, the party did not want to prevent citizens from taking over the positions of the President of Congress in the event of an election, and that this meant an act of transparency.
If he should actually take over the office, he hopes to turn the chamber into a house of respect and not to change the insults or screams to make them appear more and more similar to the citizens.
Unfortunately, from time to time, the impression is that the only place you can not talk about in Madrid is the Congress; the President of the Senate was interrupted up to 26 times.
At the same time, he praised the current President Manuel Martín and his good work and pointed out that he did not want to give rise to the view that the office had already taken over, otherwise his political opponents would call it an arrogance.
Climate propaganda
Since climate debate is subject to an unfavourable criticism, both the skeptics of climate change and those who put social and political debate at the forefront of this debate, the movement as a whole must bring about strong cohesion.
Especially when it comes to a leader of the movement who, as in the case of President Zapatero, considers the fight against climate change to be more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and even proposes to conclude a new treaty with the planet.
However, this proposal makes it clear in the declaration of action, or non-trade of its government, which has been crucial to the fact that Spain is in the EU at the top of the countries which have at least fulfilled the Kyoto Protocol.
Who are responsible for the failure to meet the requirements to which sectors this is due, and why his government, which proposed the treaty with the planet, has not stopped this development.
In addition, it is now forced to make the Spanish citizens aware of the measures it has provided for against climate change without any change.
What companies will be affected by the behaviour of citizens, the individual and collective savings measures to be taken, and the economic consequences of this.
More precisely, who needs to sacrifice and will be paid for saving the planet.
However, it has and will not give such explanations in the future.
Especially because it's about the sacrifice and the payment.
Because the measures that can be effectively implemented against climate change are unfavourable.
They are free, uncomfortable and dangerous for the accounts of companies and citizens.
Even if Zapatero, the petrol cent proposed by the PSOE, appeared strategically, it was dangerous for Zapatero to see himself forced to withdraw the proposal again.
Accordingly, it is now valid to save the planets with nothing, so with pure propaganda and empty voices without any real consequences.
With impressive statements, Commission, committees, protocols and new offices.
With its treaties with the planet, the other politicians must neither speak nor accuse, nor demand, but rather follow the demanding issue of tasting the meetings and delight others with its mildness and goodness.
However, this can only happen if the contract does not deviate from its pure virtual nature and therefore does not provide that the bike will be the only means of movement in the future, or we can only refresh ourselves with a box.
The mayor and police chief of Totana, due to the alleged development of urban corruption.
The Guardia Civil has arrested the mayor of the town of Totana, the popular politician José Martínez Andreo, belonging to Murcia. Also, the local police chief, the secretary of the mayor's office, and a hotel contractor, because of the suspicion of urban violations, was taken into custody today.
The city council was held at its headquarters, from which it was brought to the community and in its premises to the present time, surrounded by numerous agents who were also involved in the city administration and in the municipal construction of Suelo Industrial y Vivenda.
The three arrests are linked to the last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, where more than 2 million hectares of unresolved construction for urban projects should be redesigned under the leadership of the Galicia construction company Nuaria.
In addition, two other persons were not directly arrested, but were subjected to an investigation procedure initiated and carried out by the first court in Totonas.
The first six prisoners have been brought before the judge today.
Following the statement of investigation, Juan Morales is also identified against the former mayor of Totana and current independent PP deputy.
Furthermore, his ex-wife, the owner of a real estate company registered in Totana, as well as his current resident friend in Murcia, is suspected.
The president and owner of the Nuaria Group, the lawyer and entrepreneur Manuel N.A. from Vigo, was arrested in the village of Nigran (Pontavedra), as well as the manager of Suelo de Inmonaur Pablo José M.G., whose company works as a sub-group of Nuaria and is expected to receive the fine.
The investigations are carried out by the municipal authority against urban delicacy, under the supervision of the central unit of the Guardia Civil, whose representatives, in addition to the arrests, were conducting eleven further investigations, most of which were carried out in companies directly related to the arrests carried out in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
At that time, only one person was arrested in Totana: the holder of a regional known poultry farm that should have acted as a midwife.
The Nuaria construction group was commissioned to build the largest residential complex in Murcia, which should include more than 5000 apartments, a golf course and two spa hotels.
In Totana, the company acquired over 2.2 million square kilometers of area that could be converted. The aim was to implement a construction project that would raise the population of the municipality to 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria group includes other companies such as Autesa and Inomoyar, which promote the sale of property; Conyase, which operates in Vigo the parking spaces of the streets of Coruña, Venezuela and Plaza Fernando el Católica; Hogartel, whose activity is limited to the direct marketing sector and Preconiza, specializes in the promotion, sale and installation of building materials.
Things That Can Happen
1.
If you agree to this, we will reject the expression Book of the month and instead try to find a price name for other names with corresponding competences.
I already have a proposal.
People, life means change.
Of course you are cordially invited to make your proposals.

Our Finnish correspondent explains to us yesterday in the most important Finnish newspaper, the Helsinki Sanomat, published comment (Finland is located at the top of the PISA study), which refers to the comment published in the same newspaper on November 18th; on that day, the issue of which included the criticism of the book Blackburns.
The content of the philosophy section has become the subject of public debate after the tragedy around the school of Jokela.
Responsible for the cruel murder is an abiturator who quoted the works of Plato and Nietzsche in his messages.
In an interview with the daily newspaper Helsinki Sanomat, President of the Board of Education for Philosophy, Pekka Elo asked the teachers to take a more critical position on Plato and proposed that the Platon teaching should be removed from the sub-step teaching plans for the Philosophy of Gymnasia.

A colleague informs about the inclusion of illegal Internet downloads in the criminal law book:
A. The download of a song would be a violation of the law which would be subject to six months' imprisonment.
However, once again, if you extract a music store below a value of 400 euros, this is only considered as a simple violation (Article 623.1).
B. If you steal the business up to a value of EUR 1000, then the theft becomes a criminal offence, yet the penalty is less than a download (Article 234 of the Criminal Law).
C. If you listen to a car and return it forty hours later, then the penalty is still less than when you download it (Article 244.1).
D. It is less important to participate in a fight than in a music data exchange.
A three to 12-month prison sentence (Article 154 of the Criminal Code) is involved in a rebel dispute, while the exchange of data leads to a six-month-to-two-year prison sentence.
(Article 270 of the Criminal Law).
E. According to Article 184.2 of the Criminal Law, sexual harassment at work is considered to be less bad than downloading a DVD from the Internet.
F. The trade in copyright-protected films, which has not been authorised by the author, is subject to a higher penalty than the distribution of pornographic film material to minors (Article 186).
Well, if my colleague should have the right, then someone's got his demands pretty high.

My house doctor gives me one of his long, rare research articles entitled: Money leads to the activation of certain brain areas, especially if the others get more of it.
So the feelings arising from the monthly payment of the salary depend on the level of the colleagues.
The study was produced using a tomographic-magnetic reference analysis at the University of Bonn, and the results were published in the latest edition of the Science Journal.
According to statements by Bernd Weber, author of the study and director of the Bonner Brain Research Centre Life&Brain, the activation was the strongest when the participant gave the right answers and failed his partner.
The researchers were able to recognize that the brain activities always seem very moderate if both participants were correct in their response and thus also received the same amount; but if one of them received the double, it also became a stronger brain activity.
I am not sure whether it actually requires so much scientific effort to achieve such a result.
The Ombudsman from the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has been incarcerated for eight years after the Balkan war criminals. Her office is located in the State Court of Justice of the former Yugoslavia, located in La Haya.
Your mandate will run out at the end of the year and Carla will leave her office with a crying and smiling eye, as the chief leaders of the massacre of Srebrenica - with the eight thousand Bosnian Muslims alive - are still on the free footing of former General Ratko Mladic and former Bosnian leader Radovan Karadzic.
Their names are listed by the director Marcel Schüpbach, from Switzerland, as a model for the title of his documentary films La Liste de Carla (2006, not yet published in Spain); a film that, with the pace of a police thriller, pursues the Swiss state attorney from Belgrade to New York in its project to track the criminals who have been kidnapped and put pressure on their respective governments to narrow their networks.
What kind of insurance is best suited for me?
The KFZ insurance, which covers a potential accident caused by the driver, includes a high cost burden, which depends on various factors, such as age, gender, time of creation of the driver's license, family status, type of car to be insured and its use, etc.
Having a car is only the beginning.
Because it is even harder to find the appropriate KFZ insurance than the right vehicle model.
First of all, we have to be clear about what we have to do here.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and an insurer.
This agreement shall be determined in writing by means of an insurance contract which determines that the company receives the agreed insurance premium and is obliged to provide the amount of the damage in question.
The insurance premium is the price of an insurance that consists of several factors, such as age, sex, time of creation of the driver's licence, family status, type of vehicle to be insured or its use.
Insurance undertakings shall determine their prices according to the statistics, so that higher contributions are also due in case of a higher accident.
For this reason, over 25-year-olds and women have to make less contributions, as statistics show that these groups have a lower accident rate due to their discretion.
The same applies to married persons, since they tend to have fewer accidents than individuals, depending on the statistical values and therefore also on the company's convictions.
The benefits to be measured to the vehicle affect the frequency of the driving and thus also the probability of an accident.
The more often the use, the more likely the damage.
In fixing the premium, the insurance must take into account a whole series of points.
For this reason, the driver also has to study the situation thoroughly to choose exactly the car insurance that meets his personal needs first.
We are now listing the most important points to be taken into account in the selection of insurance in order not only to be able to meet a performance, but also a price-oriented choice.
Under 25 years of age, they meet many obstacles, such as low driving practice and the young driver's license, when choosing a cost-effective insurance.
Even if it would be best for the ideal insurance protection to complete full insurance, there are still more price-value alternatives.
Careful drivers can choose a full-cash with self-interest, so that the services of a full-cash insurance are covered but offered at a low price.
This type of contract includes that the customer has to pay part of the amount caused by the damage itself.
The amount is determined before the conclusion of the contract and on the basis of the amount of the insurance premium. This is the lower the amount to be paid, Luis Noguera, Spain's main representative at First Europe, explains an online insurance broker.
Another option is the extended insurance that ensures the customer against external accident damage, but not against the damage caused by the car itself.
Furthermore, this type of insurance would cover theft, fire and vehicle losses.
Here's a council.
If you are under 25 years of age, it is in your hand to reduce insurance costs; so your credit card increases by trying to drive carefully and avoid accidents.
A credit card is a reduction in the base tax rate in the relevant insurance company.
On the contrary, a penalty payment includes an increase in the rates stated.
The amount of credit and penalty payments depends on the company and its earnings.
If the company has a profitable year back, it can allow itself to increase the bonus payments, Noguera explains.
Once the 25-year mark is exceeded, it is easier for drivers to conclude a contract. The reason for this is the fact that the accident rate decreases with increasing driving practice.
Therefore, it is most appropriate to decide for a full-cash insurance with self-interest.
Normally, young people cannot benefit from their previous experience, both in the event of an accident and at the time of driving, explains the Spanish chairman of the European company, and adds that the majority of accidents occur in the second year of practice after the fear of the beginner has been dropped.
However, it is more advisable for a married customer who does not have children to complete full-cash insurance; of course, only if it allows the financial situation of the person concerned.
On the part of the insurers, couples with children are considered the customers with the lowest accident rate, and therefore their contribution payments are also low.
In this case, a full insurance with self-interest (in the case of an amount of EUR 300) would be the best option. In case you have received a high credit card, an extended insurance is recommended, which is used only for the third year of the vehicle.
They drive more relaxed and have a larger purchasing power that allows them to make a higher contribution payment, Luis Noguera says.
For Renter, it is proposed to complete a full cash insurance with self-interest (in the case of an amount of EUR 150), or an extended insurance, which only applies to a sufficiently high credit.
Finally, it must be noted that car insurance is something very important, not only because it protects the driver from possible accidents, but also because it involves high costs that require a thorough selection that meets our personal situation.
The Celtic Glasgow in Milan is looking forward to the point for the eighth final
The FC Milan and Celtic Glasgow will fight the point they lack on the next Tuesday in San Siro to reach their respective goals even before the final round of the Champions League. The Italians need the point to reach the top of their group, while it decides on their participation in the Scouts.
The Italian team already has five points and have already confirmed its participation in the fifth round with an undecided in Portugal, while the Celtic Glasgow with nine more points is needed to ensure that the FC Shakhtar with six points does not include Befica Lisbon with four points.
The two games of Group D will take place one week before the end of the sixth round, as FC Milan will have to take place at the FIFA World Cup Championship in Japan, where he will fight for the first time at the 13th semifinals to enter the 16th finals.
Thus, this group will be concluded above all and the undecided outcome in Guiseppe Meazza Stadium is expected, even if both teams are tried to win. The Italians will not at home speculate that the Celtic Glasgow knows that they would be in the case of a winning group leader and thus have a better starting position in the eighth final.
The team of Gordon Strachan could even qualify for a defeat at a fall of the FC Shakhtar. However, he should not rely too much on such circumstances, because at nine points the Ukrainians are equal to the participation; the last week they lost in Glasgow (2-1) but could win in the second game (2-0).
Thus, the Milanians will try to miss the shots at night. They hope to reach the eight finals of the redesigned champion league for the second time, after they were defeated in the pre-season game in exactly the same round by a gate of Kaka in the playback time (1-0) and by a zero-zero undecided on the play.
While the FC Shakhtar waits for the victory of the Rossoneri, the team will have to focus on its own game, as both the achievement of the eight-finals and its membership at UEFA depend on its victory and a defeat of the Celtic Glasgow.
In spite of its lower table position and without the prospect of continuing to participate in the largest European championship, Benfica Lisbon could gain third place through a victory and thus play with UEFA.
20,000 people visit the first concert of the Spice Girls Tour in Vancouver.
In the Canadian Vancouver, Spice Girls provided 20,000 visitors to the launch panel for their first tour after the band was dissolved in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) y 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) said shortly before the start of her concert at the GM Place de Vancouver Stadium that the mood in the reunited band was excellent.
About 20,000 people were able to live in the sold stadium, where a video was shown to the story of the band that had taken care of furore at the end of the 1990s.
The reunite and the world tour overlap with the publication of a new album, which includes their biggest hits and two more new songs, headslines and voodoo, and it appears in Spain under the label of EMI.
The five members of the Spice Girls wore gold bracelets on the stage, which had previously been donated to them by the husband of Posh Spice, the English footballer David Beckham.
The athlete was among the fans in the audience who brought the GM Palace to light, although the nerves of his husband Victoria had banned him in the days ahead.
During the preparations for the show, Victoria Beckham said that the British Star did not get our Garderobe's only face, and that's why I'm so excited about what he's going to do.
Sporty Spice , whose departure from the group in 1998 due to internal disagreements two years later brought the group's resolution, expressed her nervousness two hours before the concert at a press meeting.
I was shocked.
I was nervous, but I saw that the attitude of the world's public had changed, that the feelings of the Spice Girls had changed.
And that's why I didn't really think; so I'm glad to have made this decision, Chisholm expressed himself on the separation of the band she had set up nine years ago.
The singer also said that the disputes had been eliminated and that at the same time everyone was very happy again.
However, many things have changed since the last joint appearance of Spice Girls in 1998.
The group first arrived in a special machine of Virgin Airlines in Vancouver after the report of the TV broadcaster CTV.
At her arrival at the airport, the band was received by a army of girls.
The five have seven children together.
After the concert in Vancouver, the band will be the next in California, San José (on 4 December) and Los Angeles (on 5 and 7 December).
In Madrid they will enter the stage on 23 December.
New fears about natural gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine
A new price dispute between Ukraine and Russia, which increases the risk of Russian exports of fuel to Western Europe.
The vast majority of Russian natural gas exports to the European Union (EU) are led by Ukraine and each dispute between the two nations is observed very closely.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow increases the price it has to pay for the natural gas, it will account for higher transit charges from Russia.
An earlier conflict between the two countries has reduced deliveries to the EU countries in the last year.
The recent dispute between Kiev and Moscow takes place at a time when the Ukrainian government and the Russian state gas monopoly Gazprom are trying to reach an agreement on how much Ukraine must pay for Russian natural gas in 2008.
According to Gazprom, Ukraine has to be calculated more, as the group has agreed to pay up to 50% additional for natural gas from the neighbouring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say that this could mean that Ukraine has to pay 40% more for imports of gasprom.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit countries in talks," said the Minister of Economic Affairs of Ukraine Anatoli Kinakh of the News Agency Reuters.
"The changing prices of natural gas should undoubtedly be linked to our arguments regarding the level of transit charges [in Western Europe] over Ukraine."
In the last major natural gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev in January 2006, gasprom delivered to Ukraine.
This led to a case of exports to Western Europe, leading to a drastic increase in prices.
Russian gas represents a quarter of the European Union's supply.
Russia has the world's largest gas presence, but much of it remains underdeveloped.
The result is that Gazprom complements its own gas supplies from Turkmenistan and other Central Asian former Soviet nations.
NHS "to control foreign workers"
The Scottish State Health Service has to improve the checks of the pre-trial register for workers from outside Europe, a member of the control body said.
The recommendation of Chief Financial Controller Robert Black came after a foreign doctor in Scotland was brought in conjunction with the attack on the airport of Glasgow in June.
Black also expressed concern that the Scottish State Health Service had no accurate ideas about the number of foreign employees.
However, his report pointed out that other important checks were carried out correctly in a sample of five health authorities.
The main financial controller investigated staff recruited outside the European Economic Area as a result of the attack on the airport of Glasgow.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after driving a car through the doors of the main airport terminal.
He was one of three doctors who appeared in a video transmission in October in Old Bailey and was charged in connection with the moderate car bomb attack in Britain.
It is expected that the State Health Service shall carry out checks in advance of the establishment of foreign staff to ensure that they possess the necessary qualifications, experience and authorisations to work in the United Kingdom.
Although the health authorities are using Dissoluse Scotland for the review of pre-trial registers, the Agency does not have the responsibility to obtain this information outside the UK.
The report of the main auditor now says, in addition to other recommendations, that the Board should act on guidelines for the prosecution of criminal offences, helping employers in checks in different countries.
"Although we have found evidence of these controls in some staff reports, these have not been carried out routinely," the report noted.
Black said that the Scottish health authorities would follow their investigation directives to a high degree before the establishment, but added: "Our report shows areas where the system can be improved to ensure that accurate information on the number of foreign health workers is available."
BMA Scotland-president Dr. Peter Terry said it was "extremely unlikely", that investigations in advance of the deployment of potential NHS employees would identify people who could carry out future terrorist attacks.
"In the report it means that current pre-position tests of NHS Scotland work well and it is not clear what added value the recommendations will be given," he said.
The Scottish health authorities say that they currently have 1,161 foreign employees, the majority of them doctors and nurses.
However, the financial controller warned that the number is likely to be higher, even because the authorities had problems identifying those employees who are allowed to work for an indefinite period of time.
The investigation further found that the established control procedures of NHS authorities in Ayrshire, Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire, and Lotian were largely observed.
These include passports, work permits, and qualification checks.
the Scottish Government is currently reviewing its policy and guidelines for pre-employment checks for foreign personnel in the NHS.
The Secretary of Health Nicola Sturgeon said: "It was a matter for me to carry out this work in view of the terrorist attack on Glasgow Airport."
It added that the Scottish government, in conjunction with the health authorities, would take into account the recommendations of the report and ensure that the best practices in updated guidelines on control investigations would be reflected in advance of the appointment of all employees - including those from abroad - whose publication is planned next month.
Joy Division dominates film award
Control, the film biography about the late Joy Division Singer Ian Curtis has hidden five prices from the British Independent Film Festivals, including for the best film.
Prices were also awarded to the chief director Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse before he was cast for the role of Curtis, director Anton Corbín, and deputy director Toby Kebbell.
Dame Judi Dench was awarded the best major actor for the Thriller Notes on a Scandal.
And Bond-Darseller Daniel Craig won the Variety Prize for having turned the British film into the world public.
The prices were handed over in a ceremony in the London Roundhouse.
Control follows Curtis' rise to fame with Joy Division until his suicide in 1980 at the age of 23.
The black and white film - on which the soundtrack The Killers, David Bowie and New Order can be found - was turned for only 3 million British pounds.
Nevertheless, he introduced the Dutch photographer Corbín, until now the most famous for the cultic cover of the U2 album Joshua Tree, two prizes - as the best director and the best director.
Rockmusic was the focus of another prizer at the ceremony - when Julian Temple's film on the Clash singer Joe Strummer won the prize for the best documentary film.
The prize for the best performers went to Viggo Mortensen for his role as a driver of a Russian Mafiabose in David Cronenbergs in London.
Ray Winston, who is in charge of playing hard, has taken Richard Harris' award for his outstanding contribution to the British film.
The 50-year-old, including Scum, Nile by Mouth and Sexy Beast, currently filmes the Indiana Jones Continuation The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.
Winston said he was proud to receive the prize that was named after the Camelot and Harry Potter Stars Harris, who died in 2002.
"There were people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney who opened doors for people like me," he said.
"I was lucky to meet Richard Harris a few times.
He's my type of man, a great actor of his time, I'm really honored."
The independent film prices, known as Bifas, are selected by a group, belong to filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
The Bifa supporters and sponsors include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Sea Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
208 arrested in Saudi Arabia for a terrorist plot
Saudi Arabia discovered yesterday that it had arrested 208 militants because of their affiliation to cells that had planned an imminent attack on an oil plant as well as on spiritual and security forces.
The state television of the world's largest oil exporter said that one of the cells had planned to smuggle rockets.
Sympathians of Al-Qaida have launched a campaign against the monarchy, which has been an association of the United States since 2003, following the invasion in Iraq.
A cell of eight militias, identified by a foreign national, is attacking an oil plant in the eastern province, according to the TV report.
Saudi Arabia has formed a 35,000-strong rapid intervention force to protect after a failed Al Quaida attack on the world's largest oil processing plant in Abqaiq in 2006.
The report, referring to an internal ministerial statement, says that 18 of the prisoners belonged to a cell led by a "racquet expert" who illegally entered the country.
He reports that the militants had planned to smuggle eight projectiles into the Kingdom.
Another 22 of the detainees had reported on the death of spiritual and security forces.
The government has warned spiritual men to do more to stop Saudis, who are trying to join Al Qaida militias in Iraq, who want to fight allied forces and the US-supported Shiite Muslim government, who are viewed by the hardliners under the Sunni Saudis as kezeric.
Al Qaida militias consider many of the clergy in Saudi Arabia to be in cooperation with the authorities in supporting the politics of the royal family, which dominates the government.
The militias - accompanied by calls from Osama bin Laden, the leader Al Qaida, born in Saudi Arabia, to target the provincial Saudi government - have distinguished it from foreign residential areas, government buildings and energy sector facilities.
"This has been a very great effort of the security forces over the last five months," a speaker from the Ministry of the Interior told the state television.
The arrests also included a "medicine" of 16 from Medina, which aimed to promote the "Takfiri thought" - the ideology of the radical Sunni Muslims, who support violence against Muslims, who are branded as unbelievers and apostates.
Among the prisoners, 32 people were also accused of providing financial support to the militia.
The climate on Venus could give you a glimpse of the future of the earth
The Venus was perhaps once a pleasant place to live, scientists said yesterday.
Data from a European spacecraft on a orbit show that the planet is even more similar to a distant twin of the earth than it was previously aware of.
Venus is the closest planetary neighbor to the earth.
The two worlds have about the same size and have similar planets, but the Venus of the sun is a little closer.
Millions of years ago, on Venus, conditions that were very similar to those on earth and could even be inhabited were believed by scientists today.
But because of the most unbearable carbon dioxide effect, the erosion of the atmosphere by solar radiation and a slower rotation rate, Venus introduced a completely different development course.
Today, the planet is robbed of water and has a surface temperature that is hot enough to melt lead and is devastated by hurricane-strong winds and lightning storms.
The findings of the Venus Express space probe of the European Space Agency, which has examined the plants for a year, offer a veritable view of how the earth could develop in the face of catastrophic climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor of the Department of Physics at Oxford University, one of the directors of Venus Express Mission, said: "It will be clear why the climate on Venus is so different from that on Earth, while the planets are rather similar."
"Our new data enables us to construct a scenario in which the Venus began billions of years ago as the Earth may have started with a inhabited environment."
"Enriched Uranus" seized by the police
A kilo of radioactive material, reportedly enriched uranium, was seized yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
One police spokesman said that three people were arrested and that the material was being examined.
He did not confirm whether it was an enriched uranium, but said it could have been sold for $1 million (480,000 pounds).
Everything is still open
In the midst of Romey, he said he did not consider it worthy of a presidential candidate to be questioned by a snowman.
Nevertheless, the Republican candidate for the Presidency finally agreed to put a debate on YouTube, in which normal voters would take up and submit questions on video to send them to the candidate.
None of the questions raised on Wednesday, 28 November, were as ridiculous as the snowman, who asked the Democrats about global warming in the other party's YouTube debate.
But the questions, and the answers, reflected exactly this time the state of the Republican Party, which will be held in elections next year.
It is not known, just like the CNN producers who supported the debate with those who chose YouTube clips to show the candidates.
However, in the first half of the debate, which was devoted to one single topic, immigration was at the centre.
The issue is one of the most powerful issues for Republicans.
The CNN asked a group of undecided voters to serve a selection disc when they heard things that seemed to them: The TV station noticed points of agreement when the candidates spoke strictly across the borders.
The sharpest and longest exchange of the evening was between Rudy Giuliani, the national leader, and Romney, who moved ahead in the decisive polls in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Giuliani is trying to unscrew the reputation he was after him with regard to illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.
He attacked Romney in which he accused the former governor of Massachusetts of putting illegal immigrants to work at his house.
The two asked themselves particularly strongly about whether one of the candidates would support a "amnesty" (the illegals would give regular status and the possibility of citizenship).
More important candidates, such as Duncan Hunter, a California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, were able to address this issue.
None of the two men have serious opportunities to nominate, but both remain in the race, perhaps because they had previously and worsed than others on the immigration march.
At least in the area of immigration, candidates share the same views in large and all: stricter borders, intolerance against illegal migrants.
This topic, together with fears about toxic toys from China or other concerns about the rest of the world, helps Republicans to forget or minimize the differences between Liberals and Christian conservatives.
But the debate was clearly problematic than other issues.
Mr Giuliani was asked why he has supported arms restrictions in the past.
John McCain and Romney discussed whether simulated beverages should be considered torture.
One of the students asked if the candidates believed every word of the Bible.
This led Giuliani to point out that although the Bible is his favorite book, he may not literally believe the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another puzzleist asked whether Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - now against all expectations in the first place in a recent survey in Iowa thanks to his long-standing Christian conservativeism - said that the death penalty is painful but necessary.
When he was forced to ask whether Jesus would support her, he laughed at her and said that Jesus was too intelligent to apply for a political office.
The race remains extremely open.
Huckabee's rise in Iowa together with Ron Paul's most recent financial success and his impact in the debate on Wednesday.
These two are shot out of nowhere, because the two birds of the party have not yet been able to agree on one of the most famous and traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate joined the party from the beginning and convincingly united with a strong message about the size of America and a twin to both the party's wings.
This time the party is split and the result is far from clear.
Pain of the Labour Party
Gordon Brown has discovered another pit to fall; his way out of this remains the same.
For British scandals, this is not particularly spicy.
No noble title seems to be sold, no politician pays Paris hotel bills, no extraordinary toes have been heard.
But the discovery that a wealthy businessman has spent more than 650,000 pounds (1.3 million) on behalf of other people over four years, and that the party has failed to report this is something that would have been good without the fighting Gordon Brown.
When two months ago the President-in-Office of the Council of Ministers had withdrawn the request after an election, in that way, he was in favour of the intelligence of the British by claiming that questions of opinion had not affected this decision, there was hope that he would provide a robust, efficient government.
Instead, as Vince Cable, the increasingly sharp representative of the Liberal Democrats, expressed it, has developed the once feared Brown from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The inappropriate rescue of Northern Rock, a bank hit, showed regulatory weaknesses and poor judgements under arrest.
Badly thought-out proposals to amend tax laws have brought company associations against the government.
The tax loss of personal data of 25 million people showed unimaginable administrative fraud.
A trio of generals in rest began a protest in the upper house against cuts in military spending: being the minister of the forces, so they claimed to be a part-time job.
Now there are the many gifts of David Abraham; Peter Watt, Secretary-General of Labour (and her former CEO) has already returned.
None of this means that Brown unrepeats the direction of departure.
However, governments can reach a turning point after which they cannot feel it.
They don't even want people to be politicians, but they usually keep their skeps back when a new force seizes the office.
Once it is clear that it is unlikely that a prime minister will improve the situation, and he does not need to be there for a long time, this upheaval is over: the public service is beginning to fail; the cabinet ministers begin to complain; the press is looking for bad news; and the government is going to be defensive and aimless.
In one way, Brown's position is particularly difficult because he cannot claim to be a new bees, unlike other political leaders.
So he wanted to lie to Tony Blair, he was his lieutenant.
The problems with Northern Rock and the tax liability submissions, for example, are linked to decisions made by Brown as Chancellor of the Ministry of Finance.
And even if it wasn't directly involved in Blair's misdemeanour - as in the long investigation of political party funding - the voters may assume that it was.
Still, Brown's situation isn't as bad as it looks.
The mistakes are not as terrible as the conservatives describe them.
Like with Mr. Bean, no one died or was completely overwhelmed.
And the antidote, painful as it may be, is to deliver what Browns of course have always promised Stalinist tendencies: a reliable, solid and slightly brutal government.
The new witness about political donations is a good example.
Abraham’s garboesque, which compares his gifts to his unfavourable gifts, says he does not wish public recognition for his well-being.
This may be the case, but the decision to do so did not come to him.
The laws against anonymity for large political contributors are clear and exist for a clear reason: the public has a right to know who can buy access to those who govern the country.
What he says he would have known of Abraham's agreement, but not that it is illegal, will of course have to ask some questions; just like Jon Mendlesohn, Labour's chief financial operator, who was told about the independent donations in October.
But so far Brown is not involved: There is nothing that indicates that he knew about these confusions, although most of the payments were made after his acquisition in June.
So far, the Prime Minister has completed half of the work.
He quickly condemned the violation of the laws by his party, but he liquidated this determination by taking after a well-known instrument, a committee of inquiry on the subject - in order to complete the measure, by a bishop in rest and a judge.
In this case, the "teachers to be drawn from it" are not very complicated.
Once the law is broken, it's a matter for the police.
Apart from this, there are other things that Mr Brown has to do, like finding a permanent chairman for the Independent Committee on Standards in Public Life, which has been unoccupied for six months, and moving forward with a comprehensive reform of political party funding.
This would require the workers' hardliners to cooperate with the conservatives and possibly to give up the special financial relationship with the trade unions - bitter pills for a party-friendly such as Mr Brown.
But he should be aware of some party facts.
The conservatives now have a clear leadership in the questions of opinion; he has two years to win back voters; and the only way he can achieve a victory is through unmistakable justice and solid competence.
Cardboards
Does the credit crisis set the US credit card market?
When blood is in the water, it's only natural that the backflows stir up.
Now where America's real estate market is disrupting, the predators have the credit card market of the country in their visa.
Goldman Sachs analysts estimate that credit card losses could reach $99 billion if the risk of underfunded loans spread to other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of tension are clearly visible.
There are increases both in the books and in the rates of education that measure the proportion of loans that are not deductible or too late for more than 30 days.
In the last month, HSBC announced that it had taken a $1.4 billion levy from its US consumer funding, partly due to the weakness of credit card holders.
It's still too early to panic.
Loss and loss are still low.
According to the rating agency Moody, the third quarter rate of 3.89% was almost a full percentage of the historical average.
In part, the deterioration in the rates can be explained by technical factors.
A change in US Private Solvency Law in 2005 resulted in a severe case of competitive applications which, in turn, constitute a large part of the card loss; the number of applications (and thus fees) would increase again if the general conditions for creditors were to deteriorate or not.
Industry also reports on solid payment rates that show how much of their debt consumers pay each month
and trust in credit card-based securities is quite strong, despite the standstill in other areas of structured financing.
Dennis Moroney of the TowerGroup, a research firm, estimates that the amount of expenditure for 2007 will ultimately be 25% higher than last year.
Direct channels of infection between the real estate credit crisis and the credit card market are certain: it is more likely that consumers will accept credit card debts now that their own credit will be dried up.
However, the card exhibitors look at the cash flow instead of capital values, so falling home prices do not necessarily trigger a change in the creditworthiness of the creditor.
You can even be for the card exhibitors of advantage.
The incentives for consumers to continue to pay mortgage rates are reduced if the properties are less value than the value of the loan; as a result, the credit card debts will become more important under the repayment priorities.
Map exhibitors can also react much faster and more flexible than credit providers to the stormy conditions by changing interest rates or credit limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risk of rapid reassessment of assets.
"We will not wake up one day and re-evaluate the loans completely," says Gary Perlin, Capital Ones Chief Financial Rapporteur.
Even if a sudden undercover crisis in the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of a sustainable decline are much more real.
If lower domestic prices and a reduction in US credit are forced into recession, the industry will no doubt face a worse future.
Keep looking at these shark streams.
British bankers acknowledge themselves guilty in the case of Enron
Three British bankers who were supposed to be brought before the court for their role in the fraud system with the former chief financial manager of Enron, Andrew Fastow, changed their search on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew initially had seven cases of fraud using telecommunications means for alleged conspiracy with Fastow in a secret financial fraud in 2000, in order to enrich themselves at the expense of their employer.
The procedure was implemented in January.
But during a hearing before the U.S. District Court, Ewing Werlein Junior filed charges for a case of fraud using telecommunications.
The three former leaders of Greenwich NatWest, a unit of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, were known in Britain during delivery procedures that lasted two years.
In the United States, their case is a loose end to an investigation that was launched after Enron's collapse in 2001.
The original charges against them in 2002 were pointed out by Fastow that it was the objective of a government investigation in relation to the enron decline.
The charges against the bankers - called the "NatWest Three" - claim they came to Houston in 2000 to highlight a fraudulent plot with Fastow and his former top advisor Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of an Enron partnership, which was controlled by Fastow, the architect of countless fraudulent enron machines that contributed to the company's racing in the competition.
At the beginning of 2002, the Bank valued its participation in the subsidiary at zero, but the three British men knew that it had a significant value in reality.
A company under copper control acquired the bank's share of the subsidiary for $1 million.
The bankers paid 250,000 dollars to participate in this company.
According to the prosecution, Fastow wrongly argued against Enron that the energy company would pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its share in the subsidiary.
But in fact, the 20 million dollars went to the British bankers, Fastow and others.
The bankers received $7.3 million, while Fastow, copper and other $12.3 million, according to the prosecution.
In January 2004, Fastow found himself guilty of perjury in two counts for his role in Enron's Square.
The British Trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is serving a 6-year prison sentence in the federal prison of Louisiana.
Copper is sentenced to three years and a month in an institution in Texarkana.
Each of the three men was free on the basis of a $1 million bail that made it necessary for them to live in the United States in expectation of the trial.
Enron, once the seventh largest company of the nation, was involved in the competition in December 2001, after years of bookkeeping tricks could no longer make billions of debts or weak businesses appear profitable.
The collapse destroyed thousands of jobs, more than 60 billion market value and more than two billion pension plans.
The Enron Founder Kenneth Lay and former CEO Jeffrey Schilling were sentenced last year for their roles in connection with the Enron collapse.
Schilling is a punishment of more than 24 years.
Lays Condemnations for perjury, fraud and other charges were null after he died of heart disease last year.
Not quite down in Moscow
The price of a Golfstream G550 aircraft, equipped with a roll-royce engine and enough range to fly nonstop from Moscow to Los Angeles, is at least $54 million.
But this is Kleinfeld for some of the rich Russians.
"It offers space for up to 18 passengers," said Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
"But none of you asks for so many seats because it's for a private family or a president."
Firer was at the Gulf Stream stand on the last Friday at the Millionary Exhibition, a four-day organ of displayed consumption, which was held in a closed exhibition centre on the outskirts of the capital.
In addition to golfstream, more than 200 other luxury providers had built exhibition stands, hoping to interest newly arrived Russians in all, from Mahagoni-felled yachts to diamond-crossed car grills, which would be suitable for 50 cents.
Four carefully took a shiny orange Porsche at the next exhibition stage in the viewer.
"It's a nice car, but it's Kleinfeld compared to us," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private aircraft."
Heated by an oil boom, the Russian capital seems to be overrun with money like Dallas at its glossy times.
"We went through the same phase in the 1890s, when some Americans came to giant wealth and went to Schares to Europe where they were considered materialistic," said Marshall Goldman, a scientist at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
Like the Saudi Arab survivors of the 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians are the world's most visible free money issuers.
The most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their share of gold.
Anderswo in Moscow this week invited a conference of the luxury industry Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, president of LVMH, to exchange ideas on how to sell high-priced goods on markets like Russia.
(The Conference will be organised by The International Herald Tribune, owned by the New York Times Company.)
Russia has 53 billion dollars, totaling 282 billion dollars, according to the Forbes list of the richest people.
In addition, 103,000 Russian millionaires belong to the second class, worth a total of $670 billion, according to a study on the development of private assets in the former Soviet Union, written by economic experts from the Centre for Economic and Financial Research, an expert body here.
(The World Bank says that 15.8 percent of the Russians lived below the minimum of existence in 2005.)
"There are hundreds of millions in Moscow - that's why we're all here," said Nicole Marais, a sales and marketing representative of David Morris, a London jeweller.
For the first time she had visited the fair with the Russian dealer of the brand, the Soho Jewelry Group.
"The women are all well-respected and the men are all worth a fortune."
While they go to the halls on Sunday night wearing clothes, two real estate owners, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, themselves and their clients are described as millionaires.
"I've looked at the cars and I'm trying to decide between the Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche," said Mrs. Yumatova, who delivered the design clothing she wore, like a rotter carpet veteran with Joan Rivers.
The fair seemed primarily to target the new rich, the type of brand-conscious Russian buyers who would be willing to stand for several hours in the stable to visit an additional warehouse, which unparalleledly placed Cadillac Escalades, platinum bags, Mövenpick Ice cream, tailor-made billiards, apartments in Dubai and Gun Teddyburys.
The public could buy tickets for 30 euros (44.57 dollars).
"The Russians are interested in learning which brand is the most expensive and the best," said Mr. Gijrath, who sat patriotic at a exhibition by the Dutch porcelain manufacturer Royal Delft in front of a large image of a rembrandt made of handmade blue mosaic stones.
"Of course, Russians are more interested in clipper clipper."
In fact, the traders here say that the Russians with old money (10 to 15 years old according to Russian standards) have already moved from large-scale logos to the kind of naked brands with limited numbers that would not be marketed at a commercial show.
Nevertheless, thousands of people, whether millionaires, sent by millions or simply tourists, were forced through the halls every day.
And some of them bought.
On the first night of the show on the last Thursday, Roman Ersov, the general manager of King Koil Bedten said here, he would have sold two $70,000 matratzen set, made of silk, Kaschmir and cotton, with unique gold ropes.
Also on the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, a sales manager for A1 Moto, told a company that the high-end cars with high-end alarm systems provided that his company sold the green orange Porsche for 170,000 dollars to a Russian millionaire.
Until Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, said that a company that adapted luxury cars to customer wishes, he would have sold three car refrigerator grills for a roll-Royce Phantom, which are the same for each of the 55,000 dollars of chain armor.
He showed a reporter a car tire that was developed for a Russian casino owner, with stores that he had worn with colorful Swarovski crystals, so it looked like a rouletted.
The cost: $22,000 for a quarter.
"The Russian millionaire, the street rider or a picture of his wife's face from the Cuban zirconium will not necessarily ride on these wheels," said Mr. Karapetian.
"He will keep it in his 30 or 40 cars garage."
Even though many of his Russian customers are rich, Mr. Karapetian said that the phrase "Russian millionaires" would not express much exclusivity at the moment, given the rise in real estate prices.
"If you bought a apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, they're probably already millionaire, at least on paper, if not in cash," he said.
"There are more of them than you believe."
Those who were not millionaires could at least do as much as if they were rich at a position operated by the Alliance Continental, a Russian asset management company.
The company had set up four red telephone cells in British form, which were completely closed with mountains of false millions of dollars.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing director, said his employees had printed 500,000 false bank notes for the millionaires fair.
Passants were asked to turn the money holes around, to take mobile phone photos, while they were in the middle of the replacement, to let friends cut, or simply to insert a few million.
"Look, in Moscow everyone can feel like a millionaire," said Mr. Karryev.
Suspected operation at death in New Jersey
It was the day before the harvest festival as Ronald Livingstone through the large glass window of the Just a Little Healthier Restaurant here and watched as a car on the white Cape Cod held two doors down at West Scott Avenue.
Soon there was a police car.
And then there was another one.
"Then I saw the boxing car of the medical bodyguard," said Livingstone, an overseer of the restaurant, on Wednesday.
"That was the point when I knew someone was dead."
The authorities found that the dead woman Olga Arroyo, 41, was an assistant to the director of the Newark Police Station.
Now the investigators are trying to determine whether they died because of a procedure performed by an unauthorized cosmetic surgeon who did not identify the police and who worked at the house at West Scott Avenue 212.
The authorities have not yet found what has caused Mrs Arroyo's death, and they are hopeful that toxicological investigations, whose results could not be available for weeks, will help to clarify a mysterious death that has sent sorrow through the leadership of the Newark Police.
Ms. Arroyo has been an assistant to the police director, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice was widely known in the department.
"She was loyal, hard-working and hard-working," Mr. McCarthy said about Mrs. Arroyo in a telephone interview on Wednesday.
"Look at my Pitbull.
She protected me."
McCarthy said that Mrs. Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer working for the Alcohol Control Commission, and that she left two sons, 14 and 11, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, a spokesperson for the State attorney of Union County, Theodore J. Romankow, said that the investigator would try to determine whether Arroyo died as a result of unauthorized surgical treatment.
"That is one of the possibilities," said Mrs. Walsh.
"It's an ongoing investigation."
The authorities said they arrived at the house about 3 p.m. in November.
And they found Mrs. Arroyo on a sofa.
She was declared dead on site.
More than a week has passed and the authorities have reported little about their investigation or about the owner of the house, which is listed as Flor Margarita Castro.
Walsh didn't want to say if Mrs Castro was questioned by the authorities.
The investigators are trying to determine whether a part of the house has been used as a medical practice.
On Wednesday, no one opened the door to Mrs. Castro's house, where a vibrated rosemary stands in the narrow front garden and a Dalmatian close behind the house.
A blue belt with "Ethyl Vanillin" - used as a substitute for vanilla in foods and perfumes - sat in the parking lot next to a door leading to the underside.
Two mountain bikes depend on hooks on one side.
McCarthy said that when he first arrived in Newark, after spending 25 years with the New York Police Department, Mrs. Arroyo was of invaluable value and helped him find himself in the provincial and hard political culture in his new city.
"She said, 'You have to watch this or that one,' he said.
"She was always here when I got here and she was always here when I went.
It was painful."
Hopes that the central bank will reduce interest will lead to a rise in world shares markets
Yesterday, the shares jumped on both sides of the Atlantic, after market projections that the central bank was trying to settle the credit markets by further interest, with overwhelming comments strengthened by the Vice-President of the U.S. Central Bank.
The stock markets increased in London, New York and throughout Europe after Donald Kahn, the number 2 of Ben Bernanke, the president of the Central Bank, said that politics had to react "flexibly and pragmatically" to the constant pressure on the financial markets.
In a clear effort to calm down sad markets, given the signs of emerging credit tensions, Kohn said that the latest turbulences had "partly reversed some of the improvements in market functions from the late part of September and October".
If the increased turbulence remained, it would increase the possibility of further strengthening the financial conditions for consumers and businesses, he said.
The comments were received by investors as a signal that the central bank is ready to enter and stabilise the credit conditions with new capital prices in the US markets and possible further interest rates.
The performances also helped calm the Wall Street, given other bad news from the US economy, now that the sale of US real estate reached a new record threshold in October.
The consequences of the financial turbulence were underlined by the announcement of Bear Stearns, the Investment Bank, that they would eliminate 650 jobs, or 4 percent of their global workers, in a cost reduction measure to offset serious losses from their lost laws in the US mortgage credit sector.
It is expected that only 20 of these places will disappear in London, where the bank employs 1,500 employees.
In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Index jumped by 331 points, or 2.55 percent, to close at 13.289,40, while the wide-angle S&P 500 index rose by 2.65 percent.
In London, the FTSE 100 index increased by 165,5 points, or 2.7 percent to close at 6,306.2, adding more than 39 billion pounds to the value of British standard values.
Germany's Index Dax increased by 2.6 percent and France's CAC40 increased by 2.3 percent.
In the past, the resumption of credit pressure on the markets was underlined after strong demand for a three-month guarantee of the European Central Bank granted to the European commercial banks was granted a significant 4.7 per cent, the highest rate since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England, the US Central Bank and the European Central Bank to follow and to feed other capital assets into the money markets in London increased as the three-month "Libor" loans to lease between UK banks increased by 6.59 percent to the highest since late September, after a continuous increase since 21 November.
England faced a decision about the statements of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
Here are two dilemmas, each of which is almost as difficult as the other.
Who's supposed to hit as number 6 for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, no less relevant in a broader context than the first test against Sri Lanka, who should make the decision?
The second question is important because David Graveney, the president of the election, at least under this special title, is here to help the Chief Coach Peter Moores and Captain Michael Vaughan decide, and because the table of High Morris, the English business manager, is filled with applications for national election officials, even if not for any part-time.
Anyone who does not always get the sixth battle position will be unhappy, but life is often unfair and sport is without a doubt.
It is never easy to find out exactly what a person can achieve the top of his career, while someone else never rises above the lowest rank, sometimes from lack of luck rather than ability.
It is not only in the cricket where the selection is difficult, where judgements are necessary, which are always subjective at the end.
Is it the right time for Bopara?
Is it fair to Shah when he does?
The same may also be asked in another area, whether, for example, John Edwards or "Tubby" Bannerjee, both intelligent young executives with good conclusions, who know the business well, should be transported.
Who can say what the right class is for a cricket player, unless he is given the opportunity to swim or swim.
Of course, numbers have a great influence on decisions, but they also have opportunities.
Within a team, a cricket player must catch the captain's eye at the right time when he can take a wicket and a fighter must get regular chances in order if he wants to make a day-to-day cricket player impression.
The eyes of the voters are more complicated.
There were many who were better during the last season than, for example, James Anderson, who would appear to play in the first test, even though Stephen Harmison himself declared himself healthy and how the wind boiled into the net.
Anderson took 32 first-class tickets with 33 runs to earn a position in this tour.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 with the same modest average, but both had their highlights and hoped for even more.
Whether Shah or Bopara is playing at the Asgiriya Stadium, there can be only one question of view.
The choice could decide the careers of both men, or it might make little difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in each test and was successful in the first, with five tickets and 40 useful runs, but it was Paul Collingwood, at that time still struggling to strengthen himself, who created the breakthrough to a significant test cricket player and who, although he scored a double hundred against Australia, may still be underestimated.
It is likely that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after further discussion during today's network session at the Asgiriya Stadium, will follow their conservative instincts and abdominal feeling for Shah's greater experience of Bopara's youth enthusiasm.
There are arguments for both.
For Shah, he speaks of his working and valuable 88 test-debüt-innings in Bombay, 43 first-class hundreds and only six of Bopara, who is 22 years younger, and an excellent balance against targeted balls.
But Shah made only ten runs in his two innings in May against West India in the test in Lord, his Heimatherena as a Middlesex player, and this, in addition to his immediate rejection of the voters as Vaughan was healthy in order to take his position for the next game, seems to have taken the swing out of his battle, which was still obvious in Bombay.
On the contrary, all of us from Essex are truly happy with life.
He was not impressed by anything on a cricket site and his attitude was taken away from it when he had recently hit a four-wheel drive vehicle in an exhibition for England's sponsor Volkswagen.
He suffered smaller injuries and probably a shock, but the first thing he did was to pull out his Vodafone (of course also sponsorship) and call his teammate Alastair Cook, who had observed this from a distance, and with enthusiasm to say, "Have you seen this?".
Bopara is a much better field player, he keels his middle tempo with some effect here on the playing fields, which seems to fit him and beats with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right man is one thing to choose the right time for another.
Maybe that's the real art of the selection.
I tend to give Bopara his chance now, which does not mean that Shah may not be well there when, as the tea set suggests from Ceylon, he is the one who's going to play here this weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and to fight Al-Qaida
The first busloads of Iraqi refugees from Syria arrived in Baghdad yesterday, with a stream of displaced persons, their money or visas, and others who hoped that the city would return to normal.
Some even came back to fight the rebels who had driven them out of their homes.
At the bus station Mansour, before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus in an official government convoy of a dozen buses, the terminal was operational with refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned to private transport.
"I decided to go to Syria after killing many doctors in Baghdad," said Sabah Al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
"I came back today because of what I saw on TV and what I read in the newspaper about what happened in Baghdad and how it would be safe now."
They say that the Mahdi army has stopped killing people," he said about the Shiite militias of the militant cleric Moqtada Al-Sadr, who has ordered his forces to reset to the present time.
Qassim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Scottish teacher from the predominantly Sunni part of Amariyah, returned with his two children because he could not renew his Syrian visa and because the Iraqi regime was not allowed to work.
His Shiite neighbors in Amariyah called him to tell him that a local, supported by the United States, had contributed to the Al-Qaida from their base in the west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of the new arrivals from Jordan was the leader of a Sunni and Shiite tribe, who was driven out of his house in Sliekh in northern Baghdad by an attack with hand grenades after he had called on his citizens to fight Al-Qaidas.
He came back to fight.
"Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they started one of the anti-al-Qaida militias in Sleikh and that they needed my support and the boys.
That's why I'm back today," said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many reported that they had been attracted by the increasing peace in the capital since the U.S. increase and the growth of local "group affected citizens" that were armed and, in cooperation with the US military, defending their urban districts.
But more were said to have been forced home by visa problems and money laundering in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis had fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarai, a 51-year-old three-year-old father, expressed the general suspicion among the exiles that Nouri al-Maliki, the Scottish Prime Minister who had asked the Syrian government to impose visa restrictions on refugees in order to force people to return.
More than two-and-a-half million people have probably escaped from the sectarian death squads in the country.
"We went well until al-Maliki visited Syria and the government forced the Iraqis to give no more visa to force them to return to Iraq," said the Sunni pensioner.
"I can't trust a government that supports the criminals who brought down my house after I left."
Part of the reason for the decline in violence is that sunnits were driven from Shiite residential areas and vice versa, leading to the creation of many places where tensions have left.
There are fears that a sudden stream of refugees will re-scatter sectarian tensions and there will be conflicts.
Small Saarland, good education
The smallest federal state is leading and even shines with the international orientation of its universities.
Only in one field of education do the Saarland feel the same deficit as the rest of the country.
"I've told a non-saar country yesterday that we are not French" - this slogan posterifies the smallest federal state selfironically on its 50th birthday.
France and Luxembourg play a major role in the education system of the Saarland, which is located in the education monitor of the German Economic Institute of Cologne (IW).
This is how the universities of tradition cooperate closely with the neighbouring countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
To this day, students can complete their study with a double or even triple pulse.
Accordingly, the proportion of foreign students is 15.6 percent.
But also the country children bring the Saarland in an over-average number to the universities - many of them without an end at the gymnasium.
"In Saarland we use the vocational education system," says Axel Plünnecke, education experts at IW.
More than five young people acquire their study rights at a vocational school, making Saarland more than seven percentage points above the federal average.
The possibilities for combination of vocational and academic training are also significantly expanded.
As measured by the number of people, the equipment with dual studies is the second best in Germany.
Despite the practical training and increasing demand, however, the number of engineering graduates has decreased by one third in recent years.
This is why the Ministry of Education has now committed the universities to a marketing campaign for engineering sciences.
"At the schools in general, we have attacked several reforms after the first Pisa study," says one spokesperson of the Ministry of Education.
The government thus introduced national comparative tests.
In order to teach the children to start earlier, the last Kita year is free of charge - a model that is currently copying other federal countries.
Whether students’ performances are improved in a sustainable manner will only show future comparative studies.
In Pisa 2003, the proportion of students at risk fell from 29% to 20%.
Overall, however, Saarland did not grow as strong as other federal countries.
The Bayers are better off.
And, to the detriment of the Saarland, foreign language skills are not measured at Pisa - in this area, you could point otherwise.
Because the language of the neighbors is mandatory in Gymnasia - even if the Saarland are not French.
Chavez sets the clocks
In Venezuela, the clocks are almost different from the rest of the world.
On 9 December, President Hugo Chávez will be allowed to return the time meters in the South American country for about half an hour.
In Spain, Chávez becomes a joke figure.
According to the Venezuelan Official Journal, a new law will set the clocks at the world time less than four and a half hours.
This gives the South American state a time zone that does not exist in any other country of the world.
The U.S. enemy Chávez justified his decision, inter alia, that the United States of the world should have set up the division in time zones for hours.
In addition, Chávez announced on Wednesday (location time) because of a Geselfare announced the interruption of relations with neighboring Colombia.
The left-wing nationalist said that as long as the conservative Alvaro Uribe is president of Colombia, he will not be involved in relations with the head of state or the Colombian government.
"I can't do this on my own because of my dignity," said Chávez, who advocates a constitutional reform about which citizens of the island must vote in a referendum on Sunday.
With the reform, he would significantly expand his power in the country.
The trigger of the dispute was the decision by Uribes to withdraw the mandate for negotiations with Marxist rebels in Colombia, where it was about the release of hostages.
Uribe had "split in his face" Venezuela had criticised Chávez on Sunday.
Even in Spain, Chavez is all over the mouth.
A new mobile Klingelton ensures in the country for Furore: "Por qué no te callas" (Why don't you hold your mouth) is the sentence that has already downloaded over half a million people from the Internet.
He was addressed by King Juan Carlos of Spain, who was born on the recent Ibero-American summit of the constant call of the left-wing populist, and this was run over the mouth.
German threats 2007 pay minus
Despite the strong economic crisis, German workers are threatened with a real pay loss, according to this year's forecast.
Experts called a whole bunch of reasons for their pessimistic prediction.
According to an estimate of the Hans-Böckler Foundation, the employees in 2007 could actually calculate less on the balance sheet than in the previous year.
"It is the debt of modest wage development, the increase in VAT and the price cuts in food and energy," said Gustav Horn of the Institute for Macroeconomics and Economic Research of the "image" section.
New burdens could also be faced with unemployment insurance for workers.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück said the "New Osnabrücker Zeitung", the planned reduction of unemployment insurance to 3.3 per cent for the current situation is correct and reasonable.
However, the Federal Labour Agency should not again be in a position to ask for loans or grants at the federal level, the SPD politician was quoted.
On Tuesday it was announced that the price explosion in food and mineral oil products has been running the inflation rate at the highest level for 13 years.
Total prices rose by 3.0 per cent in the year.
Venus is the Holly twinning of the Earth
The Venus is more similar than ever thought in spite of its vivid atmosphere: the European space probe "Venus Express" has discovered lightnings in the atmosphere and windmills in Poland, as they occur on the earth in winter.
For almost three decades scientists have suspected that it's glowing on Venus.
Now the European probe "Venus Express" has given evidence - it felt electromagnetic waves on the edge of the atmosphere: The beams on Venus shoot at an altitude of about 56 kilometers from Wolke to Wolke, reports Christopher Russell from the University of California in Los Angeles in the science magazine "Nature".
According to the famous "survey theory", lightnings have created life on earth: winds should have stimulated reactions in the ocean that led to the formation of amino acids, the building blocks of life.
Not so on Venus: "If there was ever life there, it must have been in the very early history," says Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
Today, there may hardly be anything alive on the surface of Venus: The atmosphere is about a hundred times closer than on earth, it reigns with temperatures of 500 degrees.
"The Venus may be the devil's will of the earth, but it is a twin," said Russell.
Why the Venus, which is so much like the Earth in size and mass, has struck such a completely different development, is the basic question of the Esa mission.
The beginning of "Venus Express" in November 2005 was a milestone for Venus research, as since the early 1990s there has been no more probes to explore this planet.
The latest research results, now presented in several "nature" articles, stress not only the uniqueness of Venus within the solar system, according to researchers.
"They also show that the communities of our neighboring planet are larger with the earth than at first accepted," says Esa.
In addition to the already known wind of the North Pole, the researchers also found a cloud beam at the South Pole, which is moving much faster.
The phenomenon recalls air currents on the earthly winter season, writes a research team about Giuseppe Piconi from the Italian Institute of Astrofisica Spaciale e Physicsa Cosmica.
The second thinner planet of the solar system has almost the same mass as the earth and is almost as large with a diameter of 12.100 kilometers.
The planet, also known as the morning or evening stars, crosses the sun in almost 225 days.
But it turns much slower around itself: a Friday lasts 243 days.
Although the Venus with surface temperatures of 460 degrees Celsius and a pressure of 92 bar hardly resembles the Earth, scientists assume that both planets were created under similar conditions.
On both of them, the water that remained on the earth in the oceans was collected, but on the Venus was lost in the space of the world.
And while carbon dioxide is fixed on earth in carbonaceous stones, it makes up most of the atmosphere on Venus.
Cooler defends Merkels Meeting with the Dalai Lama
Federal President Köhler asks for an end to the party's dispute about the reception of the Dalai Lama in the office.
Indirectly, he criticised the SPD for their attacks on the Chancellor after the meeting in September.
President Horst Kohler of the Federal Republic of Germany has taken care of Germany's views and has called on the great coalition to end the struggle to receive the Dalai Lama.
"We should not present a divided nation to the outside world in this matter," Köhler told the trade sheet.
At the same time, the colder understood the reception of the Dalai Lama by Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in September.
"Human rights have universal validity for me, even if I have respect for the diversity of cultures," Köhler said.
Everyone knew that Germany had to maintain sensitive balance in foreign policy, the president of the Federal Republic of Germany stressed, but Merkel took protection before the draft, and she was running a new China policy.
"The Federal Chancellor did not withdraw from the traditional one-China policy.
That's what China also knows," the cook said.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) had voiced unmistakably about the reception of the Dalai Lama and was therefore attacked by a series of Unions.
Steinmeier had, among other things, complained about the Union's "spainary policy" in foreign policy.
Following the reception of the Dalai Lamas in the office, there came to be severe irritations in the German-Chinese relationship.
The Chinese leadership has not only expelled German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück (SPD) but has also frozen the so-called Strategic Dialogue of the Foreign Ministers of the two countries, according to SPIEEGEL.
China's Head of Government Wen Jiabao has now called on Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel to accept the Dalai Lamas as an error.
When European politicians officially received Tibetan religious leaders, Wen Jiabao confirmed the Chinese position.
The actions and words of the Dalai Lamas showed that he was trying to separate Tibet and the other Tibetan region, which also includes other provinces today, from China.
Whiskers warn against claws as in France
Street fights with police, shots, burning cars: Wolfgang Schäuble warns of Krawalen as in France.
All should be done so that social dissatisfaction in Germany does not disappear in violence on the street, the Minister of the Interior called for.
Barricades burned, Randaliers shot at the police with shrotflinten: After the heavy youth caravans in France, Federal Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) in Germany fears a similar development.
"We need to note that social explosions do not occur with us as well as in violence.
We have to take this seriously," he said to the "New Press" appearing in Hanover.
Not every young person is justified by the rapid change in social reality.
Bund, countries and municipalities have already worked with the emphasis on solving problems, said shrugs.
This is not only about the integration of migrants.
"From the Summit of Integration to the Islamic Conference, this is the first success."
However, it is too early to be warned.
At the same time, Schäuble pointed out that there were no urban and sociological problems in German cities, such as France.
In the northern suburbs of Paris, young people had delivered heavy street fights with the police in the last few nights.
Also in Toulouse burned cars and public buildings.
Greater integration efforts by the Federal Government called for the president of the Turkish municipality in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
In view of the Krawale in France, Kolat warned against "disposal effects".
The situation in Germany was not as fragile as in France.
However, there is a need for action.
Kolat pointed out that the unemployment rate for young people with a migration background was "averagely high" under 25 years.
In particular, more training should be provided.
Kolat stressed, "We must give young people a perspective."
But the chairman of the Turkish community added, in Germany more than in France "social control takes place in the families".
In addition, many young people with migration backgrounds did not want to destroy what their parents have built up here.
Kolat said, "But we have to be careful."
Young people should be given the "fast opportunity to participate in work and training".
Meanwhile, at night it remained largely quiet in the Paris Voortor Villiers-le-Bel.
Hundreds of policemen were in use, a helicopter flew over the area with lightning waves.
The competent authorities reported three arrests as well as a few burning mills and cars.
Since the day before, a offer of about 1,000 security forces has been providing for peace.
The police will take over as long as it is necessary, Interior Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie announced after a visit to the capital.
On Tuesday night, about 80 policemen were injured at Krawalen in Villiers-le-Bel.
As a result, the unrest is over toulouse.
The Krawale were involved in a traffic accident when two young people came to life on Sunday.
After the first findings of the Public Prosecutor's Office, the police are not responsible for the death of young people.
In the kingdom of Angela Wolke
The far-reaching appearance of the chancellor shows that the coalition is in the end - and that it is no longer expected of itself.
In which country does this federal chancellor actually live?
After her unconcerned appearance in the general debate of the Federal Day, which was cruel and inconsistency, one must say: not here - not in the country that you should finally be governed by.
The proposal that they focus too much on foreign policy has rejected Angela Merkel with an angry set of arguments.
That was provincial, she said, and she only showed that she didn't want to understand what the critics were doing.
In the Federal Day, she has documented to all the people how much their proposal has been.
There was neither concrete interest nor even a feeling for the problems in the country.
Instead, Angela Wolke presented herself: a retired politician who flees to foreign policy and remains there in the vicinity.
For example, climate protection: There is no guarantee that the decisions of Heiligendamm will be made, but it does not say how to achieve the climate objectives in this country.
At the same time, the self-esteem - so much inflamed - would have lost the CDU chief two years ago.
Now she complains to the crowd that the rise reaches the people.
In order to harm her image as a pragmatician, she solves problems, instead of making the world beautiful.
But in the kingdom of Angela Wolke, internal problems are a marginality.
Children's Poverty and the Concerns of the Lowly Slaves?
She's got a few extras left for it.
It describes how often she promises when it comes to the child’s impact.
Three events need Merkel to produce a half-way sentence.
It rises as on a foreign land when it becomes concrete.
Department of Attacks
In the YouTube debate of the Republican presidential candidates, the two favorites Rudy Giuliani and Middle Romney provide a hard exchange of beats - and now have to fear a foreign candidate.
The tension of the candidates is already on the first topic.
He has made New York a "place of refuge for illegal immigrants", in the midst of Romney he rejects his opponent Rudy Giuliani.
This account, on the other hand, with heavy proposals: "I would say his own house was a port for illegal," denied Giuliani and proposed to the former governor of Massachusetts to have occupied private immigrants without papers.
The candidates blow to the attack: because the Republican base still has no clear preferences, the eight presidential advocates use the debate on CNN in particular to discredit their opponents.
The self-rotated 30-second videos that Internet users sent via YouTube are hardly more than a fingerprint.
"With this kind of isolationism, we have allowed Hitler to come to power," John McCain tells his opponent Ron Paul, who as the only one in the round is calling for an immediate withdrawal from Iraq.
Romney also gets a strong reading from the Vietnamese veterans when he refuses to condemn the so-called "waterboarding", an interrogation method that is simulated in drinking as torture.
However, while the main themes of the campaign are beyond Iraq's war and torture, the reactions of the Hall audience in St. Petersburg in Florida show.
When always conservative values are prized and future tax increases are rejected, the auditorium will burn the case.
Once again, it shows where the weaknesses of the two favorites lie.
"I was bitten at the time," explains Romney, cutting off and offering to the base and television audience a petition that he was still part of the retirement advocates in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, comes into the loop when he is asked to explain the Bible literally.
Musharraf rules for the first time in Civil
One day after his resignation as Chief of Staff, the Pakistani Power of Musharraf was banned as President.
This will end eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
Pakistan's President Pervez Musharraf was banned on Thursday for another five-year term of office.
Pakistan's television broadcast took over the ceremony in the Presidential Palace of the capital of Islamabad live.
Musharraf vowed to respect the Constitution and act for the good of the nation.
On Wednesday, he had handed over his office as Chief of Staff to his trusted Ashfaq Kiyani, and this led to international pressure, especially from the United States.
Eight years after his arrest in an unblooded military coup, the former general now rules for the first time as a civilian head of state.
With his retreat as commander of the forces, Musharraf had met a core requirement of opposition and the West.
Another central requirement is an end to the exceptional state that had hung the Musharraf on 3 November.
Soon after his release, Musharraf, according to General State Advocate-General Malik Muhammad Qayum, will withdraw the exceptional situation and thus meet a further demand from the West.
The Supreme Court of the country, the Musharraf, who had occupied the state of emergency with him in early November, had rejected all objections to the contested re-election of the Head of State on 6 October last week.
Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed and four others injured in the northern northern tribal region of North-Waziristan in an attack on a military convoy.
According to an army spokesman, the bomb exploded on a street near the border to Afghanistan.
The fathers of the Krautrick return
Germany's supergroup of the 7bziger muzzles again: The three band members of Harmonia again introduced their consoles at a concert in Berlin.
For Revival, an average of its great time "Live 1974" appears.
At that time, they were much more famous abroad.
The extended sensation then occurs in the form of three men set on the evening table.
Everyone has their boxes before him, his cables and, above all, his buttons.
Dieter Moebius rots in the flower white shirt with 63 years in the middle.
Left flanked by Michael Rother, 57 years old and owned by Laptop and guitar.
Right, viewed by the auditorium, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, 73, is concentrated on the console.
Everyone contributes to noise, including a beat.
And sometimes it accidentally adds to a traditional piece of music.
This does not seem to disturb the gentlemen themselves.
That the Harmonia band again has provided some excitement among Krautrock lovers.
Here you can discover: Targeted inquiries have revealed that the name has been arduous through collective poppy memory, but not so sustainable in order to lose this band painfully for 32 years.
But why should not the German also celebrate its living legends from the 1970s?
At the same time, what is called misleading Krautrock was more and more true in England and America than in their own country.
When the music economy gave the survivors of the Cologne Group Can 2003 the Echo Prize for Life, it was seen in the room in German pop-views.
When the Red Hot Chili Peppers even thanked Laudatio for the bands La Düsseldorf and New!, the wonder was no limit.
At the concerts, Michael Rother jumped at the Red Hot Chili Peppers on stage like an old friend.
The problem of ignorance at home and the declaration abroad is one.
That is why the memory is already demanded with harmony because the Trio existed only two years ago and in this time there was also a much lower power of effect than they were subsequently assigned by others.
Moebius and Roedelius had previously musicd with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the very promising name cluster.
At first, they played in the cellar under the Berlin Schaubühne.
Then in Düsseldorf, for economic reasons, for a plate label kept by the church.
Rother had recently recovered from a power plant and then played a call as a guitarist at New!, then perhaps the most radical German group.
However, in 1973, Roth followed the cluster musicians into exile to Forst in Weserbergland.
There, in the Old Weserhof, a 16th-century ruins, they lived as city - fledged municipalities.
Less ideologically than in the municipality I, where Roedelius could even cry as a child girl.
Rather in a clever artist's house.
Apparently, there was also a vimmel of the Harmonia Ottenstein singing association and a name for the art.
Some kept harmony from it.
The first album was called "Music of Harmony" and the following "De Luxe".
For so let the music also modest the sound, the band little material need.
The travel collection did not serve only the self-esteem.
The CD "Live 1974" appeared at a concert in Griesem, before a nearly 50-head recording, as someone believes to be.
At that time, the desire to strengthen harmony came from Rother and to practice occasionally.
For Roedelius and Moebius an uncivil claim.
The band declared its separation in 1975.
Rother landed in the Esoteric spherical and secured his existence with albums such as "Flaming Hearts".
Cluster was relived in the eighties and has been more successful since there was harmony everywhere.
The live album is due to Herbert Grönemeyer.
Its record company Greenland has set itself the goal of maintaining the Krautrock as a true German contribution to living music.
New! has already been dug up like Roedelius Solowerk.
The physical resurrection of harmony takes place in the Berlin House of cultures of the world.
Publicly subsidized, within the framework of the Woldtronics Festival.
Julian Cope is the British, Altpunk and author of the handbook "Krautrock Sampler".
There's also Dr. Motte's Loveparade-Erfender.
To what extent would the overall width of the effects of the Krautruck be confined to the following pop music.
In this way, harmony is filled with the vacuum of the supergroup.
The sentence by Brian Eno swims with the unique sounds in the hall: "The only true music you belong to is the future."
There are images showing producers with harmony in the farm.
Legendal education serves projections of further black-white photographs of former cabled devices.
Before that, the three veterans are again concerned with improvisation.
No longer by sticking microphones to the organ and to the drums to unlock unstoppable sounds of the instruments via self-assembled effects devices.
Today electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three to the Technically Advanced Tuffler.
It also doesn't change the choir of the house.
Under the leadership of Barbara Morgenstern, you will be accommodated and played under sound clouds and sing at a beautiful place with the "Aaaaaaaaah!".
Krautrock was always a very English term.
It was never about Rock.
The roots were sought less in the blues than in music schools (Can), technologies (power plant) or on the run before artistic and social conventions (cluster).
Whoever calls here "'68!" is not absolutely wrong, and harmony can't get out of it right now.
Even the most self-evident is thoroughly overthinked on the stage.
Where does music start, and when does it stop?
This can protect one’s nerves or volatile moments of great happiness.
Richard Gere is simply not cynical enough
With "The Hunting Party" and "Killing Peace", two films are again involved in the Balkan war.
But they don't both believe.
Either the concepts put too much on action and footballers or they are too touchy.
Richard Gere can't help in "The Hunting Party" either.
The good news first: Even though war criminals Karadzic and Mladic are still hiding in the Balkan mountains, but calculated there, in the dark background of the Bosnian war, the actor Richard Gere has now been found.
We had lost sight of the most beautiful man of the eightties last year because too many netless roles in well-being films for women and too many press conferences on the subject of Buddhism led to the desire for prominence.
Now Richard Gere is suddenly the most important argument, "The Hunting Party - If the hunter gets caught" (Why do movie titles today have to be as long and expensive as the driver's tariff agreements?) perhaps.
He provides a wonderful eye-winding picture: Basically, his war reporter Simon Hunt is what could have been made out of Gere if the fate and film industry were not as generous: a man who has his best times long behind, but who himself has preserved as a ruinous monument of his downfall even a considerable remnant of the former charm.
But despite this trump, "The Hunting Party" together with the German production "Killer Peace", which also starts this week, only the endless series of broken Balkan war films.
With "Killer Peace" you can make a short process: the film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemmelt), who save a Serb from cosovarian hackers, who are still in love with one of them.
Although it is gratifying that the Serbs are not represented here once as the sole root of all the evils, the flat film loses itself too quickly in footballer and action.
There remains a kind of "Alarm for Cobra 11" without a highway but with war for it.
On the other hand, "The Hunting Party" can be found to be exemplary, why there has never been a really good Balkan war film.
The story of three U.S. war reporters, who appear to detect the Serbian super-war criminals "the Fuchs", could have become a new "Apocalypse Now" at another time with another director and another book author (both in Personal Union Richard Shepard).
Because the stories are similar: Both times small teams go into the woods to accomplish something that the military cannot and both times it will be a journey into madness.
One of the reasons for the defeat of "The Hunting Party" is that Simon Hunt is not simply letting his heart be the downside cynic when he is introduced to us at the beginning.
No, the script must also have a romantic affair with a later murdered Muslim Bosnian.
Finally, "The Hunting Party" goes down to the Bach, when the reporters in the five-minute time-off process have succeeded in what Nato, CIA and all the world's leaders have not done in five years: catch the war criminals and leave the Muslim Bosnians to the right racket.
This is so bad that you want to call the International Court of Justice in The Hague for crimes against kinology.
The film has a very human concern.
He wants to insist that Karadzic and Mladic continue to run freely, and he suspects that Americans and French people (this should be exceptionally agreed) do not pursue the persecution too intensive due to secret political agreements.
But the good community and the evil are sometimes so similar that a famous Brecht poem comes to mind.
It says about the wooden mask of an Asian demon on the desk of the poet: "I am so sorry to see the wounded rulers, in which I mean, how hard it is to be evil."
Films such as "The Hunting Party" have exactly the same hairheads, but they explained how hard it is to be good.
The problem is not limited to the kind of Balkan war film.
Recently it was reported in this newspaper that all Iraqi films were big fleets.
You can add: There has never been a good South Africa film.
Almost always applies: If a star moves out on the world's crisis heroes or mine fields, something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arquette comes out, "on the other side" with Angelina Jolie or "blood diamonds" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
Perhaps all the conflicts are time-consuming.
Still, it had to go decades before Hollywood could turn a good movie over the Holocaust with "Schinder's List".
Some films will probably still mature - the Vietnam works now known as classics "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jacket" have not been celebrated in any way as masterpieces.
But maybe today we know where every mass murder in real time comes home on the same two screens, even too much about the world's conflicts.
And that robs the writers of the book the carelessness it needs to tell good stories.
"His or nothing" or "The Great Dictator" have finally become so good because Lubitsch and Chaplin did not yet know how bad the Nazi regime really ruled.
Maybe you don't want to be good when you want to make good movies.
You may need to have the sarcasticly distant artistic view of Romancier Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about parallels between his historical novel "Lemprières Dictionary" and the Balkan War, he replied: "It is only because some things never change.
Cities will always be terriblely dangerous, people will always be brutally murdered and war will always prevail in Yugoslavia."
Critics from Beust for Olympia Absage
The resignation of the mayor from the Hamburg application for Olympic Summer Games has been severely criticized in politics and the economy.
Many want to continue fighting for the games in the water.
But from Beust, realism encourages the assessment of the chances.
The chief businessman of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, Hans-Jörg Schmidt-Trenz, referred to on Wednesday as "not good for the economic location".
No other project has recently developed as large motivation forces in the city as the Olympiade.
"Without this objective, sport policy could not be maintained to the same extent."
Schmidt-Trenz called on the Senate not to condemn the project, but to find a new long-term approach to "exempting from a changed time beam".
On Wednesday, mayor Ole von Beust remained in previous statements, which at least made the Olympic ambitions of Hamburg unrealistic until 2028.
"Not Hamburg decides on an Olympic application, but the German Olympic Sports Bond," said Beust WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the decision of the sports club expected for early December on a Munich application for the Winter Games 2018.
"This preference means for us that we will not have any realistic chances in the period we have considered until 2028."
However, the dream was not out of time, said of Beust.
The Hamburger Sportbund (HSB) regretted the statements of Beusts.
As a result, the impression is that Hamburg will no longer apply for Olympic games in the next 25 years.
"It is too early to build up a chance by relieving the plans at this time," said HSB President Günter Ploß on Wednesday.
A refusal to apply was also in opposition to the statement by the Senate on the occasion of a reception for the full assembly of the German High School Sports Association.
There by Beust the Hamburg application for the 2015 university "not as a substitute" for Olympic games in Hamburg.
The High School Sports Association had only nominated Hamburg last week as a candidate city.
The SPD-Citizenship Group suggested that the Senate should not have used valuable time for the construction of the apartment in Hamburg.
"The development of the small grassbrook has been delayed by the Senate for years because it has placed on the map of Olympia and expanded the building of the apartment," said SPD Deputy Carola Veit and Jan Quast.
While the SPD for the Small Grassbrook has always required an integrated planning for Olympia and later residential use, the CDU has unilaterally put on the "event factor".
The application for the 2012 Olympic Summer Games in Hamburg had sparked a great enthusiasm.
However, Hamburg was defeated in Leipzig.
It's not Warhol's box.
Anyone who connects the terms Sweden and the wooden box is thinking about Ikea, but not Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
Currently in Sweden, made wooden boxes cast dark shadows on Warhol's workshop.
Most of the four-nine Brillo boxes listed there from the "Type Stockholm" are fakes.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expresse" some months ago doubts about the authenticity of Andy Warhol's Brillo-Boxen of 1968, internal research at the Modern Museum in Stockholm now comes to a devastating result: The six "Brillo-Boxes", which the former museum director Pontus Hultén of the Modern Museum in 1995 has made as a donation, are copies - and probably also the majority of the hundreds of other Brillo boxes of the "Type Stockholm", which are in circulation on the international art market.
The history is obscured, a confusing slaughter of artistic and curatorial productions.
In 1964 Warhol created his first "Brillo-Boxes" in New York, painted wooden boxes based on the red-blue-white design of the cardboard boxes of the soap powder "Brillo".
A exhibition of his works at the Modern Museum in 1968 - with Warhol's agreement - hundreds of Brillo boxes from pappa: these came (for cost reasons) not from Warhol, but were delivered directly from the Brillo Cartonagen factory.
It was not about works of art, it was about their models, about just exhibits.
At the same time, Warhol may have granted in 1968 the permission to produce some Brillo wooden boxes in Sweden, but they were not exhibited in the Modern Museum.
Journalists now speak of about fifteen boxes that were then entered into the art and auction history as authorized original Andy-Warhol-Brillo-Boxes with the name "Type Stockholm".
Some of them have achieved more than $100,000 on auctions.
The problem is now that the legendary museum director Pontus Hultén later falsely claimed that it was produced and exhibited in Sweden about a hundred wooden boxes in 1968, which Warhol left him.
In fact, Hutíns 105 boxes were produced in Malmö in 1990 for an exhibition in St. Petersburg.
Warhol has been dead at that time for three years.
Lars Byström, chief conservator at the Modern Museum, has also examined three of the six museum-side Brillo boxes made of Swedish private property, two of which were manufactured in Stockholm in 1968: their press bands were first founded and muffled, then white oil paint was filmed with a brush.
On the other hand, the structure of the 1990 copies betrays that the color with a painting role was applied directly to the press panel without foundation - it is also not about oil, but about acrylic.
"These boxes were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of Andy Warhols Brillo-Boxes," says the director of the Modern Museum, Lars Nittve, "if the 'Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board' in New York does not come to another conclusion, the Modern Museum will classify the six boxes in its collection as copies/exhibition material."
Already in July, the Authentication Board has declared free to follow the "serious charges" that will be raised in the case of soap powder kits.
But since then, you've been hiding in an unobtrusive silence.
Rebellious Soldiers in Manila
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers who had stayed in a hotel in Manila demanded the shock of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
He could not answer any bloodshed, said the leader Antonio Trillanes, who proposed corruption and election fraud, reporters at the hotel.
Government-owned soldiers had previously stormed the hotel under train gas.
The approximately two dozen soldiers had been in the building for hours.
Around half of them stood before the court on Thursday because of a failed coup attempt in 2003 - among them Trillanes.
He used the negotiation to replace himself with about 30 sympathies.
The military police officers who were actually supposed to guard him were obviously running over to him and joined his maternity.
They entered the Pennsylvania hotel and demanded the shock of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Loyal government troops closed the district around the front hotel.
The President called for an urgent meeting of the Security Cabinet.
The National Security Adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the actions of the soldiers.
"People have enough," said Trillanes.
"We call on people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, who previously commissioned the elite unit of the Scout Rangers, said other military units wanted to join the march shortly.
Government critics have called for large demonstrations against the President on Friday.
Their government has been overestimated for months of corruption.
Manila's financial district was already 2003 the main scene of the attempted maternity of about 200 military members against Arroyo.
The rebellion escaped after almost 24 hours of refusing to join the army.
Since 1986 there have been at least seven attempts against democratically elected governments in the Philippines.
United Internet becomes a major shareholder in Versatel
The United Internet has secured a share of more than 20 percent of Versatel's telecommunications company.
The average price per share is 14.46 euros, as the company reported on Wednesday night.
You're now holding 20.05 percent of the base capital.
Over a take had previously been speculated.
You keep the option open to increase the share of Versatel.
With the move, you want to advance the consolidation of the German DSL market, United Internet shared with you.
Earlier on Wednesday, the Bank had already taken action on a step-by-step after it increased its participation in the Düsseldorf network operator by another 5 per cent to 15.1 per cent.
The money house held the shares only for a third party, called it in the financial market.
On the day before, United Internet had already participated with almost 10 percent of its mobile phone company Drillisch.
As part of a capital increase, Drillisch has placed 17.4 million new shares in the value of EUR 106.4 million.
5.15 million shares of these have purchased the United Internet for 31.4 million euros.
In addition, companies have held discussions on marketing cooperations for DSL and mobile radio products.
"We strengthen our partnership," explained a United Internet speaker.
The two companies have established the Community company MSP to take over the freenet.
First, the two companies want to satisfy themselves with a share of good ten percent to Freenet and do not use their right to take up another 18.49 percent to Freenet, the United Internet informed on Thursday.
However, the two companies kept all options open, in particular to further increase their participation in Freenet AG, it was said.
Discussions between the United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership were concluded in mid-November.
The ongoing and still hard-looking poker around Freenet has been part of the consolidation of the German telecom market for months.
At the end of the third quarter, Freenet had 2.9 million mobile phone clients and 1.27 million DSL and complete-closure customers.
The holding of United Internet and Drillisch has so far held 6.01 percent of the Freenet shares.
Now it has been agreed that Drillisch will bring about four percent more.
The right to purchase the 18.49 percent of the investment company Vatas was already agreed in August.
