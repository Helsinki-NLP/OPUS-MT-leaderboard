Members of the Wells Assembly do not want to “come to the maps”
Among some members of the National Assembly, there is a dissatisfaction with the proposal to adopt an MWP abbreviation.
The problematic solution is to change the name of the Assembly to the Parliament of Wales.
Members of the Assembly from different political parties are concerned about possible jokes with this abbreviation.
One of the lobbyists, expressing his party's opinion, expressed concern that the new abbreviation “refuses Twp and Pwp”.
For our readers, it's not from Wells: in Valiant Twp it means "top", and pwp is "cake".
According to a member of the Assembly of the Wells Party, his organization had generally “remained inadequate” and offered other options.
Conservative party representatives “do not object” to the new abbreviation, but note that MWP is close to the letter Muppet (map).
In this context, the w letter in the Welsh language is approximately u in the Irish dialect of the English language.
The Committee of the Assembly, currently developing a draft law on the change of name, made the following statement: “The final decision on what members of the Assembly will be called will, of course, remain”.
The Wales National Assembly of 2017 has been authorized to change its name.
In June, the Committee published the results of a public opinion survey on the proposed options under which the Parliament of Wales had found broad support for the local population instead of the Assembly.
With regard to the appointment of members of the Assembly, the Committee preferred the option “Members of Parliament of Wales” (Welsh Parliament Members, or WMP), while the option of MWP received the highest public support.
As a matter of fact, the members of the Assembly proposed other options, but the Chairwoman, Elina Jones, would find it difficult to find a solution that would be consistent, and I would remind you that the draft amendment law should be submitted within a few weeks.
Reform laws will also include other modifications to the working process of the Assembly, including new rules on the disqualification of members of the Assembly and the system of the Committee.
Members of the Assembly voted in favour of the final version of their name during the legislative debates.
Macedonians voted in a referendum to change their country name
On Sunday, the Macedonians voted to be renamed the country in the Republic of North Macedonia.
The national vote is intended to resolve a multi-year dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province of Macedonia.
The Greek Government has long insisted that the name “Republic of Macedonia” implies territorial claims to the Greek province, and has repeatedly opposed the entry of its northern neighbours into the Euro Union and NATO.
The President of Macedonia, George Ivanov, the opponent of the referendum on the change of name, said that he was not going to recognize his results.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, note that the change in the name of the country is the total price of entry into the EU and NATO.
Crisis in Garlem's Income: Always Shut Down St. Martin's Coloque
“The elders of the area I spoke to said that before each corner, there was a bar and a church,” says Adams.
“And now there is nothing else.”
The disappearance of bars can still be understood as follows:
“The format of communication has changed.”
“Bar stopped being a kind of guest in the whole area where they came regularly.”
But with regard to the churches, there is concern that the funds received from the sale of assets will not last long, as their leaders would have hoped.
At the place of the church, he added, there would be a multi-dwelling house whose tenants would hardly support those in the area of income.
“Most of the buyers of these apartments will be white,” says Adams. “And this will be about the day when such churches are finally closed, because new neighbors will never become their own.”
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black territory: the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martin’s church 10 years later.
The first membership of the Methodist Church left the income in the 30th century.
Their building was purchased by the black income of the neighborhood.
When St. Martin's church went into the hands of a black community, her leader was John Howard Johnson, who organized a shop boycott on 125th Street, Harlem's main trade artery, where they refused to work or to be promoted in the service of the blacks.
In 1939, as a result of the fire, the building suffered considerable damage, and in the restoration work, Johnson’s father was ordered to install a carilon.
The famous David Johnson, the son of Johnson’s father, who changed him into the head of St. Martin’s church, proudly called the Carolon “cools for the poor”.
But the expert who tried the Carolon in July called it “cultural heritage” and “a unique historical tool”.
An expert at the University of Michigan Tiffany Ng also noted that this was the first carilon in St. Martin's church to be the world's first instrument of his kind, played by a black musician, Dionysio A. Lind. 18 years ago, he was invited to play the largest carilon in the Riverside Church.
According to Merrieuezer, St. Martin's church has not yet been replaced.
In the last few months around St. Martin’s Church, there has been a difficult situation with architects and contractors, some of whom were invited by world leaders, and others by the Episcopal Church.
The congregation is owned by the governing body of the income of the world leaders, and in July the parish was concerned that the parish “is trying to transfer the value of work” to the congregation was owned, although the latter were not involved in the election of architects and contractors to the parish.
Some appearances have expressed dissatisfaction with the lack of transparency on the part of the parish.
In California, the shark injured a 13-year-old lumberjack.
According to official sources, on Saturday, the first day of the hunting season in Lobster, a 13-year-old stork in California was attacked by the shark and injured by the body.
The attack took place about 7 a.m. near Bikon Beach Beach Beach in Ensinitas.
As Chad Hammel told in an interview with the KSWB-TV (San Diego) on Saturday morning, he was dancing with his friends, and about half an hour later, he heard the boy screams for help, and together with his friends, they sailed on the boat to the attack site and drove out of the water.
According to Hammela, he first decided that the boy was very excited about the role of a lobbyist, but quickly “he felt that he was shouting, ‘ I was being bitten!
They have tempted me!"
As Hammel went down to the nest, he noticed that “he had completely torn the skin around the key”.
“I called for everyone to get out of the water,” says Hammel.
The boy was transported by helicopter to the Children's Hospital Radi (San Diego); his condition was considered critical.
The kind of shark that's been hit by a teenager is unknown.
The rescuer Captain Larry Giles, during a press briefing, reported that a few weeks ago, a shark was spotted in this place, but it was not considered dangerous.
Giles also added that the victim of the attack had suffered injuries in the area of the upper deck.
The authorities have crossed the area from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Sámi Beach in Ensinitas for 48 hours to investigate and ensure the safety of the population.
Giles noted that there are 135 species of sharks in this area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Seinsbury plans to subjugate the British perfume-cosmic market
Seinsbury is planning to establish cosmetic and perfumery units in Buts, Superdrag and Debenhams stores with cosmetic consultants, in the models of luxury universities.
The United Kingdom's perfumed and cosmetic market is estimated to be 2.8 billion pounds of sterling and continues to expand, as fashion and household goods fall, and the significant share of this desired market as an experiment in 11 stores throughout the country will be presented to space offices of cosmetics and perfumery and should be expected to succeed in many other shops in the coming year.
Supermarket owners are looking for more than filling up the former TV bands, microwave ovens, household goods, and investment in the perfume-cosmetic market is a good solution.
According to the representatives of Seinsbury, it is planned to increase the dual range of cosmetic products to 3,000 names, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing L'Oreal, Maybellline and Burt's Bees range will be presented to a larger extent, in special locations, of the kind of organization of goods in Buts stores.
In addition, the company ' s Butik-Cosmetics product line will be reorganized to meet the demands of young buyers.
The two Seinesberi shops will be presented by the perfumery producer Fragrance Shop: the first one has already been opened in Croedon in southern London last week, and the second one is expected to be opened in Sally Oak, Birmingham this year.
Internet commerce and the tendency to buy a small amount of products every day in small shops near home have led to the need to attract buyers in other ways.
Mike Cup, President Seinsbury, says that the tickets are gradually turned into a university, and his supermarket network is fighting for buyers in a competitive fight against cheap shops, such as Aldi and Lidl, offering more services and non-food.
Hundreds of Seinesberi supermarkets are located in Argos, and some of them are now available at Habitats since the network acquired two brands two years ago, and this has resulted in the increase in the sales of food and supplies from these purchases.
The previous attempts by the supermarket to give a new life to their cosmetics and optics have not been successful.
In the early 2000s, a joint venture between Seinesbury and Booths was organized, but there were further differences between the parties on the section of the proceeds from the sale of pharmaceuticals in supermarkets.
A new strategy was developed after the sale of the pharmaceutical business of Seinesbury (all 281 stores) by Selesio, owner of the Lloyds Farmasi network, for 125 million pounds of sterling three years ago.
Lloyds is expected to support the implementation of the plan by adding a broad line of luxury care for La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four shops.
Paul Mills-Hex, commercial director of Seinesbury, says: “We have completely transformed the appearance and atmosphere of our perfume and cosmetics departments to create a more favourable environment for our customers.
We have also invited specialized consultants who will always be prepared to assist the Council.
Our brand range for any taste, pleasant design and comfortable location of the shops will attract many visitors to the search for cosmetics and perfumery, and this will be a completely new concept of shopping".
Peter Jones 's anger' responded to Holly Willowby's out of a deal of 11 million pounds sterling.
The star show "Logovo Dracona" Peter Jones "distorted" by a TV show by Holly Willowby from a deal of 11 million pounds of sterling that she intended to conclude with Peter's Lifestyle brand, but instead preferred new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willowby doesn't have time for their joint brand of household clothes and Truly accessories.
This couple's business was compared to the Goop actresses of Guineat Peltrow.
The 37-year-old Etim morning programme announced its decision in Instagram.
Holly Willowby's decision to leave their winning Lifestyle brand to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV, led to Peter Jones' rage, the star of the Dragon Lodge.
As our sources say, Jones was “disturbed” when a TV fan at a tense meeting held on Tuesday in the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Bakingemshire, admitted that after the conclusion of new contracts it would not have had enough time for their common brand of household clothes and accessories Truly.
They were compared to a young actress named Guinette Peltrow by Goop, and her sales were expected to double the condition of Willowby, estimated at 11 million pounds of sterling.
The 37-year-old leader announced his departure to Instagram, and Jones himself left Britain on a private plane in the direction of one of his villas.
According to one source, “Truly’s brand was Holly’s top priority.
It was a long-term investment that would provide it with a jobless existence for the next few decades.
Its decision led to all parties to the transaction.
They were all shocked by what happened on Tuesday, because weeks remained before the start of the brand.
In Marlow's headquarters, the whole warehouse was filled with goods ready for sale.”
Experts believe that this morning, one of the most popular stars in Britain, can be the company in millions of pounds of sterling because of significant investments in goods: from pillows and candles to clothes, as well as the potential delay in starting the line.
It is also about breaking up old friendships.
The three Willowby children and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been friends with Jones and his wife, Taray Kapp, for 10 years.
Willowby created a True brand together with Tara Kapp in 2016, and Tari's husband, 52-year-old Peter Jones, led the company in March.
Both couples are often on vacation together, and in addition, Jones owns 40% of Dan Baldwin's television company's shares.
Willowby will become an M&S brand and replace Anthony McCartlin as the leading ITV "I'm famous".
A source from the nearby Johns district said yesterday evening: "We cannot comment on his business".
Complex negotiations, "and then we kissed each other"
He was ashamed of the criticism of the media because of the “invalid president” comment and positive assessment of the North Korean leader.
Why did President Tramp give up so many claims?
Tramp said, echoing the voice of the leading news.
"There's nothing I haven't given up on."
He noted that Kim Chen Ein was interested in the re-meeting, after Tramp called them the first summit held in Singapore in June, a significant step towards reducing nuclear weapons in North Korea.
But the negotiations on denuclearization have come to an end.
Three months after the June summit in Singapore, the high-ranking North Korean diplomat Li Yon Ho made a statement to the world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea is still awaiting “responsibility” from the United States following the original disarmament policy.
Instead, the U.S. said that the diplomat continued to use sanctions as a pressure stream.
During the meeting of its supporters, President Tramp made a much more optimistic assessment.
He said, "The North Korean case is a great deal."
“We were on the brink of a war with North Korea.
Millions of people could have been killed.
And now we have a good relationship."
According to Trampa, his efforts to establish relations with Kim Chen Yin bore fruit: missile tests were put to an end, hostages were released and US soldiers who remained in the territory of the DPRK also returned to their homeland.
Speaking of his relationship with Kim Chen Yin, Tramp stressed that his unusual approach to diplomacy had nothing to do with it.
"Being a nice president is so easy, but instead of 10,000 people on the street who are falling into this completely destroyed hall, there would be only 200 people here," Tramp said, pointing to the crowd gathered before him.
Dogs and earthquakes in Indonesia: disaster destruction recorded, hundreds of victims estimated
On the first day of the earthquake in Lombok, foreign NGOs were told that there was no need for their assistance.
Although more than 10 per cent of the population of Lomboka had been left behind, the Government did not consider it necessary to declare the national natural disaster, which was a prerequisite for international assistance.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they made it clear that there was no need for international support, so it was not easy,” explains Selina Sambung.
The Children's Rescue is preparing a mission to Pala, but we still do not know if a foreign group can work on the ground.
According to Mr. Soutopo, an official representative of the National Disaster Management Office, the leadership of Indonesia conducted an assessment of the situation in Pala to determine whether international organizations should be involved.
In view of the continuing seismic instability in Indonesia, the country continues to be horrendous in preparing for natural disasters.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Acheha, they can rarely be found on other coastlines.
Despite the warning of the threat of tsunamis, there was no siren in Palao to warn the population, which probably led to so many victims.
Transport between many Indonesian islands is quite problematic even in good weather.
Achieving disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A floating hospital in Lomboca to assist victims of earthquakes is sent to Pala, but the road to a new disaster will take at least three days.
President Joco Vidodo has strengthened Indonesia's veto infrastructure as the main item of his election campaign and spent countless resources to improve roads and railways.
However, the administration of President Joco, which was taking a new turn next year, was in trouble with funding.
The President also criticised the increased interfaith enmity between the conservative Muslim majority of Indonesia and the rest of the population.
More than a thousand people were killed, and tens of thousands were killed as a result of clashes between Christians and Muslims, armed swords, bows with arrows and other suicides.

The memory of Cromwell in front of Parliament's building sparked a heated debate on “historic rewriting”
“Refuse” Plus would be the reward for the barbaric destruction of many cultural and religious artifacts of England by its followers, Puritan fanatics.
However, the memory society called Mr. Kryk a “summary” and “an attempt to rewrite history”.
John Goldsmith, President of the Conservatory, said: “As part of the ongoing debates on historical monuments, the issue of the statue of Oliver Cromwell in front of the Westminster Palace is inevitable.
In addition, there is no connection between the economic movement during the English civil war.
It's possible that Oliver Cromwell is suffering for the sins of his ancestors, Thomas, who lived centuries ago.
The magnificent statue Besides the authority of Sir William Hamo Tornichroft reflects the views of his contemporaries in the 19th century and the historical achievements of man, which many still consider worthy of respect.
In an interview with The Sunday Telegraph John Goldsmitt, he said: “Many people, especially at the end of the 19th century, considered Cromwell as a defender of Parliament from outside pressure, in his case the monarchy.
Whether such an opinion can be considered historically accurate remains the subject of expert debates.
But we can be certain that the conflict that arose in the middle of the 17th century had an impact on our country's further development, and Cromwell was a significant historical person representing one side of this section.
Its achievements as a Lord Protector are also highly valued and respected.”
The Chinese farmer killed the killer pig
In one of the markets in South-West China, the farmer has become a victim of pigs, local media are reported.
The body of the victim (only his name is mentioned in the media, Juan) with a broken artery, was found near the hill on the market in the province of Lupanishu Province of Guiju in southern China, reports Morning Post on Sunday.
The pork industry is preparing to introduce pigs to the pig farm, 30 May 2005, China’s Chinese province of Cinhai.
Yuan and his twin brother arrived from the neighboring province of Yunan on Wednesday and brought 15 pigs for sale.
On the next morning, the twin brother discovered the lifeless body of Joanna, and the door of the nearby pigs was opened.
There was a huge drop of blood on the river in the pigs.
During the trial, it was found that the pig weighed 250 kilograms of the farmer's risk of dying.
“My brother’s feet were torn and crushed,” said the newspaper Guiyang Evening News Wu, a relative of the murdered.
The surveillance video showed that John came to the market at 4:40 a.m. to feed his animals.
The body was found about an hour later.
The pig-killer didn't belong to the brothers.
The market manager told the Evening News newspaper that the pig was isolated at a separate launch during the investigation, in order to avoid repeated attacks.
The Yuan family is reported to be negotiating with the market administration for compensation for the death of the farmer.
Cases of swine attacks on humans occur uncommonly.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in the American state of Massachusetts, seriously injured a man.
Ten years ago, a 300-kilogram animal drove a Valianian cruiser to the tractor and let her go, just in fear of a successful woman.
In 2012, it was recorded when a farmer in Oregon, U.S.A., was eaten by his own pigs. As told by a Canadian farmer CBC News channel, pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act on their hidden aggression as a “lower mechanism”.
"The pigs of the game,
They're busy and curious, but they don't want to hurt you.
You should simply convey your animal's feelings of action and respect," he explained.
Hurricane Rosa brings rivers to a large part of the South-West United States
It is estimated that Hurricane Rosa is losing its power by moving through a cooler water zone to the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the next few days, it will bring rivers and floods to the territory of North and South-West Mexico.
As a Saturday morning, 5 a.m. in New York, the cyclone reached the 1st category of wind up to 135 km/h, 360 km south-west from Punta-Euhania, Mexico.
It is expected that on the resurrection, Hurricane will move north.
At the same time, over the Pacific, a low-pressure zone will begin to be formed, which will move east to the west coast of the United States. As it approaches the coast of the state of Lower California, the storm will bring tropical moisture to the north of Mexico, to the South-West US territory.
On Monday, more than 25 cm of precipitation is expected in Mexico.
Strong rivers are expected in the coming days of the South West under the influence of tropical humidity in the emerging low-pressure zone.
Wastes from 2.5 to 10 cm will cause dangerous floodwaters, trashy streams and possible wastes in the desert.
In some areas, especially in the southern states of Nevada and Arizona, because of high tropical humidity, the precipitation rate can be 5 to 8 cm per hour.
In certain areas of the South-West United States, mainly in the area of Arizona, up to 5-10 cm of rainfall is expected.
The risk of sudden rapid-development floods is not excluded due to the uneven distribution of tropical rains.
In the current risk of the tropical river, pedestrians in the desert are seriously affected.
The lions can turn the canyons into stormy rivers, and the thunder can cause the winds to collapse and the dust to rise.
The low - pressure zone on the southern coast of California will collapse.
It is possible to drop up to 1.5 cm of precipitation, which can cause small congested streams and create rolling surfaces on the roads.
This is the first rainfall in the region since the beginning of the rainy season.
There will be tropical rains in Arizona on Sunday evenings and Sundays in other territories until Monday evening and Tuesday morning.
On Tuesday, the river will take place in the area of Four Angles and continue until the middle of the night.
In October throughout the United States, there will be a sharp drop in temperature due to the low air temperature in the Arctic at sufficiently high temperatures in the tropics.
Sometimes such a combination leads to a strong drop in temperature in a small territory.
Such severe temperatures will be especially observed in the central United States on Sunday.
Between the temperature in Kansas City (Missuri City) and Omaha (Nebraska City), and between St. Louis and De-Moons (Iova City), there is a difference of almost 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, the summer heat will rise and spread to other territories.
Most of the central and eastern US territories are expected to be warm in early October, and the temperature will reach 27 degrees from the South to the North-East.
In New York on Tuesday, air temperature may rise to 27 degrees, 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast promises an unusually high temperature on the East Coast by mid-October.
Senate hearings on the case of Judge Brett Cavano have seen more than 20 million viewers
Brett Kawano and Cristina Blja Ford, who accused Kawano of attempted rape in the 1980s, drew more than 20 million viewers from six television channels on Thursday.
The political opposition to the candidacy of Kawano has received an unexpected continuation. On Friday, an urgent message was received in the media: Republican Jeff Flake made a requirement that the charges against the lawyer be investigated by the FBI within one week.
As Ford stated in the hearings before the Senate Legal Committee, she was convinced by the 100 per cent that Kawano had attacked her in a state of harassment and had tried to disband her at a school party.
Cavano gave emotional testimony, claiming that 100 per cent was convinced that it was not.
According to the Nielsen Research Agency, the Friday debates saw more than 20.4 million viewers.
The Agency took into account average statistics from CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC channels.
Data on the number of other channels, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, are not yet available.
Moreover, Nielsen's rating does not always take into account viewers watching television at work.
For comparison: it's a middle audience following an American football match at the playoff or Oscar's ceremony.
The largest audience was at Fox News Channel, whose leadership was in a hot position to support the appointment of Kawano: Senate hearings, all day long, saw an average of 5.69 million viewers, reported by Nielsen.
Second, ABC of 3.26 million viewers.
The CBS audience was 3.1 million, NBC - 2.94 million, MSNBC looked at 2.89 million viewers, while CNN had 2.52 million views, Nielsen reported.
After listening to the case, I don't feel weak.
The current drama with Jeff Flake was played on Friday.
After the Senator of Arizona, considered a moderate Republican, reported his intention to support the candidacy of Cavano, CNN and CBS, he was able to print the camera on Friday morning on the way to a meeting of the Legal Committee.
The whole world has seen, as he has lost his eye, a blow from the angry women in the direct air on CNN.
"I stand in front of you," said one of them.
"Do you think he is telling the truth?"
"The strength behind you, while so many women are powerless," they tried to explain their position to the woman.
Fleck replied to the activists that his office had already prepared a statement and would address the subject at the Committee meeting.
When a few hours later, the Legal Committee was prepared to approve the candidacy of Kawano as a judge and send it to the Senate for a general vote, all channels broadcast the meeting in direct air.
However, Flick made one condition — to investigate the FBI's allegations against the candidate by the next week, as the democratic minority had done.
Flick claims that he has changed his opinion through the intervention of another, Senator of the Democrats of Chris Kuns.
He made a final decision, talking to Kuns and several other senators.
The Fleka decision was effective, as it was clear that the Republicans did not have enough votes to approve the Kawano without an investigation.
The decree of President Trampa F.B.R. opened an investigation into the allegations against Kawano.
British Prime Minister Teresa May accuses her critics of "political games" about the situation with Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Teresa May accused politicians who criticised her plan to leave the EU, that they put extra party interests above the interests of society.
The Prime Minister of Great Britain attends a conservative party conference in Birmingham on 29 September 2018.
In another interview, published on one panel with May, the former head of MIDI Boris Johnson criticized her so-called Shaski plan in Brexit, stating that the introduction of customs duties between the United Kingdom and the EU is “indisputable”.
Death of Wade Sims in shooting: Police arrested Daiton Simpson on suspicion of the murder of Forvar University of Louisiana State
The police arrested a man suspected of murder as a result of a shot by Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at Louisiana State University.
According to the Baton-Ruja police, 20-year-old Dayton Simpson was arrested and detained for murdering a second degree.
The police posted a video of the drama with Sims and Simpson, in which Sims lost his eyes.
According to WAFB, the CBS regional channel, the police found Simpson DNA at the scene of the crime.
During Simpson's interrogation, he admitted that Wade was fatally injured.
According to the Lawyer's report, Simpson has a deposit of $3500,000.
The coroner of the eastern district of Baton-Ruz published a preliminary conclusion on Friday: death was caused by a cross-combined gunshot wound to the neck and head.
The Division is grateful for the criminal investigation of the state police department Louisiana, the State Police Criminalist Laboratory, the South University Police and the local people who have assisted in the conduct of the operational and risk-taking activities that have led to detention.
Joe Alleva, director of sports at the University of Louisiana, thanked the law enforcement forces for their “good work on behalf of the criminal”.
Simsu was only 20 years old.
The two-metre foreward was the native of Baton-Ruz; his father, Wayne, also played in Louisiana State University.
In the past season, Sims picked 5.6 points and made 2.6 choices on average for a match.
Will Wade's team coach made a statement on Friday morning, saying that Wade Sims' tragic death caused a shock and a “present woe” to all players.
"That's what I've always been afraid of," the coach added.
Vulcan covered the ashes of Mexico
The Volcano Popocatepetl has fallen to the south of the Mexican capital.
On Saturday, Mexico's National Centre for Natural Disaster Prevention recommended that the population not be approached by the volcano: its crater had registered activity and 183 paragas emissions were produced in the afternoon.
At the Centre’s sight, the bush was often scattered near the volcano, and there was a fertilization.
In some areas of Mexico, such as Sochimilko, social media users published photographs of lobby glass cars covered with thin layers of ashes.
After an earthquake of 7.1 MW, which struck the central part of Mexico in September 2017, geophysics recorded the volcanic activity in 72 km south-east of the capital.
Volcano Popocatepetl (or, for its part, Don Goyo) has been a active volcano since 1994.
Posts of the Catalan separatist police in advance of the first anniversary of the independence referendum
On Saturday in Barcelona, a millennium-long meeting was held on the first anniversary of the referendum on the withdrawal of Catalonia from Spain, which had devastated the country for two camps, and there was no conflict between independence and police; six participants were detained.
Police personnel had pushed the protestors away from independence, while the latter, dressed in black masks, had abandoned the custody of the eggs and dusty cow, raising the cloud of dark dust in the very centre of Barcelona.
After the police set up a dove to stop the crowd, the riots resumed with the new force.
Within a few hours, the independenceists said, “We will not forget, nor will we forgive.” And their opponents said, “Peace be upon you, Spain.”
According to the local press, fourteen participants fell into a hospital with minor injuries.
On 1 October last year, a referendum was held on the withdrawal of Catalonia from Spain, which was recognized by the illegal Spanish Government, but was an important milestone for separatists.
Catalonia had voted in favour of leaving Spain, but the phenomenon was low because of the fact that the opponents of the march had mainly boycotted the referendum.
According to Catalan official sources, almost 1,000 people were injured during last year's attempts by the police to block the referendum at the country's polling stations.
On Friday, separatists met in the claimed way of monitoring the demonstration in support of the Spanish police in order to prevent it from being conducted.
The demonstration was still taking place, but it went the other way.
The 68-year-old electrician Narsis Termez, who visited a separatist meeting in his wife's company, recalls that the hope of the acquisition of Catalonia's sovereignty is growing.
“Last year, one of the most important events in our lives has happened.
My parents cried out with joy, got the opportunity to vote in the referendum, and today we are in a state of subjugation," he says.
In the recent December elections in the local administrations, the Catalan parties for the Spanish office have won an important victory, even with a small break, but this year their movement is losing its supporters, as many of the well-known movement leaders are either running or in custody, awaiting the court for their role in organizing a referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Hoan Puch, a 42-year-old telephone recorder in support of the police, said that the conflict was being exacerbated by both sides of the political spectrum.
“Strengthened tension,” he added.
On Saturday, Oriol Junckeras, one of the nine leaders of the Catalan separatists, said that he intended to join the European Parliament next year.
“Participating in ordinary elections in the European Parliament as a candidate is the best way to condemn the loss of democratic values and repression by the Spanish Government,” he said.

"Livingston" victory over "Randers" thanks to Metko Golo Mengi
First goal, Dolly Mangy won a guaranteed victory by the Livingstone team
Thanks to the shot of Livingstone, he won an unexpected victory over Rangers. For the chief coach of the Scottish club, Stephen Gerard, this is only a second defeat for 18 games.
The exact hit by Dolly Mangy was equal to Gary Holt's team with the Hibernian club in the starting table, where they share second place.
The Gerard Club was left without a victory in the Premier League season. On Sunday, they will meet with the leaders of the Harts group, from which Rangers are left at eight points.
On Thursday, Rangers will play a match for the League of Europe with the Austrian Rapid Club (Vienna).
Livingston Club continues its unfavourable series in the division, has already won six matches and has not received any injury since Holt replaced Kenny Miller as the lead coach of the team.
Lost moments for Livingstone in the grip of hard-working guests
Holt's roof coaches must have been counting from the very beginning — the Rangers clearly failed to cope with their efforts.
Scott Robinson was able to break through the line of protection, but the goal of his weak attempt was not gone, and then the defender Alan Litgou, turning too wide, was unable to prevent the ball from getting into the network.
The receiving party allowed Rangers to play in front of their protection line, counting on dangerous moments when the game was resumed.
That's what they missed this important goal.
Rangers were released, and Livingstone took advantage of the opportunity: Declan Gallagher and Robinson made a transfer to Menge, who was killed from the central location.
At the time, Rangers were superior to the ball, but the protection of the host team was unprovoked, so Liam Kelly's doorkeeper was not worried.
The second time continued under the same scheme, although Kelly had to get hit by Alfredo Morelos.
The Rangers' doorman, Alan McGregor, turned his sword off Scott Pittman, and Litgou made a large delivery from the standard.
The matches were constantly under attack at Livingstone, but all the attacks were reflected, and the two Penalties — one for triggering Glenn Midlton Halkett and the other for the hand — were not satisfied.
‘Penomanal’ game ‘Livington’ — analysis
By BBC Scotland – Alaster Lamontt, "Tony Makaroni Arena" report
A phenomenal game and excellent result for the Livingstone team.
Absolutely all the games were great, and on the other hand, all expectations were over, continuing to rise to the football Olympics.
Their style of games and composition has not changed since they came to top ratings, and the great merit of Coach Holt was that he had mobilized this team from the beginning.
His team had a number of current heroes.
Captain Halkett led a well - organized defense, and Menga did not let Connor Goldson and Joe Urall relax.
However, Rangers could not get into the rhythm.
Although they had good playtimes with Coach Gerard, this time they didn't justify our expectations.
In the last few minutes, the fighter didn't take control of the ball, and they only managed to protect the host team one day. Rangers, released in the middle of the table, have something to think about.
Cold reception of Erdogan during a visit to Cologne
On Saturday, 29 September, when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met in the morning, the weather was great, and both of them were in a great mood.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's visit to Germany to establish relations between the two NATO parties, a visit, and without any conflict.
The heads of countries were unable to understand issues such as human rights, press freedom and Turkey's EU accession.
After Erdogan was sent to Cologne to participate in the opening ceremony of a huge new mosque.
The largest Turkish diaspora outside Turkey lives in Cologne.
For security reasons, the police did not allow a 25-year-old crowd to enter the castle, but many Erdogan supporters were nearby to see their president.
At the same place, opposers of the Erdogogan regime, including Kurds, gathered to give a full vote to condemn both the policy of Erdogohan and the decision of the German Government to invite him with a visit to Germany.
The presence of radically opposite views at the meeting reflects the undiminished nature of this figure: many Germans with Turkish roots carry Erdogan, while others consider him a tyrant.
Road accident in Deptford: Car crash led to the death of a biker
In London, the car was hit by a bike driver who ended up at the scene.
Avarya took place near Besud Street and Evelyn Street, a revitalized crossroads in the south-east of the city of Depfort, about 10:15 a.m. local time.
The driver and the men who came to the station tried to help the bicycle driver, but the man did not realize it.
This is not the only accident with a fatal outcome in this area: it's only half a mile from the scene, on the streets of Childers Street, another biker was hit by a car whose driver was hidden.
The London police report that work is currently being done to identify the person of the deceased and to inform his closest relatives.
As long as the roads are closed and the bus route is changed, drivers are asked not to go to the area.
Illnesses in Long-Lartin Prison: Six policemen injured
According to the Long-Lartin Administration, six police officers were injured during the riots in the men ' s prison.
In the men's prison of the Long-Lartin (Wusstershire) strict regime, the riots that have been committed at around 09:30 a.m. on a local basis continue on Sunday.
The Tornado Opera group was called for the suppression of the riots involving eight prisoners from one wing.
The police received minor damage to the soft tissue; they received medical attention on the spot.
According to the official representative of the prison, “specially trained personnel were recruited to permit the incident at the Long-Lartin Correctional Facility.
Six of them were injured.
We are categorically denying the use of physical force in our institution, and it is clear that the perpetrators will be handed over to the police and their measure of repression can be changed for a longer time.”
There are currently more than 500 prisoners in Long Larten, including one of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, the media reported that the prison manager had fallen into a hospital under attack by one of the prisoners.
In October last year, the prison management was forced to attract special-purpose units to calm the displaced prisoners who had thrown billiards into the guards.
Hurricane Rosa can sink Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (which will benefit the dry territories)
Arizona rarely falls in the area of an intense tropical cyclone, but this time it “flighted” – at the beginning of the next week of hurricane Rosa, making her last round, must cross the desert part of the South-West and bring with it the risk of floodwaters.
The National Meteorological Service has already warned of the threat of flooding on Monday and Tuesday in West Arizona and the southern and eastern parts of Nevada, in southern California and Uta, including in cities such as Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
It is expected that Hurricane Rosa will cross a straight line over Phoenix on Tuesday and flow through the river on Monday evening.
The Office of the National Meteorological Service in Phoenix reported in Twitter that “all ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of a tropical storm or depression within 320 km of Phoenix since 1950.
Hurricane Katrina (in 1967) walked 65 km from the Arizona border.”
According to the latest forecasts of the National Meteorological Service, there will be 5 to 10 centimeters of precipitation, which will reach 15 centimeters in the Arion Mogolon-Rim plato.
In other desert regions of the South-West region, such as the Central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, it is possible to land up to 2.5 to 5 cm of landfills, 10 cm of landfills can be reached.
For areas whose rivers flow by side, the rain caused by the hurricane of Rosa can be a blessing, for the region has long suffered from drought.
Although the floodwaters may pose a danger, abundant rains can facilitate dry season in the South-West of the United States.
According to U.S. Drought Monitor, more than 40 per cent of Arizona's territory is affected by severe drought (second category),” reports the weather.com website.
At first, Hurricane Rosa is breaking down on the Mexican state of Lower California.
As early as the day of the resurrection, hurricane, the maximum speed of which is 137 km/h, is 360 km south of the city of Punta-Euhania (Mexico) and is moving north at 19 km/h.
Hurricane has been found in a water-frozen area on the Pacific coast and thus loses its power.
In the second half of the day, hurricanes will reach Mexico in the category of “tropical storm”.
Abundant floods are expected to occur in certain areas of Mexico.
“In the territory of the Lower California to the north-west of Sonora, up to 7-10 cm of rainfall, up to 25 cm,” reports the weather.com website.
Furthermore, Hurricane Rosa is heading north through the territory of Mexico, and early in the morning it will reach the border with Arizona in the tropical cyclone category, from Arizona to the southern part of Utah until Tuesday evening.
“The main potential risk associated with Hurricane Rosa and its remains is the strong rivers in Lower California, the north-west of Sonora and the desert areas of the South-West United States,” the National Meteorological Service reports.
It is expected that the sediments will cause dangerous floodwaters, waste streams in the desert and possible flooding in the mountain areas.

Donald Tramp: "Cavana has broken all the hatred, all the evil" of the democracies"
“The vote for the Kawano judge is a voice against the ruthless and repugnant tactics used by the democracies,” Tramp said at a meeting of his fellow citizens in Willinga, West Virginia.
According to Trampa, in the process of approving the nomination of Kawano to the candidate, “all hatred, all anger” of the Democratic Party has been disrupted.
On Thursday, Kawano gave a testimony at the U.S. Congress, in his emotional treatment he categorically rejected the charge of Christine Banja Ford that he had sexualized her more than 30 years ago when she was both teenagers.
Dr. Ford also gave testimony during the hearing of her indictment.
On Saturday, the President of the United States said that that day “the American people saw the brilliant mind, class and courage” of Kawano.
“The vote for the approval of Judge Kawano is a vote for the approval of one of the most outstanding lawyers of our time, with an unresolved public service list,” the president of his group of fellow citizens in the state of West Virginia announced.
In his speech, the President raised the question of the nomination of Kawano, as to the importance of the appearance of the Republicans for elections in Congress and the House of Representatives.
“For the most important elections in our life, only five weeks remain.
I don't take part in them, but I'm taking part in the race in a different way," he said.
“I’m wearing a tantrum and fighting for our excellent candidates.”
Tramp believes that the democracies have called themselves “by all means to resist us”.
Under the regulation, the first key vote in the Cavano candidacy Senate was to be held no later than Friday, the Assistant High Representative of the Republican Party reported.
The earthquake in Indonesia has taken hundreds of lives, and the total number of victims continues to grow
On Saturday, the Indonesian authorities announced that at least 384 people had been killed, many of them were caught by the giant waves that took over the beaches of the Indonesian island of Sulavesi, which was damaged by the incredible force of tsunamis and earthquakes.
The first victims of nature were hundreds of visitors to the beach festival in the city of Pala, and on Friday, on the coast, they reached an altitude of almost six metres, which gave way to all of them and led to the eternal death of many of those present.
The tsunami followed an earthquake of 7.5 on the Richter scale.
“When a storm warning was issued yesterday, people continued their beach rest instead of running into hiding immediately and therefore lost their lives,” reported Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, an official representative of the Indonesian National Administration for the Elimination of Natural Disasters during the press conference held in Jakarta.
“The tsunamis didn’t come, there were cars, bridges, entire houses, nature destroyed everything on its way,” Nugroho explained, adding that the tsunamis crossed the ocean at a speed of 497 km/h, and they were forced to land on the coast.
Some of them were taken to the trees, saving their lives.
About 16,700 local residents were evacuated to 24 shelters in Pala.
The aerofotosum management of the effects of natural disasters is seen in destroyed homes, shops, bridges and heated swords.
On Saturday, the coastal city was still wiped out by underground rushes.
A series of earthquakes occurred in the territory of 2.4 million people.
The statement by the Agency for the Evaluation and Use of Technologies of the Republic of Indonesia (BPPT) indicated that the energy emissions caused by the earthquake amounted to approximately 200 times greater than that of the Atomic Bomb that destroyed Hiroshima.
The tsunami may have been stronger than expected by the geographical location of the city at the end of the long narrow Gulf.
Nugroho called the “massal” damage, adding that thousands of homes, hospitals, malls and hotels were destroyed.
The bodies of the dead were found under the ruins of the damaged buildings; all traumas were received by 540 persons, and another 29 were counted missing.
Nugroho added that the victims and destructions could be even more significant along the coast to 300 km from Pala, in Dungala, which was close to the quake.
Communication with Dungala was “completely destroyed and no information was received”.
“More than 300 thousand people live in the Dungala area,” reports the International Committee of the Red Cross in its communiqué, whose staff and volunteers have already moved to the disaster zone.
“There has been a tragedy, but it is not yet a border, ” the report says.
On Saturday, the Office was severely criticized because it had not reported the arrival of the tsunamis in Pala, but the authorities believed that the waves had reached the coast at a time when the initial warning was still in force.
The social media featured a favorite video in which a man on the top floor of the building screams at the rising tsunamis, desperately trying to draw people’s attention to the street.
After a few minutes on the beach, a wall of water is demolished, and a whole house and a car is taken away.
Reuters has not yet been able to confirm the authority of this role.
Earthquake and tsunamis have led to major electrolyte disturbances, which has caused the connection in Pala, which has made rescue operations very difficult.
Military transport aircraft were sent from Jakarta and other cities with humanitarian assistance, but the evacuated population still lacks food and items of the first need, government sources reported.
The city ' s airport was opened for humanitarian assistance only; it would be closed for other flights until October.
On Sunday, the evacuation centres in Pala will visit President Joco Vidodo.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia is over 800.
The situation is very bad.
The volunteers of the World Vision charity came from Dungala to Pala, where the staff found shelter in the courthouses of their office building.
“They saw a great multitude of ruined houses, ” he says.
The situation is very bad.
The charitable organizations have begun to implement humanitarian aid mechanisms, but many complain that international NGOs have failed to reach Pala.
Indonesia ' s legislation allows funding, humanitarian assistance and foreign organizations only after the announcement of a disaster zone.
It hasn't happened yet.
“It is considered to be a local disaster,” says Aulia Ariana, the Indonesian Red Cross press secretary.
“As soon as the Government announces a natural disaster to the national, we will be able to accept foreign aid, but until the status remains unchanged.”
On the second day after the natural disaster that struck Paul, the friends and relatives of the people who had fallen, they still look forward to their wonderful salvation, which will bring the people back to the best of their faith.
A little boy who fell into a sewer hole was saved on Saturday.
In the resurrection, the rescuers pulled out of the building a woman who spent two days there near her mother's lifeless body.
Hendon Subandon, a coach for national paraplanery assembly in Indonesia, has prepared two missing pilots for the recent Asian Games in Indonesia.
Among other people trapped in Roa Roa's hotel were his students, including Mandagi.
“I’m not the last person in this sport, and it’s emotionally difficult to survive,” he said.
Hendon recalls, as he learned of Roa Roa's assault on other paraplanetists, over the next few hours he was desperate to contact whatsApp with his colleagues from Pala who were resting at the beach festival.
However, his messages were depicted with one grain of straw, not two pigeons.
“This means that the messages were not delivered,” he said.
Hard clay 26 750 during the service of the ATM in Newport-on-Livi
On Friday morning, the delinquent kidnapped $26,750 from the Brink's incassator, a banker in Newport-on-Levia, says the news release of the Newport police.
According to researcher Dennis McCarty, the driver of the armoured microbus took the cash out of the ATM in the fun complex and was going to borrow it with new bank notes.
At that time, “a member of the Brink's from the back ran away” and stole a banknote bag for the ATM.
According to witnesses of the incident, several suspects escaped from the scene, but the police did not indicate the number of potential participants.
Citizens with any information on these individuals are requested to contact the Newport Police Office at 859-292-3680.
West Edge: The rapper has changed its name
Rapper Kane West thought of himself as a new name: Yes.
He announced on Saturday in Twitter: “The identity previously known as Kanye West”.
The 41-year-old West has long worn this pseudonym and even put it in the name of its eighth album that came to June.
The news about this appeared in advance of Cana's appearance in a Saturday Night Live broadcast, where he is planning to present his new Yandhi album.
The West canyon will be a leading singer instead of Ariana, who cancelled her participation due to “emotional experiences”, reports the transfer author.
West stated earlier that pseudonym was not only a reduced option but also a religious sense.
“Ye – the most common word in the Bible, it means “the”, “you”” – West explained the name of his album in a recent interview with Big Boy.
"That's me, that's you, that's us.
The first was Cain, which means “one, ” and now I am the only one, that is, the reflection of all good, evil, inconceivable in us, all at once.
And the album is an attempt to figure out who we are."
The dog is not the first known rapper to change his name.
Sean Combs, formerly known as Paff Diddy, Pi Diddy, or simply Diddy, asked to be called Love ("love") or Braza Love ("Brat Love") this year.
The West rapper Jay-Zi also changed his name several times: with a definition and without, written letters or strong.
The President of Mexico solemnly promises not to use military force against the civilian population
The President of Mexico, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, vowed never to join the military force against the civilian population before the 50th anniversary of the student demonstration, which ended with a bloody clash.
Speaking on Saturday in Tlatelolko Square, President Lopes Obrador promised “never to flee to the army for the repression of the Mexican people”.
At this site, on 2 October 1968, the students were given the first round of the crowd and started a 300-year-old life shot, which took place in the background of the strengthening of the left-wing student movement in Latin America.
Lopes Obrador also promised support to a Mexican youth in the form of a monthly scholarship to study and open up more free public universities.
According to him, unemployment and the lack of prospects for learning lead young people into criminal peace.
It is necessary to redouble the financing of the development of II
China should not be underestimated and its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence (GI) - the United States should double investment in its scientific development, Li Caiaphas, an investor and an enterprise in the field of II development with experience in Google, Microsoft and Apple.
A number of American ministries have made earlier statements on the work of II, although the United States as a whole does not have a clear strategy for II development.
At the same time, China introduced its own plan last year: its goal is to become the first in the innovations of II by 2030.
“The increase in the II research budget twice would be a good start, given that all other countries are far away from the United States, and we expect the next II breakthrough,” Li says.
The increase in funding can double the chances that the next major achievement of the II will be achieved in the United States, Li CNBC said in an interview this week.
Li, whose book “The Masters of artificial intelligence: China, the Kremney Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, Director General of Synovation Ventures, who invested in one of the most outstanding companies in China, Face +.
In the 1980s, he worked on an artificial intelligence system at the University of Carnegie-Mellon, which was the highest-ranking player in the U.S. hotel and was then head of Microsoft Research and the president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee mentioned previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Robotics Challenge Agency Defense Advanced Research Projects, and was interested when the next competition was held to help find people with a non-traditional thinking.
According to Lee, researchers in the United States often have to work hard to obtain government grants.
“It is not China that embraces academic leaders, but corporations,” Li was convinced.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have been hiring light from universities to work on artificial intelligence in recent years.
It is convinced that changes in immigration policy can also help the United States to develop artificial intelligence.
“I think green cards should be automatically offered to candidates in the field of artificial intelligence,” he says.
In July 2017, the State Council of China published a plan for the development of artificial intelligence for the next generation.
The Chinese National Fund for Natural Sciences provides scientific funding similar to that provided by the National Research Fund and other governmental organizations to American researchers, but the quality of the research work in China below is confirmed by Lee.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Ministry of Defence established a Joint Centre of Artificial Intelligence, where partners from industry and scientific circles should participate, and the White House announced the establishment of the Special Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in the AI Next programme.
With regard to NSF, it is currently investing more than $100 million a year in II research.
However, US legislation, which sought to establish the National Security Commission on artificial intelligence, has not taken any action in this regard for several months.
Macedonians vote on the referendum on whether the name of the country should be changed
On Sunday, the people of Macedonia voted in favour of the referendum on whether the name of their country should be changed to “the Republic of North Macedonia”, which would allow for a multi-year dispute with Greece, which blocked its applications for entry into the European Union and NATO.
Greece, composed of the province of Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbour is a claim in its territory and has put a veto on its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, both Governments concluded an agreement based on a new name, but the opposition nationalists claim that this change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority of the population of Macedonia.
President George Ivanov said that he would not vote for the referendum, and the boycott campaign questioned whether the voter appearance would correspond to the minimum 50 per cent required for the referendum.
The question raised at the referendum was: "Do you support NATO and EU membership, subject to the adoption of a treaty with Greece?".
The participants exchange names, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim that Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the collapse of Yugoslavia, should pay this price for entry into organizations such as the EU and NATO.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for the young of Macedonia, so that it can live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us," says 79-year-old Oliver Georgievski, who lives in Skopje.
A sufficient number of Members of Parliament stated that they would respect the outcome of the vote to make it decisive, although it had no binding legal force.
The change of name will require a majority in two thirds of the members of Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission stated that no violations had been reported by 13:00.
However, the appearance was only 16 per cent compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66 per cent of registered voters voted.
“I came to vote for my children, our place in Europe,” says 62-year-old Jose Tanevski, an elector from Skopje capital.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dusko voted in favour of a referendum in Macedonia on the change of the name of the country, which will open the way for its entry into NATO and the European Union in Stromice, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In front of the Parliament building in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardakov, 54, prepared a small stage, placing chairs in front of the chambers established by the citizens who are going to boycott the referendum.
"We want to join NATO and the EU, but we want to join with a high-level head, not by violating the thresholds of official offices," Kavadarkov says.
“Yes, we are citizens of a poor country, but we also have a sense of our own dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can address other countries, such as China and Russia, and become part of the Euro-Asian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO membership would make investments in Macedonia, which was so necessary in that country that the unemployment rate was more than 20 per cent.
"I believe that the overwhelming majority will be behind because more than 80 per cent of our citizens support the EU and NATO," Zaev said after the vote.
He believes that the positive response will be “the basis for our good future”.
The survey, published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Political Research, showed that between 30 and 43 per cent of voters would participate in the referendum, but this was the most appropriate event.
Another survey conducted by the Macedonian Telecom TV channel revealed that 57 per cent of respondents planned to vote on the Sunday.
70 per cent of these figures claim to be positive.
In order for the referendum to take place, the appearance should be 50 per cent plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum will be the first serious impact on the policy of the Western Government since it came to power last May.
See: Serhio Aguero from Manchester City covers the protection of Briton to kill the goal
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling argued with the protection of Bryton, bringing Manchester City to victory at 2:0 a.m. on Saturday at the Atihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
When Aguero shot a target for 65 minutes, it seemed that it did not work for him.
At the beginning of the episode, the Argentine attacker got his dog at the center of the field.
He disappeared between the three Bryton defenders before going out into the open space
Aguero was surrounded by four rivals in green football.
He surrounded one of the defenders and surrounded several more on the edge of the Briton Criminal Zone.
He passed the Sterling sword on the left.
An English attacker, in a fine zone, came back to Aguero's sword, which knocked the right foot door of Briton Matthew Ryan into the right corner of the gate.
“Aguero has some problems with his legs,” said Coach Manchester City, Pep Gardiola.
“We agreed that he would play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he shot a target at that moment."
But it was Sterling who gave the Blue Sky an initial advantage in the struggle against the Prime Minister.
That goal was killed in 29 minutes.
In this game, Aguero won a ball, deep in the territory of Briton
He gave a great cut on the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane did a couple of tapes before handing over Sterling to the far side of the barn.
The attacker, the Blue Sky, struck a ball in the door just before it ran out of fields.
Manchester City was defeated by Hoffenheim in a team of champion leagues on Tuesday at 12:55 at Rein-Nekkar-Arene in Zinsheim, Germany.
Sherzer is going to pick the dots at Colorado Rockyz.
After Washington Nashionals got out of the game-off battle, there was no special reason to force events.
But the inalienable Sherzer hopes to take up the fight against Colorado Rockys on Sunday, but only if Roxie, which runs into one Los Angeles Dodgers game in the West Division, will be the problem in the playoff.
The 5-2 victory over the Neshionals on Friday evening, Roxie, has already won at least 7 or 8 seats, but they still hope to secure their title in the first division.
“Even though we play just that way, at least we can hold our positions, knowing the enormous importance of the atmosphere in Denver in the presence of viewers and other teams, probably unprecedented this year.
How can I miss such a thing?"
"Nezionals" has not yet announced the drinker on the Sunday, but according to the latest data, it is up to the Sherzers to present this role in the present situation.
Sherzer, going out on the 34th game, threw a ball on a drinker's field on Thursday, and on Sunday, in his exit, he will be a drinker.

Tromp is running a pre-election race in West Virginia
Referring to the importance of the presence of Republicans in the interim elections, the President made a direct reference to the situation around Brett Kawano, the nominations issued by the President to the Supreme Court.
"All we did was put on the map in November.
Five weeks left up to one of the most important elections in our life.
It's very, very important, I'm not running, although I'm really running, fighting for good candidates everywhere," he said.
Trump continued: "You see this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, you see what's going on right now.
And they are determined to regain power by using whatever means are needed, and we observe vanity and wickedness.
They are like those whom they try to get power and control, but we are not going to give them control."
The Democrats, he claims, were intended to “stand up and stop”.
“And you will observe it in the last four days,” he said, calling the democracies “evil, vile, evil, and false.”
He referred to the Senate's Legal Committee, referring to Senator Diane Finnstein, which triggered a loud voice from the hall.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you allow the contents of this document to run away?
Mmm... mmm... what document?
No, no, the language of the body has given it away, I have never seen the language of the body so much as to contradict the words."
The Laborist Party is no longer an organization that has different views.
It does not show tolerance for those who express their opinion
When Momentum activists in my local party offered me a voice of disbelief, it was no surprise.
Finally, I am the last in a number of Members of Parliament from the Liberal Party who have not yet said that we are not welcomed by what we have said.
A similar attitude towards my colleague in the Parliament, Joan Ryan, because she strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized for my disagreement with Jeremy Corbin.
The importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, in the irony of fate, is the issue that Jeremy had not agreed with the previous leaders.
The Notice of the Nottingham East Laborist Assembly said on Friday that “we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive”.
Most of my eight-year stay in the position of a local member of Parliament from the Libyan Party was the same as the GC Friday evenings.
Unfortunately, today's tone is not consistent with many meetings, but the promise of a “more human and mild” policy has long been forgotten if it has ever been.
The fact that there are no differences in views in the Leborist Party is becoming more and more obvious, and each opinion is assessed as to whether it is acceptable for the party ' s leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader; colleagues, whose political perspective I had previously considered to be similar to my own, had been expecting that I would radically change my views and take the position I would never agree with, whether it was national security or the single EU market.
Every time after my public address, it is not important that I speak, the social networks should have a lot of insults that call for the abolition of elections condemning the centre's policy or claiming that I should not be a member of the Lebanese party.
And that's not the only thing that happens to me.
Indeed, I know that I have been happier than some of my colleagues because the comments in my address still tend to be political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who face a daily flow of sexual or racist attacks, but never retreat.
It is most disappointing in this policy that such a number of insults have become the norm.
Last week, Jeremy Corbin said that the Lebanese party should develop a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer a “wide church” and that every wave of mistrust or change of party selection rules is already taking place.
Over the past two years, I have received many recommendations that call me to sit still and to speak, and then everything will be fine with me.
But that's not why I came into politics.
Since I joined the Laborist 32 years ago, as a school student who was troubled by the unrelenting attitude of the Tatcher Government, which caused my school class to break down, I have sought to uphold the highest standard of public services for those who need it most, whether it is the work of a local deputy or a government minister.
I have never hidden my political views, I have not done so in the past elections.
No one in Nottingham East could misinterpret my political positions and areas in which I disagree with the current leadership.
To those who supported this vote on Friday, I would like to say that our country is moving to Brexit, which is guaranteed to bring an economic, industrial and state riot, and I do not understand the desire of some to spend their time and strength on my loyalty to the leader of the Libyan Party.
But in fact, the only audience I would like to appeal to is not Nottingham Momentum, but my voters do not matter whether they are or not the Laborists: I am proud of what I am serving you, and I promise that no threat to the abolition of the election results or political opportunity will prevent me from acting as I consider necessary in your behalf.
Chris Leslie, Member of Parliament from Nottingham East
Er 38 - 17 Melrose: The Invincible “Ere” Goes First
The two late attempts may have been somewhat inconceivable, but there is no doubt that “Er” won the triumph in this interesting tenent prime minister.
Now they're heading the table, the only invincible team of tens.
Finally, due to their superior protection, and the ability to choose the right moment, the host team and coach Peter Merci gave the full right to be satisfied.
"All this time we have been tested for strength, and we are still invincible, so I have no reason to grieve," said Peter Mercie.
Robin Kristi, Melrose: "It's worth the credit "Er", they've done their best."
Grant Anderson's 14-minute attempt, made by Freser Klimo, led by Er, but a yellow card issued for the game "Voriors" by the Scottish player Rory Hughes allowed Melrose to go forward, and Jason Baggot caught up with an unrealized attempt.
Climo increased the Er's fraction from the penalty before, directly in the middle of the game, earned a score and then made a single attempt at the break, making an Er's 17-5 account.
But Melrose started the second half well, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, which was realized by Baggot, reduced the poison to five points.
Then there was a long break due to the serious trauma of Ruarid Knott, and after the re-out, Er further moved on through the attempt of Stafford McDawela, who was made by Klimo.
The current captain, Er, Blair Mcferson, then received a yellow card, and once again Melrose, the rivals were forced to pay a regular game for the unrealized attempt by Bruce Colvin, at the end of a period of fierce pressure.
However, the landlords returned, and when Struan Hatchinson received a yellow card for the arrest of Klimo without a ball with a penalty line, Mcferson made a tacdan behind the upcoming “Er”.
Klimo achieved the advantage, not least from the very beginning, after Kyle Row had been hit by David Armstrong and sent the final attacker Gregor Henry to the fifth attempt of the field owners.
The Still Game star is about to start a new career in the restaurant business
The Still Game Ford Kiran star is about to start working in the hospitality industry: it was known that he was appointed director of the licensed restaurant company.
A 56-year-old actor plays the role of Jack Jarvis in a popular BBC show, a script he writes about, and is filmed with a former comedy partner, Greg Hemfil.
Duet announced that the upcoming ninth show would be the last show, and it seems that Kirnan is planning a life after Craigang.
According to official information, he is Director Aeringmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on this information, although the Scottish Sun source suggested that Kirnan is planning to participate in the “excellent restaurant business” in Glasgow.
“Our sea” means that no exit to the sea of Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen its way to the Pacific
Marines patrol the La Pase military headquarters.
Blue flags have been raised in public buildings.
The marine bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are painted with a slogan: "Our right is ours.
It is our duty to bring it back."
Throughout Bolivia, landlocked people still remember the coastline lost in Chile as a result of the 19th century's bloody conflict because of resources; living and striving to sail across the Pacific again.
These hopes may have been the boldest in recent decades, as Bolivia is awaiting decisions by the International Court of Justice, which will take place on 1 October as a result of five years of debate.
“Bolivia has energy, the spirit of unity and the balance of the soul, and of course there is a positive result,” said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Kaldzilla.
Many Bolivians will observe the decision-making process in the International Court of Justice on large screens throughout the country, hoping that the Hague Tribunal will be able to support Bolivia ' s statement that, after decades of intense negotiations, Chile is obliged to negotiate for Bolivia ' s sovereign entry to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic president of the Bolivian indigenous peoples, who fought an unforgivable battle for reelection next year, is also looking forward to the decision that will be made on Monday.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he said at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court would hardly take a decision in favour of Bolivia, and if so, that would change little.
The United Nations body in the Netherlands has no authority to control the territory of Chile and has already stated that there will be no impact on the outcome of possible negotiations.
That the decision of the International Court of Justice was delivered only six months after the last arguments were heard, he said that the case was “not complicated”, said Pas Zarat, a Chilean expert on international law.
And for the last four years, Bolivia has not moved, but it has been abandoned all the time.
“The current administration of Bolivia has taken advantage of the problem of access to the sea for criminal purposes,” Zarate said.
According to her, the military rhetoric of Morales destroyed Chile’s last goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations at some point, but then it will be extremely difficult to hold discussions.
These two countries have no diplomatic relations since 1962.
The former President, Eduardo Rodriguez Velce, a representative of Bolivia in The Hague, disagrees that the court ' s decision was made too quickly.
On Monday, Bolivia will be “an exceptional opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile” and the opportunity to “end 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefit”, he states.
Kaldazila also disagrees that Morales, another of the most popular presidents of Latin America, uses the military-sea problem as a political horizon.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific,” he said.
“The decision of the court is an opportunity to make sure that we have to move beyond our past.”
North Korea asserts that nuclear disarmament will not be possible until it can trust the United States
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea Ri Yon Ho claims that his country will never go to the destruction of its nuclear weapons unless it is able to trust Washington.
On Saturday, Ri took part in a meeting of the United Nations General Assembly.
He called upon the United States to fulfil the commitments made at the Singapore summit among the leaders of its countries.
His comments are made as the US Secretary-General, Mike Pompey, gradually reverts to the path of resumption of the sudden nuclear diplomacy more than three months after a meeting in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Chen Jin.
Ri argues: the dream that long-term sanctions and US opposition to the declaration of the end of the Korean war will ever put the North on its knees is a utopia.
Washington is afraid to adopt this declaration if the Pyrenees do not take significant steps to achieve disarmament.
And Kim, and the president of the United States, Donald Tramp wants to hold the second summit.
But skepticism about the fact that the Pyrenees are serious about the rejection of the arsenal, which the country is probably considering as the only way to guarantee its security, is widespread.
Pompey plans to visit Pyrenees next month to prepare a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris ' s fashion shows the latest line of mass main clothing that promises to appear in the media, and will be brought directly to you
If you want to add a straw to your collection or protect yourself completely from sunlight, there is no need to look for anything else.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented the mass of unusual main clothes that are part of their SS19 collection and the blind visitors of the Fashion Week in Paris.
This summer, extremely impractical traps won the popularity of Instagram subscribers, and designers decided to send their snowflakes to the podium.
Valentino’s outstanding specimen: the main escape clothing, decorated with wide strips, similar to the periphery, was decorated on the heads of the models.
Other massive accessories included decorated with precious stones of arbusia, a wizard's hat and even ananas, but all these main clothes are not intended to warm the head in cold weather.
Tom Brown also appeared in the world a collection of amazing masks, which had to become very early in Halloween.
On many of these stone masks, the mouth was covered, and they reminded the portrait of Gannibal the Reader more than the creation of the corner.
One of the specimens reminded us of the equipment for underwater swimming with pipes and protective points, and the other was a growing frozen.
If you're a high-tech fan, you're lucky.
Modern critics predict that these huge traps have every chance of going through mass sales — directly to you.
The large-scale traps follow the five La Bomba, a two-foot, wide-spread solo trap from Riana to Emily Ratakovski.
The cult label that released this extremely unpractice hat, which won as much popularity in social networks, gave birth and sent another huge accessory to the floor — a broken beach bag, almost as large as the one dressed in a bathroom model carrying that bag.
The orange bag of a beloved Rafi with a white leather handle and a cap of the Rafi became a clear copy of the Jacquemus La Riviera SS19 collection on the Fashion Week in Paris.
Luk Armitaj, a stylisticist, explains: “I think that large traps and beach bags will appear in the media next summer, and since the designer has produced such a furor with his productions, it would be extremely difficult to ignore the demand for huge accessories.”
John Edward: Knowledge of languages is of utmost importance to the citizens of the world
The independent schools of Scotland continue the tradition of brilliant education, which has been confirmed in 2018: the results of the examinations have shown individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other significant disciplines.
These schools are part of the Scottish Board of Independent Schools (SCIS), where more than 30,000 students are trained throughout Scotland, and there are efforts to provide the highest level of service for students and their parents.
Independent schools seek to prepare their students for further higher education, their careers and the status of the citizens of the world.
As part of the educational sector, which is responsible for the development and implementation of an individual school programme, we see that modern languages continue to be popular and desirable in schools.
He said, “If you speak with a man of understanding, then you will speak to him.”
If you speak with him in his native tongue, you will speak to his heart.’
This is a convincing proof that we cannot rely only on English if we want to build and trust relations with citizens of other countries.
As a result of the recent examinations this year, we see that the languages are taking the leading positions in the league tables and have the highest scores of exams in independent schools.
A total of 68 per cent of students studying foreign languages received a higher assessment of “A”.
Data from 74 SCIS schools showed that 72 per cent of students received “A” in Mandarin (Chinese language), while 72 per cent of German students, 69 per cent of French students and 63 per cent of Spanish students also received “A”.
This proves that in Scotland ' s independent schools, foreign languages are undoubtedly of vital importance to children and young people in the future.
Language materials are now being used in the same way as natural sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics in independent schools and other educational institutions.
The survey carried out by the UK Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 showed that 17 per cent of the problems faced by employers in filling vacancies were due to lack of language skills.
Thus, language skills are increasingly becoming a key to a successful future career for young people.
In view of the fact that more prospective jobs require language knowledge, these skills are needed in a globalized world.
Regardless of what profession a student will choose, if he learns the second language, he will gain real benefit in the future by developing another additional skill that he will enjoy throughout his life.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives competitive advantages to a person who knows several foreign languages.
According to a survey of YouGov, involving more than 4,000 adult British in 2013, 75 per cent failed to speak well in a foreign language to support the conversation, and the French language was the only language with a double percentage, 15 per cent of respondents said.
That's why investment in language education is so relevant now.
Knowledge of several languages, especially languages from developing economies, will give children more opportunities to find good work.
In schools in Scotland, there is a wide range of languages that are taught — each school has its own set of languages.
A number of schools focus on more classical modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered the most important for Britain in the light of the future development of the country by 2020 — such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the interests of your child, independent schools will always choose from a number of teaching languages whose members are experts in these languages.
The independent schools of Scotland strive to create an environment of education that will prepare children and equip them with the skills needed to achieve success, no matter what future awaits them.
At present, it cannot be denied that languages remain vital in the global business environment for the future development of the country, so this should be reflected in education accordingly.
In fact, modern languages really need to be viewed as “international communication skills”.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, which provides diversity and benefits for young people in Scotland.
It's a good thing to do.
John Edwards, Director of the Council of Independent Schools of Scotland
Lebron debuts in Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The ambitious expectation of fans to see Lebron James for the first time in Los Angeles Lakers has almost ended.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James was playing a pre-season resurrection match against Denver Nagets in San Diego.
But he still has to figure out how long he has to play.
“More than one and fewer than four eight,” Walton replied on the Lakers official website.
The Lakers reporter, Mike Trudell, wrote on Twitter that James was probably playing a limited time.
After training early this week, James was asked about his plans for six pre-season games in the Lakers schedule.
“I don’t need pre-season games at this stage of my career to prepare for the season,” says the game.
Tampa race in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Tramp is starting a wave of election meetings tonight in Willinga, West Virginia.
This is the first of the five planned meetings of the Trump next week, including the friendly Tennesia and Mississippi.
Since a vote on the candidacy proposed by the Supreme Judge has been postponed, Tramp is seeking support for the forthcoming interim elections, as the Republicans are at risk of losing control of the Congress if the vote takes place in November.
How many evenings will the Tramp meet in West Virginia, and how can you view it online?
The meeting with Trump in Willinge, West Virginia, will take place at 19:00 a.m. on Saturday, 29 September 2018.
You can see the Tramp meeting with Western Virginia voters online on direct YouTube.
Tramp will probably be held at the hearings that will take place this week in order to bring his candidate, Brett Kawano, to the post of Supreme Judge. The proposal by Trampo of this candidate has caused a lot of negative reactions, since Kawano was accused of sexual harassment, and the vote to be held in the Senate will be postponed for a week until the FBI conducts an investigation.
But the main objective of this action is to help the Republicans in the November elections to increase their pre-election rate.
Thus, President Tramp's campaign is aimed at helping these five meetings, which should be held next week, to “activise the activities of volunteers and supporters, as Republicans are trying to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and the House of Representatives,” Reuters writes.
“Congress control is so important for its agenda that the President should visit as many states as possible, because we enter the tense pre-election season,” says the press secretary of the Trampa pre-election campaign, who refused to be called Reuters.
The action planned today at Wesbanco Arena in Willinge can attract supporters from... Ohio and Pennsylvania, and attract the attention of the Pittsburgh media, reports West Virginia Metro News.
This Saturday's trip to West Virginia is the second visit to the state in the last month, because it has benefited more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Tramp is trying to help a candidate in the Senate from West Virginia, Patrick Morrisi, who is staying on the ground as a result of the interrogations.
“The fact that Morrisi has begun to challenge the contestants must come to the president — it’s a bad sign for Morris,” says Simon Heder, a politician at the University of West Virginia.
Rider 2018: The U.S. Assembly demonstrates readiness to fight and seeks hope by sending to a couple's meeting on Sunday
After the three one-sided sessions, the two-by-two Saturday game may have been the one that Kubok Ryder needed.
The transitional initiative is an extremely inventive sport concept, but it is a game that is believed in, and at such contests it is particularly expressive.
So who's got the initiative?
"They had a six-point advantage, and now four, so I think it's a small initiative for us," Jordan Spit said.
Of course, Europe has a four-point advantage, and twelve more on the horse.
The Americans, according to Spita, feel “winds in the pans”, and they have reason to hold a spirit of height, not least thanks to the shape of Spita and Justin Thomas, who have played together all day, and each of them can be praised by three of the four.
Spit was unforgivable from you to the branch, rather than a personal example.
The winning bells became louder as the round went on, the decisive ball went off in the hole, closing the match when Thomas and I were two to two.
His strike, which gave him a victory in the 15th hole, was met with a similar blow, one that speaks of his faith as a chance for an American team.
“We need to get together with all the forces and focus only on our game,” Spit commented.
That's all that's left for the players.
Go through 18 moons and become winners.
The only games that have worked for the last two days more than Spit and Thomas are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Flitwood, who are undoubtedly in the history of Kubka Ryder.
A strange, but charming couple from Europe have killed four out of four, and they don't seem to know the mistake.
Molivud was the only couple who did not worship a god on Saturday, but they also avoided the gods on Saturday mornings, Fridays and Fridays.
Such a series and how their energy seems to circulate between them and non-existent patients, strengthens the faith that they will not be defeated on the Day of Resurrection, and when the sun will rise beyond the Le Golf National field, there will be no more famous game that will strengthen Europe's potential victory than Flitwood or Molinari.
It would be great if both of them were on different corners at the same time.
However, it speaks of the glory of Europe in the meantime.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly argued with Serhio Garcia, the morning hero of the four matches when he was paired with Alex Norren.
The gods and the two double gods on the first nine moons took out the Spanish and the Swedes, from which they could not get out.
So no one in the resurrection will be able to help you get out of your pit.
It is so interesting to observe the game in four balls and four games because of the interaction between the couples, the advice they exchange and the intention to reduce, and how the strategy can be changed into a single moment.
So far, Europe has played better than the team, and it has been a major breakthrough in the last day, but this Thursday session has also shown that the United States has all the strengths to fight, in which some, especially in America, have doubted.
On the final day, Cuba Rider Europe is running with an account of 10-6
Europe will have a tangible advantage on the final day of Cuba Ryder after the completion of the Saturday matches in four matches and Thursdays with the 10-6 over the United States.
The inspired duet Tommy Flitwood and Francesco Molinari led the fight against two victories over the fighting Tiger Woods to bring the Le Golf National account to four points.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who wanted to return lost to Haseltin two years ago, dominated the permissible mistake of the American team in the morning games in four matches, winning an account of 3-1.
The U.S. had more resistance on Thursdays, won two matches, but they were unable to reduce the gap in the account.
Jim Ferrick's team needs eight points from the 12 resurrected match to keep the trophies.
Flitwood was the first European novelist to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, who had received the name Mollywood after the sensational outputs, became only a second pair who won four points in the first four matches in the history of Kubka Rider.
With Woods and Patrick Reed in four swords, they were then well united for victory over the fallen spirit of Woods and American novelist Bryson Decebmo with even more determined 5/4.
Woods, who played two Saturday matches, showed periodic problems, but now he lost 19 out of 29 matches in four, and Thursdays were seven.
Justin Rose, a four-ball player who took a break in the morning, returned to his partner Henrik Stanson on Thursday, won Dustin Johnson and Brooks Kepku with an account of 2/1 taking the first and third places in the world.
For Europe, the game has not become an easy and pleasant walk to the south-west of Paris.
The three-time Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas won two points for the Americans on Saturday.
They won a strong victory with 2/1 on Spanish John Ram and Ayan Polter in four matches and returned later to play with Polter and Rory Macylerro in 4/3 on Thursday, losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of Kubka Rider team was driven out of four points, leaving alone, given that the Férik team, like the owners, had to be killed to keep the trophies.
After two days of holding second place, however, the contrast in the resurrection appears to be beyond their capabilities.
North Korea says that “categories” will not be disarmed unilaterally without confidence
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea stated to the United Nations on Saturday that the continued sanctions were increasing mistrust to the United States, and that his country would not, under any circumstances, give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally.
Ri Yon Ho stated to the annual General Assembly that North Korea had adopted “essential measures of good will” last year, such as the cessation of nuclear and missile tests, the dismantling of nuclear police and the obligation not to increase nuclear weapons and the development of nuclear technologies.
“We don’t see a symmetrical reaction from the United States,” he said.
“Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we will not be able to unilaterally take the first steps towards disarmament.”
While Ri reiterated the already-called North Korean complaints against Washington ' s “step-by-step” approach to denuclearization, according to which North Korea would be rewarded by step-by-step measures, his statement was important in the sense that it did not reject unilateral denuclearization without control, as Phanyan did in the past.
Ri referred to the joint statement made by Kim Chen Yenn and Donald Tramp on the first in the history of the summit between the current President of the United States and the North Korean leader, which took place in Singapore on 12 June; then Kim promised to start moving towards the “declaration of the Korean peninsula”, and Tramp promised the North Korean security assurance.
North Korea is seeking to formalize the Korean War 1950-53, but the United States is claiming that the Pyrenees must first abandon their nuclear weapons.
Washington is also opposed to the call to weaken severe international sanctions against North Korea.
“The U.S. insists that “denuclearization should be done first” and increase the level of pressure through sanctions in order to achieve their goal in a forced manner and even object to “a declaration of the end of war”, says Rí.
“The idea that sanctions can put us on our knees is a utopian dream of people who don’t know us.
But the current problem is that the continued sanctions are increasing our mistrust.”
Ri did not mention plans for the second summit between Kim and Trampo, which the United States leader mentioned in the United Nations early in the week.
Instead, the Minister drew attention to three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Mun Zhee In, which took place in the past five months, and added: “If the issue of denuclearization were a South Korea side, rather than a US side, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not be such a topic.”
However, the tone of Ri's speech differed sharply from last year when he told the United Nations Assembly that the target of North Korea's missile to the US mother was inevitable after Mr. President of Evil's Tromp called Kim "a suicide rocket".
This year, the UN Trump, which threatened to “completely destroy” North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take disarmament measures, but said that much more was to be done, and sanctions should remain in force until North Korea is disarmed.
On Wednesday, Trump said he did not indicate any time-limits for the process: “Will it take two years, three years, or five months?”
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should encourage Pyrenees to take the steps they have taken.
However, the Secretary of State Mike Pompey said to the UN Security Council on Thursday: “The introduction of sanctions by the Security Council must continue actively and compulsorily until we see complete, final and confirmed denuclearization”.
The Security Council has unilaterally strengthened sanctions against North Korea since 2006, in an effort to cover the financing of the Pyrenees ' nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompey met with Ri at the UN General Assembly summit and announced after that meeting that he would visit Pyrenees again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompey visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip failed.
In July he left Pyrenees, he said progress had been made, but for a few hours after that visit, North Korea condemned him for “bandish requirements”.
North Korea pledged to dismantle the missile complex and the nuclear complex at a meeting held with Moon this month, if the United States would adopt “relevant measures”.
According to him, Kim told him that the “appropriate measures” he spoke about were security guarantees that Tramp promised in Singapore, as well as actions aimed at normalizing relations with Washington.
Students of Harvard are learning to breathe in special courses
The new course, introduced this year at Harvard University, helped all primary students learn to sleep more and to fight the chauvinist culture of continuous consumption of caffeine with a view to encouraging “nights off”.
One of the academics found that the most successful students in the world often have no idea how to take care of themselves.
Charles Chesler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School, and a specialist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, has developed a course that he believes is the first in the United States.
After his opening, he was in a heated position to introduce such a course, with a report on the impact of the lack of sleep on the learning processes.
"At the end of my report, a girl came to me and said, 'I'm so sorry that I've only known about this now that I'm almost out of my training.'
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep — that it surprised me, ” he told The Telegraph.
The course, for the first time proposed to the students this year, describes how the habit of healthy sleep contributes to academic and sports success and how it improves the overall human self-esteem.
Paul Barreira, Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Executive Director of the Health Service of the University, said that the university decided to introduce this course after it was found that students had severe sleep deprivation during the school week.
The job takes one hour, students perform a number of interactive tasks.
A section of the exercise offers a picture of a room in a living room where students who insist on coffee cups, dishes, coaches and books get information on how each of these actions and substances — coffee, light, and sleep deprivation — affect sports results and how important it is to get sufficient sleep daily.
In the second section, participants will learn how long sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
An interactive map of the campus encourages participants to think about their daily life.
“We understand that these exercises will not change the behavior of the students immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know how anyone else has the right to know, for example, how smoking affects his health," added Professor Chesler.
According to him, the false feeling of pride that a person can “abstain all night” is still widespread, and modern technologies, as well as increasing pressure on students, mean that sleep deprivation is becoming a problem.
According to him, the sufficient amount of sleep of good quality is the “secret weapon” of a student to fight stress, nervous exhaustion and anxiety, and even to fight too much weight, because sleep can turn the brain into a hunger mode, making him feel hungry all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chesler to develop a course, visiting one of his last year's studies in Harvard.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to spread this information throughout the campus.
He hopes that the next step will be to ask all graduates to have a similar training program before going to a competitive school.
Professor Chesler recommends that students establish a building warning that they need to lie down to sleep and sleep, as well as to remember the harmful effects of the blue light emitted by electronic screens and light-emitting lamps that violate human biorit and lead to sleep problems.
"Livingston" 1 - 0 "Randers": Gol Menga wins the Gerard command
Rangers survived a regular painful departure meeting, as the Dolly Menga goal led the unscrupulous team of Stephen Gerard to a loss of 1.0 in Livingstone.
The ibrox team was hoping to win its first victory after a 4-1 win in St. Johnston in February, but Garry Holt's team only defeated Gerard out of 18 games, leaving his team at eight points behind, giving the Harts team an easy victory to the leaders of the Scottish Prime Minister.
Manga was killed in seven minutes before the break, and the Rangers, who had lost the power of the spirit, apparently, were not going to equalize the account.
While Rangers had now fallen to the sixth place, Livingstone had risen to the third place, and only Hibernian had fallen in relation to the heads of the dead.
And Rangers may have additional problems after a line judge, Kalum Spence, had to deal with a head injury after an object was thrown out of the guest sector.
Gerard made eight replacements to the team that passed through Er in the semifinal for the Scottish League's Cube.
In turn, Holt went on to the same Levi 11 strategy, which increased the gap with Harts last week, and he would be pleased to see his well-managed opponent's tightness at every step.
Rangers may have been leading a sword, but Livingstone had more to do when a ball hits them.
They had to be shot naked in just two minutes when the first Meng Scott Pittman transmission stopped Alan McGregor, but the defender took advantage of the chance.
Kigan Jacobs had a fine shot at the captain of the Craig Halket team, but his defense partner, Alan Litgou, was only able to send a sword to the side of the stand.
Rangers took over control, but in the last third, it seems there was more hope than faith in their game.
Alfredo Morelos was convinced that he and Steven Louless had to be beaten for forty-five minutes, but Judge Steven Thompson did not agree with the Colombian statement.
Rangers made two hits in the first time, but the former doorkeeper Ibronx, Liam Kelly, was hardly worried about the hit by Lassan Kulibali's head, and the weak hit by this Edjaria.
Although Libya's first goal, which was killed at 34 minutes, may not match the game, no one can deny that they have earned it exclusively for their own work.
But again, Rangers failed to cope with Jacobs' game from a standard position.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher gave up Scott Robinson's sword, who was trying to force all the forces to hand the ball over to Manga for completion.
Gerard began to act on a break when he changed Kulibali to Ryan Kent, and that change almost immediately resulted in the end of the last half-defense to give Morello's passport, but the impressive Kelly slammed out of his line of arrest.
But Livingstone continued to attract visitors to the game they thought of, with the participation of Litgou and Halket, making long transfers.
The Holt team was trying to increase the break-in at the final stages, but McGregor was able to lock Jacobs up before the Litgou gave the transfer from the corner of the field.
Rangers, Glenn Midlton, once again, needed a hit after he met Jacobs, but Thompson refused again.
Almanah: Geiger Accountant Designer
And now the page of our Almanac "Vescresno morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago in Germany, the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Gans" Geiger was born.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity — an invention that eventually led to the creation of a device known as Geiger's counter.
As one of the basics of science, Geiger also became one of the basics of popular culture, and this was reflected in the 1950s by the Colocol Coronado, with the cowboy-like Rome Rogers and Dale Evans, which seemed to be non-scientists, in the main role:
Man says, "What's the matter with this thing?"
Rogers: "This is the Geiger counter, used to detect radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put these glasses on, you can really hear the effects of the atoms generated by the radioactive activity in the minerals."
Evans said, "That's right now."
Hans Gaeger died in 1945, he did not live for just a few days before his 63th birthday.
But his invention, named after his author, is still widely used.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to see the anomalous cells
A new anti-inflammatory vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” the anomalous cells and kill them.
Part of the treatment of the vaccine is to teach the immune system to identify anomalous cells
The method is to remove immune cells from the patient and change them in laboratory conditions.
As a result of this change, cells are able to “see” the type of protein that is characteristic of many types of cancer, and cells must then be returned to 0.
The test vaccine shows promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
In one patient who was introduced to this vaccine and whose immune system has learned to recognize the anomalous cells, ovaries cancer has been in remission for more than 18 months.
The method is to extract immune cells from the patient and change them in laboratory conditions, and then the modified cells can “see” HER2 proteins, which are characteristic of many cancers, then the modified cells are reintroduced to the patient.
Professor J. Berzofski, U.S. National Institute for Cancer Research, Wifsad, Maryland, states: “The results we have received include a very promising vaccine”
Professor Berzofski explains: HER2 “stimulates the growth of several types of cancers, including the cancer of the milk iron, eggs, light and colorectal cancer.
A similar method has been successfully used in the treatment of leukaemia. It has been used to prevent immune cells in patients and their “training” as cancer cells should be used.
Kane West has been defending the Trap in the MAGA trap after its appearance in the SNL.
It's all bad.
Kane West was released at a study during the Saturday concert, which he spoke to the U.S. President Donald Tramp, claiming that he would re-occupied this post in 2020.
Following the performance of his third song, entitled “The State of Sample,” which he performed, he held the title “Delay the Great America” again, the performer spoke against the Democrats and supported the Trump.
“I often talk to white people, and they ask me, ‘How can you support the Trumpet?’
Well, if I were concerned about racism, I would have been away from America for a long time," the executive said.
The SNL channel made a parody show with Matt Damon in the main role in which the Hollywood star ridiculed Brett Kawano's testimony to the Senate's Judicial Committee on Ms. Blessing Ford's statements on sexual harassment.
On TV, they did not show how the crowd was upset by the West, but this video was uploaded to social networks by the comic book Chris Rok.
Now it's not clear if Rock tried to take this step off West.
Also, West complained to the public that he was being ridiculed after the scenes.
"They fell upon me behind the scenes.
They're saying don't go into this trap.
They really fucked up on me!
Washington Examiner quoted him as saying, "And yet they said that my position is not cool."
The West continues, "Do you want to know what's not cool, so that no one can tell you what to do?
Then you will need love."
His comment, at least twice, drew the attention of the audience, the SNL members seemed to be disappointed, and one person said to the publication: “All the studios are silent.”
Westa was recently invited to replace Ariane Grande's singer, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days before that.
Many have succeeded in playing Westom song "I Love It" in Perrier's boutique suit.
West was supported by the head of the TPUSA Candis Turner Conservative Group, who wrote in Twitter: “One of the bravest people: SPASIBO FOR THE REPRESENTATION OF MANY”.
Karen Hunter's lead show wrote in Twitter that West was just "who he is, and it's absolutely remarkable".
“At the same time, I don’t want to support anyone (by buying his music, clothing or otherwise supporting his creativity) who, in my opinion, divides and distributes the ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's a free man.
"So do we," she said.
Prior to the start of the show, the rapper announced in Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he was now “formally known as Kane West”.
He's not the first artist to change his name and go to the feet of Diddy, also known as Paff Daddy, Paffy and Pi Diddy.
His colleague, the rapper Snup Dog, originally had the name Snup Lion, and as an example, of course, it was possible to bring an executive who had recently become a legend, the Prince who had changed his name to a symbol, and then the artist known as Prince (Prince).
Attempts to commit murder because of a felony in the Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man was accused of attempted murder after one of his visitors ended up in a restaurant in the east of Belfast on Friday.
The incident occurred in Balihakamore, as reported by the police.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast World Court on Monday.
The charges will be considered by the Public Prosecutor ' s Office.
Kit Harrington's Presbytery Star attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harrington is known for his role as a fan of John Snow's sword in the brutal medieval fantasy series HBO "Game of thrones".
However, a recent 31-year-old actor has been very critical of the hero-cat stereotype, saying that such characters often inspire young people to think that in order to respect you, they must be cruel.
In his interview with The Sunday Times Culture Kit, he said he believed that something had gone wrong, and asked how to solve the problem of toxic masculinity in the age of #MeToo.
Kit, who recently got married to her colleague in the Prestal Games, Rose Lesley, her rival, admitted that he was “very uneven” to this problem.
“I personally take this question seriously: where did we fail to accept courage?” she asks.
"Why do we teach grown-ups that we have such a problem today?"
China believes that television may be partly responsible for this outbreak of toxic courage because of too much muscle.
The actor continues: “What is born, and what is acquired?
Why do they teach on television and on the streets, which makes young men feel that they should show only one particular side of courage?
I think it's really one of the biggest problems in our time, and how can we change it?
Because today with young people, there's really something wrong.
In the interview, he also acknowledged that he would not participate in any of the "Game of thrones" or "game of thrones" after the series ended next summer, stating that he had “ended with battles and horses”.
Since November, Kit has played a major role in the re-re-re-re-re-re-sponsive "True West" Sam Shepard telling about the film producer and his brother, the kidnapper.
The actor recently announced that he believed that a meeting with Rose was the best final "Games of thrones" for him.
"I met my wife on the show, so he gave me my family and my next life," says the actor.
Rose played the game, the subject of the passion for the character of China John Snow in a fancy series entitled Emma.
The couple noted the wedding in June 2018 in the home of Leslie in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reported a 14 per cent increase in new cases
China announced a 14 per cent increase in the number of people with HIV and AIDS.
According to health representatives, more than 820,000 people in the country are suffering from these diseases.
Only about 40,000 new cases were registered in the second quarter of 2018.
The overwhelming majority of new cases of disease were sexually transmitted, indicating a change in past trends.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in some areas of China as a result of blood transfusions.
However, the number of HIV infections was practically zero, Chinese health representatives said at a conference in the province of Yunnan.
Every year, the number of people with HIV and AIDS in China is increasing by 100,000.
The transmission of HIV by sex is a serious problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexualism was decriminalized in China in 1997, but LGBT discrimination is still widespread.
Studies confirm that, due to the country ' s conservative values, 70-90 per cent of men who have sexual relations with men are ultimately married to women.
In many cases, transmission of diseases is due to insufficient protection of these sexual minorities.
Since 2003, the Government of China has pledged universal access to anti-HIV drugs as part of its efforts to address this problem.
Maxine Waters objected to the leak of information on the guilt of senators of the Republican Party, complaining about “hazardous lie” and “the theory of the conspiracy”
A member of the U.S. Parliament, Maxine Waters, on Saturday, denied the charge that one of her staff posted personal information to three U.S. senators on the Wikipedia page of the legislators.
The Los Angeles Democrat argues that claims were made by “ultra-right” experts and websites.
“A lie, a lie, and a more false lie, ” Waters says in his Twitter.
It is reported that the published information includes the address and number of United States senators, Lindsey Graham, South California, Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, Uta.
This information appeared on the Internet on Thursday and was published by an unknown person at the Capitol Hill during the hearings of the Senate commission on sexual harassment against the candidate in the Supreme Court of Brett Cavano.
The leak took place a while after three senators questioned Kawano.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address, which identifies the source of the communications, was linked to the Waters office, and reported information on the Waters staff, reported Hill.
“This unsubstantiated claim is absolutely false,” Waters assures.
“A member of my staff whose personality, personal information and security were compromised as a result of these frauds was in no way responsible for the disappearance of this information.
This unsubstantiated claim is a complete lie."
The Waters statement was immediately criticised on the Internet, including by the former White House Press Secretary Ari Flasher.
"This is an angry denial," says Flesher.
“This means that the author has a temperature that is not suitable for work at Congress.
When you're accused of something you didn't do, why are you angry?
And you don't have to justify yourself.
And you shouldn't have to dig in the prosecutor's motives either.
We have to stay calm and cool."
Flasher seemed to have compared Waters' reaction to the democratic criticism of Judge Kawano, whose critics accused him of being too angry during Thursday's hearings.
Omar Navarro, a candidate for the Republic of Waters in the interim elections, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
“If that’s true, it’s very important, ” he writes.
In his statement, Waters wrote that her office had warned “the respective authorities and law enforcement authorities about these frauds.
“We will make sure that criminals are found,” she writes, “and that they have legal responsibility for all their actions that can be destructive and dangerous for all and every one of my staff.”
Johnny English is striking again — a weak fad of Rowan Atkinson
Today it has become a tradition to look for Brexit's meanings in any new film in which Britain is somehow depicted; it also refers to the new Parisian spy French "Agent Johnny English", which began in 2003 and continued in 2011 with "Agent Johnny English: Recharge".
Will a self-inflicted picture with the motto “clearly that we are all shit” become a new attempt on national exports?
In any case, the resynthologist Johnny English has received his right to a second time to chaos — his name is clearly inferred from the fact that he is a broad-screen comical creation intended for a non-English cinematographic audience.
Hero, of course, is a stupid secret agent who, despite his amazing claims on the glamour, received a little Clouseau, Mr. Bin's drawings and the portion of this guy, who introduced one single note to the Chariots of Fire melody in London in 2012 at the opening ceremony of the Olympics.
Originally, this character was created on the basis of the identity of the traveler and the fading “international” Atkinson, once played in the oblivion of Barclaycard, in which the hero left a complete mess behind.
In this last edition, JE has one or two pleasant moments.
I really liked the scene when Johnny English approached the helicopter, dressed in middle-aged maturity, and the shovels were lying down on his helmet.
Yes, it demonstrates the gift of Atkinson for the physical performance of comedy scenes, but the humor itself seems rather weak and strangely excessive, especially because such “serious” cinemas, such as “Agent 007” and “Mission’s non-executive”, are now definitely offering comedy as an element.
It's such a feeling that the humor is about children, not adults, and for me, the amazing convulsions of Johnny English are not as inventive and appropriate as those of Atkinson in the movies about Mr. Bine.
The permanent mission is now that Britain is in serious trouble.
Cyber hacker penetrated the top secret British spy network, revealing the identity of all British agents on the ground, to the horror of the daily agent, Kevin Eldon, here, unfortunately, became an episodical role.
This is the last chapel for the Prime Minister, a tense and tense figure already suffering from enormous political impotentness: Emma Thompson is doing everything possible for the Quazi-Terez-May character, but in the script there is nothing to do with it.
Her intelligence advisors told her that since each active spy was compromised, she would have to withdraw someone from retirement.
And here on the stage is the unencumbered Johnny English of his own character, who now works as a school teacher at a point of establishment, but also gives informal lessons in secret operations: there are some good jokes here, since English offers the skills of the Spanish Academy in the style of rock.
English returns to Whitehall for urgent instruction and joins his former unsuccessful friend Buff, who is playing Ben Miller this time.
Buff is now a married man who is under command of a submarine, a role of “weird hockey klutz,” in which Vicki Pepperdin is a little lost.
Thus, Batman and Robin are again in the game because of the terrible mistakes they have made in the secret service of Her Majesty, and they are faced with a beautiful rock woman named Ophelia Bouletov in the performance of Olga Kurilenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is dangerously under the guise of a charismatic technological billionaire, who claims that he can solve British computer problems — the catcher of Jason Walt, who plays Jake Lacey.
English and Buff are starting their odious furry jokes: masked under the officers, they are burning a French restaurant; they create chaos, smuggling themselves on the rock yacht; English is producing a complex anarchy, trying to use the beauty of virtual reality to communicate with the interior of Walt's house.
All these scenes, of course, are a nice and tiring idea, but there's something very childish about it.
Very moderate things.
And, as with other films, Johnny English, I couldn't think of it: can't the British cinema industry give Rowen Atkinson a role that is really relative to his talent?
Laborists deny that they are planning to reduce the British working week to four days for a five-day salary.
The Leborist Party of Jeremy Corbin is planning to consider a radical plan that says that the British will work four days a week, but will be paid in five days.
The party reportedly wants the company's managers to hand over to the rescue workers resulting from the artificial intelligence revolution by providing them with additional outputs.
This would allow staff to enjoy three-day returns for the same salary.
The sources reported that the idea was “registered” on the economic agenda of the party and would help the population to become a part of the workers.
The trade union Congress approved a four-day working week so that workers could benefit from the changing economy.
The high-ranking source of the Libyan Party said The Sunday Times: It is expected that policy revision will be announced by the end of the year.
“This will not happen at the same time, but the four-day working week is our goal, which is consistent with the party's approach to changing economic balance for the benefit of the workers, as well as the overall industrial strategy of the party.”
The Labour Party is not the first to support this idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day working week during its 2017 election campaign.
However, it is not currently approved by the majority of the Liberian party.
The representative of the Liberian Party said: “Four-day working week is not a party policy and is not considered a party”.
Tenevo Chancellor John McDonnell used a labyrinth conference last week to concreteize his vision of the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said that he was determined to break the power of “unsightly directors” and “speculators” of municipal companies.
The plans of the thinner also mean that the current water canal shareholders may not get their share back, as the Lebanese Government may make “countries” on the basis of the alleged errors.
He also confirmed plans to include company directors and fund inclusive Ownership Funds to transfer 10% of the capital of the private sector to the labour sector, which could receive annual dividends of up to 500 pounds.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy are saying "60 minutes", whether the FBI's investigation into Cavano might change their opinion.
The FBI's investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Kawano held a final vote on his appointment as Supreme Judge at least weekly and asked whether the Agency's findings could encourage any of the Republican senators to support Kawano.
In an interview on Sunday, a 60-minute correspondent, Scott Pelley, interviewed Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Grem, whether the FBI can find anything that would make them change their mind.
Kennedy seemed more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"Well, of course," answered Kennedy.
“I went to the meeting, and I said I was talking to Judge Kavano.
So I called him after this happened, and I got this information, and I said, "Did you do it?"
His answer was firm, firm and firm."
But the opinion of Grem in the vote remained inconceivable.
"I am firmly determined about Brett Cavano, and my opinion can only be changed by arguments, by action as compared to dynamite," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but one thing I do know is that Brett firmly denied all of this," he added, referring to Christine Blacie Ford.
“None of those whom she called as witnesses could also confirm these facts.
It's been 36 years.
And I did not see anything new in it.
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and did it do anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, the Global Citizen Festival (the Festival of Citizens of the World) will be held in New York, an annual musical event in which an impressive star from the least impressive mission will take place — the end of poverty in the world.
For the seventh year, as part of the World Citizens' Festival, tens of thousands of people have been reached by the great crowd of the Central Park, but not only in order to benefit from the statements of performers such as Janet Jackson, Cardie B and Sean Mendes, but also in order to describe the current objective of the campaign: eradicating extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Citizens' Festival, which was opened in 2012, is the continuation of a global project to combat poverty, conducted by the international group of human rights defenders who hope to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (if you are not willing to pay for the VIP ticket), you had to participate in voluntary activities or send an e-mail to the world leader, make a phone call or perform any other or other significant actions to help raise awareness of your goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has the 12-year-old World Citizens Festival been in achieving its goal?
Is it an idea for people to be rewarded by a free visit to the concert currently to convince their citizens to call for action, or is it just another case of so-called “clitivism”, when people believe that they are making real changes, signing an online petition or sending messages to Twitter?
Global Citizen organizers say that since 2011, more than 19 million “actions” have been registered at the festival, conducted by its supporters, who pursue many different goals.
It is recalled that the world leaders have promised to allocate more than $37 billion, which should affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group had sounded 390 commitments and announcements made as a result of its action, at least $10 billion of which had already been paid or collected.
The group estimated that the funds had provided direct assistance to almost 649 million people worldwide.
One of the most significant commitments is The Power of Nutrition: a British partnership of investors and implementing professionals committed to “helping children to fully discover their potential”, promised to provide Rwanda $35 million to help put an end to malnutrition in the district, which was done after more than 4700 tweets from Global Citizens participants.
“With the support of the British Government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens, such as you, we can make social injustices with regard to inadequate nutrition of past history,” said Ambassador Power of Nutrition Tracy Ulman during a live concert in London, held in April 2018.
The Group also stated that after more than 5,000 actions were taken to encourage Britain to improve food for mothers and children, the Government announced funding for the Food Force project, which would cover 5 million women and children through activities aimed at improving food.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the festival's website, "Why do you think we can end up with extreme poverty?"
Global citizens say: “This will be a long and difficult path that we will have to meet and fall from time to time.
But as in large movements to fight for civil rights and against apartheid, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Sean Mendes, Cardie B, Jeanelle Mone, are some of the artists who will be attending this year's event in New York, and his leaders will become Deborah Lee Fernness and Hugh Jackman.
United States dollars can use a military fleet to “block” to prevent Russian energy exports: Minister of the Interior
U.S. Minister of Internal Affairs Ryan Zinke said that Washington could “as necessary” resort to the help of its military and maritime fleet to prevent the collapse of Russian energy suppliers in the markets, including in the Middle East.
Zinke argues that the presence of Russia in Syria, especially where it operates at the invitation of a legitimate Government, is a proposal for a study of new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason why they are in the Middle East is that they want to trade energy just as they do in Eastern Europe, in southern Europe," he said.
And, according to the official, there are certain ways and means to address this problem.
“The United States, together with our fleet, has the opportunity to ensure the openness of sea routes and, if necessary, to block their energy from entering the market,” the Minister said.
Zincke called on the participants to organize the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-commercial group that position itself as “a voice of energy consumer” in the United States.
He further compared Washington's approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, noting that they were actually the same.
“The economic strategy of Iran and Russia is more or less effective use and replacement of fuel,” said the Minister, calling Russia “a pony with one truck”, whose economy depends on fossil fuel.
Statements were made that the Trampa Administration had the task of increasing exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia with a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, officials of the Tramp Administration, including the President of the United States themselves, are trying to convince Germany to leave the “inappropriate” project of the North Stream-2 pipeline, which, according to Tramp, made Berlin a “plenty” of Moscow.
In Moscow, it was repeatedly stressed that the North Stream-2 project, worth $11 billion, which should double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, was a purely economic project.
Kremlin argues that Washington's fierce resistance to the project is due to economic reasons and is an example of unfavourable competition.
“I appreciate that we share the view that energy cannot be a pressure tool and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers,” said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak after a meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry, held in September in Moscow.
The position of the United States had led to a negative reaction by Germany, which had confirmed its commitment to the project.
German industrialists in the Federation of German Industry (BDI) called for the United States to stay away from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“When a third State interferes with our energy supply, it creates a serious problem,” said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industry Federation (BDI) after the recent meeting of Chancellor Angela Merkel and President of Russia Vladimir Putin.
Senator from Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren will carefully explore the potential for the president's ballot in 2020
The Senator of Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that he would carefully explore the possibility of joining the President after the interim elections.
At a meeting of the city word in Holioke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was thinking of participating in the pre-election race.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and "start" our broken government, and for that to "top" a woman," says Warren The Hill.
“After 6 November, I will take a close look at the possibility of joining the President.”
Warren thus assessed President Donald Tramp's activities during the meeting: “It is a misdirected area”.
“I’m worried about what Donald Tramp is doing with our democracy,” she said.
Warren is an open critic of both the Trump itself and his candidate for the post of Judge Brett Cavano.
In her Twitter on Friday, Warren wrote: “Federally, we need to investigate the FBI before we start voting.”
However, the poll published on Thursday showed that the majority of Warren's electors do not think it should be balloted in 2020.
According to a survey by the Political Research Centre of the University of Suffolka/Boston Globe, fifty-eight per cent of the "probably" electorate Massachusetts said that the senator should not be bullied.
Thirty-two per cent of respondents, on the contrary, support her plans.
The survey showed that the population was more supportive of former Governor Deval Patrick: 38 per cent supported his possible participation in the elections and 48 per cent opposed.
Other well-known names of democracies that were discussed in connection with the 2020 perspective include former Vice-President Joe Baiden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Byden claims that he will take an official decision by January, reports Associated Press.
Sara Palin told me about the post-traumatic stress disorder of Trak Palin at a meeting with voters of Donald Trampa
The 26 - year - old Trek Palin, who served as an army officer in September, spent a year in Iraq.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night
“My son, who has returned home, now survives the same as other families suffering the effects of PTR and the injuries, and our soldiers return with the injuries,” she said at a meeting with Donald Trampo in Tals, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest “Bellam” and said about his son and other veterans of war, “They are coming back to others who are stoned, wondering whether their companions, soldiers, pilots and any other soldier they have brought back from their country are being treated with the same respect.”
Trak Pailin was arrested on Monday in Vasil, Alaska, and charged with family violence against women in the situation of violence and the storage of arms in the state of alcohol abuse, according to Dan Bennett, a representative of the Vasila Police Department.
18 States, Colombia, support the challenges of a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Colombia support the legal challenge of a new U.S. policy, which prohibits the provision of asylum to refugees or domestic violence.
According to NBC News, representatives of 18 states and districts submitted an analytical note to Washington on Friday to the court's consultant on the support of the asylum-seeker who was opposed to politics.
The full name of the complainant in the request for Grace v. Sessions, submitted by the American Union of Civil Liberties in August against federal policy, is not disclosed.
The woman claims that her civil husband, “and his sons in the criminal group, have been subjected to ill-treatment, but on 20 July, U.S. officials have denied her request for asylum.
She was detained in Texas.
State lawyers supporting Grace say that El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala are making a large number of applications for asylum in the United States, such as countries facing widespread problems with criminal groups and domestic violence.
The new United States policy on asylum has repealed the decision taken by the Immigration Appeals Council in 2014, which has allowed immigrants without documents to be saved from domestic violence to apply for asylum.
The Attorney-General of the District of Colombia, Carl Rasin, stated in his statement on Friday that the new policy “neglects decades of application of State, federal and international law”.
“Federal law requires that all asylum applications be examined on the basis of specific facts and circumstances of the request, and that prohibition violates this principle,” the judge advises.
Lawyers also claim that the policies prohibiting the entry of immigrants are damaging the US economy, stressing that this category of citizens is more likely to become entrepreneurs and “provides the necessary labour force”.
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sashns ordered immigration judges to no longer provide asylum for victims of domestic or gang violence.
“A refuge will be provided to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or belonging to a particular social group or political convictions”, Sashns said in his statement of 11 June.
This tool has never been designed to solve absolutely all the problems, even the most serious people are facing every day in the world.
Desperate efforts to save people in Pala: Number of deaths doubled in search of survivors
The situation was becoming increasingly difficult for survivors.
“It’s very difficult now,” says 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusum, comforting her sick child at the evacuation centre of the destroyed city of Palu.
“Every minute, prompt assistance will bring the wounded.
Pure water in the Great Deplorable."
People return to their destroyed homes, dig in wet things, and try to save everything they can find.
Hundreds of people have been injured, and hospitals affected by an earthquake of 7.5 are overloaded.
Some of the wounded, including Dvi Harris, who had a vertebral fracture and a shoulder, were inhaled near the army hospital in Pala, where patients were treated in open air, because they had to leave the room because of the constant strong thrusts.
He was crying, recalling how a severe earthquake destroyed the hotel number on the fifth floor, which he had recorded with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time for salvation.
I think I was pushed into the wall, ” says Harris Associated Press, explaining that his family had come to the city to get married.
“I heard my wife yell and ask for help, and then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and our baby.
I hope they are saved, and now they are all right."
US Ambassador accuses China of “accused” by “propagandist advertising”
A week later, after one of the official Chinese newspapers published a four-page ad in a daily U.S. newspaper, describing the mutual benefit of US and China, a US envoy in China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread the propaganda.
The President of the United States, Donald Tramp, last Wednesday, referred to a pay supplement to Des Moines Register China Daily, the largest commercial newspaper edition of the state of Iowa, in an attempt to interfere with the U.S. Congress, which will take place on 6 November.
The Tramp's accusation that Beijing is attempting to interfere with the U.S. elections is a confirmation of the fact that US officials have reported to Reuters: a new phase is taking place in Washington's increasing pressure campaign on China.
While it is a rule for foreign Governments to place a commercial to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in a state of escalation of trade wars, thus balancing tariffs for imports from their countries.
China ' s responsible tariffs at the beginning of the trade war were intended to defeat exporters in states such as Iowa, which supported the Republican Tramp Party, by Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, US Ambassador to China and former long-term governor Iova, a major exporter of agricultural products in China, claims that Beijing has damaged US workers, farmers and businesses.
China, writes Branstad in a post published in the Awakening magazine Des Moines Register, “now doubles this plague by placing propaganda in our own free press. ”
“In spreading its propaganda, the Government of China enjoys the precious heart of our American tradition of freedom of speech and free press, paying and posting advertising in Des Moines Register,” says Branstad.
“Even in the newspaper kiosks here, on the streets of Beijing, you will hardly hear any different voices and not see the true diversity of views that Chinese people could learn about China’s alarming economic policy, because local media are under strict control of the Communist Party of China,” he writes.
He also added that one of China's most well-known newspapers was “derogated” from the proposal to publish his article, although he did not bring the exact name of the publication.
Analysts warn: the Kawano population has distanced women voters from the mid-term
Many high-ranking Republicans prefer to remain on the side and defend the candidacy of the Supreme Judge Brett Kawano, despite several statements of sexual violence. Analysts warn that there is a negative reaction, especially by women, which may affect future interim elections.
Emotions around the situation have become extreme, and most Republicans have formally declared that they want to continue to vote.
It cannot be returned to such things, ” writes Grant Rier, professor of politics at Maxwell School at the University of Syracuse, in his article on Saturday.
Rier doubted that Senator Jeff Fleeck (R-Arizona)'s attempts to investigate the FBI at the last minute would be sufficient to calm the angry voters.
"Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday; they will not forget about it tomorrow or November," said Karin Jean-Pier, Senior Adviser and National Representative of the Progressive Group MoveOn Washington, D.C.
On Friday morning, the protesters scandalized November ahead! On the contrary, the Senate, when the Republicans in charge of the Judicial Committee decided to apply for Kawano, despite the testimony of Dr. Kristin Blacie Ford, Mic reported.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will go beyond the framework,” said a non-partisan politician named Stu Rottenberg on the news site.
“People say that the situation has come so far enough, and that is true.
But everything can get worse, especially with regard to women voters in the suburbs and young voters, from 18 to 29 years of age, who, although they do not like the president, often do not vote.”
Even before Ford publicly protested against the candidate as a high-level judge accused him of sexual harassment, analysts suggested that if Republicans confirm the move, this step could lead to a response.
“It’s already a mess for the Republican Party,” said Michael Styl, former president of the Republican National Committee last week, as NBC News reports.
“This is not only about voting in a committee or final vote, or whether the Kawano is sitting on the scale of the defendants, but also about how the Republicans deal with how they are concerned with it,” says Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps to choose democracies, a news channel.
However, Americans seem to have split up a few on the question of who to believe — Ford or Cavana — and to hear more about the latter.
A new survey of YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents believe in Ford's findings, while 35 percent said they believe in Kawano exactly or probably.
In addition, 38 per cent believe that Kawano lied more or less during his testimony, while only 30 per cent said the same about Ford.
According to Fleke F.B.R., the charges for Ford are currently being investigated, as well as at least another prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Last week, Ford swore in the Senate Legal Committee that Kawano, being in a state of depression, attacked her when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Judge showed her his genitals at a party during his education at the Yel University in 1980s.
The inventor of the World Pouch plans to launch a new Internet for Google and Facebook
Team Berners-Li, the inventor of the World Cup, launches a startup that claims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the Technology Legend, Inrupt, is a company based on an open Berners-Lee Solid platform.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and how to give people access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company Berners-Li, the goal of Inrupt was to gain “world domination”.
“We have to do this now,” he says about his starting stage.
“This is a historic moment”.
The annex uses Solid technology that allows people to create their own “personal data storage” or POD.
It may include lists of contacts, cases, calendar, music library and other personal and professional data tools.
The application works on the same principle as Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify – all can be used in one browser and at the same time.
The uniqueness of the personal data repository is that it is fully managed by a user who can obtain access to any necessary information.
The company calls this principle “a personal expansion of rights and opportunities through data”.
According to the Director-General of John Bruce, the idea of Inrupt is that the company has provided resources, processes and relevant skills to make Solid available to everyone.
Currently, the company includes Berners-Li, Bruce, the security platform purchased by IBM, several state developers with whom the project is being contracted, and the community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Li said that he and his team did not negotiate with Facebook and Google on whether his company needed to make radical changes, which would change all their business models completely at once.
“We do not ask leave of them.”
In his post to the Media on Saturday, Berners-Li wrote that “the Inrupt mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of a new solid network”.
In 1994, Berners-Li converted the Internet, creating a World Wide Web consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, the vote of Berners-Li sounded quite influential in the debate on net neutrality.
Even starting Inrupt, Berners-Li will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Internet Fund and the Open Data Institute.
“I am incredibly optimistic about this next era of the Internet,” says Berners-Li.
Bernard Vann: Church servant rewarded by the Victorian Cross during World War I
In the history of the Anglican Church, only one warrior priest was awarded Victoria's cross during World War I, and this event was observed in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann was awarded this award on 29 September 1918 for his participation in the attack on Belgium and Løukur.
Unfortunately, he was killed by a sniper four days later, so I never knew that he had received the highest British military award.
The memorial in honor of this event was presented to him by his two grandsons at the parade in Rusden, Nortgemptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "significantly," that the monument was opened 100 years later after his grandfather received the prize.
According to the London newspaper of 29 September 1918, Colonel Vann carried out his battalion through the San Canton channel “in a very dense fog and under a strong fire of field weapons and bullets”.
Later, he threw himself on the fire line and, with the “greatest difficulty,” led the group forward, and then with one hand he threw the field gun, and three soldiers of the unit.
Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, more than a month before the end of the war.
72-year-old son of a hero Michael Vann said that “he could hardly do the same heroicly, but that calms down”.
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also imposed a wave at the end of the parade led by the Imperial Youth Orchestra, Berntwood.
Michael Vann said that “it is a great honor for him to participate in the parade” and added that “the strength of a real hero is confirmed by the support that will be given to many people”.
MMA worshipers didn't sleep all night to see Bellator 206, but instead showed them the pig Peppu
Imagine that you didn't sleep all night to see the full Bellator 206, but they didn't let you see the main event.
The San Jose table contained 13 battles, including six main programme battles, which were broadcast all night in the direct air at 5 UK television channels.
At 6 o'clock in the morning, when Gegard Musasi and Rory McDonald prepared for the meeting, the British patients were shocked, seeing on the screens of "Peppa Swinku".
Some patients were not impressed, for they did not sleep until morning to see the battle.
One of Twitter’s worshipers called this change of message to a child’s multifilm “some painful joke”.
“A public decision was made that this container was inappropriate for 6 hours tomorrow, so they had to switch to children’s programmes,” said Dave Schwarz, Senior Vice President Bellator on marketing and communications, when asked why it happened.
"Yes, "Swinka Peppa."
The president of Bellator Scott Kocker said that they were planning to make a schedule so that future battles could also be seen by visitors from Britain.
"As for the re-show, I think we will be able to resolve this issue," Koker said.
"But there will be a resurrection, six o'clock tomorrow, and we will not be able to resolve this matter until the Day of Resurrection, and it will be for them on Monday.
But we're going to make the most of it.
Believe that when the message was changed, the text message came to light, and all of them were far from friendly.
We tried to solve this problem right away, we thought it was some kind of technical failure.
No, it was a matter of public importance.
I promise that this will not happen next time.
We're going to reduce the number of battles to five instead of six, as we usually do, and for fans we're trying to increase that number, but we've got a change.
Yeah, well done."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daily experienced a feeling of undervalue due to his sexual orientation
The Olympic daver Tom Dale says he's growing, feeling worse because of his sexuality, but that's what gave him the motivation to be successful.
The 24-year-old sportsman said he didn't realize that “not all are like him” until he went to high school.
Speaking in the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs, said Lauren Lavern, he said he spoke about the rights of gays to give another “hope”.
He also said that the victory in the Olympics had become less concerned with him after he had a child.
The permanent leader of Kirsty Yang's multi-year show, due to his illness, took a few months' leave.
Daley, who served as the main guest in Lavern, said that he felt “nothing more important than any of his peers” because his sexual orientation was considered unacceptable for society, both for boys and girls.
He says, “These feelings of worthlessness and incompatibility have been real, but they have given me strength, and I have been able to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was “something” so that not all would be disappointed when they finally learned about his sexual orientation.
A double bronze Olympic medalist became a known LGBT activist and in his speech at the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year called on countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he had expressed his opinion because he was lucky that he could live an open life without consequences and wanted to give another “hope”.
A three-time world champion said that the feelings of the man, US director Dustin Lans Black, with whom he met in 2013, “remained in his favor”.
Last year, Dale married Oscar, who was 20 years older than him, but claimed that the difference in age was never a problem.
"If everything is going on in your life at such young age," he went to his first Olympics at 14 years of age, and his father died three years of cancer, "it's hard to find a rival who would have the same heartily opposite life experience.
The couple became parents in June, they had a son named Robert Ray Black-Daily, and Dale said that “all his peace” had changed.
"If you asked me last year, it would be all about "I need to win a gold medal," says a sportsman.
"But you know, there's something more important than gold Olympic medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011, at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Daley told me that his father did not want to live by what he was dying, and one of his last requests was that they were tickets to the first series of London 2012 contests.
"I could not say to him, 'Dad, you will not be near, and you will not be able to sit there in the first row,' says Daley.
"I held him by the hand when he stopped breathing, and only when he actually stopped breathing did I finally realize that he was not invincible," said the sportsman.
The following year, Dale participated in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze.
“I just knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life — to present before a crowd of fellows in the Olympics, it wasn’t a better feeling,” he said.
It also inspired him to choose the first favorite song — Proud by Heather Small — that helped him prepare for the Olympics and still likes it.
Desert Island Discs, BBC Radio 4, Sunday, 11:15 in English summer time.
Mikkelson, not in shape, spent this Saturday on a rock by Kubka Ryder
American Phil Michaelson will record on Sunday, played his 47th Cup Rider match, but he will have to raise his form to avoid an unpleasant wave.
Michaelson, who played at the pool on record 12th time, was sent by Captain Jim Furick on a rock Saturday for four swords and fours.
Instead of being at the centre of events, as was often the case in the United States, a five-time major winner divided his day between watching the game and working over his own field game in hopes of correcting his concerns.
I have never had the most direct hit, even at the peak of my career, a 48-year-old sportsman is not the ideal candidate for the Le Golf National race, where the long Raf usually punishs for the inaccurate hits.
And if the course itself is not scary enough, Mikkelson will meet with the British Open Francesco Molinari, who joined the new Tommy Flitwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans who lost four points in the 12 single match make a big start, Mikelson's match could be decisive.
Ferick expressed confidence in his partner, although he could still say so.
"He completely assumed the role of him today, caught me in the back, hugged me and said he would be ready tomorrow," said Ferik.
"He's pretty confident of himself.
He's going to the Hall of Glory, and he's done so much for these teams both last week and this week.
I probably didn't think he was playing two matches.
I was hoping for more, but that's what it was, and that's how we decided to go.
He wants to be there with everyone."
On Sunday, Mikelson will win the record of Nick Foldo's number of matchmates in Kubka Ryder.
This may mark the end of a career in Kubque Ryder, which never matched the heights of his individual record.
Mikkelson has 18 wins, 20 defeats, and seven things, although Ferik said his presence has brought little benefit to the team.
“He’s fun, sarcastic, passionate, he likes to teach people, and he’s a great guy who’s interested in him,” he explained.
“I think that this week young games have been fun with him, and that was interesting to see.
His game is much more than just a game.”
Captain of the European team Thomas Bjorn knows that a great advantage can soon disappear
Thomas Björn, the captain of the European team, knows, in his experience, that a significant leadership in the single level in Kubque Ryder can easily turn into an unfavourable side.
Datchanin debuted in a match in 1997 in Valderram, where a team led by Northern Ballesteros had a five-point advantage over the Americans, but overcame the finish line only to hear ahead with the smallest difference, won an account of 141⁄2-1311⁄2.
“You keep reminding yourselves that we had a great advantage in Valderham; we had a great advantage in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderham, where we won, but just now,” said Bjorn, printed in the photo, after a review of the 2018 Class, won the Le Golf National with an account of 5-3 on Friday and yesterday, as a result of the 10-6.
So history will prove to me and the whole team that it's not over yet.
You'll be on your own tomorrow.
Go and do the right thing.
Until there are no points on the table – nothing is finished yet.
We have a goal, and it's a chance to win the trophy, and that's what we need to focus on.
I spoke unconventionally, focusing on the 12 games of our team, but we also know so well that we are against what we are against – against the greatest games of the world.”
It was a pleasure to see his games on a golf course, but Bjorn said, "I would never have been more than that.
We'll have another test tomorrow.
Individual statements are starting tomorrow, and this is a different matter.
Always nice to be with your partner when things go well, but when you're alone, you experience all your professional golfer's strength.
That is the idea that players should be forced to put themselves in full tomorrow.
Now the partner stays behind, and he must also make all his efforts.”
Unlike Bjorn, his rival, Jim Farik, believes that his individual games would be better than his partners, with the exception of Jordan Spitt and Justin Thomas, who took three of the four.
Féric himself has gone through all of this in the last few days, becoming part of the victory team in Brooklyn before finally losing when Europe has celebrated the "Miracle in Medina".
“I remember every damn word about it,” he said in response to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, captain of the 1999 game, was involved before the last day.
"We have 12 important fighters tomorrow, but you would like to finish it as soon as possible in Brooklyn as in Medina.
When the initiative moves one side, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle of the match.
We have properly designed our plan for the game and designed the guys as we thought was right, do you understand? Tomorrow we will try to create a miracle.”
Thomas was assigned to try to lead the resistance by meeting with Rory Makilro at the top of the match with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Flitwood and Ayan Polter, as well as other European players from the top of the tournament table.
“I have selected such a group of guys, and in this way, because I believe that they will overcome all possible shortcomings,” Bjorn said, commenting on his choice of individual players.
Introduction of the new German military ship to the operation
The new cargo of the German fleet had to be put into operation in 2014 to replace the old warships of the Cold War, but this would not happen at least in the following year due to incorrect systems and price growth, local media reported.
The launch of the "Rainland-Pfalc", the main ship is completely new to the Baden-Württemberg class, now delayed until the first half of 2019, reports Die Zeit with reference to the military representative.
The vessel was to join the fleet in 2014, but the problems that arose after delivery made the fate of the ambitious project difficult.
Four Baden-Württemberg ships, ordered by the Navy fleet in 2007, will be replaced by the Bremen class of seniors.
They are known to have a powerful rifle, a number of zinetic and anti-corrobial missiles, as well as some “steel” technologies, such as reduced radiolocation, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer periods of service, which should allow the deployment of the new brakes for up to two years away from domestic ports.
However, the continued deployment of the entry into service means that the most modern warships, which they say, allow Germany to distribute its power abroad, will already be old by the time they enter the armed forces, notes Die Zeit.
The F125 crash fell into the headlines last year, when the German naval fleet officially refused entry into service of the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss firm in Hamburg.
This was the first time the fleet returned to the shipowner after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but the German media referred to a number of critical “programme and machine defects” that made the warship useless in the use of combat.
The lack of software was particularly critical, as the Baden-Württemberg court would be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors — only half of the working force on the old Bremen frigates.
In addition, it was found that the ship was too difficult to reduce its productivity and limit WFP ' s ability to introduce future updates.
It is estimated that the 7000 tonnes of Rainland-Pfalz twice heavy ships of a similar class used by the Germans in the Second World War.
In addition to wrong equipment, the cost of the whole project, including team training, is also a problem.
It is said that it has reached an estimated 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion) compared to the original 2.2 billion euros.
The problems of the detention of the fleet of the new frigates have become particularly important in the light of recent warnings of the reduction of the military and maritime power of Germany.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the Committee on the Defence of the German Parliament, acknowledged that the military and maritime forces actually “ends the stockpiles of deployment-enabled ships”.
The officer said that the problem over time had become acute, because the old ships had been removed from operation, but their courts had not been granted a replacement.
He's sworn that none of the Baden-Württemberg frigates could have been armed with a fleet.
National Trust Listens to the Secret Life of Flying Mouses
A new study carried out in one of Scotland's hot spots has the task of showing how flyers use the landscape in search of food.
It should be hoped that the data received would allow the behaviour of unique milking wings to be re-examined and would assist in further conservation activities.
The study organized by the National Fund of Scotland will study common netopers, soprano netopers, as well as brown long-term flyers and Dobanton Nights, inhabitants of Inverewe Gardens, West Ross.
Special registrants will be established at some points around the site to track the flying mice throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile local surveys using hand detectors.
The expert sound analysis of all the records will determine the frequency of the screams as well as the types of activities for which the different groups of these animals are responsible.
A map of the environment will then be prepared and a report will be prepared to provide a detailed picture of their landscape behaviour.
Rob Duar, NTS Nature Conservation Adviser, hopes that these results will show what habitats are most important for flying mice and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to identify the main directions for the management of the habitat environment, such as the formation of meadows, as well as the ways to maintain forest massages, optimal for flying mice and other related species.
The populations of flying mice in Scotland and throughout Britain have declined significantly over the last century.
They are threatened by disappearances due to construction and development work that affect their habitat and the loss of the habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting facilities may pose a risk, as well as a glue band for flies, chemical processing of building materials and household shells.
In fact, the flyers are not blind.
However, their night habits are such that their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to winning.
They use complex eco-location techniques to accurately identify obstacles to flight.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 significant gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, is very serious about the population of flying mice.
Ten experts have been trained in the organization, who carry out regular surveys, check-outs, and sometimes rescue work.
The organization has even created the first and only reservation in Scotland of the three-wing mice in the area of Damfris and Galloue, where eight of the ten Scottish flying mice live.
David Thompson, the real estate manager, said that the name was an ideal territory for them.
"Here, in Thrave, a great place for flying mice," he says.
“There are old buildings, many old trees and all the elements of a good habitat.
But many flying mice remain unknown, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us to understand better what they need for a good existence.”
He recalled the importance of checking the availability of fly mice prior to the provision of technical services within private authorities, as the unintentional destruction of one nest could lead to the death of up to 400 individuals and young persons, and perhaps even to the destruction of the entire local population.
Flying mice are protected by law, their destruction, injury or destruction of their habitats is illegal.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish officer of the Flying Mouse Conservation Fund, calls on the public to help.
She said, “We have yet to know about our flying mice, and we do not know how many of them live.”
Ronaldo denies charges of rape, and his lawyers are going to court in German journal
Cristian Ronaldo denied the charges brought against him in rape, calling them "faicious news", and claiming that people simply want to "pursue", using his name.
His lawyers are going to be brought to court in the German news magazine Spigel, which issued an indictment against the footballist.
Forvard Portugal and Juventus were accused of rapeing an American named Catherine Majorga, who was probably in Las Vegas's guest room in 2009.
He allegedly paid her $375 000 to talk about the incident, reported in Spigel on Friday.
In a video in Instagram, where 142 million signatories were involved in football, a few hours after the charges were filed, the 33-year-old Ronald referred to this information as “faicious news”.
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they told today is all fake news, says a five-time winner of Ballon d'Or on camera.
"They just want to pry using my name.
It's okay.
They want to be famous, my name comes out, but it's just part of their work.
I'm a happy man, and I've got a great one," adds a sportsman with a smile.
Ronald's lawyers are willing to file charges against Spiel for “inadmissible confidentiality suspicions”, according to Reuters.
Advocate Christian Shertz stated that the game was intended to seek compensation for “moral damage to the extent appropriate to the seriousness of the legal breach, which is likely to be one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years”.
It is claimed that the alleged incident occurred in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino Hotel in Las Vegas.
Upon meeting at the night club, Ronald and Majorga reportedly returned to the playroom, where he allegedly raped it in an annal form, according to documents submitted to the Clark District Court in Nevada.
Majorga claims that after the alleged Ronald accident, he fell on her knees and told her that he was “99 per cent of a good guy, but worsened by one percent”.
The papers claimed that Ronald had confirmed that the couple had been engaged in sex, but that was by mutual agreement.
Majorga also claims that she has appealed to the police and that her injuries have been photographed in the hospital, but later she agreed to an extrajudicial solution because she felt “fear of revenge” and feared “public humiliation”.
The 34-year-old woman said that she was now trying to change her place of residence, as she continued to experience the painful feelings caused by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was going to join Real Madrid from Manchester United during the alleged attack, but this summer he moved to Italian giants Yve to a deal of 100 million euros.
Brexit: United Kingdom “I am sorry about autoproducers who have been lost forever”
The Minister of Business and Enterprise, Greg Clarke, said that Britain would “feel sorry for this forever” if Brexit lost its world-leading car production status.
He also commented that Toyota UK reported to the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at its factory in Bernston, not far from Derby.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese automaker stated that the effects of delays at the border in the absence of a Brexit transaction could lead to the loss of jobs.
The Toyota Auris and Avensis plant in Bernaston produced almost 150,000 cars last year, 90 per cent of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"I believe that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production at our plant will be stopped," said Marvin Cook, managing director of Toyota in Bernaston.
Other car manufacturers in Britain expressed concerns about leaving the EU without an international trade agreement, including on Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, claims that it will close the Mini factory in Oxford within a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are that, in the absence of a Brexit transaction, the supply chain would be at high risk, according to the autoproducer.
The Toyota production line is launched “in due course”, and the details for the cars produced for the order are provided by UK and EU suppliers every 37 minutes.
If, on 29 March, Britain leaves the EU without a deal, there may be delays on the border, which, according to industry, may lead to delays and delays.
According to the company, Toyota will not be able to keep the stocks at its factory in Derbisher for a longer period of one day, and therefore production will be stopped.
Mr. Clarke said that Teresa May's plan, which was announced in Checkers, on future relations with the EU, "was precisely calibrated to avoid these border checks".
"We need a deal: we want to conclude a better agreement that will allow, I repeat, not only to succeed at present, but also to take advantage of this opportunity in the future," he told BBC Radio 4 "Today".
“Not only Toyota, but also other producers claim that we must be able to continue the successful supply chains.”
Toyota was unable to clarify the time limit for the production to be stopped, but in the longer term, it warned that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and, ultimately, reduce jobs.
Peter Covallaris, who worked in Bernaston for 24 years and was head of the trade union, said that the concerns of members of the organization grew: “By my experience, if we lose these jobs, we will no longer be able to return them”.
The representative of the Government said, “We have developed a precise and reliable plan for our future relations with the EU”.
The Trampa meeting with Rosenstein can be postponed again, according to information from the White House
The responsible meeting of Donald Tramp with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “transmitted to another week”, as the fight for Brett Kawano's candidacy for the Supreme Judge continues, the White House declared on Sunday.
Rosenstein is curing the work of Special Adviser Robert Muller, who is investigating Russia's involvement in the election, the relationship between Trampa and Russia's assistants and the potential obstacles to justice by the President.
If the Tromp of the Deputy Prosecutor-General was released, thereby threatening the independence of Muller, the mass of suspicions in Washington for months had been raised.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the use of the session to record talks with Trampo and the President's impact on the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein objected to this information.
However, on Monday, he went to the White House to resign as soon as possible.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced on Thursday, which was then in the United Nations in New York.
Tramp said he would “do not” to release Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid clashing with the Senate judicial committee, in which Kawano and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Kristina Blacie Ford gave testimony.
On Friday, Tramp ordered a weekly investigation into the complaints of the FBI in Kavano, which further held a full vote in the Senate.
Press Secretary Trampa, Sarah Sanders, spoke at Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “The date of this meeting has not yet been appointed, it may be this week, and it may be postponed for another week, taking into account all other developments in the Supreme Court.”
But let's see, and I always prefer to keep the press in the course."
Some journalists object to this claim: Sanders did not give a briefing at the White House since 10 September.
Chief Chris Walles was interested in why.
Sanders said that the lack of briefings was not called “advised to the community” by television reporters, although she added, “I will not deny that they are playing in the audience”.
It proposed to increase the number of direct contacts between Trump and the press.
“The President holds more meetings in response to journalists’ questions than any other president before him,” she added, but she did not bring the exact figures, “We have these figures.”
Sanders said that the briefings would continue, but “if the press has the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly, it is much better than to talk to me.”
We're trying to do this as often as possible, and you know how many meetings we've had in the last few weeks, and if you can talk directly to the President of the United States, it's a worthy exchange of press briefings."
The tramp regularly responds to questions from the White House, participating in public meetings or press conferences with high-level individuals.
The conference exclusively for the press is a rare one.
The President ' s strange conduct in front of the assembled journalists this week in New York may be the answer to why.
The Minister of Health addressed EU workers in Scotland with a letter on concerns about Brexit
The Minister of Health has asked EU staff working in Scotland's GSC to express their gratitude for the country's name and wish them to remain in their post after Brexit.
Gin Freeman, MSP, addressed staff less than six months before Britain left the EU.
The Government of Scotland has already undertaken to cover the cost of making EU citizens' status statements in its public services.
In her letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: “The negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on exit continued during the summer, and this autumn a decision should be reached.
However, the British Government is also strengthening the preparation for a possible scenario with no transaction.
I know it must be a very alarming time for all of you.
That is why I would like to stress once again how much I appreciate the contribution of each staff member, regardless of his nationality.
EU-wide colleagues and beyond will bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the health service and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is, of course, your home, and we really want you to stay here."
Cristian Abercromby underwent an emergency surgery with regard to head injury
Michael A. from Tennessee reported that the Tennessee State Tigers semi-defencer, Kristian Abercromby, had undergone an emergency operation, having suffered head injury on Saturday after defeating 31-27 in a match with Vanderbill Kommodores.
The chief coach of Tennessee Rod Reed told reporters that the trauma had been received shortly before the break.
“He came to the sideline and just walked out there,” said Reid.
Trainers and medical personnel gave Abercromby oxygen on the sideline before placing it on the bearings and taking it to medical examination.
The official representative of Tennessee told Chris Harris from WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercromby had performed an operation at the Vanderbillt Medical Center.
Harris added that “until there are details about the type/degree of the trauma”, and Tennessee is trying to figure out when the trauma occurred.
For Abercromby, only on the second course, it was the first season in Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
On Saturday, before the game was released, he successfully captured five balls, which amounted to 18 balls per season.
Foreign buyers will pay a higher herb collection when purchasing real estate in the United Kingdom.
In line with the new Tori plans, foreign buyers will be charged with higher herbage in the purchase of real estate in the United Kingdom, and additional money will be used to assist homeless people.
This step shows no results of Corbin's attempts to attract young voters
The increased herb collection will be taken from those who do not pay taxes in Britain
The Treasury expects it to raise up to 120 million pounds per year for homeless people
Foreign buyers will be charged with a higher charge of herbage in the purchase of real estate in the United Kingdom, and additional money will be used to help homeless people, which will be announced today by Teresa May.
This step has no effect on Corbin's efforts to attract young voters, who promise to make housing more accessible and to increase the income of citizens.
The increase in herb collection will be taken from non-taxable individuals and firms in the United Kingdom, and the additional funds thus provided should encourage the Government ' s efforts to assist homeless citizens.
The addition to the existing herbage collection, including an increase of up to three per cent, introduced two years ago for the acquisition of secondary and rental housing.
The treasury expects that this step will allow up to 120 million pounds per year.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of the new London real estate facilities are purchased by non-British residents, which leads to price increases and makes it difficult for buyers who purchase their first apartment to improve their housing conditions subsequently.
Many of the country's elite areas, especially in the capital, have become “primarily cities” because of a large number of foreign buyers who, by buying housing here, spend most of their time outside the country.
A new policy was developed a few weeks later after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in herb collection to help more young people acquire their first home.
He accused large construction firms of undermining real estate prices by purchasing land, but not actually using them, and urged Ms. May to refuse the quota for accessible housing to correct the “prudential housing situation” in Britain.
Mr. Corbin announced a number of proposed positive housing reforms that would include rental control and termination of unwarranted eviction.
He would also like to give local authorities more authority to build new homes.
Ms. May said: “Last year, I said that I had dedicated my prime minister to the British dream of making life better with every new generation.
This includes solving problems in our housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build life here.
However, it is unfair that for non-British citizens as well as for foreign companies, the acquisition of real estate is as accessible as for those working in the UK.
For too many people, the dream of acquiring their own home became too far away, and the danger for some to appear on the street was too real.
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to run Scotland"
Boss Sunderland Jack Ross says that his “final goal” is to become a certain stage manager of Scotland.
The 42-year-old Scottish enjoys the rebirth of the North-East Club, which is currently taking third place in the first league, separating from the three-point championship.
This summer he moved to the Stadium of Light after St. Mirren returned to the Scottish Prime Minister in the past season.
“I wanted to fight for my country as a game.
I got the B, and everything," Ross Sportssound BBC Scotland said.
"But I grew up looking at my father at Scotland in Hampden as a child, and that always attracted me.
However, this is only possible if I can become a successful club manager.”
The predecessors of Ross, Sunderland's managers were also Dick Advokaat, David Moies, Sam Allardis, Martin O'Neil, Roy Kin, Gus Poet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former manager Alloa Athletic said that he had not experienced such authority names in such large clubs before rejecting Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“For me, success at this point will depend on whether I can get this club back to Prime Minister.
According to its structure and possibilities, this club is undoubtedly the Prime Minister,” the coach said.
“Bringing him there is an easy task, but I will consider what I have done, only if I can get the club back.”
Ross has worked for only three years as a manager, first as an assistant manager in Dumbarton, then for 15 months at the heart of the coach.
Then he helped Alloa get up from the third level and in the next season he took St. Mirren out of the lower positions in the champions.
Ross claims that he feels more comfortable today than ever in his career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
“It was probably the current crossroads,” he recalls his responsible work in Alloa.
“I sincerely believed that management was more suitable than a game.
That sounds strange because I did my best, worked hard on this job, and achieved some success.
But the game is more complicated.
There's a lot of things that need to be done every week.
I still have a lot of pressure on my job, but I feel good at being a manager.
I always wanted to lead, and now, by doing so, I feel most comfortable as a fish in the water for the rest of my adult life."
You can listen to a full interview at Sportssound on Sunday, September 30th, on Scotland's radio from 12:00 to 13:00 in English summer time.
According to the survey, 17:30 — the ideal time for beer pins
The summer heat has increased the sales of British pubs, but it has reduced the sales of restaurants.
According to statistics, sales in pubs and bars in July increased by 2.7 per cent, and restaurants fell by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin of the CGA Business Consulting Company, which received this statistics, says: “The continued solar activity, and longer than expected, England’s participation in the World Championship, means that July continued the trend of the previous month, June, when sales in pubs increased by 2.8 per cent, and in restaurants, on the other hand, declined substantially.”
The fall in income in restaurant trade by 1.8 per cent was also continued in July.
The pubs and bars selling alcohol have shown much higher results than in restaurants.
The pubs that sell only food also suffered from the heat of the sun, even though they were not as strong as restaurants.
The feeling is that people only want to jump out of the street to miss a drink.
The sales of drinks in pubs and bars increased by 6.6% per month, and food by 3%."
Paul Newman, an analyst at RSM in the field of leisure and hospitality, says: “These results continue to be the trend we have observed since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of major social or sporting activities remain critical when it comes to sales on the loss market.
It is not surprising that restaurant networks continue to experience difficulties, as the decrease in sales by 4.8 per cent per annum will be particularly painful due to the ongoing price pressure.
The long summer has proved to be as never before for the operators working with the food, and the fact that August, bringing more moderate temperatures, will provide such a necessary transition."
The overall increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including reopened, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the slowdown in branding.
Sectoral sales monitoring Coffer Peach Tracker for the British pub, bar and restaurant sector collects and analyzes the productivity of 47 networks with a combined turnover of over 9 billion pounds and is a recognized industry benchmark.
Every fifth child has secret accounts on social networks he hides from his parents
According to the survey, every fifth child — some 11 years of age — has secret accounts on social networks that he hides from parents and teachers.
The survey of 20,000 high school students revealed the growth of the Facebook Insta pages
This news has raised concerns about sexual content
Twenty percent of students say they have a “basic” account that parents know about
However, each fifth child — some of them only 11 years of age — creates accounts that he or she hides from adults.
The survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid increase in the number of fake “insti” accounts, i.e. the Instagram site for the exchange of photographs.
This news has raised concerns about publications of a sexual nature.
Twenty per cent of students said they had a basic, “clean” account that their parents had access to, but also secret accounts.
One mother, who accidentally had access to her 13-year-old daughter's secret account, was there for a teenager who called on others to “strengthen him”.
A study conducted by the Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Independent Directors of Schools (HMC) showed that 40 per cent of children between the ages of 11 and 18 had two profiles in the joints, and half of them recognized that one of them was usually secret.
HMC head Mike Bukenen says: “Many teenagers are trying to create online spaces that are not available to their parents and teachers, and this is a disturbing fact.”
Elid Doyle will become a "voice of sportsmen" of Scotland's easy athletics
At the annual general meeting of the governing body, Elid Doyle was elected to the Board of Directors of the Scottish Light Athletics as an observer member of the Board of Directors.
Doyle, Scotland's most titled sportsman on light athletics, says President Jen Bitty that this step is an excellent opportunity for sports leaders to take advantage of the extensive experience of sports at the international level over the past decade.
“Elid enjoys great respect in the Scottish, British and world Light Atlantic community, and we are confident that its participation will bring great benefit to the sport in Scotland,” Bithyte claims.
Doyle says, “I am striving to be a voice of athletes, and I hope I can make a real contribution and contribute to the development of sports in Scotland.”
The American, who won 200 metres and 400 metres in 1996 at the Atlante Games, has a total of four gold Olympic medals, and now works as a regular commentator on BBC, has lost his ability to walk after the stroke.
He writes in his Twitter: “A month ago, I had a stroke.
I've lost my ability to move.
The doctors said it would only be time to see if I could fix it, and if so, to what extent.
It was an exhausting job, but I was completely healthy, I learned to walk again, and I am doing fishing today!
Thank you very much for your support."
Advertising of milkfats, where feeding mothers compared to cows, divided the views of internet users
The dairy production company caused Internet disputes, publishing a advertisement that compared breast-feeding mothers to breast-feeding cows.
By placing on the market, they say, “the world’s first insidious breast milk sauce,” the consumer technology company Elvie published an advertising music video showing the freedom that the new milk sauce provides to nursing mothers.
Four real moms dance in a full-time evening with a musical track containing the words, "Yes, I'm feeding my own milk, but you can't see my tail" and "If you haven't noticed it, it's not my breast."
We feed our children with milk, we feed and we feed.
This advertising role, which was published on Facebook's website, caused Internet disputes.
77,000 reviews and hundreds of comments: the video has received a mixed response from the audience, and many say it sheds light on the “fears” of the dairy industry.
“It is a very bad decision to use cows for advertising this product.
Like us, they need to be pregnant and born to produce milk, except that their children are taken from them for a few days after birth," one user writes.
The milkfat Elvie is dressed directly under a special bisthalter (Elvie/Mother)
And here's another comment: "It's probably as traumatic for both mothers and children.
But why not use them to advertise milk sauce for mothers who leave their children? "
Another user adds: “Advert from reality”.
Others, on the contrary, protected the role, and one woman even wrote that the song was “very beautiful”.
"I think it's a great idea.
If I were to feed a kid, I'd have to buy one.
The breast cramp really made me feel a cow.
Advertising, of course, is a bit of a shock, but that's what it feels like.
“The product is generic,” wrote one user.
And another comment: “A lot of advertising that is intended for mothers who breast-feeding (usually doing it directly at their workplaces or in toilets) and who, in truth, feel a little “cows.”
It's not for us to admire or abuse our milk industry."
At the end of the video, a group of women showed that they were all dancing with these undetected milk sauces hidden under the bisthalts.
The concept of this advertising campaign is based on the fact that many breast - feeding women say they feel cows.
In fact, Elvie's milk solution is completely inconceivable, has no pipes or pipes, is freely placed in a butcher for feeding, and without any intention of enabling women to move, keep small children, and even go to the street during feeding.
Ana Balarin, a partner and child development specialist at Mother’s company, comments: “The Elvie Molocotsus is so revolutionary that he deserves a bold and provocative advertising.
By paralleling women and sheep cows, we wanted to focus our attention on breast-feeding and all its problems, demonstrating in a sleek and cheerful manner the incredible sense of freedom that gives new milky sauce.
It's not the first case that Elvie's milk is in the headlines.
During the London week, the mother's mother of two children appeared at the designer's stage, Marta Jacobovski, using this product for appointment.
Hundreds of migrant children have been freely moved to the camps at the border with Texas
The number of detained migrant children has increased dramatically, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, partly because the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Tramp administration have made it difficult to locate children in the contractors.
Most sponsors are usually the same immigrants who do not have documents and are afraid to threaten their stay in the country, taking the child under their command.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential commanders and other adult members of their families would have to provide fingerprints and that these data would be transmitted to the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Olbens, a senior immigration and customs officer, testified to the Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had been asked to take the leave of minors.
Later, the Agency confirmed that 70 per cent of the detainees had not been previously tried.
“About 80 per cent of the persons who are either contracting or members of their families are illegal in the country, and a significant proportion of them are aliens who commit a crime.
We therefore continue to persecute these people," Olbens said.
In the words of host workers, seeking to speed up the process of child training, officials introduced new rules that some of them had to appear before the court within a month of detention, not after 60 days, as before.
In order to claim their legal status as an immigration judge, many are present on video, not personally.
Those deemed to have no right to help will be quickly deported.
According to shelter and information workers in the system in recent months, the longer children remain in detention, the more likely they are to be disturbed or depressed, which may lead to the outbreak of violence or attempts to escape.
Lawyers say that these problems are being increased in larger institutions, such as Thornillo, where the signs that a child is experiencing difficulties are more likely to be ignored because of the size of the institution.
They add that transporting children to tents without giving them time to prepare for it or to say goodbye to friends can add to the trauma that many of them are already struggling with.
Syria orders the U.S., France and Turkey immediately to expel the troops
Speaking to the United Nations General Assembly, Minister for Foreign Affairs Valid al-Moual also called on Syrian refugees to return home, despite the fact that war had already taken place in the country for the eighth year.
The speech, which was also the Deputy Prime Minister, stated that foreign forces were illegally on the Syrian land, on the pretext of combating terrorism, and “will be considered accordingly”.
He said to those who were gathered, “They must leave immediately, without any condition.”
The museum insists that in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have been killed since 2011, and millions of people have been expelled from their homes, “the war with terrorism is almost over”.
He said that Damascus would continue “to carry out this sacred battle until we clear all Syrian territories” by terrorist groups and “loved illegal foreign presence”.
The United States has deployed some 2,000 military personnel in Syria, mainly trained and consulted both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs against President Bashar Assad.
The French contingent has over 1,000 military personnel in a war-dwelling country.
With regard to refugees, Mualem said that good conditions had been set up for their return, and he accused “some Western countries” of “Irrational insurance” that urged refugees to stay outside the country.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to promote the return of citizens,” he said.
“They are politicizing what must be a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union warn that Syria will not be helped to recover until a political agreement on the end of the war is reached between Assad and the opposition.
The United Nations diplomats say that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a buffer zone in the last major siege of the Idlib rebels has made it possible to continue political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkey Agreement has prevented the widespread assault by the Syrian forces supported by Russia in a province where three million people live.
However, the Mualam stressed that the agreement had a “clear deadline”, and expressed the hope that military action would be directed against the Georgians, including the Al-Qaeda fighters, who would be “destructed”.
The UN envoy, Staffhan de Mistura, hoped that the first meetings of the new committee would soon be convened, consisting of representatives of the Government and the opposition, to develop a post-war constitution for Syria and to pave the way for elections.
The museum presented the conditions for the participation of the Syrian Government in the Committee, stating that the work of the Commission should be limited to “the consideration of the articles of the current Constitution” and a warning of interference.
Why Tramp wins second term
In line with this logic, Mr. Tramp will win the election again in 2020 if the impression and scandal do not soon end his presidency, and that is what many liberal spectators are likely to hope for.
And this will undoubtedly be “the only dramatic final of the presidency for all history”.
At this point, there is no sign of fatigue in the viewers.
From 2014, premium-time ratings have increased by more than twice — up to 1.05 million per CNN and almost three times — to 1.6 million per MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million premium viewers, compared to 1.7 million years ago, and the MSNBC show "The Rachel Maddow Show" has exceeded the rating of cable channels, collecting 3.5 million viewers in the evenings during the main news show.
“This is a fire that people are exposed to, because it is beyond our understanding,” says Neil Beer, director of the ABC “Designed Survivor”, a member of the Cabinet of Ministers, who becomes president after the Capitol is destroyed as a result of the attack.
Nell Skowell, a long - published comedy writer and author “Only funny: several unpleasant truths about entering the Club of Hollywood Boys” offers another theory.
She recalls one day riding a taxi in Boston before the 2016 elections.
The cab driver told her that she would vote for Mr. Tramp.
"Why?" she asked.
He said, “Yes, because he is a madman.”
In all this chaos, there is something valuable — it is fun.
Of course, unlike the rest of the content broadcast on television, Washington news lines can determine the future of Rou v. Wade and answer questions about the possibility of bringing together immigrant families and the health of the world economy.
The exception is a luxury that only privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, when you look at the six o'clock in the morning, as an expert group is discussing Bob Woodward's use of a "deep background" for his book Strah, or about Paul Manafort's shirt for $15,000 from a stripe of skin (a suit, warmed gorillas), as Washington Post, or about a sharp description of Storm Daniels, let's say Mr. Trampa's anatomy, it's already out of the ordinary information.
I, for example, will never look at Super Mario with the same eyes.
“Partly his job is to make us feel that the reality of the show is to feed you every night,” says Bernt Montgomery, executive director of the Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the Pawn Stars about the changing actor's composition of the Tramp show and the daily affairs of the subject (dark with N.F.L., praise Kim Chen Ihn).
You can't let yourself miss any episode, or you're hopelessly left.
When I contacted Mr. Fles this week, there were 27 degrees of heat on the north coast of Kauai, the sun was shining, but he was hiding inside his home and watching the MSNBC while recording the CNN.
He could not get away from the screen, at least not exactly when they showed how Brett Cavano was brought before the Legal Committee of the Senate and the future of the Supreme Court.
"I remember when we did all these crazy shows, people said, "This is the beginning of Western civilization," says Mr. Fles.
“Then I still thought it was a joke, but it turned out they were right.”

Foreign money is influenced by the worst interim elections leading to the White House
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania District 17 receives cash flow by changing districts in Congress, where two officers participate in the race for the same place.
This beautiful region of Pittsburgh, whose geography has not been changed for a long time, supports democracy, a member of the House of Representatives of Connor Lamb, who took place in another district in the extraordinary elections last spring.
Lamb is opposed to another active official, Republic of China Rottfus, who is currently representing the 12th district of Pennsylvania, which is substantially reciprocated with the new 17th.
The cards were revised after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in January decided that, as a result of the election, the old areas were assigned to the Republicans in violation of the Constitution.
The Honka in the new 17th district called for a heated discussion on financing campaigns between the financial forces of the main party, the Committee of Congress of the Democratic Campaign (DCCC) and the National Committee of the Republican Campaign (NRCC).
The name Lemba became known in Pennsylvania after a small victory at the March special elections in the 18th Pennsylvania district.
This place has been occupied by the Republicans for more than ten years, and President Donald Tramp has won the district with 20 points of advantage.
Political experts give the democracies a little advantage.
El Salvador was ordered to support China, but then withdrew
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, which had led to the negative reaction of Washington.
In June 2017, Mr. Tramp held a warm meeting with the President of Panama Juan Carlos Vareloy. He also owned Panama until his partners had moved out of Trampa's management team.
The representatives of the Department decided to withdraw US leaders of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to “the recent decisions on Taiwan’s non-recognition”, said at the beginning of this month the Press Secretary of Hezer Nawert.
However, the possibility of punishment was considered only for El Salvador, which received approximately $140 million in 2017, including drug control, economic development and support.
The proposed penalties, including the reduction of financial assistance and visa restrictions, would be painful for that country in Central America with its high level of unemployment and killings.
In the light of the regular internal meetings of North and Central America, the representatives of North and Central America postponed the high-level conference on security and economic prosperity, which should have been held to conduct the outcome of the similar meeting, which took place last year, which was perceived as a step forward in the efforts to prevent migration to the United States.
However, by mid-September, the high-level representatives of the Administration had suggested that they wished the conference to be held, and that it had actually discontinued its consideration of the question of the punishment of El Salvador.
According to the diplomats, the conference is scheduled for mid-October and will be attended by Vice-President Mike Pens, indicating that the administration is truly important to this meeting.
Three U.S. diplomatic representatives were welcomed back to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without bringing any new harsh messages or sanctions from Washington.
The representative of the White House, Mr. Bolton, refused to comment on the details of the debates that three American officials, including two diplomats, had discussed domestic issues subject to anonymity.
Their reports also confirm the background of an anonymity, which is within the scope of the administration.
Study History
The next step could be the report of Special Adviser Robert Muller on the possible impediment to Mr. Tramp's justice, as there is very substantial evidence in the public reports.
Mr. Muller also reportedly began to investigate the facts of the trumped-up campaign with Russia and its attacks during the past elections.
If the Congress changes the host, Mr. Tramp will appear before the person responsible in that body, just as he is ready to speak again to the electors, and perhaps eventually to the jury of his colleagues.
But there is a lot of 'if'; I do not want to say that the fall of Mr Trampa is inevitable, as well as the fall of his equivalents in Europe.
We will all make a choice on both sides of the Atlantic, which will say the duration of the fight.
In 1938, German officers were ready to set up a coup and overthrow Hitler, and that would have happened if the West had resisted him and supported the Czechoslovak troops in Munich.
However, we have not done so and have missed the opportunity to avoid subsequent years of bloodshed.
The course of history is being developed at such points, and the improbable march of democracy is speeding up or slowing down.
The Americans are experiencing some of these fragile moments now.
What would we do if Mr. Tramp fired Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Muller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult situation since, according to the newspaper, he proposed to make secret records last year about the President's activities and discussed his inability to serve.
Mr. Rosenstein said that the data on The Times were not true.
“How will we react if the recently requested FBI investigation into Brett Cavano is not complete or true, or if it is still approved by the Supreme Judge despite the merit of being accused of sexual harassment and false testimony?
First of all, will we vote in the medium term for the Congress, which will bring Mr. Tramp to justice?
If we do not pass these tests properly, this winter will prove to be too long for democracy.
But I believe that we will be able to go through them with the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech-Slovenian Jew, who lived in the same Nazi regime in Osvenci, whose officials once occupied the post office, where I lived many years later.
She survived, immigrated to the United States, and 60 years later I was led to the burning of Saturday candles on the table with a swastika symbol.
With such a family past how can I not be optimistic about our future?"
Norman Eisen, senior scientist at the Brookings Institute, is the president of the City of Responsibility and Ethics in Washington and the author of the book The Last Palace: The Troubled Age of Europe in the history of five lives and one legendary home.
Grim Dorrans from Rangers was optimistically set up in front of a football club called Rapid.
The Rangers are taking the Venice Rapid on Thursday, knowing that the victory over the Austrians, after an impressive victory in Spain over the Vijarreal at the beginning of this month, will allow them to take strong positions in the G League of Europe group.
The knee trauma prevented the semi-defencer, Grim Dorrans, for the first time in the season from speaking to nothing with 2:2 against the "Vilarreal" account, but he believes that "Randers" can use this result as a tramp to achieve great results.
"It was a good time for us because "Vilarreal" is a good team," said a 31-year-old footballer.
“We went into the game, thinking we could get something, and we left with nothing.
Maybe at the end of the day, we could do it, but nothing at all was probably a fair result.
They probably played better in the first time, and our success came to the second time where we were better.
There will be another great European night on Thursday.
I hope we can get three points, but it's going to be a difficult game because they've shown a good result in their last game, but given the support of the sick, I'm sure we can move forward and get a positive result.
Last year was certainly a difficult one, taking into account all that has to do with my injuries and replacements at the club itself, but now there is a good factor in this place.
It's made wonderfully better, and the kids really get the pleasure; the training went on the clock.
I hope we can move forward, leave behind the past season and succeed."
Women lose their sleep because of fear of their pension stocks
Despite the fact that the respondents had a clear understanding of how they wanted to be cared for, few spoke with their family members.
About half of the people involved in national studies said that they had discussed the value of long-term care with their wives.
However, only 10% said that they had talked to their children about the subject.
“People want to talk about them, but they don’t try to discuss this with them,” says Holly Snyder, Vice President of the Nationwide for Life Insurance.
And that's what we need to start with.
Speak to your wives and your children. You may not be able to prepare your family until they care for you if you do not speak beforehand.
Discuss with your consultant and family where and how you will get medical assistance, as this choice can be an important cost factor.
Consult your financial advisor: he will help you develop a payment plan for these expenses.
Your choice of financing for long-term care may be covered by a traditional long-term insurance policy or a mixed life insurance policy that will help cover these costs or self-insurance with your own property, provided you have money.
Put your legal instruments in order: get rid of legal battles.
Build trust in medical care and appoint a trusted person who will monitor your medical care and monitor for professionals to meet your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
We also recommend considering the possibility of financial confidence.
A trusted person should be selected to help you make financial decisions and to monitor the payment of your accounts if you are unable to do so.
Don’t forget about the cubs: Imagine that your elderly parent was in need of immediate medical attention, and he is on his way to the hospital.
Can you then provide information on what medication he is taking and what he is allergic to?
Write down all these details on the paper so that you can prepare for each case.
Martin adds, “It is important not only that there are finances but also that the choice of doctors is. ”
“What medicines are you taking?
Who will take care of your dog?
Build and write down this plan."
In Ilfracombe, people fired several times from a pneumatic blowout
A man fired a few times from a pneumatic blowout, returning home from the play.
The victim, whose chest, life, and hand fell, was 40 years old in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon.
The police described the shooting, which occurred about 02:30 in English summer time, as “an accident”.
The victim didn't see the attacker.
The wounds are not life-threatening, and the police are now searching for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
According to officials, at least 384 people were killed as a result of a massive earthquake and tsunami that devastated the Indonesian city of Pala on Friday, and the number of deaths is expected to rise.
Out of communication, rescuers cannot obtain any information from Donghal, a region north of Pala, which is close to the quake epidemic with 7.5 balls.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated in Palao as a result of the natural disaster.
Here are some key facts about Pala and Donghal located on the island of Sulavesi:
Pala, the capital of the province of Central Sulavesi, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulavesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 (given for 2017).
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when an earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Dongala is a district that extends 300 km (180 km) from the coast to the north-west of the island of Sulavesi.
The district, the administrative area of the smaller province, had 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the basis of the economy of the province of Central Sulavesi, in particular in the coastal region of Donghal.
The acquisition of nickel is also important for the province ' s economy, but mainly focused in Morovali, on the opposite coast of Sulavesi.
According to the Indonesian Agency for Natural Disasters, the tsunamis have been destroyed several times in Pala and Donghal over the past 100 years.
In 1938, the tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dongal.
The tsunamis also occurred in the western part of Dongala in 1996, resulting in the deaths of nine people.
Indonesia is on the Pacific volcano fire ring and is regularly suffering from earthquakes.
Here are some of the main earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: The strong earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in the north of Sumatra on 26 December caused tsunamis that devastated 14 countries, resulting in the death of 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: The follow-up to the severe earthquakes broke out on the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: The earthquake of 6,8 hit southern Java, the most densely populated island of Indonesia, causing tsunamis on the southern coast, resulting in the deaths of some 700 people.
2009: Earthquake 7.6 occurred in the city of Padang, capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: Earthquake 7.5 hits occurred on one of the Isles of Mentawa in Sumatra, causing tsunamis up to 10 metres, which destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: The weak earthquake broke down in the Pidi Jai district of Aceha, causing destruction and panic, as people remembered the devastating earthquake in 2004 and tsunamis.
The tsunami did not happen this time, but more than 100 people died as a result of the destruction of the buildings.
2018: Strong earthquakes have taken place on the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia, resulting in more than 500 deaths, mainly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings, and thousands of tourists remained temporarily in ruins.
An older son of Sarah Palin arrested for domestic violence
Trak Pailin, the eldest son of former governor Alaska and vice-candidate of President Sara Pailin, was arrested on charges of assault.
The 29-year-old Pailin from Vasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, in a situation where domestic violence occurred, and for the repression of arrest, according to a statement issued on Saturday by the Alaska State Police.
According to the police report, when one of his acquaintances tried to call the police to report the alleged crime, he picked up the phone.
According to KTUU, Pailin is in the Mat-Su insulator and will be released at $500.
He appeared in court on Saturday, and when he was asked whether he was guilty, he declared his “one-time innocence”.
Pailina was threatened with three minor Class A crimes, which meant that she could be deprived of her liberty for up to a year and fined $250,000.
He was also charged with the crime of Class B, with imprisonment for up to one day and a fine of $2,000.
That's not the first case when he was charged with criminal charges against Pailin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Paylin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported the alleged attack.
The case is currently under consideration by the Alayski Veteran Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, reporting domestic violence and storing weapons in a state of alcohol abuse in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend said he hit her on the face.
Sara Palin was criticized by the veteran groups in 2016, after explaining her son’s ill-behavior behaviour with post-traumatic stress, as well as his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunamis in Indonesia: hundreds of people killed
At least 384 people died as a result of an earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulavesi on Friday.
Earthquake of 7.5 balls caused tsunamis and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications are not working, and the number of victims will rise in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred not far from the central Sulavesi, which lies north-east of the capital of Jakarta Indonesia.
There are video recordings on social media.
Hundreds of people were at a beach festival in the city of Palo when the tsunami broke down on the shore.
The Federal Prosecutor ' s Office wishes to bring a rare death sentence to the suspect in New York City.
The Federal Prosecutor ' s Office in New York is seeking a death penalty for Saifllo Saipov, suspected of committing a crime in New York, resulting in the death of eight persons, a rare punishment for a federal crime that has not been applied in the state since 1953.
In October, Saipov, 30 years old, was probably taken by the truck Home Depot to attack a bike on the West-Syd road in Lower Manhattan, cutting down pedestrians and bicycles.
In order to justify the death sentence, the prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov had deliberately killed eight people and “pretentiously” caused serious bodily harm, according to the notification of the intention to obtain the death penalty in the South of New York.
According to the legal instrument, the two charges may result in a death sentence.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal jury read Saipov ' s indictment of 22 counts, which included eight counts of murder for the purpose of a rocket used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, as well as an accusation of violence and the destruction of cars.
According to the prosecutors, the attack was “very planned and intentional”, Saipov carried it out, as described, “in a hostile, cruel and criminal manner”.
"Syfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injuries, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, Ann-Lora Decadta, Darrena Drake, Ariel Erlie, Erna Ferrodi, Erna Diego Mendos and Alejandro Damian Pagnukko," says the notice of intent.
Five of the dead were tourists from Argentina.
Ten years have passed since the prosecutor's death penalty was demanded in the South of New York District for criminal offences.
In September 2009, Khalid Barnes was convicted of murdering two drug addicts, but eventually he was sentenced to life imprisonment.
The last time the death penalty for the federal case in New York was applied in 1953 to Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were sentenced to a contract for spying on the Soviet Union during the cold war two years earlier.
Rosenbergi was sentenced with the use of an electric chair on 19 June 1953.
According to Saipov ' s court documents, the native of Uzbekistan demonstrated that there was no injury after the attack.
According to the police, he told the investigators that he was glad he did.
According to the indictment, Saipov told the authorities that he had been inspired by the video IGIL on the phone to carry out his attack.
He also asked the IGIL to hang out in his hospital room, the police reported.
He denied his guilt on all 22 indictments.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders on the side of Saipov, said they were “clearly disappointed” by the decision of the prosecutor.
“We believe that the decision to apply the death penalty, rather than the life sentence, will only exacerbate the pain of those events for all their participants,” Patton said.
The protection of Saipova had previously been addressed to prosecutors with the request not to seek a death penalty.
Member of Parliament from Tori says NAYJEL FARAZ should not be responsible for negotiations on Brexit
Today, during a protest at the Tori Nigel Faraj conference, he vowed to “mobilize the people’s army”.
Former Ukip leader said that policies should “sympathize” with Eurosceptics, as one of the members of the Teresa May parliament suggested that he should be responsible for negotiations with the EU.
A member of the Conservative Party, Peter Bowe, said at a meeting in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would have "extended" if Mr. Faraj were Secretary Brexit.
However, the problem faced by Mrs. May, in trying to reconcile her deep-separate ranks, is further exacerbated by the fact that the members of the Tori Party, who are opposed to leaving the EU, join a separate protest against Brexit, which is taking place in the city.
The prime minister of all forces is trying to maintain his compromise plan, which was launched at the Chekers in a desert by Brexit, its opponents and the EU.
The Allies insist that they continue to try to conclude a deal with Brussels, despite the negative reaction, and thus force Eurosceptics and Laborists to choose between its package and the chaos.
Mr. Bowe said at the Leave Means Leave (“Wowty means to survive”) in Saulhalle, which he wants to “play Checkers”.
He suggested that Mr. Faraz should be held responsible for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had been responsible, we would have left," he said.
Member Wellingboro added: "I will continue to speak for Brexit, but we need to play the Checkers."
Addressing the EU, he said: "We did not fight in world wars to be dependent.
We want to establish our laws in our country."
Mr. Boun rejected the assumption that the public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British had changed their opinion and wanted to remain is totally inconsistency”.
Participator Brexit of the Tori Andrea Jenkins party was also at the meeting, giving reporters the following comment: “I say: Prime Minister, just listen to people.”
"Chequers unpopular among the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for this plan, it is also unpopular among members of our party and our activists who are actually pushing the streets and, in the first place, electing us.
Please put the checkers aside and start listening to what they say to you."
In her brief address to Ms. May, she added: “The Prime Ministers shall remain in their work if they are faithful to their promises.”
Mr. Faraj said that if policies were to be submitted to the 2016 referendum, they would have to be forced to “sigh”.
“This is now a matter of confidence between us, people and our political class,” he says.
"They're trying to hand over Brexit, and we're here today to say, 'We're not going to let you down.'
Addressing the desperate crowd, he added: “I want our political class, which is on the brink of Brexit’s betrayal, to feel a void.
“We are mobilizing this country’s people’s army, giving us victory in Brexit, and we will not rest until we become an independent, independent and proud United Kingdom.”
In the meantime, Brexit's opponents took a demonstration on Birmingham and then held a two-hour meeting in the city centre.
Several activists fanned the Tori v. Brexit posters into these outputs.
At the opening of the conference, the Labour Party member Lord Adonis criticized the conservators for security issues in the mobile annex of their party.
“And these people claim that Canada’s IT and technology systems can be set up plus, for border work, for free trade without borders with Ireland,” he added.
"It's a bad side.
The good Brexit does not exist in principle," he said.
Warren plans to “carefully explore” the possibility of participating in the presidential race
A member of the United States Parliament, Senator Elizabeth Warren, said that after the November elections, she would “enoughly explore the possibility of joining the presidents”.
The Boston Globe reported that a masseuse democracy on Saturday told about its future meeting in Western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trampa, is in November for a re-election against a member of the Republican Party of Jeff Dil, who was co-chaired by the Tromp campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
There are talks that she has the chance to take part in the Trump post in 2020.
On Saturday, she held a regular meeting with the electors in Holioque; since Tramp entered the post, it was her 36th meeting with the electors in the form of a rat meeting.
One of the participants asked her if she was planning to join the president.
Warren replied that it was time for women to go to Washington to "start" our broken government, and for that to be a woman upstairs.
As a result of the murder of Sims (stretched), the LSU was arrested
Baton-Ruz Police, Louisiana State, announced on Saturday that the suspect in the shooting was arrested by LSU Wade Sims, who took place on Friday.
At 11:00 a.m., at a press conference, the Baton-Ruz police announced the arrest of Dayton Simpson, 20 years old.
On Friday, the police department published a video of the shooting with a request to help identify the person who was able to download the video.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot around the campus of the South University on Friday morning.
“Way Sims got a gunshot wound in his head, which ended,” police chief Murphy J. Paul told reporters on Saturday.
Wade joined his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted that he was involved in the incident, had weapons and shot at Wade Sims.
Simpson did not object to arrest and was detained in the East Baton-Ruz police department.
A young man grew by 1 m 82 cm in Baton-Ruz, played in 32 games with 10 starters last season and picked up on average 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 choices for the game.
Gran Pri Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaches the title of the world champion after the command tactics gave him victory over Sebastian Fettel
Since Walter Botts was qualified on Saturday, Louis Hamilton was encouraged, and it became clear that Mercedes' command tactics played a major role in the race.
He was well-initiated and practically promoted to Hamilton when he protected his position on the first two turns, and invited Fettel to attack his teammates.
The Fettel first went to the pit stop and left Hamilton in the tail of the whole group – the choice that became decisive.
Mercedes went to the pi-step one round later, and then came behind Fettel, but Hamilton, after some fighting “coal in the wheel”, stepped forward, which led to the failure of the Ferrari driver to leave the inner space free, risking himself after a double movement to protect on the third turn.
On his 21st birthday, Max Ferstappen started from the back of a series of networks and was in the seventh place by the end of the first round.
After that, most of the race he was holding on to his native tires in order to quickly finish, subjugated Kim Rykconen to fourth place.
As a result, he went to a pit stop at the 44th round, but could not increase the pace of the remaining eight rounds, because Rykkonen took fourth place.
The day was difficult because Walter had done fantastic work on the exits and had shown the present glory by sharing it with me.
The team did such an exceptional job to have a couple of tricks in stock," Hamilton said.
Sign Language of the Toys
President Donald Tramp criticised Senator Diane Finnstein for his statement on Saturday that she had not issued a letter from Christine Blaise Ford, the prosecutor of Brett Kawano, a candidate for a high-level judge in sexual harassment.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the President did not mention the direct testimony given by the Ford to the Senate's Legal Committee, he said that the Senate had shown that the participants of these events were “slow, ugly and false people”.
“The only possible response to all of this, and what is happening in the Senate in the last few days, is wonderful, it is anger, evil, and lies,” he said.
'You see all these' they will reply, 'No, I did not do it.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Diane Finnstein, did you "slid" the information?
Remember her answer... did you delete the document information? - What?
Oh, no.
I wasn't going down.
Yes, stop.
We, what, did we "slid"?...No, we didn't "slid", he added with the Senator's intension.
In July, a letter was sent explaining in detail the charges brought against Ford against Cavano and it was unlawfully announced in early September, but Finnstein denied that the leak had occurred in her office.
“I did not hide Dr. Ford’s allegations, but I did not collect her information,” The Hill told the Committee.
“She asked me to keep this information secret, and I did as she asked.”
However, the way in which she denied the charges in the run-off seemed to be unpopular to the president who commented on this at the Saturday morning: "This is what I shall tell you: The language of the body has been greatly influenced by it.
Maybe she didn't "slip," but the language of the body was worse than I've ever seen."
In continuing to protect his candidate for the position of a Supreme Judge, accused by three women in sexual harassment, the President suggested that the Democrats use these accusations for their own purposes.
“They are certainly trying to regain power in all accessible ways.
We observe pride, malice, no matter who they try, through whom they have to overcome in order to gain power and control," the President quoted Mediaite as saying.
British elite hockey league: Dandi Sprat 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Duyer scored two goals for "Jeants" in the game against "Dandy"
In the game of the elite hockey league, Dandi Schar was fired for a Friday defeat against Belfast Giants, won a response match on Saturday with a 5-3 account in favor of Dandi.
"Jeants" won an early two-goal victory thanks to the hits of Patrick Duyer and Francis Bowlier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney raised the level of the home team before Duyer took the Giants out to the leader.
François Bushar compared Dandi's account before the two goals of Lucas Lundvald Nilsen secured their victory.
For the people of Adam Kif, who won the "Dandi" at 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night, it was the third defeat in the Elite League season.
It was the fourth season meeting between the parties when the Giants won the three previous match.
The first goal of the Duiyer came at 3:35 a.m. after Kendall McFollah's barefoot, with David Rezerford's support, and then Bovilleer doubled the advantage four minutes later.
During the initial period, Sullivan returned to the game at 13:10 before Matt Markardt trained Couni to balance the account at 15:16.
Duyer agreed that the Giants took the initiative at the first break when he shot the second goal in the evening at the end of the first period.
The owner regrouped, and Bushar reassessed the account, killing the goal at a number of shifts at 27:37.
Counnies and Charles Corcoran were united to help Nilsen to give Dandi the first chance for a match to be won at the end of the second period, after which he and his team won the victory, holding opponents in the middle of the field until the end of the final period.
"Jeants", currently lost four of the last five matches, are being sent to Milton-Caines for the next match to take place on Friday.
The air traffic controller died so that hundreds of people on board the plane could avoid earthquakes
The Indonesian airshipman was sentenced to death by the name of a hero after he deliberately went to death so that hundreds of passengers could fly well.
More than 800 people died and many lost their lives as a result of a severe earthquake on the island of Sulavesi on Friday.
Strong underground tunnels continue to destroy this area, and many of the inhabitants of the city of Palu have fallen under the roofs of the buildings.
Although his colleagues were saved by escape to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunavan Agung refused to leave his post at the horrendous altitude of Mutiar Sis Al Jufrei Airport, the city of Palu.
He remained in his seat to make sure that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was then on the flight deck, could safely fly.
Then, when he was shown that the tower was breaking down, he pulled it off.
Later he ended up in the hospital.
The representative of Indonesia's aircraft Johannes Sirait stated that this decision could save hundreds of lives, reports the Australian ABC News Agency.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to deliver it to a large hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, the dispatch ended before the helicopter was able to sit in Pala.
"We are very sorry about this loss," he added.
In the meantime, the authorities are concerned that the number of earthquakes could reach thousands, since, according to the Agency ' s information on the effects of natural disasters, access to the cities of Donggal, Sigi and Butong is limited.
“The number of victims is probably growing, as a large number of people are still under siege, and many have not been able to get out of there,” says Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
The volunteers, whose height was six meters [6 m] high, devastated the city of Pala, where the mass burial of the dead will take place on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft provide humanitarian assistance to the affected city.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, tells Sky News: “The quick help brings the victims every minute.
Clear water's not enough.
The mini-markets are being plundered everywhere."
Jan Helfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, tells CNN: “Indonesian Red Cross soldiers will be on their way to help the survivors, but we do not know what they will be left there.
The tragedy has already taken quite a serious scale, but it can all be much worse.”
The President of Indonesia, Joco Vidodo, arrived in Pala on Sunday and spoke before the armed forces of the country, in particular, said: “I ask you all to work day and night to fulfill all the tasks related to evacuation.
Are you ready?" says CNN.
At the beginning of this year, Indonesia suffered from an earthquake in Lombok, resulting in more than 550 deaths.
A plane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now reports that a person has been missing after a plane crash in the lagoon
The airline, on its voyage, has now reported that one person has been missing while it has been said that all 47 passengers and crew have been well off.
Air Niugini states that as a Saturday day, it has no information about a male passenger.
The airline stated that it was cooperating with local authorities, hospitals and police, trying to find this person.
The airline was unable to respond immediately to requests for more detailed information about the passenger, for example about his age or nationality.
Local sailors helped rescue other passengers and aircraft crew after he fell on the water trying to land at Chuk Island Airport.
On Friday, officials reported that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline also reported that six passengers were hospitalized on Saturday and were all in stable condition.
The causes of the crash and the precise sequence of events remain unclear.
The airlines and the U.S. VMS claim that the aircraft landed in the lagoon not far from the airfield.
Some witnesses claim that the aircraft was unable to land on the flight-seasonal field.
U.S. passenger Bill Janes says the plane's got on the flight deck too low.
"And that's very good," adds Janes.
Janes told me that he and other passengers were able to pass by an emergency exit on a ton plane, as the water level was on the belt.
He also said that the stewards panicked and shouted on board and that he had a slight headache.
The U.S. I.S. reported that the mariners who repaired the surrounding area also helped to rescue by using an inhaled boat on which they transported people to the shore before the aircraft was loaded at approximately 30 metres (100 feet).
Air Safety Networks have shown that in the last two decades, 111 people were killed in aircraft accidents with aircraft registered in PNG, but none of these accidents were related to Air Niugini.
An analysis of the intelligence could prove the fact that women were burned alive
On Saturday, the charge was brought against the man charged with burning the residents of Mississippi in 2014.
The analyst of the Department of Justice of the United States, Paul Roulette, gave long-term testimony as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He told members of the department how he used cell phone records to form a general picture of the action of the 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim of Jessica Chambers on the night she died.
Roulette explained that he had received data on the location of these people with several mobile phones; according to this data, Telelis spent the evening with Chambers, which contradicted his previous testimony, reported The Clarion Ledger.
He said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, but according to the data received, his cell phone was close to Chambers; when that was discovered, the police interrogated Sanford.
In his testimony, Sanford said he was not in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked Sanford if Tellis was right, claiming that he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said, "That's a lie, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he met Chambers two weeks before her death.
However, the telephone records indicate that they were only called within one week.
Roulette also showed that shortly after the death of Chambers Telelis, her text messages, telephones and contact information were removed from her phone.
"He's the star of her life," says Hale.
Protection must begin to explain its final arguments on the resurrection.
The judge said that he expected the trial to be handed over to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: what is such a "unknown hip-hop"?
Three hip-hoppers are going to fight negatively against this genre, filling their music with positive content.
The High Breed Group in Bristol argues that hip-hop content has changed by addressing the underlying political and social problems.
The group would like to return to their roots and make the “incognito” hip-hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Commons have recently witnessed a rebirth in Britain by such artists as Akala and Lowkey.
One more black?
New York's Ninja tried a family couple because of racist sms.
The New York Nanny appealed to a family couple for a discriminatory dismissal after receiving a complaint from a woman that she had been “one more black”, which the woman misbehaved instead of her husband.
Spouses deny that they are racist, claiming that the claim is “the object of extortion”.
Lynsy Plasco-Flexman, the mother of two children, expressed concern, knowing that the new bride offered by the child care service, Giselle Morris, was black when she came to the family on her first working day in 2016.
"NEEEEEEEEEEEET, THAT'S NOT THAT, THERE'S ONE DIFFERENCE," wrote Mrs. Plasko-Flexman in her husband's text.
Instead of sending a text message to her husband, however, she misdirected him twice.
When I realized my dismay, Plasco-Flexman fired Morris, claiming that the girl who became an African-American had done a bad job, and that they were expecting a Filipino, not an African-American, reports New York Post.
Morris was paid for one day's work and then sent home to Uber.
Now, Morris is in court for a family couple and requires compensation for a disbursement of $350 per day for six months, according to the original oral agreement, which, however, had not been concluded by any contract.
"I want them to understand: such things are not allowed," she said on Friday, adding, "And I know that this is discrimination."
Spouses disagree with the accusation of racism and claim that the release of Morris could be considered a reasonable step, as they would no longer be able to trust her if they tried to do so.
“My wife sent her a message that she really didn’t mean it.
She's not racist.
We're not racist," said the husband, Joe Plasco, post.
But would you trust someone with whom you have been unconcerned, even if you were in distress, and you did not want to do so?
Would you trust your newborn child?
"Come on!"
Plasco said that his wife had born a child only two months ago and was in “a very difficult situation”.
"Are you ready to pursue the man who has been in this situation?
It's not very nice of you," added the banker who specializes in investment.
The trial is still ongoing, but public opinion has already given its judgment in social networks, accusing a couple of unacceptable conduct and logical problems.
The publishers of Paddington were afraid that readers would not be able to walk with a talking bear, says a new letter.
The daughter of Bonda, Karen Yankel, who was born shortly after the publication was adopted, wrote: “It’s hard to put yourself in the place of the first reader before it was published.
It's very fun to know that Paddington has a huge success."
She also told her father that before he decided to write a children's book about the honeycomb, he was an operator on the BBC, and that he would refuse to publish with optimism, and added that his 60-year-old anniversary was “and joyful and bitter” because last year their author did not become.
With regard to Paddington's own honeymoon, she is referred to as “a very important member of our family”, and her father was quietly proud that his character finally became known.
"He was quiet and modest," said his daughter.
“The leader of Paddington was so real to him, and for his father it was almost as if his own child had made a success: he was proud of them, although he did not really consider this success as his own merit.
I think he was referring to Paddington's success that way.
Paddington was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, but he also always gave due respect to the bear.”
I had to say goodbye to my dying daughter on the phone.
After her daughter was landed, she was delivered to Nicci Hospital Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors tried to save her life.
"Nada called regularly and said that it was really bad that something went wrong," says Ednan-Laperuz.
"He called again and said that she would die in the next two minutes, and that we should forgive her.
I did.
I said, "Dash, I love you so much, dear.
We'll be together soon.
We'll be together.
The medications that doctors gave her, forcing her heart to work, gradually stopped acting by abandoning her body.
She died earlier than expected.
I had to just sit down and wait, knowing that everything was coming to an end.
I couldn't cry, I couldn't cry, I couldn't cry, or I couldn't cry, because there were other people around me, other families.
I had to hold my hand firmly."
At the end of the day, Mrs. Eden Laperuz, the grief of losing her daughter, landed on the plane with other passengers, calming down with the huge loss she had just had to survive.
"No one around knew what happened," she says.
"My head came up, I didn't stop crying.
It's hard to explain, but that's what I've been trying to do when I'm flying.
He needed so much in my love and support.
I know how much he loved her."
Women who have suffered the loss of loved ones prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones who have committed suicide try to prevent others from doing so.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphrey are on the Welsh Bridge openings with comforting words and telephone numbers that people can turn to for support.
Ms. Davis Tyler's son was 13 when he began to experience depression, and at the age of 18, he died with him.
“I don’t want other parents to experience what I experience every day, ” she says.
45-year-old Davis, who lives in Lidney, tells us that her son was a great poet and had a hell of a smile.
"They all loved his smile.
Everyone said that when he smiled, it was as if the light was burning in the room."
But before he died, he left his job because he was in a terrible time.”
This happened in 2014, and the last one with Tyler found his brother, then 11 years old.
Mrs. Davis said, "I'm not going to stop being afraid of a sudden reaction."
Mrs. Davis has come up with these openings, "because people knew there was someone to talk to and tell, even if it was your friend.
You cannot sit down and remain silent, and you must speak to people."
Mrs. Hamfriz, who has been associating with Mrs. Davis for many years, lost Mark, her husband, who lived with him for 15 years — not soon after his mother’s death.
“He did not say that he felt depressed, upset, or anything like that,” she says.
"In a few days before Christmas, we noticed changes in his mood.
It was a very bad thing for him. He did not look at his children when they opened their gifts.
She says his death was a huge trauma to them, but they have to go through it, it's a shock to our family.
It broke her into pieces.
But we have to keep on living and fighting."

Future Bretta Cavano hair hangs: FBI launches investigation
“I thought that if we could get something like what he asked, an investigation limited in time and volume, we could bring in even a little unity,” said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that he feared that the committee would “break up” on the background of a growing party chain reaction.
Why did Mr. Kawano and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
Time is the cause of their fluctuations.
The interim elections will take place only five weeks on 6 November, and if, as expected, everything will be bad for the Republicans, they will be seriously weakened in their efforts to get the person they want and to choose him as the Supreme Judge of the country.
George W. Bush called to the senators, lobbying for Mr. Kawano, who had worked in the White House for Mr. Bush, and who, thanks to Bush, met his future wife Ashley, who then served as Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI issues its report?
A vote will take place in the Senate, which currently consists of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
Until now, it is not clear whether Mr. Cavano will be able to obtain at least 50 votes at the Senate meeting, which would enable Vice-President Mike Pens to address the issue of equality of vote and to confirm his candidacy as a Supreme Judge.
The number of refugees from North Korea has decreased by Kim
Since Kim Chen Yin came into power seven years ago, the number of North Korean refugees in South Korea has decreased, the South Korean legislator said.
Pak Boon Seug, referring to the South Ministry, said that compared to 2706 escapes recorded in 2011, this figure decreased to 1127 last year.
Mr. Pack said that the key factors had become the strengthening of border controls between North Korea and China, as well as the higher rates taken by smugglers who drove people.
No public comment was made.
The overwhelming majority of North Korean refugees are finally being offered citizenship in South Korea.
Seoul claims that since the end of the Korean war in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border.
Most people are fleeing through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than a securely protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreans.
China views refugees as illegal migrants, not refugees, and is often subjected to forced repatriation.
The relationship between the North and the South, still in war, has improved significantly over the past few months.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyrenees to resume negotiations on nuclear disarmament.
This happened after the June historic meeting of the President of the United States of America, Donald Tramp and Kim Chen Yin in Singapore, where they reached common disarmament arrangements for the Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea, Rie Yun Ho, accused the United States of obstructing progress on this issue.
“If we do not have at least the slightest confidence in the United States, we will also have no confidence in our national security, and in such circumstances we will never be able to begin disarmament unilaterally,” Mr. Rei said in his statement to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Cavano a “esterical” and claims that he is not required to work in the Supreme Court.
The leader of the minority in the Palace of Nancy Pelosi called Brett Cavano, a candidate for the post of Supreme Judge, “esterical” and said that he was not fit for work in the Supreme Court because of his temper.
Pelosi made this comment in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I can’t believe that if a woman ever allowed herself to behave in such a way, she would be called a “steroidal” immediately,” Pelosi said about her reaction to the testimony of Kawano in the Senate Legal Committee, given to them on Thursday.
Kawano emotionally rejected the charges of Dr. Kristin Blacie Ford in sexual harassment, which probably took place when both of them were still teenagers.
Cavano spoke emotionally enough, sometimes even screaming and breathing, telling about his family and his school years.
He also duly condemned the Committee's democracies, calling them “grossy and clearly planned murder”, organized by the Liberals, who had lost the 2016 presidential election by Hillary Clinton.
Pelosi also said that, in her view, Kawano's arguments only confirmed that he could not serve in the Supreme Court because he had a pre-relationship with the Democrats.
“I think he is disqualifying himself with his allegations, as well as with the way he attacks Clinton and the Democrats,” she says.
Pelosi was upset when she was asked whether she was trying to bring Kawano to justice, if his guilt was confirmed, and if the democracies were to receive most of the representatives in the House.
“I will say this: if he does not speak the truth to Congress or the FBI, he is not only responsible for the Supreme Court, but also for the court where he is now,” Pelosi said.
Cavano is currently a Judge of the District Court of Appeal D.C.
Pelosi added that, as a democracy, she was concerned about the possible decisions of Kawano regarding the Access to Medical Services Act or Rou v. Wade, since he was considered a representative of conservative justice.
At the hearings on his candidacy, Kawano raised the question whether he would have to cancel some of the Supreme Court ' s decisions.
"Now is not the time to put the exorbitant and the prefect to the high judge, and to say, 'How beautiful!'," said Pelosi.
And women must have that.
It is righteous anger, months, and years of anger; it cannot go through without tears.
"When we get angry, we cry," said Miss Steine 45 later.
"I don't think it's as unusual as you think?"
She said: "I have been helped by a woman who has worked in a managerial position, and she says that she also cried when she was angry, but she has developed a technique by which she explains to her companion: 'You can think I'm crying because I'm upset.
I'm really worried."
And then she just kept talking.
I was very impressed by this approach.”
The tears are allowed as a way to get out of anger, partly because they are being treated unfairly in the root.
One of my most painful memories of the first work in the office, where men dominated: I once cried out of anger, but I was caught by an elderly woman, a soulless manager, whom I was always terribly afraid of, and dragged into a wheelchair.
"Never let them see how you cry," she said.
They do not know that you cry for evil.
They think you're upset, and they're glad they've finally brought you back to life."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Congressman of Democrats from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart during his presidential election.
In 1987, Mr. Hart was caught up in some unserious plot and got out of the race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply disappointed, decided that there were no reasons to prevent her from becoming a president.
“This decision was not considered,” she said with a smile 30 years later.
“The race had already attended seven other candidates, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called that case "The White and Seven Gnoms."
The campaign had already come to an end, it had left much behind in the fundraising process, and it had therefore sworn that it would not be in the race unless it had collected $2 million.
It was a very dangerous option, it was said.
She found that some of her supporters, who had given $1,000 to men, had offered her only 250.
She said, “I am a valued commodity for them,” and she wondered.
When she said that she would not engage in an official campaign, she was so overwhelmed by the emotions — the gratitude of the people who supported her, the disappointment of the system that made it so difficult to collect money and access to voters, as well as the anger of discrimination on the grounds of sex that she was inhaled.
"You'd think I had a nervous breakdown," recalls Mrs. Schroeder about how the press reacted to her.
"It could have been thought that Kleinex was my corporate sponsor.
I was still thinking, what would they write on my memory?
"She's no longer cryin'?"
How trade war with America can be useful for Beijing
Experts believe that the first wave of trade between the United States and China was deaf, and although fighting was far from complete, the gap between countries could bring lasting benefits to Beijing.
Donald Tramp, President of the United States, made the first warning in the beginning of this year, taxing the main Chinese exports, including solar batteries, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation took place this week, when the new tariffs affected goods of $200 billion (150 billion) and actually taxed half of all goods coming from China.
Beijing has made equivalent returns every time, with recent taxes on American goods amounting to $60 billion from five to ten per cent.
China promised that responses to the United States would be equal every time, and the world's second largest economy would hardly start to experience at least the smaller difficulties in the near future.
To force Washington to resign means to drop the requirements, but to drop the US publicly would be too careful for Si Xinpin, President of China.
However, experts believe that, if Beijing is able to play its cards correctly, the pressure of the US trade war can provide long-term support to China by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a rapid political solution in Washington or Beijing can create conditions that will lead to an economic gap in any of these countries is in fact much more dangerous than previously recognized observers,” says Abigail Grace, a researcher at the Center for New American Security, who specializes in Asia.
Minister for Foreign Affairs stated that Syria was “prepared” for the return of refugees
Syria states that it is ready to return to the refugees voluntarily and that it is seeking assistance in the reconstruction of a country that has been devastated by a war that has continued for more than seven years.
At the United Nations General Assembly, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Valid al-Mual, reported that conditions in the country had improved.
“Today’s situation on the ground has become more stable and secure thanks to the success of the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The Government continues to restore destroyed areas by terrorists so that people can live there peacefully.
All conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to a country that they had to leave due to terrorist attacks and unilateral economic measures affecting their daily lives have now been established.
According to the United Nations, over 5.5 million Syrians left the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mualem said that the Syrian regime would be grateful for assistance in the reconstruction of the devastated country.
But he stressed that the country would not receive assistance under any conditions or assistance from countries sponsoring terrorism.
Europe Ensuring the Victory of Kubke Rider in Paris
The European team won Kubok Rider 2018, winning the U.S. team with a score of 16.5 to 10.5 on Le Golf National in Paris, France.
The US$ 6 times had already been played on European land, and the European Cup of Raider had not been played since 1993.
Europe has returned to its crown thanks to Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team, which has picked up 14.5 points that they need to win over the United States.
The American star Phil Michaelson, who fought a large part of the tournament, made his first long shot in the water at the 16th hole in the pair-3, with his match Frankesko Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari won all rounds of his rounds, became 1-x-4 players who had ever been 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spit was defeated at 5:4 a player with the lowest score in the European team, Turbour Olesen of Denmark.
One of the best players in the world, Dustin Johnson, dropped 2:1 John Polter from England, who may have been participating in the Cup of Riyadh for the last time.
Spain's Serhio Garcia, a veteran of eight Kubkov Rider, has become a winner of the whole history of Europe with 25.5 points of career.
“I don’t usually cry, but I can’t hold on today.
It was a difficult year.
I'm very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm very happy to get a cup again.
It's all in the team, and I'm glad I was able to help," says Emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He's handing over the falcon to his associate John Ram, who, on Sunday, won the victory over American legend golfer Tiger Woods with a 2:1 account in a single game.
“I’m very proud of this victory,” says 23-year-old Ram.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now his career record is 13-21-3.
These indicators are quite strange for one of the greatest players of all time, which has won 14 main titles, with only Jack Niklaus.
The U.S.A. fought all the way out, trying hard to win, and the exception was Patrick Reid, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau, who showed the golf course throughout the tournament.
The U.S. captain Jim Furick said after his team's inconsistencies: "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning, we were able to touch Europe easily.
It didn't work.
We're filming the traps before Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played great.
We are regrouping, I will work with the PGA of America and our Committee, the Cube of Raider, and we will move forward with success.
I love all 12 boys, and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to be able to play.
We have lost."
Red flow: news Micro-organism concentration decreased in Pinellas, Manati and Sarasote
The last report of the Florida Commission on Fish and Wild Nature reflects the overall decline in red flux concentrations in some parts of the Tampa Bay.
According to the FWC, in the districts of Pinellas, Manati, Sarasota, Charlotte and Kolier, there is reports of abundant colouring, which refers to lowering the concentration of micro-organisms.
The Red Flood extends about 130 miles [30 km] from the northern Pinell to the south of Li.
Ochagi can be observed in about 10 miles from Hillsboro County, but their number has decreased significantly over the past week.
Red tides are also seen in the Pasco district.
Last week, the average concentration in the Pinellas district was reported and close to it, from low to high concentration in the coastal area of Hillsboro, high concentration in the Manata and Sarasota districts and in the coastal areas, the mean concentration in the Charlotte district, high concentration on the coast of Li district, and low concentration in the Koller district.
In the Pinellas, Manati, Sarasota, Li and Kolier districts, there is still a likelihood of respiratory irritation.
No such probability was reported in North-West Florida last week.
