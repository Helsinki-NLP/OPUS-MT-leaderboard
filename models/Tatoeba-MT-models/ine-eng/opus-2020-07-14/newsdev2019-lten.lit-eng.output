Purgės seller Lina Ognisantisti honors Bedford's dream
In the photo: Lina Ognisanti is selling ice for a warm year, and winter is a sluice.
More than 40 years of waste and ice trade in the city centre will be respected by a woman who has been created a private merma.
Lina Ognisantissi, selling ice and sprays on the "Dinky Donuts" of Bedford Midland Road, was invited to dinner tea with the family.
Almost 3,000 people have signed a petition on the Internet in order to receive or obtain recognition.
Mr. Ognisthesi said she was honored to receive such approval.
According to Bedford Mero Dave Hodgson, Mr. Ognisantsi with children and grandchildren was invited to his office to visit the city’s royal and historical artifacts and to drink the tea.
"Lina Bedforfe takes a special place, and its kiosk is part of the city centre," he said.
I am glad that she accepted my invitation, and I look forward to our meeting in my office so that I could thank Lina for her work in our city."
In her words, Mr. Ognisthesi thanked the people of Bedford who thought about her and said: “This is a great honor and a beautiful treat.”
The petitioner Sarkab Mahmood said that he did not accept all the signatures.
When he heard about the reception planned to be held before the end of the year, he said: “I am very happy about Lina because she has earned it because of her fine character.”
Kelyje on Alsterio "Lambretta" club
Lambretta's motorcycles have been unchanged in the 7th-century fashion culture.
The group of Italian motorists tried to preserve the spirit of those times.
70 years after the establishment of the first Alster Lambretta Club, about 100 motor lovers from the United Kingdom and Ireland gathered this weekend around Fermana.
One of the first two members of the club Chris Wilson acquired the first Lambretta in 1966 for about £40.
“My motor was just a vehicle, but I learned that I could use it and otherwise.
It was such a sport.
I didn't get involved in fashion culture, and now I'm probably too old," he said.
"It was rather cheap and fairly reliable, you could have bought it at the available price, and you got to do something more than just move from point A to point B."
He participated in a separate start in the Meno Island TT ring.
The first Alster's Lambretta club was created at the beginning of the 1980s and reorganized 12 years ago.
"Approximately 1971 motorists and other modes of transport are becoming less and less dominated by people, and the clubs in general suffered from unrest, so I thought, "It's all over," said Chris.
"Then, some time ago, interest reappeared and it seemed to grow more and more."
Philip Steele is the secretary of the Alster "Lambretta" club, which currently holds 97 members, responsible for the membership.
‘All reasons differ.
Some members were influenced by fashion culture because almost everything from it began.
Others are racing enthusiasts or handkerchiefs – you can find all people here.
There are also those who are simply interested in vintage.
Many motors are modified, so there are no two of them.
It is possible not to change the engine and to drive at a speed of 35 or 40 miles per hour, adapted to the narrow streets of Italy, but some members have improved it.
Some highly modified motors may reach a speed of up to 100 miles per hour."
During the weekend, some motorists had to be pushed into the mud.
And although the waters of Northern Ireland are not always as pleasant as the "Lambretta" father of Italy, this time the sun of education for motorists driving around Fermana.
Ruth Davidson asks for a silent question about Brexit
Ruth Davidson asked his fellow conservators to be "a period of silence", so that the minister could agree on Brexit.
Scotland's head said that over two years after the EU referendum, the debate took time.
She expressed her opinion in the words of Boris Johnson on the premier's plan, which he called "unreasonable and completely absurd".
She told the BBC that Sunday Politics Scotland had the time to support the Prime Minister.
At the party conference held in Birmingham, she said: “Over the past two years, we have had time for debates.
The former Secretary of Foreign Affairs took office in the history of one of the best cabinets and a large part of the current plan was prepared during that period, which had already been recognised last November.
The conservators now have to support the minister's president, allow her to complete the transaction and help implement the plans in the country.
I think the period of silence would be very useful."
Their comments followed a sharp criticism in Brexit's debate, which was not the first time the former Secretary of Foreign Affairs, Boris Johnson.
In an interview with BBC journalist Andrew Marro, Theresa May later confirmed that she believed in Brexit and that her cabinet plan could ensure a favourable free trade with the European Union.
Mr. Davidson also said that he would promise to prevent Scotland's second referendum on independence in other elections, because in 2014 "studies were promised that such an event would be the only one in their generation".
Asked about a possible re-referendum on Brexit, she said: "If we are talking about Scotland's history, I have repeatedly stated that it is impossible to repeat the referendum if you are a nationalist and the result does not satisfy you.
I would rather, if I said that another referendum on Brexit could be held, because I expected a different result."

Christine'a Blasey Ford confirmed a statement on sexual harassment suspected by Brettas Kavanaugh
Lelanda Keyser, who was in high school friends with Dr. Christine'a Blasey Ford, accused a candidate in the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh's sexual harassment, when both of them were teenagers, wrote a letter to the Senate Court Committee and explained that even though he did not remember the evening in the house where the attack was possible, he believed the Ford story.
In the past, Keyser made a statement through his lawyer that he did not remember that evening and did not even know if he had agreed to Kavanaugh.
On Thursday, Kavanaugh’s testimony to the Court’s Committee often referred to Keyser’s statement as proof of his innocence, but did not mention Keyser’s claim to trust the Ford’s words.
On Friday, President Trump asked the FTB to conduct a study during the week when Senator Jeff Flake and other senators of interest asked to give time to the investigation and to postpone the entire Senate’s vote on Kavanaugh.
On Saturday, Keyser sent a letter to the Committee, stating that he wanted to "by contributing to the additional FTB investigation" on Kavanaugh.
“But, as my client has already explained, she is unknown to Judge Kavanaugh and does not remember the evening or the meeting he would have had with or without Dr. Ford,” says Keyser, lawyer Howard Walsh.
The letter further explains that Keyser "has not rejected Dr. Ford's statement and has already told the press that he believes in Dr. Ford's certificate."
"But the simplest and unchangeable truth is that it cannot be confirmed, because it does not mention that happening," continues the letter.
Kavanaugh's friend, Mark Judge, who was allegedly near the scene of the attack, also claimed to have contributed to the FTB investigation.
Illicitly, Chicago's people talk about life with a corrupt cop and get him
The Chief Prosecutor of Illinois is trying to change the history of Chicago police after a dark period.
A dishonest policeman is believed to have exploited innocent people in social housing and wrongly seized many people.
To date, 42 people have been unjustly convicted.
Ida B. Wells is currently only an empty site instead of the project's social housing project, and more than a decade ago, their people in the horse used to corrupt Chicago police.
They were led by Sergeant Ronald Watts.
The inhabitants blamed him and his tactics for the oppression of property, the slander of police reports, and the oppression of prisoners.
Willie's Martin and Cleonas Globeris are two of the judges who have so far been tried by the Cook County Attorney General Kim Foxx.
"If you didn't work with him, you would end up bad.
You were his enemy.
You prevented him from acting and profiting," said Cloone Glober about Watts.
“I was very afraid.
I wanted to get out of that area,
But I didn't have to go," said Willie's Martin.
The lawyers of the Foxx Ethics Section will review further 30-40 cases related to Watts.
Ida B. Wells, the resident of the social housing house Landonas Allen, said that many people decided not to worry about Watts.
“More than anything,” he said.
"But this was not important."
According to another former resident, Clarissa Baker, no one believed in the people’s words about the officer in the official duties.
"He's got his leg.
Who will believe us?"
said Baker.
Joshua Tepferis, who was working on a project at Chicago University, said that no one really believed them.
“All was busy, because these people didn’t seem important and worried, because they – the black people in the social community – were thought to be guilty of something,” Tepfer said.
‘Sergan Watts sat in prison for 22 months in 2013 to try to steal FTB informants.
Martez Wise's also sentenced to imprisonment thanks to Watts.
I just had a son.
I couldn't have been with him for four years.
He almost didn't know me because he was just born, so I had to reinstate him," Wise said.
"I lose four years without a need."
For 72 years, Fidelity believed in the success of block chains, virtual reality and artificial intelligence
The potential of Fidelity blocks has been observed until 2018 when all corporations started talking about this technology.
The Director-General, Abby Johnson, led the investment in cryptovoivorates, the most risky and unprovoked asset class in recent years.
"Just about two years ago, I and other senior leaders were smarter than what's going on, especially in the bitcoin market," Johnson said.
We started to talk, and we realized that we had to explain.
Smalums encouraged the launch of the "cataine" bitcoins in the New Hampshire department, when the price of this cryptovailability was about $180.
Last December, the price was nearly $200,000, and, according to Johnson, “we were surprised that we started to earn higher prices, even though we never believed that. ”
It did not specify how much bitcoins were "exposed" or how much Fidelity was earned.
"Fidelity" workers are clearly interested in these technologies.
For workers, a block chain club called “Bitas and Blockes”, which organizes seminars and meetings with specialists, now has some 2,600 members.
The company agreed with Coinbase, which enabled Fidelity customers to verify the remainder of the encryption using the Fidelity mobile software.
In 2015, there was an opportunity to sacrifice the funds by bitcoins.
According to Johnson, the company rejected most of the other possible uses of bitcoins or at least refused them for a short time.
We're trying to monitor the market.
Until now, Katie Chase, the leading technology centre strategy for Fidelity and the Block Chain Incubator (part of FCAT), is looking for ways to use public and business blocks.
Chase was unable to comment on specific projects, but revealed that he was very interested in customers, partners and employees.
"It's all very new.
If you get information, you'll understand that you're still trying to find conceptual evidence," Chase said.
We have tried to adapt block chains to different situations and we have learned a lot, but technology is not yet so advanced as to solve such problems."
Until then, she said, the group focuses more on trying to understand the nature of these obstacles.
They try to understand how to calculate physical objects, such as art works, value in chips or use blocks chains in the supply chain.
"Because this is not the focus, but I think it will finally get interesting," Chase said.
"Fidelity will be prepared for this."
As an example, she pointed out the "Pebble" newspaper, which was completely unsuccessful in its trading standards, but finally purchased "Fidelity".
Its group created a programme for a smart clock, which was stopped to produce after three years, when millions were collected through the Kickstarter collective financing project.
Apple Watch, Fidelity was ready for the market.
It quickly adapted the Pebble programme for the new Apple product.
"We were not absolutely sure that the Pebble newspaper would be popular, but we wanted to be prepared if people liked smart watches," she said.
"We stored knowledge and were ready when smart clocks were released to the mass market."
Earthquakes and tsunamis ravaged the island of Celebration
On Friday, September 29, Indonesia’s island of Slaves was hit by a massive earthquake of 7.5 bullets, caused by tsunamis and killed by nearly 400 people.
There are many injured and it is believed that the number of dead will rise.
According to the representative of the Indonesian disaster management agency, electricity and communications are not affected, and it is therefore difficult to assess the damage in the city and the nearby Dongal fishing community.
California students wore masks with racist inscriptions
As reported by the CNN branch of KGTV, the Escondido Schools Union confirmed this week that about 10 students had taken a poorly planned decision to demonstrate racism at the senior class event.
"We are proud that everyone in our school is being accepted and that there is no fear of diversity," said Director Adriana Lepe- Ramirez.
"We will not tolerate the promotion of racism and isolation."
The report also states that the incident is investigating Escondido's secondary school, union officials and local police.
"The school administrators have contacted the parents and guardians of advanced students and will be subject to criminal penalties," the report says.
On the basis of a police report, students from the school north of San Diego were wearing masks with letters from which a racist tape was drawn and photographed through the posters.
The school usually approves the recordings in advance, but with the photos taken officially, some students choose their own words.
The Union report states that such behaviour "is incompatible with the culture, values or history of the secondary school of Escondido".
"We must understand the impact of our words and actions and take responsibility for the decisions we make every day," said Lepe-Ramirez.
"Escondida's secondary school will continue to be a culture based on family values and unity throughout the community."
The former teacher of Cade's Panel told the KGTV channel that the video that was seen in the social media had corrupted him.
"It hurt me personally," he said.
“It seemed funny to them, but it didn’t.
Only fools can laugh from such things."

"Now better than ever, I understand that America's best needs a leader who will respect and value them."
Elizabeth Warren said he was thinking about candidacing the presidents after the mid-term election
"It is time for women to march to Washington and correct the corrupt government to which women must be led," said the Senator of Democrats, speaking of the rumors gathered at the Holocaust in Massachusetts.
"I therefore call on you to think carefully after 6 November whether or not it is appropriate to apply to the Presidents."
Warren, trying to defend his position in the competitions with a Republican representative in the country of Geoff Diehlu, said earlier that the presidents were uninvited because he wanted to pay attention to the work of the Senate.
"It is very important to focus on the mid-term elections and to act as if the only important thing would be 2020," she told reporters in August, speaking in the National Press Club.
"The most important fight is mid-term elections, and they are important not only in Massachusetts, but also throughout the country."
Warren has long been considered a potential candidate for democracy in 2020, which can compete with President Donald Trump.
However, it would look forward to the difficult struggle of the early elections, which may include other well-known democrats – former Vice President Joe Biden, California Senator Kamala Harris and Senator Kirsten Gillibrand.
Psychiatric clinics are associated with a third fatality in less than a year.
According to The Mail, a third person has been murdered in a luxury psychiatric clinic for years.
On 7 April, Shaquelle Vidal (23rd) died on a voluntary holiday in West London, Marylebon, in the Nightingale hospital.
Her boyfriend James Lyle (57) – the manager of the Risk Insurance Fund, millionaires and former supporter of the Conservative Party – paid her maintenance costs for five years.
The future chief chef died almost six months ago when Daisy Boyd (28th) was the founder of the River Cafe, Rose Gray.
D. Boyd died on 5 October after a visit to cocaine, which was illegally introduced by a clinical visitor, after his departure from the publishing company, Dan Macmillan (43).
Two months ago, artist Alan MacDonald (61) was released from the hospital four days ago.
In May, the Supervisory Quality Commission criticised Nightingale for not trying to prevent illegal inputs.
The BBC series "Mock The Week" was registered at Avos Vidal daughter Shaquelle's clinic on 11 March.
Last week, at a preliminary session of the West Minister's Crown Court, Queen's attorney Katie Gollop said that Shaquelle was released from AWOL on 29 March and that after the week, he returned to a mental state that he understood.
Mr. Gollop, acting on behalf of Avos Vidal, said: "My client wants to know what happened to Shaquelle ...>, what she was working with and what she was working with."
Her name was Shaquelle, Mr. Lyle.
“I know that Shaquelle continued to communicate with James Lyle and he was in New York at the time,” said the film director John Gordillo (52).
At the Gordillo meeting, he revealed that on 4 April Shaquelle called him and said that he wanted to buy and drink cyanide and that he had been calling clinics for 20 minutes since the call "more than a dozen times", but no one responded.
“I see that further events could have been avoided if anyone had responded,” he added.
On 5 April, the clinical doctor found that Shaquelle’s mental condition is extremely poor.”
After less than 48 hours, she started running the computer.
The representative of Nightingale expressed his sympathy for families and friends and said: “Our clinical objective is to provide high-quality care in a safe, environmentally friendly environment.”

Led Zeppelin again appealed to the court for allegedly stolen Stairway To Heaven guitar rifle
Led Zeppelin was again brought before the court on the occasion of the "Starway To Heaven" song, which was allegedly stolen by the group.
It is said that part of the British Group's 1971 hits have been depleted.
The Court rejected the judgment in 2016 that the group did not take the name of the other group Spirit.
In 2015, Michael Skidmore's trusted guitarist presented the complaint.
It seems that the performance of the "Led Zeppelin" song "Starway to Heaven" will take a long time – as it itself sings.
The group will again stand before the Court of Justice on the convictions of the 1971 Balady guitar rifle.
The US Court of Appeal rejected the 2016 judgment that the group did not copy the start of the hit from the Spirit group.
The judge of the court is said to have made mistakes, such as misinformation about copyright laws.
She was returned to the court.
Spiritist Randy Wolfe's reliable Michael Skidmore's first application was filed in 2015.
The police robbery in Michigan ended when the police transferred a suspect's murder to them.
The suspect in the murder of his girlfriend, Michigan, was taken after police raids that ended him on a police car.
In 33 C.E., Adam Nolin was suspected of killing his girlfriend in Michigan on Thursday, 27 C.E.
He was taken to the court on Friday at the hospital where he came to the officer when he was transferred by a police SUV car, because Nolin shot policemen trying to escape on the road where he was in intensive traffic.
Nolin has been charged with five serious crimes, including murder and police escape.
"It is not a normal but not the first case in the hospital," said Captain James Maguffe of the Vajoming Police.
“The treatment is required, but the process of justice must also continue.
The Judges often adapt to the implementation of this."
Nolin's girl's body is found on Thursday in a mobile home in the Creekside Estates area.
The mother of two children was shot with one shot, and the police immediately found Nolin a suspect.
The police then issued a public warning about Nolin and presented a brief description of the black Dodge peak in 1996.
The man was spotted in his pocket and drove to the speed of US 131 when the police tried to stop him.
Nolin and Pikapu came to the concrete wall, then ran out of the car and let them run fast.
As he ran away, he shot at the cheerleaders.
One policeman sat in the police car and moved Nolina from behind.
The observer filmed the event.
She is taken to a hospital in difficult but stable condition and will remain there until she is released and transferred to Kent County Prison.
"This event showed that West Michigan policemen are risking their health in order to protect the community," said Maguffe.
"They took the man quite quickly and with the right means, and we are very proud of them."
Noline is charged with a total of two charges of murder and is also accused of fleeing from the police, carrying a hidden weapon and committing a serious crime by using a shooting weapon.
He has not yet been convicted of the murder of his girlfriend because the investigation is ongoing.
"Of course, we are continuing a murder investigation that will soon be completed so that we can report it to the Kent County Prosecutor," said Maguffe.
The judge mocked the courageous man who had thrown his teeth into his house for a broken wagon.
The judge had no compassion for the courageous man who stood before the two criminals who tried to break into his house.
Although one of his thugs tried to drive him on a wooden board, in 63 C.E., David Oldham failed to make it.
A man in charge of the university’s territory defended, beat both criminals, and kicked one of their teeth.
The rebels fled, but after a mustache on Mr. Oldham's blood was left, according to which Craig Ford was found and taken after four months.
In announcing the sentence to Ford, who lost his teeth trying to enter the house of Mr. Oldhamo 400 000 £ of individual values Ormskerke, Lankašyre, the Queen Judge Clement Goldstone said: “You probably did not believe such a reaction, when you were caught in sight of only the eyes and nose, you met him at home, he broke you.
He also beat your partner, who tried to climb the second floor and jump off the roof.
On Friday, when Ford was sentenced to three and four months in prison, the judge said: “I hope you have learned two lessons.
The first is not to raise David Oldham, the second is not to start with the police.
Because of your crimes, you now have one tooth less than you used to, and you've got a dog in your mouth.
It's a little bit of a punishment."
He added: “I want to congratulate Mr. Oldham on how he has responded to your actions.”
Prosecutor Derek Jones said that Ford had already been sentenced to another incarceration in 2016 and had to be sentenced to three years, but had been released in a fair manner.
Mr. Oldhams appealed to the Royal Court of Liverpool when he heard a noise at home on 5 April at 7 p.m.
“ Mr. Oldham, who is a wealthy man, went out of the house and courageously opposed the accused, ” said John.
Fearing for his safety, he punched him in the face, tearing him apart and tearing his teeth.
Then the other intruder jumped out of the roof in front of Mr. Oldham, who instinctively knocked him in the face."
According to Mr. Jones, the attendant took a wooden board and tried to drive to Oldham, and Ford said: “Kill him, he has thrown my teeth out.”
The common man told Oldham, "If you let us go, we'll go" and he and Ford escaped from the crime scene.
On 2 August, the police hired Ford to travel to a place in the Wavertree area.
The Forda went after the police dog, and then this one stabbed him in the heel.
It's supposed to be the second inlet still open.
Fords admitted that he had been in a position of no permanent residence for 25 years. Ford admitted that he was guilty of intrusion, collapse and dangerous driving, although this was forbidden to him and he did not have a driver's license.
The criticism of such activists made to Johnson came with applause.
These activists today buried Boris Johnson when he was expelled as “a black and aggressive man”.
P Johnson, attempting to convince ordinary people with his compromises about Brexit, called for a strict assessment by former Minister of Trade Digby Jones, who was also agreed to by members of the Birmingham Conference this evening.
David Davis also attacked Mr. Johnson because he cares about the newspaper headlines, not solid politics.
Speaking to MailOnline, Mr May, the associate in the Cabinet of Ministers added that he was simply "crazy" because he could not be a full-fledged leader.
The opposition was met when the former Secretary of Foreign Affairs re-invented the Minister's "Checkers" plan and called it "unreasonable" and "totally absurd".
Mr Johnson also added that he sincerely believed in the project, and that is what she did two years ago in the referendum.
It also called on the government to support ambitious projects such as bridges between Northern Ireland and Scotland.
However, Mr May felt that her critics were playing political games and claimed that she was not bluffing and ready for difficult negotiations with the EU.
In an interview with Andrew Marro BBC, which was launched by a press conference, Mr. May said, "I believe in Brexit."
The former Lebanese Trade Minister, Lord Jones, now acting independently, has called for his consent to hear Brexit's perspective.
People were disappointed when he gave an opinion on Mr Johnson, who allegedly replied to the concerns of the businessmen concerned.
In particular, without mentioning Mr. Johnson, Lord Jones made it clear that he was “a poor and aggressive man. ”
"The business is very important, therefore, by saying "Valniop business", the former Secretary of Foreign Affairs showed that he is really a poor and aggressive person," he said.
"I totally disagree with him."
Lord Jones also welcomed the response of Mr May to the Zalcburg leaders at the meeting of the EU leaders to his cabinet plan.
The Scottish leader Ruth Davidson also once criticized Mr Johnson, recalling that he was a high-ranking government official during the Brexit negotiations.
Mr May, in the Cabinet of Ministers, Mr MailOnline said that the intervention is not very serious and Mr Johnson does not have enough support between Parliament to be able to eliminate the Prime Minister.
They said: “Now such news is not very dangerous.
He's noiseing, but he doesn't have enough support in the parliamentary party, and he knows that himself.
We see the sharp contrast between David Davis, who respectfully expressed his opinion, and Boris, who shares his personal ambitions."
The Business Secretary, Greg Clarks, criticized Mr Johnson, who attacked the businessmen who were skeptical of Brexit.
Speaking at a conference held in Birmingham, Mr. Clark said that Mr. Johnson was "totally wrong".
He said: “I am amazed that someone in general can think so.
There are no successful economies in the world that do not have successful flourishing companies."
In an interview with Sky News, Ridge on Sunday, Mr Davis admitted that the coming months would not be easy, as the EU will try to force the United Kingdom to give a lot of advantages.
However, he believes that the government must not compromise and reach a similar agreement to the Canada Treaty, rather than the one proposed by the Cabinet of Ministers.
Asked how Mr. Johnson managed to lead the tower, he did not miss the opportunity to gain the former Secretary of Foreign Affairs.
In line with Mr Johnson's proposal to bridge the bridge between Northern Ireland and Scotland, he said: "One of the shortcomings of British politics is a fantastic idea for politicians."
He added: "Our communication is chaotic, and many of his ideas are suitable for titles, but not for strong politics."
Bulgaria spends £80 million on poor recovery of European taxpayers' money
Bulgaria has spent £80 million on the poor old-school restaurant of European taxpayers, which now appears to be built from 'silver and cardboard'.
The Balkan country has released £80 million from the European Regional Development Fund.
Instead of returning to the previous size, the restaurant was inundated.
The local government of the areas of the Krakrak fortress has promised to re-enter the work.
The Bulgarian government has released ten million EU-wide non-nomist medieval pills for a restaurant.
The Balkan country has released £80 million from the European Regional Development Fund for the restoration of old castles and fortresses, but instead of returning their former size, it has gained confidence in the construction work.
Relics after expensive reconstructions seem to be built from "silver and cardboard", so it is no longer attractive to tourists.
For example, the memorial guards found that the fortress of the Middle Ages of the Western city of Pernik in Bulgaria, Krakra and the Roman fort Trayanov Vrata, next to Ihtimano, was reconstructed using polymer concrete, most commonly used as a base.
According to The Telegraph, the EU-Bulgaria government has privately agreed that this failure must be learned.
"The fortress is a crafty state," said architect and memorial guard Stella Duleva about Trayanov Vrata.
It took 16 centuries, and now it's damaged."
Such reactions were expected after the Krakrak fort restaurant in Pernik, and the local government promised the removal of the part delivered in 2019.
The fortress of Pernik has been removed as a result of untrustworthy modifications.
The Byzantine Yailata fort is designed as a cheese fortress, because it has been restored from yellow white blocks that are not related to the air-affected façade.
These unsuccessful efforts coincide with new doubts about how the European Union is using development funds.
This year's Distinguished Gentleman's Ride event is a styling barber mine.
These stylish costumed motorcyclists from all over the United Kingdom are released to streets on vintage motorcycles to collect money from the Movember fund.
The event is called "Kilnaus Genentelman's trip" and is organised annually to raise money and raise public awareness about prostate cancer.

In Sydney, for the first time, Mark Hawkas organized the "Distinguished Gentleman's Ride" event in Australia.
The idea was inspired by a picture of Don Draperio's performance in the series "Mad Men", where he sits on the classic motorcycle with the best in his line.
This year, hundreds of barbers, including a spicy cab dog, were riding on the Tower Bridge in London.
Teniso axis Boris Beckeris was treated with skin cancer
Boris Becker thanked doctors for successfully removing skin cancer.
In the pictures of Becker, you can see a small patch to the eyes from the sun.
"It was a normal check and it seems less than it really is," he said to the German newspaper.
After being treated with skin cancer, the tennis legend Boris Beckeris was photographed with a patch on his nose.

A 24-year-old bullet in the unidentified train platform for body sizes did not die
On the train platform, the undisputed naked British athlete decided not to sleep.
Jessica Mayho, who won the silver medal this year at the British athletes' championship, said he was on Friday afternoon at Lids Station.
At the age of 24, 11 inches [15 cm] and five feet [11 cm], Mr Mayho said that he had been pushed by a man in front of the train.
At about 17:00 a.m., the male who was attacked on the platform took her off as a "great".
However, there is a rising sports star in pursuit of a man's return to Tokyo Olympics in the British team 2020.
From the western part of the city of Kyrgyz, in Yorkshire, Father Mayho said: “I lived until other people lost their eyes on the full platform.
Such people can be acquiesced and forced to trust themselves no more, but it is the human body, the "mechanism".
As soon as he announced his adventure on Twitter, the young athlete called for a great deal of social support.
MBE ordered the knight Andy's Lewis wrote: "Great!!
Maybe he's drunk with the blind?
It's crazy, Jesse, it's all right with you.
Don't let that idiot ruin your pleasure."
Gavin Gray's added: "I'm crazy.
Not only because of him, but also because of the circumstances that ignored him.
I'm glad you're okay.
You're an example of a new generation.
You show that you need to be proud of yourself, but not satisfied can awaken!"
While working at the University of Lids, Mr Mayho was interested in youth, one of her older nurses was encouraged.
Since then, she has been able to take her second place at the British Müller's Senior Championship, which took place in Birmingham in July this year.
She won the British championship medal just last month after winning in the North England Games.
He refused to comment further on the event.
If you break at least 50 million users, the Facebook will have to pay £1.25 billion.
Using the security gap, criminals were able to reach at least 50 million Facebook accounts.
However, a high degree of intrusion is reported only after three days on Friday.
Facebook now threatens a huge penalty under new European data laws
Once at least 50 million shares have been broken, the Facebook may have to pay a fine of £1.25 billion.
The offenders could have reached a security gap, so much personal information could have been disclosed.
However, Facebook only reported the entry on Friday three days ago, and until yesterday, it was not possible to tell how much British publications had been damaged.
While the search for the programme continues, the Irish Data Protection Commissioner, who checks how the Internet giant complies with the requirements of European data compliance since its headquarters in Dublin, criticised the company by saying, "The message is not complete."
Facebook is a major penalty under the new European Union data laws, as companies may be required to pay up to four percent of the world turnover.
In the past year, Facebook earned $31.2 billion.
The offenders have reached an appointment using the "View As" function, which allows users to see how their profiles look to others.

In 1954 he established a book club "Nidas" and led him until 1957 and 1983-1991.

The following records are being heard in the MG Baltic case: the defendants consulted the Gabrielis Landsberg
The hearing opened a conversation between former Vice-President Raymond Kurlianski and former "worker" Vytautas Gapshi on November 2015.
Listening to the record makes it difficult to understand exactly what the accused are currently talking about.
True, the record says that R. Kurlianskis and V. Gapšys are talking about the Christmas celebration, several times he calls the name of the current conservative leader Gabrieliaus Landsberg, but what he is talking about is difficult to understand.
Penalties for both natural and legal persons
In the case of political corruption, three legal and five natural persons are accused: the Working Party and the Liberal Consensus, the MG Baltic, the former Liberal and Labour Leaders, Masiuli, Vytaut Gapsi, the former Liberal, Ms Gustaini, Mr Seimas, Mr Steponaviči and the former Vice-President, Mr Kurlianski.
Interests of the Working Party on the effects of counterfeiting and trade, the Liberal Movements are suspected of counterfeiting, trade and abuse, and MG Baltic is suspected of bribery and trade of these parties.
The officials suspect that the politicians took or spoke about the harvests with MG Baltic Vice-President Kurlianski, who later proposed or supported the Group's initiatives in the Seim and other institutions.
Former President of the Liberal Consciousness of the Liberals, Mr Masuulis, is suspected of the effect of trade, of counterfeiting and illegal enrichment, of the suspicions presented to the former vice-president of this party by Mr Steponaviči, of abuse, of the former member of the Vilnius City Council, Mr Gustaini.
V. Gapšys is suspected of the effects of counterfeiting and trade, Mr Kurlianskis - of the effects of bribery and trade.
Question: Who has the greatest opportunity to win the second presidential election?
In the poll on the second round of elections, four candidates were included in the top four rankings - economist Gitanas Nauseda, the unpublished minister, Saulius Skvernelis and two Fathers of the Union - candidates who participated in the first election of the Lithuanian Christian Democratic Party (TS-LKD) - Seimo Member Ingrid Šimonytė and diplomat Vygaudas Ushakkas.
It is true that on Sunday the TS-LKD received support in the elections, I. Shimonytė and V. Usakaks withdrew from the electoral struggle.
As data show, if the elections were to take place in the near future, in all cases, the second President's tour would win Mr Nauseda, but the leader of "Vilmorus", sociologist Vladas Gaidys says that there are too early conclusions to make.
"Departs (from others - DELFI) Naused, but it is very important to see whether the parties are talking about, or about people who are dynamic.
These were the duplicates of the Simonyta from one study to the other, and the Nauseda growth was stopped, and even the decrease of Ushaka was.
This growth is very important to you," says the sociologist.
Moreover, in view of the results of the survey, it is clear that many percent of the people have not yet decided what they will vote for or consider generally refusing to vote.
If the second presidential election were to be convened by I. Šimonytė and S. Skvernelis, the fight would be waged - for I. Šimonytė, 32.7%, for S. Skvernelė 30.9%.
True, even 36.4 per cent of the people replied that they would not vote for any of these candidates, or they did not know who they would vote for or vote for.
Sociologist V. Gaidys once again stressed that until now we have seen not a full picture, because all the candidates who would apply to the less successful Lithuanian electorate have not yet been published.
"If we looked at last year's elections, there are many parties in Lithuania, where are their candidates?
For example, where is the candidate for social democrats? For 30 years, was he a candidate, not now?
When you publish, you will see how his opportunities with other candidates are met.
So that side of Lithuania, which is less successful until it is less reflected," said V. Gaidys.
In turn, a political scientist at the University of Vilnius Institute of International Relations and Political Sciences (VU TSPMI) Majvydas Jastramskis says that it is still very early to draw conclusions, and all three candidates, who have rejected V. Ushakka since the fight, seem to be in the mood.
"I can say from my research experience that these differences mean nothing.
The difference between 5 percentage points does not really show the advantage of any candidate.
The only thing I could see was that Nausseda would appear well before Ushakak (...) again, if those people were really coming to vote.
Naused against Skvernel also looks good, but we now compare apples and potatoes because for example Nauseda has already announced that he will participate, Skvernel has not been published.
In addition, the survey was conducted before the initial conservative elections, as it would appear after them?", says the politician.
According to him, Mr Nausseda has a small plus, but when all the candidates are announced, he can be visited.
"The situation is quite the same.
Naused, Skverneil, Shimonytė - results for the surroundings.
I would like to remind you that after the remaining half of the 2003 presidential election, Roland Paks had 5% support to vote for it and then won the election.
This cannot be expected," said Mr Jastramskis.
DELFI recalls that the candidates have already been announced in the presidential elections by economist G. Nausseda, Seimas Member I. Šimonytė, philosopher Arvydas Juozaitis, economist, Seimas Member Aušra Maldeikienė, member of the Liberal Consistency of Petras Austrevičius, Seimas Member Naglis Pudakis and member of the European Parliament Valentinas Mazuronis.
Iran blames Israel for attempting to set up a cyberattack
"The regime whose use of cyber-weapons history is clear from such cases as (computer virus) Stuxnet (declaration), this time tried to damage Iran's communications infrastructure," said Minister of Information Mohammad Javad Azari Jeromi during Twitter.
He was referring to an attack by the Stuxnet virus in 2010, which caused damage to Iran's nuclear facilities.
It is believed that Israel and the United States have established this harmful programme.
"Because of our technical teams' alertness, they left their hands empty.
We will continue to talk about this negative action in international forums," said Mr J. A. Jeromi.
Deputy Minister Hamidas Fattachi said that the technical team had recorded a number of attempts on their systems on Monday, but the attackers had been "strengthened".
In the health club Impuls man did bad, he failed to recover
The accident occurred about 10.40 a.m.
Suddenly, in 1945, a man who was swimming in the pool suddenly fell ill, and he ran after the water.
The man was quickly removed from the water, but he was already unconscious.
It was tried to catch him.
Soon thereafter, the emergency doctor tried to rescue him, but he was unable to save his life.
He died in the hospital in the car.
This disaster was reported by the Head of the Impuls Health Club Network Antan Sakalauskas.
"In our data, a 73-year-old man visited our health club, Fabionskių, with his wife on Monday morning.
Baseine's client flew for about 30 minutes, then came up to the pool trails to rest and a few minutes after an unexpected crash.
The party was people - a client who was swimming in the common road and the pool supervisor - immediately responded, pulled him out of the water and started to cook.
The man was constantly caught up until he arrived.
The club staff immediately sought emergency medical attention, which came within 5 minutes.
When the doctor arrived, he restored the man’s pulse and breathing and moved him to a medical car.
During the hospital, the doctors tried to stabilize the condition of the man, unfortunately, after 20 minutes we received information that the man did not survive.
We mean a sincere sense of the death of a man’s family because of his loss.
According to the original data, the accident could have led to the client’s health problems.
According to the information provided by family physicians, he has diabetes.
We note that in the face of serious health problems, it is always very important to be responsible for assessing your options and to consult doctors and health club specialists.
In all health club facilities there is an alarming supervisor whose main task is to monitor the pool, its access and ensure customer safety, it distinguishes clear clothing from other employees.
Such pool supervisors shall have radio stations that can contact the administration and registry immediately, respond to their requests or provide assistance.
Four times a year, staff training is taking place in connection with the security programme - much more often than the laws require.
During this period, staff shall increase their theoretical and practical knowledge, and shall be taught how to act in the event of an accident, whether they observe the rules of procedure and internal procedures.
How Portugal has radically solved the problem of heroin
In the 10th century, Portugal faced a heroin crisis.
Each Portuguese woman knew something that would be affected by this death drug.
Now, in just a few decades ago, the country is proud of one of the lowest drug-related mortality indicators in the world.
In Norway, the missing son of a woman: he changed even four families and stopped speaking Lithuanian
According to the LNK press report, the Lithuanian lost the right to raise his son four years ago and to see him in a decision by the Norwegian Children's Rights Service "Barnevernet" and the courts.
Women’s history has led to an international scandal followed by the entire media.
The National Points for Returning the boy to Lithuania were held for his teacher in Lithuania and Norway.
However, the audience of Grazinai and her family did not help to bring back the sons of Lithuania's citizenship.
Today, a woman relates how she has lived for the past few years, separated from her son, and how her and her child’s meetings take place after two years of interruption.
At the time of the loss of the right to heal sons, the boy was 8th, today the 12th, the beginning of adolescence.
For the first two years, she had never seen a son, which was forbidden.
Later, she was granted the right to see her son twice a year, almost an hour later.
The last, a few months ago, the number of observations of the Lithuanian court was increased to three times a year and extended to two hours.
Consistency with the son reminds us every time of seeing him in a tight-cut prison - watching officers and going to them - a secret operation.
"The son has changed even four families and no longer speaks Lithuanian," - this Tuesday evening's heart opens Beauty, her story - in the LNK game
Eligius will not be returned to Masouli for personal money taken over the ship
On Tuesday, the Court of Appeal announced that the defendant's complaint was rejected.
The order is final and without a complaint.
In the case of political corruption, the former head of the Liberal Consensus, E. Masuulis, appealed to the Court of Appeal, asking him to return some personal money - the money taken from him and the wife's money.
A total of more than EUR 242 thousand was taken from E. Masoula.
Such money shall be subject to a temporary limitation of ownership rights and shall be continuously extended.
It was last extended by the Vilnius District Court on 15 October.
E. Masuulis did not ask the Court of Appeal to repay all the money - he seeks to recover from the wife's money taken 800 euros and its money - EUR 690, US$ 130, US$ 1600.
Former politicians say that the last money was allocated to the US planned trip.
E. Masiulio's lawyer, Mindaugas Blauvas, asked the Court of Appeal to repay the money on Monday, since the spouses were working well paid, had the opportunity to have such amounts.
Prosecutor Justus Laucius asked the court to dismiss the complaint.
"The decision of the District Court shall be legal and reasonable and no longer limited to the assets specified in the abovementioned charges.
The Court rightly found that there are grounds for confiscation of assets, as well as for the confiscation of extended assets", said Mr Laucius at the Court's meeting.
On 15 October, the Vilnius District Court decided not to repay more than 242 thousand euros in the case of political corruption to E. Masouli.
These money can be found through a strict corruption of the past policy in the home and in the car.
The three panel of judges found that the substance of the case showed that ownership rights were limited only to funds that constituted the subject of criminal offences committed against E. Masuuli.
"In view of the extent of the restriction, it is concluded that the right of the defendant's property is not disproportionately limited or that the restriction applies for too long," - says the judge Nijolie Zimkinė, Jurgitis Kolyčienės and Fire Trump.
The Judges noted that in Case E. Masuulis is accused of committing serious crimes, the criminal case is large and complex, and therefore it is necessary to extend the time limit for the limitation of ownership to ensure the possible confiscation of property and the extension of property.
The prosecutors say that former MG Baltic vice-president Raymond Kurlianskis gave EUR 106 thousand to E. Masuuli for the Group's decision-making of benefits to the Seim.
The two defendants believe that E. Masiul's money - €90,000 - was the Kurlianski loan.
According to the case, E. Masiul is located 242.4 thousand euros, 130 UK dollars sterling and 1.6 thousand US dollars.
E. Masuulis and his lawyer tried to recover money on several occasions, but the courts rejected their requests.
Former policies have said that part of these funds belongs to other persons and was intended to invest in real estate or is his family's money.
He also claimed that there was no data to be collected in a criminal way.
In the past, the Court of Appeal has announced that E. Masiuli's claims that these funds could have been obtained by the adoption of more than EUR 100 000.
Legal protection claims that the remainder of the net money taken through the coast could have been obtained from unspecified sources of income, not declared, not confirmed by documents, and perhaps no legitimate income.
In the case of political corruption, three legal persons are charged - the Labour Party, the Liberals, the MG Baltic Group.
In addition to E. Masiulio, the case was brought before the former "worker" Vytaut Gapši, former parliamentarian Charuna Gustani, Seimas member Gintar Stepnavici and former Vice-President MG Baltic to R. Kurlianski.
Mr Kurlianskis is accused of giving the former parliamentarians Masulia, Mr Gustaini and Mr Gapši.
The Americans have recorded dangerous Russian manpower destroyers
During the 25-minute takeover, according to US military forces, the Russian SU-27 rushed directly through the plane.
The Russian plane went through it the second time, using the speed of the train, and made a search with the underworld.
Passengers reported turbulence during the first approach and shock during the second approach.
The Russian army has the right to practice in international airspace, but this interaction was irresponsible.
We expect international standards that ensure security and prevent incidents that correspond to behaviour, including the 1972 Agreement on Marine Accidents and the Prevention of the Sea (INCSEA), - in its report the US military forces said.
"Unsafety actions increase the risk of miscalculation and possible conflicts," the report notes.
The Russian Ministry of Defence acknowledged the incident, but believed that the Russian SU-27 was holding "safe distance" from the US plane.
The cost of parental leave continues to be reduced: for sub-contracted activities up to EUR 50 per month
According to a survey conducted by the market and public opinion research company "Baltic Studies", the survey carried out at the end of August revealed that a third (32%) of parents of their one-school age had spent less than 100 euros this year, a fifth (21%) had spent from 101 to 150 euros, three out of ten (29%) - from 151 to 200 euros, and a fifth (18%) had spent more than 200 euros at the end of the summer.
The parents whose children began to go to the first class in this school year gave their child’s school basket an average of about 220 euros, while the other parents, who had already completed the first class, gave their child a lower amount - an average of about 160 euros.
However, the cost is low and for the academic year, as parents often have to pay money to their children’s boarders and tutors.
Depending on the nature of the activity, the price of one barrel in the country may vary from EUR 20 to EUR 100.
Parents who have children of school age were asked to tell them how average a month they plan to devote to their single child’s job.
The quarter (23%) of the child surveyed planned to pay up to €20 per month, another quarter (26%) claimed to pay up to €50, three out of 10 (31%) allocated to the child's pre-school employment from €50 to €100 per month, and the sixth of the parents (17%) indicated that it was planned to pay €100 or more.
True, in Lithuania, children of school age are given an informal child education basket, which consists of 15 euros a month.
However, these money can be used only for one barrel, and if the price of employment is higher, the difference must be borne by parents.
In the case where a child attends several bars or grows in the family several children of school age, the cost of teaching activities may be doubled.
As the marketing manager of the loan company Vivus.lt, Justin Ambrasienė, says that small or medium-sized incomes for saving children's stockpiles, especially when growing up in a family of children, may become a minor challenge.
On the beginning of the school year, parents have a head, where to get money for practice, office goods, or new sports clothes.
Now the main concern is how to hire children after school without paying for that burden.
We note that parental expenditure is particularly increasing in August when it is necessary to prepare well for the new years of science, but later it remains higher than in the summer because parents are willing to invest in their savings.
Often, when money is scarce and they are responsible for their options, they are cut and borrowed," says J. Ambrasienė.

The Kaunas enjoy the fourth already deranged trolleybus
Today, the fourth exhibition of the mobile street "Atia old, good news" has already appeared on Kaunas Street - a painting and inscription "Sienograph locks" of the old trolleybus.
The municipality of Kaunas reported on the new favorite trolleybus.
"This old "Skoda" also changed its green color into a much more colorful and brighter dress.
It also shows the "Atia senius, good news!" participant, - to the photograph posted by the representatives of the municipality.
Mobile street art shows "Atia old, good news" for saying goodbye to old trolleybuses, which will be replaced next time.
In the next year, the old Škoda trolebusi will be on the way to the service of rest, replacing them with 85 new puzzles and modern Solaris trolebusi.
The portal reminds us that the first road drawings of the trolley bus crashed into Kaunas Street a month ago.
On the trolebus show some well-known accents of Kaunas street art - an old pipe and a drum.
Not a week after the first appearance on Kaunas Street, the second street artist Timothy Norvila - Morfai was created.
On the trolleybus, a smooth yellow car, which is often referred to as a mere "whale".
"You wanted to invite the trolebus.
This drawing looks very welcome, especially because it matches the trolleybus wheels.
When the wheels turn on the handle, it looks like it's part of the car.
When we painted the wheels white, we made them look like a retro-style, it really touched the whole combination.
Until the trolley bus tires were painted, it really didn't seem so funny," - as much as the previous portul kauna.dina.lt spoke street artist.
And on the third trolleybus, the painting was taken on 27 October.
It is decorated with white, yellow, orange, red, but mostly with blue colors.
This color is dominant.
On the left side of the trolleybus body there is one K.Donelaiči's house, on the right - central post.
"Wabalas" to the best of me," Morfai asked for the third trolleybus by begging the artist Morfai.
New Pircs
Kaunas Day recalls that last week Kaunas' public transport company Kaunas bus company with Polish company Solaris Bus & Coach S.A signed a 29.4 million contract indicating that Kaunas bought 85 new trolley buses.
"The years throughout their history have invested the largest amount for public transport renewal.
This contract will change the trolley buses and offer the most comfortable services for all of us serving many years in Škoda brand.
The new lowest modern trolley buses will have more seats, efficient living room conditioning and heating, high-quality information systems, video surveillance cameras, ergonomic driver's workplace.

And, of course, the modern-day trolleybuses are very exciting to the city," said Mr. Mindaug Grigeli, director-general of Kaunas Bus.
The first new trolebusi Kaunas will reach August next year, and all the old trolebusi will be replaced by December.

The invitation to celebrate the Christmas together, in addition, prompted the language that D. Ragland is planning a longer stay in the United Kingdom.
It's supposed that she wants to help her daughters before and after her birth.
Meghan and her husband, Prince Harry, were to be born in the spring of 2019.
In the arena of the "Balgiri" and again the worms show "Women's World"
After entering the autumn routine and the brighter weather, the 16th time show "Women's World" is already being prepared, not to be shaken - women announce the long weekend, because even four days' hottest fashion, style and beauty news is already here - November 8-11, in Kaunas "Zalgirio" arena.
Over the years, to see how the face of the event changes, the exhibition means no longer a series of purchases, but a tradition of giving time to itself.
It often becomes a place for friends and a reason to spend the day with a sister or a mother.
Four days of exhibition have special power - every woman here can learn the secrets of the spell, learn the tricks, look like candles every day, find unchangeable products, hear or try various procedures that inhibit the aging process of the skin.
All this and more, it promises even 415 participants who will be waiting for visitors on all three levels of the arena.
Three days will take place on the subject of beauty and health, and on Sunday, the representatives of the artistic sex will be able to hear the advice to create an exceptional image from the lips of the stylistic and netizen Victorian Shillette.

Prime Minister: after the introduction of the state payment, the wages of teachers increased by EUR 117
Since September, the average remuneration of teachers in the country with a full workload has increased by 117 euros, says Prime Minister Saulis Skvernelis.
"It is early to say how much she (new order - BNS) has advantages or shortcomings.
The fact is that those who have a full workload - their salaries have grown more than EUR 117 on average," S. Skvernelis told reporters in the government on Monday.
He called the "democratic right" to implement the plans of the professional union of Lithuanian educational workers (SPDPS) for the strike on the basis of the state payment, but stressed that the strike should not interfere with the education process.
"All forms of protest in a democratic country are permitted, possible.
If you think you need to strike, it's their right to decide.
It would not be time for children, scientists, to be affected in this area.
If the strike is to happen, it must be done in accordance with existing laws," said S. Skvernelis.
In June, Seimas approved the model for the employment of the state teachers, starting in September.
The teacher's pay has changed the hourly pay - the teacher's salary is 1512 hours a year.
The teacher’s working time is divided into three sections: contact hours, i.e. lessons, preparation for them and work for the community.
This reform, led by Andriaus Navicko, is called absurd, it is a lie that it has been adopted by the "buldozer" principle and announced an indefinite strike starting on November 12th.
The LSDPS requires immediate withdrawal of this "minute" payroll system and the establishment of an ethic model for a single-state to be made up of not more than 18 contact hours.
Also, the rate of duty for fixed-term wages to increase 20% and reduce the number of children in classes.
In addition to other innovations, a new methodology for the allocation of training funds is being criticised, because, according to the union, there is insufficient funding for home training, the sharing of classes into groups, qualifications, education assistance, and the class in large cities as has been completed.
The Ministry of Education and Science has said that the state-of-the-art teacher's work will allow the teacher's work to be regulated and to pay for all the work to the school community.
It is expected that, at the level of the teacher, the community will be able to make up to half the number of hours per year, the first two years of work, up to 40% of all hours.
It is estimated that the teacher’s working hours per week are 36 hours, of which no more than 24 contact hours per week are required to teach the subject(s).
On May, the two-hour strike launched by the LSDPS has contributed about half a hundred general educational schools, vegetables and non-formal education institutions, about 1 thousand educators.
There are about 53 thousand educators in Lithuania as a whole.
Invites to be ready: crises can be expected within 2-3 years
The economic slowdown and even crises can be expected in the next 2-3 years, but both the Bank of Lithuania and the Government of the country are much more prepared for these processes than a decade ago, in the interview "Knowledge Radio" for the "Versa position" of the Lithuanian Bank's Board of Governors, Vitas Vasiliauskas.
"Saying that the crisis is already beyond the corner, I really couldn't, but there are really signs of economic slowdown.
This year our country's economy is growing by more than 3 per cent, and we plan to grow by 2.8 per cent next year.
The main message I would like to share with the public and business is that we are ready for everything," said Mr Vasiliuskas.
He believes that there are no similar crises, so they need to be prepared differently.
The difference from the crisis that occurred decades ago is that the government at that time felt that the income generated by the growing economy would be eternal and that expenditure was planned.
In 2008, therefore, after the crisis, the costs were drastically reduced.
Now, say V. Vasilousko, the situation is different, and the crisis is better prepared.
"The truth is, we see that the assessment of the situation of the Lithuanian Bank and the Ministry of Finance varies.
We believe that we are already beyond our potential and that we need to press brakes.
At the same time, the Ministry of Finance doesn't like it," said the President of the Board of the Bank of Lithuania.
The preparation of the country's institutions for the coming crisis by V. Vasiliuska evaluates 7 out of 10 points.
According to him, a small and open economy, such as Lithuania, has a very strong external impact.
The current oppression of the great dragons - the United States, China, the European Union - will no doubt strike us together.
That is why we must be very careful.
When the economy is low to say that we have decided everything, it is possible, but I don't believe it," said Vasiliuska.
What can we look forward to for those who have borrowed large sums of money?
According to Vasiliauska, the European Central Bank has clearly set up a short-term strategy, and interest-change solutions can be expected not earlier than the next summer: "This is the main objective of trying to manage expectations".
The trend, which is of utmost concern to the head of the Bank of Lithuania, is the reduction of the labour force in our country.
"The reduction of labour is largely leading to a reduction in the competitiveness of the economy.
In addition, it is a reduction in the food supply.
Migration has allowed this year to balance this process a little bit, but it does not know whether it has been a long-term trend," my V. Vasiliuskas.
ELTA recalls that the Lithuanian Bank and the Ministry of Finance predict that the country's economy will grow by 3.4% this year, and another by 2.8%.
Swedish Conservative leader tries to re-form the government
On Monday, the President of Parliament announced Sweden's conservative leader, after two months of the elections, will be given the second opportunity to form a government.
Ulfo Kristersson (Ulfo Kristerson) is owned by the right-wing Alliance of the four-centered Allies, who received a little less vote during the September 9th election than the previous left-wing coalition of the centre.
It was difficult for both sides to get rid of the majority of the opposition to the anti-imigrasin Swedish Democratic Party, which is the result of the neo-Nazi movement.
The first attempt by Mr. Kristerson to form the government on October 14 was unsuccessful.
On 29 October, President Stefan Lofven (Stefan Lioven) announced his unsuccessful test and concluded his term of office.
In attempting to force the parties to agree, Parliament's President Andreas Norlen said that next week he would propose to Parliament as a candidate for the Prime Minister, thereby pushing the first vote from the start of the government's efforts to form.
"It is not clear in advance whether the various parties will accept Ulf Kristersson as the prime minister," the reporters said to A. Norlen.
However, he stressed that "the process must move forward and the dynamics between the parties must change".
"The wireless negotiations must end," he added.
Parliament's voting date is not clear yet, but Mr Norlen said that it is the 14th of November between possible dates.
In Sweden, the President of the Parliament may send four times to any candidate to form a government to which Parliament would agree.
If all four tests are unsuccessful, the country must hold new elections.
The current appointment of Mr. Kristersson is the third test of Mr. Norlene.
Some members of the Group of the Party of the Left and the Alliance's Christian Democrats are pressuring Mr Kristersson to accept the support of the party of the far right Swedish Democrats, but he has so far rejected this opportunity.
The Swedish Democratic Party, which received 17.6 per cent of the votes during the elections and is the third largest party, ignores the long term of the main party.
The ultra-terminal party, in the course of the elections, has successfully taken advantage of voters' anger over immigration after almost 400 thousand asylum seekers have arrived in the country since 2012 and have been affected by the decision-making process.
However, the members of the Alliance of Liberals and Centralists are categorically opposed to such ideas.
Since 2014, the Swedish Social Democrats' Party (SAP) has been able to cooperate between the blocs, but only if it maintains the Prime Minister's position.
The Alliance and the Swedish Democratic Party rejected this opportunity.
A delegation from the Government of Afghanistan will participate in peace negotiations in Russia
The delegation of the Kabul Government will be participating this month in international negotiations on the peace war in Afghanistan, officials reported on Monday.
In turn, the Taliban will consider whether to participate.
On Saturday, Russia announced that it would hold a conference in Moscow on 9 November, although the US is currently attempting to enter into bilateral negotiations with the Taliban on the cessation of a 17-year-old conflict.
The High Peace Council of the Government of Afghanistan, responsible for the efforts of combatants, will send four representatives to the meeting in Moscow, told the news agency AFP by representative Sayed Ihsan Taheri (Sajidas Ihsan Taheris).
However, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Afghanistan has avoided responding to the fact that it will send its delegation to this conference, which will focus on the launch of peace negotiations between Kabul and the Taliban.
We are still in agreement with Russia's officials, said the representative of Sebchatullah Ahmadi (Sebagtula Ahmadis). - We welcome any peace efforts the Afghans have made.
The Taliban representative Zabiullah Mujahid (Zabiula Mudjahid) said that the movement is weighing on whether to go.
Moscow also invited representatives from the US, India, Iran, China, Pakistan and five former Soviet Central Asian republics.
Pakistan, formerly accused of support for Afghanistan's Taliban, "relevantly participating", said the AFP, representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Muhammad Faisalas (Muhamadas Faisalas).
The US Embassy in Kabul has not yet responded to the request to comment.
The first meeting was scheduled in Moscow in September, but Kabului was postponed to demand that the Afghans lead the process.
The negotiations will take place in the meantime.
The newly appointed US envoy, Zalmay Khalilzadas (Zalmajus Khalilzadas), is trying to convince the Taliban to agree to negotiate the end of the war and is disappointed that the multilateral meeting in Russia could undermine these efforts.
One U.S. government supervisory authority indicated last week that the Kabul government in Afghanistan has weakened in recent months.
Cuba's President Pchenjane met with North Korean leader
North Korean leader Kim Jong Unas (Kim Čan Unas) and President of Cuba Miguel Diazas-Canalis (Migelis Dias-Canelis) who chose to abolish the US economic sanctions, agreed to expand and strengthen the strategic relations of their countries, the North Korean public media reported on Monday.
Mr Diazas-Canelis, who arrived in Asia on his first international trip to the government in April, is returning to Pchenjana and his wife on Sunday.
He was met by Kim Jong Unas at the airport; the leaders went into the city to welcome them.
The North Korean State media reported that leaders held negotiations at the State Houses of Visits Paekhwawon, stressed the shared socialist history of their countries and promised further solidarity.
The official media did not provide much details, but indicated that the negotiating atmosphere was friendly.
The agreement with Kim Jong Unu could be seen as a warning to Washington, whose efforts to ensure significant progress in the area of nuclearization in North Korea are increasing.
Pchenjan, who has also recently sought favor from Moscow, is a strict rhetorical meeting of US Secretary of State Mike Pompey (Maiko Pompey) and North Korea's leading negotiator Kim Yong Cholo (Kim Jong Cholo) in New York.
In the weekend, in his official media, Pchenjan criticised the United States for unresolved sanctions - a political tool that was also widely used by Washington against Cuba and Russia.
North Korea will remember that it will be possible to continue developing a nuclear weapon programme if Washington does not change the course.
The sanctions are an important issue for Mr Diazo-Canal's agenda.
Last week, in Moscow, Mr Diazas-Canelis discussed the value of weapons contract with Russia for nearly $50 million (EUR 43.8 million) and received similar promises of Vladimir Putino to expand political, economic and military relations.
The two presidents then issued a joint statement condemning the United States of America 's interference with the internal affairs of sovereign States'.
The US economic embargo on Cuba, originally introduced in 1958, and later extended, remains in force.
The sanctions for Russia and the European Union have been imposed on Russia for the annexation of Crime and support for separatists in East Ukraine.
On Tuesday, Mr Diazas-Canelis has to leave Chechenjan.
He's still going to visit China, Vietnam and Laos.

I. Valinskienė: I would agree with many of my children
In the new construction arm opera "Love and Death in Verona", the country's brightest artists are expanding.
The team of artists joins Inga Valinskienė, who has been entrusted with one of the most important works of creation - a woman of course will play Juliet.
The important part of the team became Povilas Meškiela, who will take care of the artist's song.
"I think the love stories from Shakespeare's time have been created a lot and very beautiful, but "Romeo and Juliet", apparently, will always remain a symbol of these stories and will long be made in various stages.
It will be interesting to become part of one of these buildings," says Valinskienė about the fall after a new test.
Although a woman is well known in the scene, she has created not one role in various performances or musicals, she has not yet played a role.
"The time to play Juliet has already passed," whispered I. Valinskien.
- In my time, I'd probably be happy to accept a proposal like that."
True, the character of the sacrifice in Shakespeare’s drama is no less important, and some critics are even considered the most important.
The egg is not only an intermediary, an assistant - its way and tone of speech, a woman's attitude to feelings, and the resulting solidarity with the admirers gives the object more and more colors.
Moreover, the story is also important because it is one of the only two women in the drama "Romeo and Juliet".
"The character of the meal is not very close to my way and style, but sometimes it's just more interesting.
Creating a different character than having itself is a very important part of the creative process.
Until I know what will be the final result, because it will depend not only on me, but also on the director's interpretation, says I. Valinskienė and reveals that while the sacrifice of Juliet is likely to do the same.
- I think the wolf was listening to his heart.
That's what most women do.
That's what I'd probably do."
The legendary opera "Love and Death in Verona" of Kęstučius Antaine is created by the famous drama "Romeo and Juliet".
In fact, the creation is based on the tragic end of the story of two young people - Romeo and Juliet - love.
The sad end of history is not clear from where the conflict between the young families - Monteki and Capulets - has arisen.
"All history is possible at all times.
The parents who gave in to the child’s choice have always been and will be.
Just today's solutions to such problems are more diverse, asked whether the history of Romeo and Juliet could repeat today, says future guardian I. Valinskienė.
- On behalf of my children, I would agree with many as well as with March."
Actor and director Ramūn Cicēn's main opera - Romeo and Juliet - the role will be played by Ieva Zasimauskaitė and Justin Jarutis, the scene will also show Vidas Barikis, Kęstutis Cicēn, Mindaugas Papinigis, Marius Jampolskis, Paulius Sinkūns and Aidas Barkauskas.
The latest construction of the opera "Love and Death in Verona" will be presented to the audience at the end of December.
The first of the new colors will be the legendary creation of the Vilnius "Siemens" arena on 28 December.
The day later, December 29th, the hand opera will be shown at Klaipėda's "Swisture" arena.
E. Jankauskas announced with which footballers will complete the tournament of the League of Nations
Lithuanian football team coach Edgar Jankauskas announced the composition of the national team on 17 and 20 November at UEFA Nations League matches with Romania and Serbia.
23 footballers are invited to the assembly camp, which will begin on 13 November.
13 of them compete in foreign clubs, 10 games in Lithuanian League A.
There will be three representatives from Vilnius "Zalgirio" and "Trakų", two from Marijampolė "Suduvos" and "Kaunos Zalgirio".
Most of the leaders of the national team - Fiodoras Černyš, Arvydas Novikovas, Ernest Šekkus, Vykintas Slivka and others come to the national team.
At the very least, the attackers Lukas Spalvis and Karolis Fieldes and the safe Ovidius Verbickas, the defender of Vytautas Andriuskevičius, will not be able to help.
After a three-year break, the 23-year-old Gratas Syrėda is returned to the assembly.
G.Sirgeda was debuted in the national elections for just 18 years, following a successful 2013 European U-19 championship.
In Lithuania, the European Youth Championship G.Sirgedas scored 3 matches and became the most successful player and was selected as a symbolic team of championships.
Later, however, the prospective footballer’s career was stopped by trauma.
After two years of interruption, another representative of Kaunas Žalgirio, Mark Beneta, called for the election.
In the fall of October with Romania and Montenegro, the defenders Egidius Watkoun and Edvinas Gordvains returned because of the trauma of the League of Nations.
"Let's try to get the first points out in the League of Nations, although it's waiting for very heavy twin competitors.
In the homes of both Serbs and Romanians, we lost the minimum difference.
Failure and success.
We hope that the guests will be able to respond.
Although it is for the competitors, it is crucial to fight for the first-place group and to continue the fight for the European Championship," said Lithuanian electoral coach E.Jankauskas.
Until the end of the League’s two rounds of competition, the battle is very reprehensible in Group 4 of Division C.
After four tours, the first 8 points are held by the Serbian team.
From the point of view of the leaders, Montenegro, two points - third place Romania.
The Lithuanian collective meeting with Romania will take place on 17 November at the Ilie Oana Stadium in Plaješti.
Serbia's elective Lithuanian will take place at Belgrade's "Partizan" Stadium on 20 November.

On December 26th, the only anniversary concert "Skamp20" will be released at Vilnius's Siemens Arena, one of the three new works will be presented.
This time, it's "Love Me Like There's No Tomorrow" and a brave video clip.
"This is about love, so I realized that the clip should also be embedded in all types of relationships, regardless of age or sexual orientation," - the new song and video clip idea reveals Erica Jennings, who is convinced that any homophobia statement in 2018 is not normal.
The new song "Love Me Like There's No Tomorrow" filmed over ten different orientations and age couples: "We always supported LGBTQIA communities and we hope that one day we will no longer have to discuss this," says Viktor Diawara, who created creative music in Israel at the beginning of the year.
True, because of this video clip "Skamp" has already been able to cope with negative reactions - it does not want to show one of the most popular stories in the country.
That's a lot of saying about our society.
TV doesn't show up, because it's not the wrong content for kids.
And the fact that any televisions can be placed on the screen at any time of the day is the right content of the samples of the displayed mustaches and other violence?" - Retortically asked E. Jennings.
Erica and Willius Alessius: "I would like to see more hands-on and fun people, regardless of their social status, sex or age.
We raise children and want them to grow up in an environment where there are as many tolerances as possible and as few as possible.
We want a new song and video clip to share at least some of our listeners' day and give them a smile."
The Skamp Group has been sounding in bold songs since 1998, speaking on non-popular or opiate themes.
The best of all groups - old and new - songs will ring loud and wide at the concert "Skamp20" on 26 December at the Vilnius "Siemens" arena.
It awaits all with their families, and children up to 10 years of age are free of charge.

Presidency: LRT no policy ownership
In order to return to the LRT for the consideration of the conclusions of the Committee of Experts, the Presidency is of the view that the executives are simply seeking to acquire more political control for the public broadcaster.
"The public broadcaster is not the property of politics, and the essential principle is to maintain that independence from politics," said President-in-Office Mindaugas Lingė.
However, the adviser stressed that the opposite process could be seen at present.
"It is possible to see that those (political. - ELTA) influences want to have more.
This is what we appreciate quite critically," said Mr Linche.
According to him, the proposals of the LRT Commission operating in Seime are questionable and questionable because it applies to the independence of the broadcaster.
While Mr Linge stressed the need to improve the management of the LRT, it should be done on the basis of expert support and in the search for specific aspects that hinder the smooth operation of the LRT.
He stressed that the international authorities are already stressing that the activities of the LRT should be supervised, not by the political but by the competent authorities.
On Tuesday, Seimas intends to take a decision on the activities of the LRT in the light of the conclusions of the committee.
These conclusions have led to many criticisms.
It is highly sceptical that proposals to change the governance of the LRT - to reduce the power of the Council and to reach the mandates of its members with the mandates of the issuing authorities.
In this regard, the European Union of broadcasters has expressed concern.
The opposition group of Seimas asked the Constitutional Court on January whether the special parliamentary commission to investigate LRT activities and finances did not oppose the Constitution.
Working abroad - good news from R. Karbausski
Seimas began to consider the amendment of the Law on the Living Place Declaration by the Lithuanian Group of States and the Green Union, by Mr Ramūnos Karbausski, which exempts citizens working and paying taxes outside Lithuania from the payment of compulsory health insurance contributions.
On Tuesday, 56 Seimas members supported the project, with 25 MPs detained before 9th.
The draft is scheduled to be considered at the Seimas plenary meeting on 6 December. Seimas also decided to request the conclusions of the Government.
According to the proposed project, the persons who pay social insurance contributions in the Member States of the European Union, the European Economic Area or the Swiss Confederation, by decision of the Administrative Institution of the State Social Insurance Fund, are exempt from the payment of compulsory health insurance contributions in the Republic of Lithuania.
Living and working outside of Lithuania, according to the procedure laid down by the Board of the State Social Insurance Fund ("Sodra") and by the State Tax Inspectorate, the data provided and approved would be considered as leaving Lithuania.
This is about services that people don't use.
There is an additional opportunity to fix that man has left," explained Mr Karbauskis from the Seimas Tribune.
The proposed legal regulation, in the opinion of the Conservative of Seimas Antano Matul, would be unfair to citizens living and paying taxes in Lithuania.
"Part of the Lithuanians living abroad abuses that," noted Mr Matulas.
Social Democrats, Algirdas Syss, believe that this is how we encourage citizens not to comply with their obligations.
In his view, the system of health protection would be free of charge for the smart.
Following the adoption of the proposed amendment of the law, persons who have moved to other countries are paid social insurance contributions, outstanding debts, an easy-to-use debt management burden.
Currently, Lithuanian citizens who have actually left Lithuania but have not declared their departure in the Register of Residents are charged monthly for compulsory health insurance (PSD) contributions, and if they are not paid, debt is charged.
A. Duonela is convicted of fraud, but justified by fraud
The Vilnius District Court has left the sentence in force for imprisoning former distinguished sportsman Alvydu Duonė, but he has been acquitted for falsifying the documents.
The court's verdict was published on Monday.
A. Duonėla has been sentenced to half a quarter of a year's imprisonment in the execution of the sentence.
This year, the Lithuanian fear-and-beaking champion was sentenced by the Vilnius City District Court.
He was sentenced to half a quarter of a year’s imprisonment.
According to the judge’s complaint, the Vilnius District Court dismissed one charge, but the sentence remained the same.
The former athlete will also have to pay nearly €760 of the Denominators against the Crime Fund.
The prosecutor, Mr Duonėla, accused him of falling into a veil in 2013, where his former wife, Dalios Burokaitė, was already in charge of the dental office "Delezia", he spent 200 thousand litas (approximately 58 euros).
In December 2016, the couple only met when they received invitations to cover the loan.
His ex-wife told him that he had never borrowed money from his husband and had never found a wallet.
According to Vilnius District Court judges, there is no objective data in the case to prove that it is precisely A. Duonėla that it is not the actual non-conformity data that it is the debt of UAB "Delezija" to A. Duonėla 200 thousand litas.
The arguments in the plaintiff's case and the defendant's complaint are consistent, there are no supporting objective data in the case.
In this way, when it is found that Mr Duonėla has only used the faked document for fraud and has acknowledged that these signs - the use of the faked document - are a complex part of fraud (in this case, in the case of counterfeiting), Mr Duonėla is justified in accordance with Article 300(1) of the Criminal Code, without evidence that he has participated in criminal proceedings," wrote the judgment of the Vilnius District Court.
Firemen led the earth's vulnerable cats - the book was heard for three days
As reported by the Kaunas District Fire Conservation Board, a report was received that three days of cat burning was kept after the heat pump change.
When the fires arrived, they also heard the cat’s blizzard.
It has been clarified that several days ago the heat track repair work was carried out here.
It is expected that two cats could have been turned to the ground during the crossing.
The fires dropped the heat path overboard, which was in the middle of the subway floor, and it poured moisture into the cat’s mouth.
The son of Antonino Scalia claims that his father’s unbundled liberal protests about Kavanaugh’s
On Sunday, Judge Antonino Scalia of the Supreme Court told the Fox News agency that his father’s protest against the appointed Judge Brett Kavanaugh was not surprising because Scalia thought that the Supreme Court was too involved in the affairs of the modern world.
"In general terms, his very unbundling noise about nomination to the Supreme Court, because much is based on Roe before Wade's case – at least as far as the left is concerned," said Christopher Scalia, recalling a significant 1973 case, after which the constitutional right of women to abortion was established for certain trimesters.
Roe's case, on the one hand, abolished the rights of all states to regulate abortion itself and, in response to this decision, some countries immediately tried to restrict the right to abortion.
"My father often said that Roe was in front of Wade and in other cases that the court really tried to solve cultural problems, although they had to be dealt with through the election process and the law publishing process," he added through the show at Fox & Friends."
"In order to speed up the process, the Supreme Court has added even more damage to the proceedings, and therefore nominations to the Supreme Court and the dispute concerning approval have led to a more serious reaction because the judges are taking the role of legislators."
The Senator of Nebrasco, Ben Sasse, expressed a similar opinion this month on the approval of Kavanaugh, repeating that Congress often gives too much power to executive authorities, who are essentially unaccountable, and the resulting bureaucratic issues remain to the Supreme Court, and therefore the judges must take the job which the senators refuse.
The police seized and accused hundreds of protestors for illegal interference with the candidate's approval process.
Asked if Kavanaugh could avoid adverse reactions due to unapproved sexual harassment, which he had committed several decades ago, Scalia said she would probably not be able to avoid noise.
In reply to statements that Kavanaugh should not go to the Supreme Court because Thursday during the senators' hearings were hot and sometimes bitter, Scalia questioned whether all the judges were a peaceful character.
"The judges are often confused," said Scalia, talking about the wrong disagreements that sometimes arise in conflicting cases.
"True, Judge Kavanaugh must have reacted more aggressively, but this was different.
He tried to defend his good name from unconfirmed accusations."
On Thursday, the majority of the party’s votes (11 to 10) were allowed to participate in the Senate’s entire vote.
Senator Jeff Flake of the Republic of Arizona stated a dramatic moment that he would only give his decisive vote to Kavanaugh if the FTB were to be given a week for investigations into the violation of current probable charges, to Kavanaugh.
The investigation is ongoing, and President Shortas has said that he has a broad mandate to give the Agency and can question 'just as much as he wishes'.
"Schiaparelli" ready for use in the collection of clothing – fantastically decorated
Is Surrealism Possible?
Schiaparelli tried to answer this question.
The Paris fashion house, which Elsa Schiaparelli created almost a hundred years ago, presented its first collection of ready clothes and handmades.
This collection is almost as incredible as the famous Elsa Schiaparelli converts the shape of the coat.
An eccentric image of the long-standing fashion house appeared this time and how very modern.
In aesthetic solutions, you can find sensations, ulcers, hearts, and eyes.
Schiaparelli created his first combination in 1930 and was the first designer whose models scored the podium by music.
She and her friend Salvador Dali were planning to harmonise art and fashion, and now Calvin Klein and Rafas Simons, working with American artist Sterling Ruby.
A clever legend that Dali, together with Schiaparelli, was created and is the reason for the decoration of the evening dress before the demonstration, wanted to cast out a true Mayonez, but did not accept it.

"We wanted to return to the idea of cooperation, which is not separate from the story of Schiaparelli," said Bertranda Guyon, who has been working for the director of creation for the last three years, speaking in the fashion hall of Vandam.
In creating a collection of ready-made clothes, he supported Schiaparelli's friend with Meu Ray and, in collaboration with the Fund of My Ray, created clothes according to the very well-known works of art.
A picture of the beautiful eyes of the artist's "Sky Asaras" is shown on the marches, engraved with the "Perspex" axes, and the red lips from the "Observatory Time: Intimidators" are displayed on the right silhouette dress with a collage.
My Ray's Glass Assars on the collection carts
One of Elsa's adventures was a pleasant attraction to the character of S. Their firm color – “Schociating Rose” inspired her ghosts “Schociating”.
"Schiaparelli" is the first hand of Guyon's creation, with a key tip on the link called "The Secret".
Its retail price will also be fantastic – 5000 £.
Yesterday, in the warehouse on the left side of the Old Bank, a temporary shop was opened, where the surrealist half of Paris's fashion week was demonstrated, and for 100 € it was possible to purchase Virgil Abloho's kilometers from the Ikea collection that appeared soon.
After more than 500 young Abloho fans were released for half an hour before opening up on the front line, without any attempt to buy one of his works at a more favourable price than Louis Vuitton's men's clothes.
Ablohui this project helps to reach a wider audience than the one available to the luxury fashion or designers to create furniture.
“No one has any property anymore, but knowledge of a certain chair can help to establish a conversation at the southern table.
That's what a thousand-year-old thinks," he said recently.
The audience in the Marai area realized that this event in the garage would not be a regular event when models began to ride through them on the sidewalks.
A collection of free-coloured men and women, drawn by the man's designer Andreas Kronthaler, was based on the portraits of Jessicas Fulford-Dobson Kabul's riders.
In some high - sounding sandals, women (and several men) rode with wheels, but the floating high - watering platforms went on their own.
Westwood, having observed the show in the first row and wearing the collection dress with horse motives and orange past the belt-bound cardigan, joined her husband, who gave her the beauty of flowers on the podium.
Strong double contact in photos
Detroite was born and Peter Zelewski, who lived in London, was already a street photographer when he started photographing two years ago.
"As a portrait photographer and man, I always had two and a strange relationship that everyone spoke about," he says.
The photographer did not plan to create the whole project, but he said, "After photographing the first two portraits I gained independence and there was no way back."
Soon, the book "Dwynia" will print 44 identical pictures and stories of two couples.
This project is more visual, he says: “It is not a documentary or scientific project – I wanted to photograph the effects and sensitive portraits of people.”
Employers have expressed dissatisfaction with the trade union, in negotiations on wages
Members of the Royal Service College, who were not satisfied with the agreement of the professional union with the National Health Service on wages, expressed their disbelief after the vote and accused it of breaking the requirements for the increase in wages expected.
This unprecedented decision was taken after a heated discussion at the Royal College of Services, when former Secretary General Janeta Davies acknowledged his false promises to the members that their wages would increase by 3% this year immediately when the 1% pay limit would be abolished.
As soon as the expected salary went up, the members became angry and forced Davies out of his office, then he presented a petition and organized an emergency meeting in Birmingham on Friday, after which the college board expressed dissatisfaction.
"The honest and open debate in Birmingham has helped clarify the relationship, so the college will only strengthen," said the Director of the Royal College of Services Maria Trewern.
“The Council and the Governing Council of the Royal Service College understood the message sent to it.
The Council has already made changes in the organisation in recent weeks and has tried to listen to and include the members; we will continue to try to implement them."
The meeting will be held next week and will be expected to be held by members of the Council of the Kingdom Ministry.
"The basis of the service is confidence," the National Health Service nurse said to the Guardian newspaper.
"The actions of the Royal College Council have undermined its confidence and therefore the Council must withdraw.
I hope that she will help with her worship and listen to the request.
I wonder if other members of the trade unions will also seek to reform."
National Health Service official Rachel Harrison said in August: "I have earned a salary, the National Health Service staff from all over the country did not understand the expected increase.
That's what ruined them."
Prior to the extraordinary meeting, the Royal College of Services acknowledged that they had made mistakes in the negotiations in 2018 on remuneration and had been misinformed about them.
However, it is also said that the Royal College of Services' campaign for the abolition of the fee limitation forced the government to reject this restriction and to promise to gradually increase wages by 6,5% within three years.
The vote was held after an independent study which found that the college was willing to give up in the negotiations and Davies was accused of not being sufficiently careful in assessing the transaction.
The Royal College of Care is said to have provided non-conformity information, and therefore the members were unable to take a reasoned decision on the transaction and did not consider alternatives.
The College published conflicting information on whether all employees would expect a 3% increase.
In a short report before college, representatives were mistakenly told that the planned "up 3% increase and increase in the gradual implementation of the reform" was planned.
In fact, the salary had to be gradually raised to 3% and only some of the highest wage earners would immediately have been the result of an increase.
"The information provided to members after the acquisition was almost incorrect (most likely because it was tried to simplify it)" said the representative of the Marketing Reform Service who conducted the investigation.
‘The ESR considers that the differences between the existing system and the proposed transaction were not understood and clearly explained to the parties to the decisions, including the figures 6,5 and 29 %, mentioned during the campaign, and therefore it was not possible to take a reasoned decision.’
78% of the votes cast and 3.74% of the members of the Royal Service College took part in the vote.
Lindsay Lohan shocked the viewers of the Instagram live broadcast by trying to "get" children from the family
Lindsay Lohan took the criticism of the direct broadcast "Instagram", which she followed in the street with the family and tried to separate her son from her parents.
Direct broadcasts, probably filmed in Moscow (by dealing with the history of Instagram previously updated by Lohan), initially offered to provide a room for the family at night, but the situation was quickly complicated.
"All right, I want to show you what family I have agreed to," she told the viewers, "the refugees from Syria, I'm very worried about them.
They really need help.
Do you want to come with me?
Go, I'll take care of you," she said to the family before going to one of the children: "Would you like to stay at the hotel?
View the movies?
It would be nice to watch a movie on TV or computer."
When his parents refused, Lohan reacted in an unfavorable manner.
"Your children should not be on the street, you should work hard and do everything for them to improve their lives.
“If anyone offers them houses and lodgings, as I do now, you should agree.
They're coming back to you.
I'm not going anywhere without you.
Now I know who you are.
Don't mess with me."
When the family tried to leave Lohan on the street, the actor followed her directly through Instagram.
“See what is being done – it’s a trade for children. That’s how you cook Arab culture.
You'll marry your children, even though they don't want to go with you.
Children, don't worry, I'm with you and now the whole world sees us."
The translation ended in physical confrontation – it seems that Lohan was broken by her mother.
The video clips spread in the social media, and some users wondered whether this could not be comparable to a trial.
The Independent met with Lohan's representative for comments.
A third of the British believe that he will never pay off all the debts he has.
Almost a third of the British believe that they will not be able to cover their debts, and one in 10 believes that they will not even be able to reduce them.
A study carried out by Equifax and Gorkana, whose results were revealed only by The Independent, showed that the British, particularly in the 18-24-year-old group, believed that they would have a lifelong debt, and only half of them expected to get rid of it.
In recent years, the report published by the Institute of Fiscal Studies states that the students who have graduated have a debt of approximately 46,000, while the poorest students have a debt of more than 57,000.
Most graduates (81 per cent) have never paid all their debts, so the first 30 years of work are pressed into debt.
Public debt increases: According to the data of the Department of National Statistics, the United Kingdom's family debt is record-size and the British average spends more than $900 per annum than earnings.
However, is it worth worrying about this fine statistics?
Is the whole of the century simply a new usual way of life for young adults (and for the whole society)?
As an example, cars, which are another steam buyer, can be bought at home (if such a success has occurred).
This week, Auto Trader predicted that in ten years all new cars will be purchased on a fee basis – this will be the usual means of acquiring vehicles.
EQ Investors Director and certified financial planner Jeannie's Boyle believes that expectations have really changed.
“In these times, it’s really normal to have debts: the popular credit card, interest-free refinancing, student loans and fast credit”, she said.
"Sometimes our elders were ashamed to have debts."
In these times, the debt of students and housing prices has become a normal feature.
This claim is also supported by the Head of the Personal Finance Section of the Interactive Investor, Moira O'Neill, who believes that the results can be a cause for concern.
“If you borrow a large amount of money that exceeds your income four or five times, you may appear to have nothing to do with any additional debts,” she explained.
And that's how people get into trouble.
Interest rates have been low for many years, so people with large loans or other debts have to think about what would happen if the rates increased."
It should probably not be observed that there is no doubt about the comments made by the financial industry.
The director of the Freedom Finance loan agency Brian Brodie's says: "Schools are not taboo.
Loans for house repair or new car purchase are no longer held by the latest exits.
As a result of low interest rates, many people have contributed to the savings of the term deposits from which a higher return is obtained, but it is not so easy to achieve savings.
Therefore, the middle class is becoming more and more dependent.
In the last six months, about half of the new loans have been received by customers with a good credit rating."
Richard Haymess, Head of the TDX Group’s Financial Problem Management Division of Equifax, believes that such expectations – and not to mention the whole life – are of real concern.
He says: “Inflation was the highest in six months (2.7 percent), interest rate rose, and employment increased little, so it is not surprising that many people have a decision to borrow without a realistic plan of how to repay debts.
Our analysis showed that this year the number of bankruptcys will increase by 17 per cent, and the main factor is the record of consumer lending."
The debt may not be a matter of much concern until a person works and earns, but it is not clear how unscrupulous debt will affect his well - being in old age.
The study of the Economic and Business Research Centre, carried out in conjunction with the loan for invested assets by experts from More 2 Life, has shown that undeclared debt in the last four years has increased by more than a third, i.e. more than twice as fast as the country's average in 55 to 74.
This age group usually borrows through credit cards and spends 30 per cent more than it earns each month.
Boyle adds: “More and more people in 55 years of age choose to pay debts from pension funds, and this will affect their life in retirement.
This is most often the only savings that they "must" save.
In addition, people think that the use of the property will take place later, but the change in the property is not as expensive as it is expected.
If the price of the asset falls, this situation will only be difficult."
Squirted up to half Serena Williams sang "I Touch Myself" to draw attention to breast cancer
Serena Williams released a video in which she sings the classic "Divinyls" song with the hands of "I Touch Myself" with a sharp chest.
Teniso axis shared the clip on his Instagram page and explained that a video was created to encourage a woman to test her breast.
"This month, I wrote this version of The Divinyls World Hit I Touch Myself to remind women to check themselves regularly," Williams wrote.
"That's how I got out of my comfort zone, but I wanted to do it, because this problem affects all race women around the world.
The most important thing is to identify as early as possible – it helps to save many lives.
I hope I can remind women of this."
Williams continued: "This music clip is part of the project "I Touch Myself Project", which is performed in the praise of the famous Chrissy Amphlett – she died of breast cancer and gave us her hit to remind women of their health first."
The project is supported by the brand "Berley for Breast Cancer Network Australia" (BCNA) starting in 2014 after the death of Amphlett.
The video, published by the tennis star in his Instagram column, has received more than 1.5 million reviews and many bats' praise for how the tennis player sang the song.
"I would love to do so for this clip and your courage to do it.
Thank you, Serena," said one admirer.
Another added: “Serena, it’s NOSTABU.
20 years ago, I was diagnosed with breast cancer and dyspnoea myself, even when the mammograms did not show anything.
It's just necessary to check.
Thank you for not being afraid to get out of the comfort zone – you're a real fool!"
The "Berley" project "I Touch Myself Project" also released a new "The Chrissy" live skin letter, inspired by a rock star.
100 percent of the profits received after the sale of the calf will be sacrificed to BCNA.
It is important to know the signs and symptoms that should be looked for in the self-test.
The signs of breast cancer are not only musculoskeletal, but also altered in size or shape, rash or wound, dissociation from the spine, swelling of the skin surface, permanent pain or changes in skin texture.
In addition, cancer may be a warning of the swelling of the skin or of the gastrointestinal tract, the swelling of the veins and the swelling of the spine.
Women are advised to check their breast every month.
If you notice any signs of breast cancer, NHS recommends that you contact your family doctor immediately.
If your family doctor has examined you, he will send you to a breast cancer clinic.
Adams Driveris forced the entire SNL filming group to a quatitis
Adam Driveris was this week's "Saturday Night Live" guest star and really tried to cheer everyone up.
The best jokes are not usually related to a specific event – like a new exhibition called "The Day of the Year".
On the day of the U.S. high school, when the students bring up their father, and the adult Mortdecai (Pete's Davidson) reluctantly agrees that his father, the old oil magnet Abraham H. Parnassus (Adam Driveris), would speak the language.
In Lasdela, Parnassus, whose megalomanic personality could inspire Daniel Day-Lewis, Daniel Plainview, from the film 'Bus blood', apparently told us how the oil industry managed.
"I was born seven months early," Parnassus tells his students.
“Incubator technologies have just been discovered, so I was put in a steel bowl and heated in a pizza oven until I learned to walk.
My bones didn't shake like that, but not my spirit!
Be strong and shake your enemies!"
Davidson and his colleague SNL actor Aidi Bryant, who plays as a teacher, doesn't seem funny and can't look into the Driver's eyes.
However, the actors of the Star Wars are only fleeing and he is starting to talk about the personal war with another oil magnet, H.R. Pickins.
"I've led your uncle!" he sighs.
"I have filled her belly with my pressing seeds, and I have poisoned your son: this is my final kiss, H.R.!"
In less than five minutes, the coroner became as memorable to Adam's driver's character as Kyle Reena from two films.
"Fuck you, H.R.!"
Killed by Kendrick Lamar: Eight Unheard of Arts appeared on the Internet
It seems that many of the songs of Kendrick Lamar have been lost.
On Saturday, eight of them were added to the Internet, not to listen to the works that were played by SZA, Busta Rhymes, Jay'us Rockas, Isaiah Rashadas and Abis Soulas.
It is not clear where the song is coming from, and the title of the collection ‘Bad Kid Chill City EP’ and the illustration of the cover (which the admirer was most likely created) is not official.
Only demonstrative and unfinished versions of songs can be lost, sounding as if they were recorded at different stages of the Lamar career.
The Gang Member could belong to the Good Kid Maad City era, while Heroin, who was crowned together with the SZA, was similar to the sound track "DAMN./Black Panther".
The following songs shall be placed on the market:
‘Gang Member’;
"The Only Nigga";
'Fort In Life';
‘Loved Ones’ (with SZA);
"Own This City";
‘Heroin (with SZA, Jay'umi Rocku, Isaiah'u Rashadu and Ab Soul)’;
"Look Over Your Shoulders" (with Busta Rhymes and Michael Jackson);
"Swimming Pools Alternative".
The Independent contacted Kendrick Lamar on the comment.
Chat about the music "Chikaga": In Klaipeda there are no tickets inviting you to go to Vilnius or Kaunas
Lithuania's desire to see Klaipėda's state music theater music "Chikaga" is not served.
For this reason, the most popular Lithuanian musicians of all time have been preparing for another tour across the country's largest arena.
However, after about 1.5 months before the event, the halls take place.
The organizers announce that all the tickets have already been sold to the music in Klaipėda's "Swisture" arena, the tickets are quickly released and the events in Kaunas "Zalgirio" and Vilnius "Siemens" arenas.

The demonstrations will take place in December, and not only will you see our music from the beginning, but you will also have a great opportunity to look at the big cities of the country," says the head of the National Theatre of Klaipeda Laima Vilimienė.
The audience of Chicago will experience a change in the composition of the artists.
One of the main roles of music was first entrusted to the actor Tom Zaibu.
The talented and from TV screens is a well-known actor "In Chicago" will be the unique Billy Flynn - the best and most influential lawyer in Chicago, without the changing fate of people.
Since the music of Klaipėda State Music Theatre "Chikaga" is adapted to larger spaces, arenas, the composition of the artists in it is also greater than the creation shown in Brodwej.
In the Lithuanian "Chicago" there are about half the artists on the horse.
The main role of women to trust the fans of Klaipeda State Music Theatre soloist Beatai Ignatavičiūt (killer Velma Kelly) and charismaticist Kaunas Music Theatre soloist Gabrieli Bielskyte (killer Roxie Hart).
The Music of Chicago depicts the criminal world of Chicago in the 19th century, which turns the walls of prison into a mountain of stars.
It is a musical council of criminal justice, speaking of two murderers seeking attention and recognition.
The music has become a force for sexuality and irony.
No matter where or what the main heroes - Roxie Hart and Velma Kelly - the meaning of life - would be to shine on the shining star.
Their life is a life for the message on the first page, for the title, blizzards, praise oil...
On 13 December, Chicago will be displayed at Klaipėda's "Switurio" arena, on 18 December - Kaunas "Zalgirio" arena, on 20 December - Vilnius "Siemens" arena.

Site furniture in Kaunas
The website can be called a representative home area, where we allow time with friends, guests, etc. Therefore, it should be installed in such a way as to be convenient not only to the owners of the apartment or house, but also to the guests.
Depending on the size of the site, the wall, ceiling decoration, the taste of the hosts, the appropriate furniture should be selected.
The site should be not only nice but also comfortable.
The best help in raising the interior designer, which will help to optimally fill the space so that it is not overloaded or vice versa, is too empty.
It is recommended to first establish the main site point, i.e. the object to which you combine the furniture, other details.
This may be a church or other important focus of the site's interior.
It would also be a great place to create a conversation space where guests could communicate easily so as not to interfere with the furniture and so on.
Sofos, seats should be set close to each other so that your guests can sit and talk.
Thus, the furniture arrangement must promote communication, unite people, not distance them from one another.
Don't push the furniture at the wall.
The size of the room depends on what distance it should be from the borders.
Although the room is small, still leave at least a few places from the wall, do not push the furniture to it.
If the room is large, leave even more space from the walls.
Actually, the longer the distance, the better.
Create a balance when putting up your furniture
Consider the various details that will be on your website.
All elements must be negotiated with each other.
The furniture of the site must be compatible with the interior details.
A possible small contrast.
He will revive the inside of the site, but he should not be too big, because the inside will become dishonest.
We always advise to consult interior designers.
By creating a site interior yourself, if you do not have the necessary knowledge, you may be tempted to deviate into extremes: or create a barrier interior because you are afraid to experiment, mislead, mischosen, or try again improvised.
Appropriate lighting
This is a very important thing.
The different light reveals the space differently.
The lighting shall be displayed at different levels: ceiling lamps, wall lamps, on the floor of the lamp.
Prosecutor's Office has appealed a reasoned ruling to the LCF's managers
The Vilnius District Court appealed to the judges of the Vilnius District Court for a preliminary ruling from the Lithuanian Carpsies Federation (LKF).
As reported by the prosecutor's office on Monday, the complaint indicates that the Municipality of Panevėži did not have the legal basis for contributing to the reconstruction of a private hotel in Panevėži.
In the pre-trial investigation, it was established that, in order to find the possibility of financing the reconstruction of the hotel, a public procurement and sales contract was concluded in 2010 between the Lithuanian Banking Federation and the Municipality of Panevėži.
The prosecutors claim that the services provided by the federation to the Municipality of Panevėžys do not have to be provided and could not have been provided, since the intended services have already been received or planned to be financed by the State and sponsors, part of the planned events have already occurred before the signing of the contract and have already been paid from other funds, and part of the events has already occurred since the issue of VAT invoices - the money has been transferred to the account invoices for the events not yet happening.
The Vilnius District Prosecutor's Office argues that the judgment of the Court of First Instance highlights the fact that the State itself has committed itself to the construction of a private hotel in the Municipality of Panevėži, since there was no State obligation for a specific hotel, only the proposal made to the Municipality of Panevėži to resolve the issues of the expansion of hotels needed for the championship as quickly as possible.
In the Court’s view, the Court found that the leaders of the LCF and the Municipality of Panevėži attempted to comply with the State’s obligation without having a legal basis because the data in the case showed that there was an opportunity to organise competitions in other cities by the European Carpsy Championships, without prejudice to the law.
The Vilnius District Prosecutor's Office, in an appeal, asks that the Court of First Instance's ruling be annulled and that a new, criminal, judgement be passed in this case on seven natural persons and one legal person.
On 15 October, the Vilnius District Court fully justified the LCF Secretary-General of Mindaug Balčiņa on all criminal offences.
This case relates to the 2011 European Men's basketball championship in Lithuania.
The accusations were made to Mr Balčiņa for abuse, fraud and other crimes.
The Office of the Attorney-General, Mr Balčiún, accused him of having agreed with the Finance Manager and Executive Director of the LCF that, on behalf of the Federation, the actual non-conformity of works - transmission acts and other documents and accounts of the services provided by the Municipality of Panevėžių LCF should be included in the official accounts.
In the case of a case-by-case investigation carried out by the authorities of the Special Investigation Service (STT), the authorities of the Panevėžižių doministy of the Municipality of Panevėži may have been misled and falsified for the benefit of the LKF and later used for the reconstruction of Via Unica's Hotel "Romantic".
This hotel's manager, Dalia Kuklerienė, is accused of being burned - it is suspected that she gave M. Balčiūna television as a kiss.
All persons entitled to justice with Mr Balchiun.
The charges in this case were brought to eight natural persons and to one legal person - the Lithuanian Carp Federation.
Remote place of work - like a Bermuda triangle
In Lithuania, the number of people injured or killed in work has already exceeded the total number of people in the city of Alitau from 1992 to now and is about 83 thousand.
If the requirements for physical work and its safety are as clear as they are, it becomes, in fact, a choice to work remotely from home, public spaces or even other countries.
According to insurance specialists, although the Workers’ Safety and Health Act provides for remote workers to make safety and health conditions that do not differ from other employees of the company, a variety of modern forms of work may lead to many questions, it is written in the press.
In the event of an accident at home, the employer pays compensation for the first two days of unemployment from 80%, and for the remainder of the period, Sodra.
If it is found that an accident occurred at work - since the first day of unemployment "Sodra" compensates for 100 per cent of the wage.
The assessment of the statistics submitted by the State Labour Inspectorate and the damage to BTA is clear that the total majority of accidents and various injuries occur at work.
This is most often the case for various physical works where the risk of injury is greater: they are treated with unrelenting devices or equipment, losing concentration or coordination.
However, there are also offices where most of the most demanding, best-paid specialists are now involved in the challenges faced by employers and the freedom of movement of workers is greatly appreciated," says BTA Head of Human Resources Management, Jevgenija Kriskzyņė.
The legislation in force in Lithuania recommends a clear regulation of the employee's duties and responsibilities, defining the working time, place and functions, which also applies in the form of work remotely.
If this is done, it is easier to determine whether an accident occurred at work or not.
There are indeed different situations and nuances, each case being dealt with individually.
Employers are often told that they are responsible for the employer’s accidents at work or at work or at work meetings.
However, in this case, there are very many innovations and conditions, so I would encourage both workers and employers to initiate talks, to clarify and to make it clear and to make it very clear to both sides what situations are really considered to be an accident at work, and to which the status of home injuries will already be affected," the expert advised.
J. Kriszyņė says that in these times, when work functions are often fully sufficient for a computer and a mobile phone and a stable internet connection, the employee does not necessarily work at the place specified in the agreement and at the time specified.
Employees are mobile, they can choose to work not at home today, but to drink coffee in a cafe or park while enjoying the sun.
Is this going to be a job or not?
What if the working hours discussed are still not in line with the agreed agreement?
The expert says that there can be a real difference in the circumstances in which the investigation is carried out, "Sodros" or State Labour Inspections".
They claim that the main difference in financial terms between the work of the event and the home is the amount of the unemployment benefit.
J. Kriszyņa admits that there has been an informal hearing of unofficial experiences, when employers try to hide the true circumstances of accidents or traumas and try to get employees to seek medical advice at work, take responsibility for themselves, so that they are struggling financially.
This is an unfair, disrespectful attitude toward the employee and should not be tolerated.
On the other hand, the mobility of the people already mentioned encourages the search for additional instruments that could help businesses in similar situations: insurance of civil liability of the employer for injury to workers, accident insurance against injury, disability or even death, as well as current and health insurance," says J. Kriszyņė.

Lithuanian Regbio Collection - Polish lessons
The European Trophy Division, which is the debuting Lithuanian football team, is so hard to compare with higher-level competitors.
The Trophy Division in the Old Land is the third in terms of capacity after the six-nation tournament and the European Championship.
There are 13-18 field teams with a rating.
The Lithuanians started a solid victory at Šiauliai 30:10 against the Czech command.
And last weekend the Lithuanian elections were published in Lodje, where the Polish elections are not equal - 0:33 (0:12).
Although the Lithuanians were willing to defend themselves, they often violated the rules in the mines and the Polish governors were forced to face the threat of fines.
A total of 3, 10, 27 and 37 minutes of fines were committed by Wojciech Piotrowikius, who gave his own weight of 12 points.
In the first row, the Lithuanians had to play without a yellow card from the National Court of Minor.
On the second floor, the guests had several attacks, but the results were not successful.
At the time, the waves were able to break down our defenses.
Camuoli’s pressure in the accounting area was carried out by Matthews Pligta, later by Kristian Pogorzelskis and Matthews Adamskis.
In addition to several important players, Lithuanian elective coach from PAR Ntando Manyosha acknowledged the advantages of the competitions and said that such competitions provided a lot of valuable experience.
"Lenka played very well and dominated all the parts of the game.
Our goal was to stay as long as possible in these games.
We just rise to this higher level and have to understand it.
We won the first games against the Czechs, but now we met very powerful competitors, and we had to recognize their advantage.
The Polish elections have provided us with useful lessons," said a specialist from PAR, who has been standing at the Lithuanian elections for four years.
Next game "Trophy" division Lithuanian games 6 April 2019 home with Portuguese or Romanians.
The Dutch and Swiss teams are still competing in this division.
Joseph Blažiūnas became an adviser to the Minister of Culture
Liana Ruokytės-Jonsson, Minister of Culture, began working with Joseph Blažiūn.
Mr Blažiņas told the Minister about the management of the advisory archives, libraries, museums and cultural heritage.
J. Blažiūnas, a professor of literature and art archive of the Faculty of Communication of the University of Vilnius, has thus far been the director of Lithuanian literature and art archives.
According to the report, the Council of Ministers is the author of many scientific articles on cultural heritage and the preservation of values.
The Japanese coast's coast is looking for the worst islands.
Esanbe Hanakita Kojima - this name was given to the entire small island in northern Japan in 2014.
Small, insignificant, and priceless island, which was largely unappreciative of life, was very important to Japan.
So important is that the area now covered by it is intensively explored - perhaps it will yet arise?
Why does Japan need this island?
You won't.
It is likely that the ice and the subsoils of this island have survived all the time, although it has yet to be found almost two metres above the surface of the water.
It is hardly certain that the island simply collapsed, but at least its footprints are expected to be found.
When the island began, no one knew exactly - it was so worthless that no one was too much and no one could win.
It is likely that the first of Esanbe Hanakita Kojima’s findings was learned by Japanese fishermen who sometimes used the island as a helper to visual navigation.
Their disappearance is not a tragedy even for these fishermen, because there are better ways to catch where fish can be fished and where the Russian waters begin to quarrel.
It was the meaning of Esanbe Hanakit Kojima.
This narrow strip of land was the very evening of the Kurils Island.
This island chain, known by Russia as the Kuril Islands, and Japan as the Northern Territories.
The conflict with such interruptions has continued since the middle of the 19th century, but the full force of force prevailed in the 20th century.
In these areas there are natural resources, but Japan historically believes that the islands should belong to it.
The point is that Japan has been exploring these islands since the mid - 17th century.
They were the first to form a map, to take more detailed studies, registering a large number of small islands.
The agreements signed in 1855 between Japan and Russia indicated that the landowners were in line with Sachalina and that Japan is all the Kuril Islands.
So these two states lived until 1905, when the Russian Empire lost Japan in the Sachalin war.
In 1945 the Soviet Union took advantage of the situation in Japan and opened the Kuril Islands.
Japan, in turn, does not mean great claims to the whole island, although it was the first, but would like to have four islands - Iturup, Kunashio, Shikotan Islands and Chabomayas.
Japan feels that it has a historic right because the island was the first to explore and belonged to Japan in accordance with the 1855 agreements.
In 2009, Japan offered to share these four islands at a level, but Russia did not even consider accepting such a proposal.
Japan is quite close to the Northern Territories, but now the beginning of the island, this geographical link seems to be lost.
I said that physical sign about Japan's presence in those waters.
This is a major loss, which is why we are looking for the rest of the island.
However, even if they are found, Esanbe Hanakita Kojima will not meet the definition of a simple island - it must be dry.
This means that a slight decrease in the territory of Japan and a strong decrease in the Exceptional Economic Zone, which is calculated from the coast.
It's just interesting what you expect the island search mission to do - that it's not really going to be this way or that way.
Incredible drama in Lithuanian and Polish boxing sets
More than a week had to wait for the final verdict of the judges, who became the winners of a cross-border meeting between the Lithuanian and Polish boxers.
Nine Polish and Lithuanian twins were organized in Poland.
Four o’clock the Lithuanians won, as well as the Polish.
The final decision of the panel of the long-term panel of judges and the competition secretariat was taken at the end of the decision.
The event began with the victory of Lithuanian boxers.
Lithuanian champion Marius Vyšniauskas (weight up to 52 kg) secured 3:0 won Jakob Summa, soon Edgar Skurdelis (up to 60 kg) won Radomira Obrušniak in the post-war battle 2:1.
Two masters followed: Damian Durkaczas (up to 64 kg) 3:0 defeated Mantha Dužina, while Philip Wachala (up to 69 kg) 2:1 defeated Simon Banya.
Lithuania's overall surplus was restored by Vytautas Balsys (up to 75 kg).
Lithuania 2:1 defeated Bartose Golebiewski.
In another battle, Piotras Szczukowski (up to 81 kg) in the third round was clearly overcome by Eigred Kasmoči and the result again became equal 3:3.
He was different from the brothers in Jakulia.
Robert Jakulys (up to 91 kg) 3:0 defeated Andrzej Kolton, and Arvydas Jakulys (over 91 kg) had to first recognize the advantage of Adam’s Pilgrim.
Most of the discussions were held by Tado Tamashusko (up to 91 kg) and by Mikhalo Soczynskio.
The publication of the final outcome of its cross-border meeting lasted more than a week.
One judge won the race, two judges - the Lithuanian, but because of the technical error, the point addressed to the Lithuanian judge was read out to Mr. Soczynski.
After a long battle, the victory was left to the Polish boxer - 2:1.
The Lithuanian and Polish elections won the result of 10:8 (two points for the victory) by the owners.
They succeeded in causing the Lithuanians to experience a sudden loss of their previous mate.
In 2015 at the Marijampolė meeting, Lithuanian boxers won even five fights out of six and gained a score of 10:2.
The meeting of Lithuanian electoral leaders in Poland was a general repetition prior to November 14-17 in Šilutatė.
After the country's priorities, a new set of Lithuanian boxing will be formed, which will glorify the country in the next world and European championships.
How does a dog figure out the direction in which the person went?
You already know that the dog is very sensitive.
They may cover hidden explosives, narcotics, blood, other animals, some even detect diseases according to the smoke.
It is also well known that the dog’s feet are warmed in the movies, but their work is much more difficult than you thought.
How do they determine the direction in which the owner of the footprints went?
This question is, in fact, something more complicated than you think.
The follow-up consists of three stages - the creation, the setting and the follow-up.
The second stage is much more difficult than the other two, since it is difficult to decide which way a person walked.
There's not a second between the different steps, so their breath doesn't really differ, right?
Not at all.
The research published by the University of Oslo in 1990 describes experiments that led to a 90 - degree angle in the trajectory that a person passed.
Tests to be carried out on grass and asphalt.
And in many cases, the dog easily identified the direction of a man’s going, even when he tried to mislead them by past openings.
Can you imagine the complexity of this task?
The difference between the adjacent footprints is very small and in time it decreases even more.
However, scientists say it's not that weird - a dog could say, and which part of the foot hit the ground first.
This is because their bones are an incredible tool.
Dogs dominate the areas responsible for the bone (as our brain dominates the regions responsible for the vision).
Dog nose has 125-300 million odour receptors.
In general, dogs are at least 40 times more sensitive than humans, but their ability to interpret different flavors plays an even greater role.
Scientists then carried out analogous experiments and with bicycles left behind, but their direction was much more difficult for dogs to follow.
This is because bicycle cancer is not segmented as a current human footprint, so it's harder to isolate different places for comparison - it's not natural for dogs, so it takes more time.
True, dogs are not the strongest owners of the bear.
This title would probably correspond to the holes.
Hundreds of miles of white spots are followed by the ready - to - marry female, and the rudder’s wings attract an animal up to 30 km.
In private forests, it is a promise to regulate the rotations
Minister of the Environment Kęstutis Navickas will explain on Tuesday, Seem on the logging of forests.
At the end of August, the dissatisfaction of society was due to the forests in the Lebanese regional park.
The month was suspended by the rotation of these forests.
The Minister has acknowledged that the investigations in Lebanon have shown that there have been no serious violations.
However, the Ministry of the Environment has already introduced some restrictions, given the proposal of the Working Group to strengthen forest rotation in forests belonging to the State.
The Minister promises that other legislation adjusting forest rotations will be prepared by the end of the year.
It is also intended to adapt the same restrictions which may be imposed on public forests, as well as on private forest management.
Agnė Jagelavičiūtė revealed the strategy as set up by 170 thousand followers
People need to give what they want, and at the same time get what they want, LRT TV plays "Culturally with Nomad" says Agnie Jagelavičiūtė.
According to the stylists, she gradually built a huge crowd of fans.
"In the beginning, I enjoy the taste of man, I am moving towards myself, and for a while I'm going to get better after that taste," believes Mrs. Jagelavičiūtė.
A. Jagelavičiūtė has more than 170 thousand followers in his Facebook account - it has reached such a number by using a certain strategy: "In the beginning I enjoy the taste of man, the pace of myself, the passing of the taste a little better."
Stylist A. Jagelavičiūtė claims that there is no harm in uncertainty, so he shows his face as he is - the authenticity and the ability to find the best way of presenting is the most important criteria in the social networks of popularity.
It notes that there are no more human cultures on social networks, because many internet users are coming up with them in order to get angry or to read the comments of other people who are turning around: "For example, there was a time when I wanted to get along with everyone and change - now I don't want it anymore."
"Truthful life is the greatest thing.
And it's very much on social networks.
Feisbuke even less than the Instagram," she says.
Having an education of interior design and painting, Mr Jagelavičiūtė says that he is sending a specific message on social networks - talking about women's emancipation.
It also advertises the production of journals and also looks at creation in its work.
"I can't say that fashion magazine is an expression of pure art, but I know that there is really much there.
I believe that there is a lot of creativity in my work, as well as vanity.
I'm balancing - that's my key to those big numbers.
I don't want to create a real life.
Where better to give people what they want, and quietly to get what they want," believes Mrs. Jagelavičiūtė.
One of the most challenging events that attract young people is classical music concerts.
To increase their popularity, well-known people have suggested through life stories: to talk about vices, failures, and life experiences while remaining authentic.
It is such a strategy that Mr Jaglevičiūtė proposes to apply to the whole culture.
They say that culture has no possibilities, without any entertainment, and with true values.
"How about the offenses against students - is there a chance?
If we don't find a way to present this art without advertising, it's nothing.
When we're real and we're gonna meet the reader, maybe someone's gonna change.
Once again, the second, the third - and already dependent," she shared her insights.
Three people dived into the Lithua River in the north of June
A search for three people began in Alaska on Saturday after a helicopter accident to the north of June.
One man was saved after a Friday disaster, and the other three failed to find him.
The helicopter broke up near the Lithua Valley, north west of June.
It was found that it was "Airbus H125" on a further trip to Grand Prey Texas.
On Friday, 100 feet from the coast were found.
According to the Associated Press, one saved person was 14 years old.
It was reported that she had mild hypothermia, but there were no other problems.
There are two adults and two adolescents in the lower armpit.
According to KTVA, David King (53), Josh Pepperdas (42) and Andrew Pepperdas (11).
It has been found that Senior Pepperdas is the director of the building of the Aliask company "Davis Constructor & Engineers".
I don't know what caused the accident.
The National Transport Security Council stated that the investigation was initiated.
"I will blow up a helicopter, which was completely new – just received from the factory, two adults and two adults," says the report of Coast Guard officials on the basis of the KTVA.
It was found that the pilot had 40 years of experience in flying fixed aircraft and helicopters, including flights in Alaska.
According to Anchorage Daily News, family friend Jeff Brodsky's said that the next person "has not yet lost hope that a miracle will happen".
With the help of the coast guard, the rescuers renewed on 17 February 2016 the search for experienced alpineists in Nevis mountain Fort William, Scotland.
On Saturday, in Alaska, three people were searched for after a helicopter accident.
"I've experienced sexual violence"
The president's advisor, Kellyanne'a Conway, exposed the sexual violence she had experienced on Sunday morning.
Conway was in favour of an archeic dispute between Judge Bretto Kavanaugh, who applied for the Supreme Court, and his defendant Dr. Christine's Blasey Ford.
Conway was moved to reveal that he had experienced sexual violence himself, and he insulted B. Kavanaugh against the leader of Jake Tapper, claiming that the judge charged with sexual assaults in ignorance of the adverse facts of the charges.
"I am very touched by the victims of sexual abuse and violence.
I experienced sexual harassment," Conway said at the State of the Union on Sunday.
"I am a victim of sexual violence and I do not think that Judge Kavanaugh, Take's Tapper, Jeff Flake or anyone else is responsible for it.
We ourselves must be responsible for our conduct."
Conway said that the news network must be ashamed of Kavanaugh's comparison with Bill Cosby, who was sentenced last week to imprisonment in the state of Pennsylvania from three to ten years.
Conway also criticised the Senate's judicial committee because it was unable to eliminate former President Bill Clinton, who took up oral sex in his office and lied to the US people.
The survey showed that Kavanaugh’s and Ford’s evidence divided the U.S. society
The Americans do not agree on the evidence of Bretto Kavanaugh and his accused Christine Blasey Ford – the defendant claims that the judge sexually assaulted her when they were teenagers.
The number of people who believe that Ford or Kavanaugh is lying almost matches: 38 percent of respondents say that Kavanaugh was probably or undoubtedly lying in giving evidence, and 30 percent said the same about Ford.
The Senate Judicial Committee heard from both parties when Ford sent a letter to Senator Diane Feinstein to the judge with full convictions.
After publishing the letter, Ford and Kavanaugh said that he was ready to speak to the committee.
According to evidence, Ford claimed that there were 100 percent true that at the beginning of the 9th decade, she was tried to swallow Kavanaugh rather than the other person.
In an emotional introductory language in 51 C.E., a woman said that she felt a civil duty, so she could not remain silent.
"I'm very scared," she said.
"I'm here because I think it's my civic duty to tell me what happened to me when Brettas Kavanaugh and I went to high school."
Ford and two other women’s complaints about sexual abuse denied by Kavanaugh said that “there was never a sexual assault in high school, college or any other time later”.
“All the way you tried to find someone who would stop voting for my nomination, it doesn’t matter how unrealistic or stupid it is,” he said.
"That's the simplest fucking last minute."
On 27 and 28 September, the survey of 2607 people polled did not eliminate the results of the opinion of the different parties: the supporters of the Democratic Party believed for Ford (73 per cent), while the Republicans (74 per cent) believed for more Republicans than for Kavanaugh (14 per cent compared to 11 per cent).
The author of the exhibition "Body Worlds" called "Daktar Death" wants to be intertwined and demonstrated in his own exhibition
A German scientist who invented the plastinum wants to become an eternity part of his exhibition Body Worlds.
Guntheris von Hagenas designed an innovative method that allows for the demonstration of Lavons, Bones and Organs all over the world in the exhibition, awaiting and convulsing, and conflicting evaluations.
In 73 C.E., a man who died in a prison ordered his wife to plasticize him after his death to become a permanent exhibit at the Body Worlds exhibition, which will be opened this week in London.
“It will indeed mean the end of his life’s work.
I now understand that I will have to do this because I will express my recognition and love," Angelina Whalley told The Observer.
She said that the man gave strict instructions on what to do with his lion, and the whole process would take about a year.
The muscles, nerves and arteries must be removed, and the body must be given silicone and constructed in the appropriate position.
"He said to me, "Angelina, you can freeze me to 25 degrees Celsius for years, but then you'll have to add your hands, otherwise I'll die."
So I'm going to be able to make a year, then I'm going to have to take it."
Then, in the most ideal case, he will join the exhibition in the London Pavilion near other bodies that are hard on fixed posts at the time, such as riding a horse or playing cards.
Von Hagens was horrified by an earthquake in the United Kingdom during a direct British television broadcast (it was the first public broadcast in 170 years).
Since 1995, there have been more than 47 million visitors to the "Body Worlds" exhibition worldwide.
The founder of Body Worlds London, Peter Tabernalis, told the newspaper The Guardian, that 100 percent of the exhibits, covering about 28,000 square feet, were exposed to the gifted people who were "consented because they wanted to save the living, to light them up and to help them see possible problems".
“We see and read so many terrible things that we die.
None of us will avoid it, death is common to all of us, and I believe that "Body Worlds" shows that there is no need to be afraid," said Tabernacle.
Ronaldo's lawyers are threatening the court's appeal for prosecution.
On Friday, the Portuguese football star Cristiano Ronaldo's lawyers said that they would bring a German journal, printed in the "evidently illegal" American statement that Ronaldo had taken her to court in 2009.
One of Ronald’s lawyers, Christian Schertzas, said that the article in the journal “Der Spiegel” was “an unacceptable statement of private accusations” and he would seek legal remedies for his client.
The application was sent to the agency Reuters by Ronaldo, representing Gestifute, in response to a request to comment on the article "Der Spiegel" published on the internet.
Gestifute did not answer specific questions about the content of the Der Spiegel declaration, which Reuters could not verify on its own.
Der Spiegel first published allegations in April 2017.
One of the most popular athletes in the world Ronaldo won the title of the best player in the world five times.
This summer he moved to the "Juventus" of Italy from Real Madrid; the Italian club refused to comment on the "Der Spiegel" statement.
The report states that the alleged expulsion took place in June 2009 in the Las Vegas hotel room – this was said by Kathryn Mayorga lawyer Leslie's Mark Stovals.
Stoval told the newspaper that Ronaldo and Mayorga had agreed not to court.
Mayorga agreed to sign a confidentiality contract for Ronaldo's $375 000.
The chair did not immediately reply to Reuters e-mails for comments, and Mayorga did not respond to calls on the home phone.
However, Stovals told the journal Der Spiegel that he had filed a civil complaint in order to cancel the confidentiality contract.
Mayorga told the magazine Der Spiegel that the contract did not come true because she has so far felt the consequences of the past nine years.
"I have experienced a serious crisis," she said "Der Spiegel".
‘And yet, the charge of abuse.
I blame him and blame myself for signing this."
Sustainable business ensuring the independence of creators
Are you ready to try Self-Publicing 3.0?
The new White Paper, published today by the Union of Independent Creators on the "#selfpub3.0" site, explains for the first time how to connect to other developers, become independent and start a sustainable creation business.
The founder of the independent Creator Union Orna Ross, not the first time recognized as one of the 100 most influential people, will explain at the Digital Book World 2018 conference why developers should allow Self-Publishing 3.0 methods.
"The trend of attention, e.g. the promotion of personal trademarks, responsible use and reading on mobile phones, together with digital publishing technologies, creates a highly favourable environment for business-makers," says Ross.
However, only independent and creative thinkers and knowers who understand the value of intellectual property can benefit from these possibilities.
"#selfpub3.0" encourages developers to create several job sources through websites that create conditions for successful publishing and media.
Direct sales, subscriptions, collective assistance, broadband models and other sources of income, such as on-line training and related activities, can be obtained.
"#selfpub3.0" also encourages the distribution of books in the widest formats for audiences using retailers and other services.
The main objective of #selfpub3.0 is to encourage a change of mind and learn to manage your creative business so that the intellectual property, which is the most important creative asset, would not be unimaginably transferred to another company, e.g. to a specialised publisher or to an independent publishing service provider.
According to Ross, this is how developers can increase their income, influence and impact, and these methods must be interested not only in every creator of the digital age but also in publishers; it also stressed that real independence of creators (as well as other people) ensures commercial and creative freedom.
The future is here.
And its prospects for independent creators are now the best.
The book Self-Publishing 1.0 describes computer publishing and printing on demand.
Self-Publicing 2.0 theme is the sale of e-book readers and telephone books in online bookstores.
Now we start a new, Self-Publicing 3.0 era in which independent publishers will be taught to start a business of perspectives and sustainability.
The Union of Independent Creators is the only non-profit organization in the world that unites self-certification writers.
The aim of the Union is to develop the skills of independent publishers, promote ethical activities, help start-ups to sell books and encourage developers to pursue sustainable digital business that will ensure their independence.
The presidents of the country and central bank warned the Italian government about the planned deficit
Having heard the plans of the populist government to increase deficit costs in the next year, the President of Italy and the head of the Central Bank warned on Saturday that the country's debt must be managed.
The ruling party (opposing movement of the Five Stars and the North Right League) presented a 2019 deficit proposal on the late Thursday evening to target 2.4 per cent of the total domestic product (GDP) and three times the previous administration target.
This report reached the market on Friday and led to the sale of bonds and caused a blow to bank shares.
Furthermore, such plans are incompatible with the European Union, applying and monitoring EU fiscal rules.
When addressing the audience in the President's Chambers, which mentioned the 70-year anniversary of the constitution, President Sergio Mattarella said that under the country's framework laws "the budget must be balanced and debt must be managed".
"This is how we protect our citizens' savings," he said.
At a later central conference in Italy, Ignazio Visco's President of the Italian Bank said he could no longer raise the country's debt, which is the largest in all the economies of the European Union and is aiming at 131 per cent of GDP.
"Italy must give priority to public and private investment and manage and reduce public debt," said Visco, on the basis of Ansa's public knowledge agency.
"School must be reduced consistently."
The head of the Northern League and Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvinis replied to the words of Mattarella that the debt had grown over the year to apply the strict requirements of Brussels.
"Don't worry, Mr. President," said Salvinis in a statement.
"The government debt has grown over a year of European budgets, and we are finally changing our plans and seeking a better future and growth."
Earlier, prior to the statement to Mattarella or Visco, the five-star movement leader Luigi Di Mayo said that stolen money would be returned to people in the past" from the budget, but added that the government did not intend to oppose the EU or financial markets.
The ruling parties have pressured any non-group economic minister, Giovanni Tri, to support their planned deficit expenditure.
The Italian media said that Mattarella supported Tria's failed attempt to maintain a budget deficit that would not reach 2 per cent of GDP.
The presidents of the country and the central bank have no direct influence on economic policy.
The 77-year-old President may dismiss the law and return it to Parliament, but only once.
Parliament can then again adopt an unaltered law and legislate it.
Official information: Indonesia's tsunami sensors missed a huge wave
The Indonesian geophysics agency recalled the warning of tsunamis 34 minutes after its release, and later a severe earthquake occurred, sending a huge wave to the northeastern coast of the island of Slaves, where hundreds of people died, and thousands were left homeless.
Car gangs after tsunami in Palu, Indonesia, 29 September 2018
During the earthquake and tsunami of 7.5 balloon strength, about 1,500 km (940 miles) from the city of Jakarta, at least 384 people died.
On Sunday, the officials said that the number of victims was about to rise.
On Friday, most of the people gathered at the festival on the beach of Palus, where the weddings were won by many of the six - foot - high [18 m] fatal waves.
Geophysics Agency BMKG called on Saturday in the social media: many people were wondering whether the tsunami warning had been cancelled in advance.
The Agency stated that it had implemented the standard procedure and decided to withdraw the warning according to the data of the nearest submersible sensor about 200 km (125 miles) from Palu.
“We don’t have observation data from Palu.
We therefore had to take a decision according to the data we had," said BMKG, Head of the Earthquakes and Cunami Centre Rahmat Triyo.
The nearest sea level measurement of the windmill only determined the "insignificant" wave of six centimeters (2.5 inches) and did not observe the huge waves of Paul.
“If we had had a submersible meter to Paul or had received data from him, of course, the situation would be better.
This is what we have to say in the future," said Triyono.
According to officials, the tsunami hit Paul and the surrounding areas at a great speed — hundreds of miles per hour, but it is not clear whether he took place before or after the warning was withdrawn.
The residents are checking the labs on the street looking for their family members after the tsunami of Pal, Indonesia, on 29 September 2018.
"Because of the videos distributed in the social media, we believe that the tsunamis took place before the official withdrawal of the warning," said Triyono.
Most of the damage caused by a 9.5-ball earthquake occurred on the second day of the Christmas 2004 and caused a massive tsunami that killed about 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean, including 126 000 victims in Indonesia.
The picturesque city of Palu, where 380,000 people live, is on the north side of the valley of the green grass on the north-east of the island of Salaves.
According to the Indonesian National Disaster Reduction Agency (GDP), the city was destroyed by tsunami in 1927 and 1968.
According to the Geoffrey of the University of Oxford, the earthquake of Baptiste Gombert was not to cause tsunamis.
On Friday, the earthquake occurred due to a horizontal break – the close tectonic plate emerged horizontally, not vertically, as usual for tsunamis.
"It is believed that there was a decline in the sea, an explosion of water and a tsunami," he said, adding that the force of the waves moving along the coast could be concentrated in the north bay.
The representative of the Disaster Reduction Agency, Sutopo's Purwo's Nugroho's correspondents, said that his team "was prepared to send easy-to-read public warnings" when the tsunami warning was suddenly withdrawn.
According to the Ministry of Communications, the people had repeated text messages with warnings, but Nugroho's said that because of the earthquake, electricity and communications lines were stopped and there were no sirens on the border.
In the social media, the Indonesians doubted whether BMKG had to withdraw the tsunami warning, and felt that the information had not been provided in time.
"I'm disappointed... the warning was revoked... and the tsunamis still happened..." – Twitter user @zanogucci sent a direct message to BMKG.
Golf: Mollywood duet intends to break ticket sales records
On Saturday's victory, Francesco's Molinaris and Tommy's Fleetwood became the first two in Europe, I will win all four pairs of matches, and will probably be recorded in history, as the first result of 10-6 before Ryder Cup.
After defeating Tiger Woods and Bryson Dechambeau, they became the first European couple to win all four games.
Only the Americans Larry's Nelson and Lanny's Wadkins were able to do this in 1979.
The alarming results – 3:1, 5:4, 4:3 and 5:4 – do not show everything.
Three times she won 14 important titles for Woods and twice won for Patrick Reed.
They also won a victory against Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas – this week's US team won three more matches.
Molinaris and Fleetwood will have the opportunity to become the first Europeans to win five points from five possibilities in the Sundays.
Fleetwood has already earned most of the Ryder Cup points as a new European.
The couple, who will be given a new set of balls by the Mollywood industry, did not appear to be able to lead the European team forward from the first glance.
From Ryder's Cup of Youth, such as Fleetwood, there is no such thing as the appearance, and Molinaris didn't win any of the previous six matches and lost the four contestants.
But there was hope: Fleetwood was the first in Europe last year, known as Le Golf National, as its five fingers, and here in 2017 won the French Open tournament and demonstrated a strong temperament during this year's U.S. Open.
Molinaris is a new British Open champion and many are considered the most consistent player in the European tournament – this is a useful feature on the ground floor where high grass can lead to loss, as demonstrated by American failure.
These players' characteristics and harmonious play on the platform made them ineffective.
"Now I feel a little sensitive, but only on Saturday," said the cheerleader Fleetwood, a full weekend game with a wide smile.
This afternoon we made a great show, we played stable and good.
If we get to know history together, it'll be a special achievement.
I'm just glad we did it for the team."
The molins were happy too.
"It was great to play with Tommy," he said.
"But we must do our duty, not just to access the records, so tomorrow we will have to fight hard for 4.5 points that we need to win; it will not be easy."
Ritter's hot!
Irish village in the middle of the border
In the West of Ireland, Claregalway was once a powerful castle, the main fortress of the 15-year-old family from England, and this Saturday was remembered for its origin.
Ritteri's two-legged sword during the Middle Ages War Festival in Claregalway Castle in Golf, Ireland, on 29 September 2018.
A completely restored house of anglonorman period with a letter was turned into a medieval field of combat, where many of the enthusiasts from all corners of the world to small ones re-established contact fights and games that were popular centuries ago.
Ritterly dressed Karl Dornán and wearing the costume of war, Donna Dornan patrols Claregalway in the great art of the city during the medieval war festival in Golvěju, Ireland, on 29 September 2018.
"It's a great weekend going and something unusual," said Denise Fitzgerald from Kerio's funeral, a week-end becoming the owner of the dump.
“This is how we come back to the simplest things.
I'm trying to do everything I can right," said the theater employee, who was first involved in the war festival.
In the field, there were authentic warriors, and even their swords were a book, some of which had been slammed down, and one injured the lips.
The riders demonstrated their ability to ride and to thresh and thresh on the side.
On the side of the metal, the prisoners were armed, and the merchants prepared the medicine, and the craftsman’s rope and the wool were often dyed.
The participants, who were very gifted and deeply impressed, tried to get involved in the roles.
"I think anyone can embrace the costume, but the impression of the role is art," said Helena Stackpoole, who played Lady Eleanor Fitzgerald and had the unique opportunity to use her fashion design knowledge.
‘All costumes are sent by hand.
I've been screwing my belt for two years, and now I'm wearing a dress, and I've only had 800 pearls on my hands alone.
It matters to me," she said.
After the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, the number of fish increased to 832
According to the National Disaster Reduction Agency, the number of people killed by earthquakes and tsunamis on the Indonesian island increased by 832 each week and the affected area was higher than initially thought.
The agency's representative, Sutopo's Purwo's Nugroho's at the news conference, said that many people were struck by a 7.5 earthquake on Friday and a six-foot (20 ft) high tsunami wave.
The FBI appealed to the second woman accused of candidate Kavanaugh
FTB agents investigating the U.S. Supreme Court of Bretto Kavanaugh’s application for a second woman accused of having been sexually assaulted – this Sunday the lawyer of this woman was released.
Deborah's Ramirez lawyer John Clune's report states that the FTB's investigation of Kavanaugh's case will not only cover separate charges in an attempt to seize which Dr. Christine Blasey Ford presented to the judge of the Federal Court of Appeal this week at a dramatic Senate meeting.
Ramirez blames Kavanaugh for showing her her five in the evening, where she was drunk and who was at the University of Jelio when they both studied there.
U.S. President Donald Trumpas gave the impression that the Senate had been under pressure and instructed the FTB to conduct an investigation after a Thursday Senate meeting in which Professor Ford of the University of California filed a detailed complaint that Kavanaugh had tried to take her out in the evening in 1982 when they were both in school and were teenagers.
On Saturday, NBC News reported that the White House limited the extent of the FTB investigation.
A short time later, it denied and announced the Twitter message: "I really want them to question all the people they need in their opinion."
The White House representative, King Shahs, said that the Senate had determined the extent and duration of the FTB study (the study should be completed within a week).
"The White House allows agents to do what they are taught," Shahs said.
The United Kingdom will not comply with environmental or animal protection standards after Brexit
Minister of Environment Michael Gove said on Sunday that the United Kingdom will not return to environmental or animal protection standards so that after Brexit it could enter into trading.
The Secretary of State for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs of Britain, Michael Gove, arrived at the Downing Street in London on 24 September 2018.
Speaking at the annual Conservatory Party Conference, Gove said it would be useful for the United Kingdom to be aware of its quality food products and the government will publish this year's food strategy.
Europe returned the Ryder Cup in the unit contests
Francesco's Molinaris won the prize on Sunday by returning the Ryder Cup to Europe: italian won Phil Mickelson to the 16th floor and won the score of 14.5.
Mikkelson went to the kitchen after running the first ball into the water, while Molinaris was able to stay in the parking lot as the first European, and I won all five cats a week, although none of the previous six won.
The European victory has already been assured that Italy has launched a strike from the starting point and the ground victory lacks one point, while Henrik Stenson and Sergio Garcia have led the match and was assured at least half a point.
At the beginning of the day they led the result 10:6 and had to earn four and a half points from possible 12, so that they could return the trophies and establish their stay at home, which had been occupied since 1993.
Before that, the team succeeded only twice in eliminating the difference between four points and winning units: it did the US team in 1999 in Bruxelles and Europe in 2012 in the Medino miracle, but no one believed in yet another stunning return.
Justin Thomas, Webb Simpson and Tony's Finau gave Jim Fury's team the hope of winning the first matches, but then the European team's points went up all over the platform.
Thorbjornas Olesenas disturbed Jordan Spieth, and his team friend John Rahmas – Tiger Woods: 14 important titled athletes lost four of four.
The best-known Ryder Cup player, Ian Poulter, won what a good, mostly ovation this week, when the world's best player Dustin Johnson left him on the 18th Ride and brought Europe to victory.
Then we had to wait for the mother to finish the first, and it was Molinary's game, which caused a wave of joy in the mini, which was the greatest event in history.
RT World News: German policemen protecting Erdogan used the neo-Nazi name as a code word
According to local media, secret officials in East Germany, the Turkish President Erdogan, who was saved this week during his visit to Berlin, used the name of a sad-assed neo-Nazi extremist.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of the region said that the criminal police in East Germany are investigating two members of the SEC of the elite anti-terrorism camp.
Men were meant to protect Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan during his long trip to Germany.
Officials had to work in secret, so the protocol required the use of a code name.
They chose Uwe Boehnhardt, a sadly exaggerated neo-Nazi belonging to the National Socialists (NSU) extremist group, who killed eight immigrants from Turkey at the beginning of this century, one Greek citizen and a German police officer.
The local media reports that a strange code name has been known when two police officers have requested authorisation for the internal documents required to perform the tasks.
The officers in charge were quick to withdraw the police officers.
The first head of the Saxon criminal police, Petrice Kleine, responded to the news.
He said that the decision to use Boehnhardt's name was "must have been the stupidest" and thus "obviously ignored victims and their loved ones".
The minister of domestic affairs of Saxony Roland Wolleris endorsed this statement and the decision was called "a terrible, fearless and totally unacceptable".
Erdogan’s Friday visit to Berlin caused many conflicting assessments in Germany.
Chancellor Angela Merkel was criticized for accepting the leader who was accused of growing authoritarianism.
Merkel said that this visit is very important, “in the absence of disagreements, they need to be addressed in person”.
The public first heard about the NSU in 2011, when the bodies of Boehnhardto and his colleague Uwe's Mundlos were found in the eastern secondary facility in Germany.
One of them was believed to have killed another and then killed after a failed attempt to kill the bank in Eizenach.
The third member of the neo-Nazi group was soon taken, the last one left alive Beate'a Zschaepe.
In July of this year, the German court sentenced her to a life sentence for 10 counts of murder.
She refused to contribute to the murder, but her lawyer claimed that the accused felt moral guilt because he did not try to stop the killings.
Following the NSU scandal, the German security agencies took many criticisms.
The lawyers, activists and victims believe that the group had much more partners.
It also appeared that the German Internal Intelligence Agency BfV infiltrated many informants into the NSU and constantly hindered the study of the group's murder, attempted murder and rape.
Muskos withdraws from the responsibilities of the Head of Tesla and will have to pay $20 million fine to the Securities and Exchange Commission
Elonas Muskas agreed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission and handed it over to the court on the fraud of Twitter, in which he claimed to be a private company in Tesla.
Muskos will have to resign from his duties, but the Director-General will remain.
The documents of the agreement state that Muskas must be removed from office of the President of the Board of Directors of Tesla within 45 days and shall be prohibited from returning to this office for three years.
In addition, he'll have to pay $20 million.
It all started with a Twitter message that was inadvertent or illogically wrong, so Muskas will have to obtain prior confirmation before saying or announcing "Tesla" in any format, including, but not limited to, social media records (e.g. Twitter), company website (e.g. company website), press releases and calls to investors".
Tesla will have to pay another $20 million because it did not match Musko's original Twitter message.
In the complaint of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Muskas is accused of misleading investors in Twitter on 7 August, where he claimed to have obtained funds to make Tesla a private company whose one share would be $420 – therefore the company's securities amounted to more than 10 per cent.
Muscas soon withdrew his words by saying that Tesla would remain public and destroyed investors.
The Securities and Exchange Commission decided that Musko's initial statement "was incorrect and misleading because it did not agree with the facts".
Muskas himself explained that this error could be justified by the fact that after meeting with a representative of the independent property fund in Saudi Arabia, he felt that he was able to agree on the money.
It is reported that Musku and the Securities and Exchange Commission have approached the lighter penalty – Musku should have been rejected by the President for only two years and should not be held guilty, but Muska refused this agreement on Thursday.
On Friday, the price of Tesla's securities fell and was likely to change his opinion again and agreed with more stringent conditions.
However, according to the new agreement, as in the old one, Musku does not have to admit the blame for the error of investors.
The Aleksandria Patriarch committed to supporting the canonical Church of Ukraine and urged Orthodox unity
The Aleksandrian Patriarch Theodore II made a statement on the basis of the canonical Orthodox Church of Ukraine belonging to the Moscow Patriarchate.
He spoke in response to the separation of the Russian Orthodox Church and the Patriarchate of Constantinople.
On Thursday, Theodore II arrived in the city of Odessa in southern Ukraine and met with the highest church representatives and trusted Orthodoxes.
The Patriarch of Alexandria is one of the most respected orthodox hierarchies of the Ecumenical Patriarch Constantine.
"I have come to tell you: do not give up Orthodox faith and canonical church," said Patriarch Theodore II.
Prior to his visit to Odessa, he met with the mayor of the Polish Orthodox Church, Sava, who also supports the canonical church of Ukraine.
They also called for the prevention of conflicts resulting from attempts to justify the autonomy of the Ukrainian church.
"We will always support those who seek orthodox unity," promised Theodore II.
The Orthodox Church recently experienced a major crisis following the decision of Constantinople Patriarchate to recognise the independence of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine.
The latter belongs to the Russian Orthodox churches, also called the Moscow Patriarchate.
Constantinople decided to send exarchus to Kiev, thus violating the rule that would prevent one Orthodox church from turning to other things.
The Egzarchai are special patriarchal representatives who formally take up a position higher than the Metropolis of Onufry, who is the current head of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine belonging to the Moscow Patriarchate.
The Moscow Patriarchate misappropriated the actions of Constantinople and cancelled all the church’s common prayers and membership in organisations led or co-chaired by the representatives of Constantinople.
However, it is said that this decision has warned Constantinople not to take other opposing actions and that the two churches have not been completely shut down.
Of the three churches in Ukraine, only one church belonging to the Moscow Patriarchate of the Orthodox Church is recognized.
Most Ukrainian clergy recognize its authority, but the government has always openly supported one of the separate churches, a church belonging to the Kyiv Patriarchate of the Orthodox Church of Ukraine, which occurred in the tenth century.
This religious movement even has a patriarchal leader, Filaret, in order to recognize the official Orthodox Church, complete independence and equality with the Moscow Patriarchate.
Damascus opened for the first time in three years the main transit of Syrian-Jordan trade
According to the SANA State News Agency, the Syrian Government has claimed to open the border crossing of the Nasiba border, which was closed for three years for military action in the territory of Jordan.
This can be done because the fighters on the Syrian side left the land to the city of Dara.
Nasibas is the most important trade link not only between neighbouring countries, but also between Lebanon and the Gulf of Persia.
The most important thoughts from the United Nations language of Lavrov
In the US Foreign Minister Sergeius Lavrovos attacked the West for "political blackmail and brutal force" and said that diplomacy must not be given to dictatorships and unilateral sanctions.
At the UN General Assembly on Friday, the Minister said that some Western countries, trying to maintain their own positions as leaders of the world, put pressure on others without conscience.
He did not name specific countries, but said they were using "political blackmail, economic pressure and brutal force".
The world must pay a high price for the selfish ambition of the small group of countries.
Lavrova, a ten-year-old representative of Russia, said at the meeting that the culture of diplomacy and negotiations is changing the dictatorship and unilateral sanctions applied without UN approval.
The Minister said that the sanctions applied by many countries are "injurious or ineffective" and recalled the US block imposed for many years in Cuba.
"But the story did not teach us anything," said Lavrova and added that "the Westerners would only like to confess the guilt if it is "very likely".
We remember how often such unwarranted accusations were justified by interference and wars, such as the 1999 explosions in Yugoslavia, the 2003 invasion of Iraq and the 2011 invasion of Libya."
Of course, Lavrov did not mention all Western invasions and recalled the seven - year - old Syrian war as one of the most recent cases.
A failed attempt by extremists to overthrow the Damascus regime could be a waste of time for the entire country and open the way for the establishment of a "terrorist Caliphate".
Lavrova endorsed the Astana peace process, which began with Russia, Turkey and Iran, and said that this process helped prevent the Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS) and other groups who wanted to capture Syria as a whole.
It is now important to restore the country's places of war and to help refugees return safely.
Lavrov came back to the battle of great forces and said that the UN was actually created "to learn from the Second World War".
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of Russia recalled that in 2018 the 'golden' Munich Treaty, signed in 1938, which France and the United Kingdom agreed to allow the nations to annex part of the Czech Republic to Hitler, which was occupied by the Germans.
Although then British Prime Minister Neville's Chamberlain said that the Munich Treaty "will bring peace to these times", the war began a year later.
"Miunchen's betrayal" shows how far "the country's selfishness and disregard of international law can lead," Lavrovas said.
"The dictatorship and the pressure of the colonial era must be a help to the history archive or to the muzzle."
Moscow believes that constructive dialogue can solve all the problems of the world, Lavrov said.
"If you have questions or fears, sit down and talk, reveal facts, listen to your colleagues' arguments and try to reconcile interests."
Krislas we light up?
RT World News: Israel's nuclear weapons are in the middle of a fog, and Bibi's finger is turning to Iran
The Prime Minister of Israel, in the speech of the UN General Assembly, claimed that Tehran had hidden nuclear weapons.
It may be that a fellow Israelite is hiding something.
The favorite Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, released the news on Thursday, showing highly photographed photos with places where Iran allegedly considers nuclear material.
Teheran replied that Tel Aviv would rather take care of his 'undeclared nuclear weapons programme'.
Although Israel never admitted (but did not deny) having nuclear weapons, RT journalist Muradas Gazdiev tried to find out if Tel Aviv really should look for rust in his eye.
Scottish Government: no complaints about Alexo Salmondo before January
The Scottish Government claimed that no complaints concerning Alexo Salmondo had been filed by January this year.
In January, the former prime minister was charged with two charges of sexual harassment, although he was severely negative.
In March, he was informed of the investigation.
Salmonella, who resigned from the Scottish National Party, was in a case with the Scottish Government on the basis of a complaint against him.
In response to the claim that one complaint was first examined in 2013, the Scottish Government stressed that no complaints had been filed before January.
A representative of the Scottish government said: “The Scottish government filed two complaints on Alexo Salmondo in January.
We could ignore them or hide them.
Previously, the Deputy Prime Minister did not hear any complaints about Alexo Salmondo and, as we have already said, the Prime Minister first heard about the investigation from Alexo Salmondo in April 2018.
We are convinced of the legality of our processes and we will firmly defend our position.
The Scottish Government will seek as much information as possible.
However, as we have already mentioned, for legal reasons we cannot comment any more on Mr Salmondo's case at this time."
Alexo Salmondo said: “We are not going to do anything because our petition against the permanent secretary is now being discussed at the courtroom and we hope that the decision will be taken soon.
We'll talk in court.
Our aim is to prove that the Scottish Government's complaint procedure against Alex is illegal."
Glazgas interrupted by Dragons result 29:13: "Warriers" played the break of Lee Jones
Glazgas returned the winner's title in Guinness Pro14 by winning additional points and winning the Dragons Scottstown Stadium, while Coach Dave Rennie's is not hiding satisfaction, but he believes the game could be more accurate.
After an unexpected loss to the Southern Kings team at Port Elizabeth last Saturday, Rennie's highly changed teams asked to try and although she was able to collect the necessary points to be able to remain at the top of the A conference, the wind and rainy air-fighting was certainly not a glamorous match.
"I think we had a great fight tonight, we played on the right side of the square, and our strategy was good," Rennie's said.
“We had to play more precisely and we could take advantage of more opportunities.
The conditions were not favourable.
We have created many opportunities, and we are happy to do so.
You need to play more precisely, but 40 or 50 points won today would not have been a good result.
We had to try.
We won extra points, but we have to make more effort next week to play home with Zebre, and next week with Saracens in Europe."
Although the air was windy, the Glazgo team soon began to earn points, but TMO received all the lost balls of Huwo Jones, including his captured internal transmission of Niko Matawal in the left corner.
Discouragement did not last long: the left column of Olis Kebble's fourth minute fell in the middle, and Adam Hastings was easily caught.
The Dragon reduced the difference when Arwels Robson received the fine and the security turned the player over immediately after 20 minutes of mark and the bets won the point.
The game after a rather peaceful first-party escaped almost half an hour's notice: the Glazgo fighters consistently attacked the Dragon line, then the judge from South Africa Stuart Berry's sentenced the guests for 22 minutes on the side of Hastings.
"Warriers" was released to caves, but lost the ball after a smooth transfer, because a few hits on the left side of Matawal could not control the ball and it was transferred to the left.
The second test took place two minutes after the interval: Hastings missed the Dragons line and wisely transferred the ball to the abandoned Lee Jones.
The Cambodian was returned to Hastings' position and the result of the rivals became 12:6.
The first minute on the second side of the glass was very successful: Alex Dunbar’s ball was played by Lee Jones for the second test, and Hastings helped him.
However, Warriers failed – after just four minutes they took the ball in the middle of the square and the Dragon Center, Adam Warren, pushed it through the door, so he won points, and then he took Josh Lewis after playing the open game with Robson.
Warriers quickly returned to the leading position and the 54th minute after the fourth test earned additional points when Huwa Jones ran right and Hastings failed to pass the ball (it was the third failure of the four tests).
The painting maintained a comfortable higher position and, after a few minutes, carried out a fifth test – Dunbar passed the ball after Thursday with George Horne, and Hastings won points.
Kebble's published as the best match player, but Rennie's fought Hastings.
"They clearly prevented us from playing, but we really opened up in the middle," said the coach.
“He was a few feet short, but he was a sleigh, and he still managed to get away.
He's in good shape and trusts himself."
"Ayr United" won by Morton 1:5: "Ayr" hit the master team of five stars
Lawrence Shankland and Craig Moore won two rounds, and Declan McDaids added one more and thus helped "Ayr" to stay on top of the championship table.
"Ayr" drove forward after Shankland's invasion of six yards after Michael Rose's coup hit McDaid.
In the 35th minute of Morton's first test, Charlie's Telfers took the ball from the twin Robbie Crawford on his own site and sent it down by Air User Ross Doohan to the far end.
The players from Grinoka's fourth-minute-second generation had a chance to push forward when Doohan's paraded Gary Oliver, but Michael Tedseras launched a weak penalty, which the user easily caught.
Ayr's 74th minute was the second time the winner passed when the replacement of Craig McGuffie's long distance was fired in the air and dropped onto the ground was sent to the doors of another replacement player Craig Moore.
Moore's transferred the ball the same minute to Shankland, who entered 17 in this season.
To the fans, Moore returned to his side a quarter from the country of the square, and McDaid sent a flashing ball to the door.
Alloa and Falkirk games ended with 0:2: the first victory of young people in league
"I am delighted, I feel relieved, I am happy," said Ray McKinnon after a very demanding first Falkirk win league and the season's winning points.
"Rangers" loaned by the shooter Zakas Rudden (18th) won after being taken to both bodies and pushed the host team "Alloa Athletic" into the champion's cabin and released the club from the pressure.
"It was an important game for us," said McKinnon.
"In the last three competitions, we probably earned more, so it was great to win three points in a tense situation.
I'm glad we got the first points.
It would not have made any difference, but it was important for us to win."
Rudden sent the ball to Patrick Brook in the 26th minute and earned a take from the door line in the middle of the second cell, when Demantas Petravičius slowly blew the ball over the user Neil Parry.
"We wanted to be firmly convinced, but failed," said Mr. Waps, leader of the company, Jim Goodwin.
Hearts Surgery petition for half-finals received more than 11,000 signatures
The Hearts Surgery petition for the Betfred Cup semifinals schedule has been signed by more than 11,000 people.
The sirals are angry about the decision to hold both semi-finals on the same day and at the same stage.
As advised by the Scottish police, SPFL decided last week to hold the "Aberdeen"–Rangers" event at 12:00, and "Hearts–"Celtic – 19:45, as well as the "Jambos" and "Dons" infestation.
The Evening News, along with Aberdeen Evening Express, asked for a fair solution to the problems.
The so-called “Super Saturday” judgment was also condemned “Aberdeen”, and “Hearts”: both clubs issued statements that criticise the schedule.
A petition was published on Thursday at change.org, which requires one of the matches to move to another place or date.
A man accused of murdering two women in Kent's village

Royal archives and music "Hamilton" creator of the world light about King George III
After presenting to the Queen a project that opened up a large archive of documents collected during the year of the George III administration, it was hoped that letters, journals and languages would help the public to get to know more about the kings of thought.
Now these documents will reach another audience – the Royal Archives have decided to cooperate with the Vestenda music completely unexpectedly.
The academics who wanted to reveal the true face of the king invited the musician "Hamilton" Jurg III, who played the actors in the Library of the Windsor Chamber, to review the most important documents from the time of the Queen's own proproprosenel.
Researchers are trying to make old handmades available to wider audiences, so they will be able to reach digital documents in the presence of fans.
Members of the royal family have already publicly supported the musical creation, and the Hercoga and Hercogie show will take place twice, although Prince Harry’s grandfather is constantly shown on stage.
Michael Jibson, acting as the king of Vesten, said that the documents had to be considered and helped to get to know the king whose image was made by the audience by the musician Hamilton, the film "Kalais Jurgis impregnatis" and the series for the children "Student History".
"We fell in love with beautiful letters"
US President Donald Trumpas did not create enthusiasm after the attempt to reduce the tension with North Korean leader Kim Jong Unu and on Saturday at his sponsors' meeting, he said that after writing letters, he was “in love”.
Mr Shortas and Mr Kim said that they were going to achieve a nuclear disarmament in Korea, which they discussed at an unprecedented meeting that took place in Singapore this year.
Before moving to a new phase of history after many years of public disagreements, the leaders of the countries changed with insults and insults because North Korea wanted to create a nuclear missile capable of reaching the United States.
“I was as strict as he was.
We always talked," Mr. Shortas said at the meeting in West Virginia.
"And then we fell in love, understand?
In fact, he wrote me beautiful, beautiful letters."

Squirrel for Shemonyte: everything decided by the party's "squirrel"
Prime Minister Saul Skvernelis said that there was a lack of democracy in the internal elections of conservators, and the party's leadership actually appointed Ingrid Šimonyt as a candidate for presidents.
"The feast of "democracy" has always been wonderful, gently saying when the party screamed, the top decided and actively supported one candidate.
Probably the second candidate had no opportunity to win even theoretically," S. Skvernelis told reporters in the government
"Conservators have appointed their candidate, with that and we greet them," added the Prime Minister.
The Prime Minister of the State of Greens said that I. Šimonyt should be evaluated by voters, recalling her work in the Government of Andria Kubil.
Mr Skvernelis has not yet been informed of whether he will participate in the President's election.
The Lithuanian National and Green Union intends to approve its candidate next year.
The leader of the ruling "states" called the election of the conservatives Ramūnas Karbausskis "a failed experiment" because of the activity of the minority parties.
"First of all, we need to welcome an experiment that has absolutely failed.
There were only 55% of the party's members, totaling only about 20,000 voters.
Knowing what money was needed to be made available to those elections, it is therefore clear that it did not succeed," R. Karbauskis said to the news portal delfi.lt.
"I don't think the costs will be worth the result, because the result is no, the party decided that their candidate would be so good, but who would spend so much money," he added.
During the weekend of the internal elections, 79% of the members of the Conservative Party and their supporters voted in favour of the Chimonyte candidacy.
Lietuvos's pay is a joke: one area can change everything
According to the Baltic Salary Survey survey carried out this year by the Baltic Salary Survey, the wage was mainly increased in Estonia.
Lithuania and Latvia have recently returned from their neighbours, written in the company's press release.
"After consulting 850 companies and examining the changes in remuneration in the Baltic countries, we see that monthly wage before taxes this year increased by 81.8% in Lithuania and on average increased by 7.7% and annual salary by 10.5% in addition.
Latvia has not missed us much - as many times a year, but as in Estonia, a smaller number of employees compared to our country," says Povil Blusius, a representative of the company that conducts the studies, and adds that in the context of such trends in wage growth, the economic indicators of the country that dictates them should also be taken into account.
In Estonia, wages are rising at a faster rate
Although the salaries in Latvia and Estonia were lower for part of the staff than in Lithuania, the increase was higher.
In Latvia, the annual salary rose by 71% of the employees of the companies surveyed and reached 11% in our country.
In Estonia this year's salary rose by 73 per cent and by 13 per cent on average.
There is also a significant impact on wage growth trends on the exchange of employees, as the changing job can get a much higher remuneration than in the previous job.
For those who did not change jobs and jobs in Lithuania in recent years, the annual salary rose by 8.8% - more often than in other Baltic countries.
In neighbouring Latvia, the annual wage growth rate for such workers was 3.6 per cent.
Estonia remains a leader in the Baltic countries not only as the average wage for new, but also for long-term workers.
In the absence of changes in jobs or duties, the rate here was the fastest: the monthly - 6%, the annual, including the supplements - even 9%.
According to the remuneration expert, such trends often depend on, or are combined with, the overall economic indicators of the country: inflation or GDP growth, their forecasts, state monetary policy, prevailing market moods.
For example, forecasts about the coming economic crisis encourage business to behave more cautiously and to invest less.
Suspected and rapidly growing sectors of the country, such as information technology, construction, pharmaceuticals, can also generate common statistics and mitigate minor changes.
The greatest tax burden is in Latvia
In relation to wage growth, it is important to take account of the different tax systems in these countries.
In Latvia, employees pay most of the fees, up to 31 or 34%, which may increase to 42.4 per cent.
For example, Lithuania has a fixed rate of 24%, which is the result of higher wage growth in Latvia, employees can expect a similar or even lower rate of earnings than in Lithuania.
In Estonia, the same tax rate as in Lithuania is 23.6 per cent, so in this country we find the most favourable labour tax in the Baltic countries.
In the field of IT - the most competitive rewards
According to the survey, in all the Baltic countries almost independent of the level of duties, IT specialists' positions remain among the best paid.
The opposite is the situation in retail trade - the market indices in this area are one of the smallest, so employees earn less than the average market income.
In comparison with last year, the most rapid wage for engineering specialists in higher positions, as well as risk management professionals, has been raised.
Such a rise in remuneration did not fall this year and the positions of some IT sectors - a large number of organisations' information security specialists increased monthly salaries up to 14 per cent.
At the same time, the wage in retail trade has not changed much.
However, some companies have successfully carried out adjustments to the remuneration systems and thus the annual salary for the premiums rose by about 2 per cent.
According to the remuneration specialists, there is a trend that wage growth dictates the need for the most demanding specialists - the demand for system analysts continues to grow in the Baltic States.
Ariana Grande suffers again: the former puzzle doesn't break the joke
After the divorce with Ariana Grande, Pete Davidson was stabbed to death by creating a series of concerns about their relationship.
Participating in Saturday Night Live, he chose to laugh about how too quickly he gets into serious relationships.
The fans speak that the truth, seeing just three weeks ago, Ariana and Pete withdrew their puzzles, which happened just after a few months of knowledge.
Pete's tried to create scenarios that mentioned his failed relationship, but it will happen on the screen a little later.
It turns out that from her former relationship, the humourist is exacerbating Aryan himself.
She's hurt, not to the heart.
At least that's how the foreign news portal TMZ told the hidden sources.
White or red: how to choose the sugar recommended by the dietologist
Baltasy of the Russians?
Which sugar?
During the polling centres, it has been shown that while Lithuanians still traditionally collect white sugar, the fact that many peoples of this white death have completely rejected the ingredient.
The fact that red sugar sales are growing is also not hidden by the representatives of the trading networks.
According to the "Maximas" representative, red sugar is becoming increasingly popular and the peoples buy it more and more, although the usual white sugar - by choice is still more and more ahead.
Organic sugar is also growing and organic sugar is growing in specialised organic products stores.
One of the most popular products there is coconut sugar.
According to Dietologist Dalios Vaitkevičiutas, the main difference is the price and the harmful effect on health may have on both.
"Rudish unrefined sugar is three times more expensive, but in the health of these sugars, using their surpluses is harmful to the body," said D. Vaitkevičiūtė.
Live without sugar, the dietologist advises to reduce its daily intakes slightly.
This is the result - the benefits of all - are falling and unwanted kilograms, better and health.
A month of consistent use of less sugar, it will be easier to give up everything.
"Every custom we form is about a month, so after doing such an experiment, let's say, it's time for a month to improve some product without sugar - coffee or tea, we'll see how positive it will be and I think we can all give up a little effort," said an idetologist.
Doctors claim that sugar is not produced by white blood cells without any reason - abuse of sweeteners can become causes of obesity, diabetes, cancer, and other diseases.
It is therefore worth trying to consume it at least, because it is added to a lot of food, even to a feed.
Another "Lietkabel" step: Lipkevičios owes other LKL teams
The Lietkabeli Paneviž team welcomed Vytien Lipkevičius - the shooter is loaned by the Prienų Skycop team.
At this Betsafe-LKL season, V.Lipkevičius entered 6.4 points in 22 minutes, recovered 2.8 balls, performed 2 performance transfers and scored 8.5 points.
FIBA Champions League, 29 years old, 198 cm high score scored 3,8 points, 2,5 points recovered ball, 1,5 results of transmission and 4,8 points of effectiveness during 21 minutes of game.
In the near future, Lietkabelis will announce a new purchase that will strengthen the composition.
S. Bushevics joined the coach's staff
The Senior Coach Nenado Čanak, the commander of the Lietkabel team, became an assistant to the Lithuanians, Sandis Bushevich.
41-year-old Latvian in 2005-2006 season played Vilnius "In the East of Lithuania", and in 2014-2017 he worked in this club's system as a male coach.
Last season S. Bushevich trained Jekabpils team.
Sports director Jonas Vainauskas invited Stephana Babraska to the headquarters, but he still intends to continue his career as a basketball player.
Vytenis Jasikevičius was also invited, but the agreement was not reached on both sides.
S.Bushevic will work with Robert Kuncaiči and Algimant Bruž at the Litekabeli training station.
Latvia will join Lietkabel on Tuesday and will play the FIBA Champions League match with Dijon USA, but we will not develop it at the bottom of it, as the registration has been completed 24 hours before the start of the match.
Biofuel price reduction is not suitable for all
In order to reduce the price of biofuels, more leaf trees will be transferred to Lithuania in 2019, the Minister of the Environment says.
According to Kęstučio Navicko, this is how you want to " impact" the price of biofuel.
"We have a large set of certain types.
The balance (...) needs to be balanced.
The concentration in soft leaves is because this is how we can have a little impact on the prices of biofuels," said Mr. Navickas on Tuesday, presenting the situation about forest cutting.
According to Navicko, this year the price of wood increased by about 20% in Lithuania.
According to the Minister, in the next year, the pools will be drained as much as this year and the hills will be about 80 hectares lower.
According to him, in Lithuania trees are more waste because of favourable natural conditions.
"In the next few years, it should not be," said Mr. Navicks.
Now 10.2 million ha forests are state and 800 thousand ha are private.
Fighting food prices - a certain obligation: to encourage buying only in your area
The proposed obligation to buy 50% of food products from local producers to reduce the prices of the measures provided by the Ministry of Agriculture is announced by the news portal 15min.lt.
"The Law would apply not only to small traders operating in the regions but also to other suppliers of goods and services.
For example, printing services or office goods could also be provided to the buyer in municipalities by successful local companies," said Minister of Agriculture Virginius Sinkevičius.
President Egidius Mockevicius of the association of meat processors does not doubt that this provision would discriminate against the part of entrepreneurs and would also be difficult to control whether the law is not used by the sellers.
The measure of incompatibility is also criticised by the Head of the Business Confederation of the Governing Board of Sutkus.
Macron calls for Europe to fight against Russia and the US
French President Emmanuel Macron called on Tuesday to create a "real European army" to ensure opportunities to protect against Russia and even the United States
Mr Macron, since his accession to power, calls for the creation of a common force in the European Union, says that Europe needs to reduce its dependence on the military power of America.
In recent years, he has won a major argument by announcing to President Donald Trump that Washington will withdraw from the important Cold War Treaty on Nuclear Power.
"We must protect against China, Russia and even the United States," E. Macron told the radio "Europe 1".
This is the first interview given to his radio since the position of the president began in May 2017.
"Do I see how President Shortas announces that he is withdrawing from the important disarmament treaty created after the 9th decade of a nuclear crisis in Europe, which will be the main victim? - Europe and its security," said the French leader.
The above-mentioned missile crisis has resulted in the development of non-strategic nuclear weapons in the end of the Cold War, through which the United States deployed ballistic missiles in Europe.
This crisis was a major factor in the United States and the Soviet Union's conclusion in 1987 of the medium-range nuclear power contract (INF).
"We won't protect Europeans unless we decide to have a real European army," said E. Macron in an interview, recorded on Monday evening in Verden, northeastern France, this week to the president of the World War I camp in the 100th year before the end of this conflict.
According to Mr Macron, in the situation, "as Russia, which is at our borders, has shown that there is a potential danger... we need a Europe that is better protected by itself and not just depends on the United States".
The French leader became the main initiator of the project to establish the forces of nine European countries, which can quickly set up a joint military operation, escape from the war zone or provide assistance in the event of a natural disaster.
Ministers of Defence of these nine States will meet in Paris for the first time on Wednesday to discuss details of how this force will act.
The European Union has also been committed to a significant increase in its defence budget since 2021 and to the research and development of new technology of around EUR 13 billion over the seven years.
The current EU defence budget does not amount to EUR 600 million.
However, French military schools preparing high-ranking soldiers, Professor Bruno Alomaras said that the vision of the closely united European defence is a difficult implementation.
"The idea of creating a common strategy culture is not bad," he told the news agency AFP.
- However, there is a great gap between the European defence, which Emmanuel Macron is dreaming about, and indeed, there are very big disagreements between the European partners."
Lukashenko NATO hits with rockets: we're not idiots.
On Tuesday, the President of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, stated that his country would need a new weapon if NATO continued to hold forces at the western border of Belarus.
"If NATO continues to be alarmed by the deployment of bases in Poland or otherwise, Belarus will need more effective weapons, in particular rockets," the state news agency BelTA quoted with a group of American analysts from Minsk.
The Head of State also noted that Belarus already has its rocket manufacturing industry.
"In recent times - you have noticed, but we are not blind - we have created our rocket industry and produced our very precise (relevant) missile weapons," the President stressed.
Last week, Mr Lukashenko stated that Minsk and Moscow were looking for the appropriate and costly response to plans to build a base in Poland and to name it for the honour of President Donald Trump (Donaldo Trampo) for the "Trumpo fort" (Fort Trump).
"Of course, it's causing us anxiety.
If we say, in Poland, they will say that they are willing to spend millions of dollars in order to displace some of the Trimp's forts there, of course, we are not idiots and of course we are reacting to it," said Mr. Lukashenko, participating in the discussions of the main group of the Munich Security Conference.
"Of course, we are discussing with our main Union (Russia) how to respond to all of this and how to find an appropriate response at minimum costs," he added.
Western relations with Moscow have been severely affected by the Crimean annexation carried out by Russia in 2014.
Their links also play a role in the Syrian conflict and this year's fight in Great Britain, as it is believed that the attempt by the Russian special services to poison the former agent Sergei Scripla's nerve paralysing material.
The tension between Moscow and Washington further exacerbated the fall after D. Trump announced that he was planning to withdraw from the Cold War Treaty on the regulation of nuclear weapons.
Russia warned that this step could undermine the global security system.
The man who executed the strike revealed how his wife was killed by a footballer who was forced to kill his wife.
Brazil suffered a bloody crime during which the national footballer Daniel Correa Freitas was executed severely.
The athlete was killed by an 18-year-old girl at the birthday party.
The 24-year-old footballer was found dead in Parano, south of Brazil.
It is reported that it has been executed: cut off genitalia, reported severe neck injuries.
After killing a footballer for 38 years, Edison Brittes Jr. acknowledged his guilt and claimed that he did so because D.C.Freitas had abused his wife, Cristian Brittes.
After the massacre, the Brazilians later told in detail what had happened on a crucial night in the television program.
"The evening had already come as soon as I realized that for a long time I had never seen my wife's Christian.
I went to our bedroom, but the door was locked.
When I opened the door, I saw Daniel and my wife, who had prayed for help, lying down in bed.
I've been in death.
Together with my former friends in the evening, we pushed him into the field and dragged him into the car.
This is where I had a knife, with which I killed my wife, a man who had been robbed.
I was very angry, I couldn't do anything to myself at that moment," said the killer.
Along with his friends, he threw the dead body of a footballer near the river, where police officers were looking for a major crime weapon.
The Brazilian civilian police arrested E.B.Junior, as well as his wife and the holy daughter of his birthday.
It is said that police officers surveyed still have strong evidence that a woman was abused during the evening.
True, the last messages and photos of the football player recently distributed in the "WahtsApp" feature can help you run the study.
The footballer sent two pictures to one of his friends through "WhatsApp" in which he starved himself in the bed next to a sleeping woman who, as it turned out, later became Christiana's wife.
"I can sleep here.
There are many women sleeping in different rooms.
I'm going to eat the mother of the barber, although her father is somewhere near," the footballer wrote to his friend.
In this season, Daniel Correa Freitas, a member of the São Paulo Club, was awarded a second in line with Brazil's ability to compete in São Bento.
Tragically killed by Paul Walker's daughter celebrates the 20th year: she did not die without tears
Tragically killed Corridor Paul Walker's daughter Meadow will celebrate a special occasion - she is 20 years old.
Meadow Walker lost one of the most beloved people in the world five years ago, and still a silent wall has been opened.
In social networks, a very rare girl has left her teenage years with tears on her birthday.
She mentioned him when she caught him with a little pie, on which the pink number "20" went out.
The Internet has cut off the scars in which a girl suffers on the day of her birth, but they were quickly removed from social networks.
After the death of the actor Meadow, only her mother Rebecca Soteros grew up.
Paul Walker’s brother and his wife repeatedly said that the actor’s daughter had all the facts.
He was so proud of her.
"Ostino Pauerso" fans threw their head off: another part of the film is waiting
The cultural comedy "Ostinas Pauersa" has captured millions of people around the world.
Futurist, smiling shoulders and costumes are still becoming an inspiration for many fans.
The film creator and star Mike Myers announced that the fourth "Ostino Powers" film is waiting.
However, one of the main actors in the Mini Me film will no longer be able to develop.
His role as actor Verne's Troyer died early this year, in the 49th century.
It was confirmed that the actor himself took his own life.
Mike Myers believed that the world of Verne's Eastine Powers would really miss a movie without him.
Verne was a fantastic comedy actor.
When we wrote the script, his character was not very special - he created all the popularity himself.
He was a great cascademan, a great dancer and a wonderful man," said Mike Myers about him.
Juliette Lewis will join the series "Conners", created by "Rozana"
The star Juliette Lewis on the Twitter network confirmed that he joined the series Konersa, created by Rosana.
“Yes, it is.
The secret is revealed! #JulietteLewissontheconners #TheConners", an actor wrote this week on Twitter and posted a picture that she considers the scenario with the name of the situation comedy.
In another photo, Lewis was photographed with Johnny Galecki and Sara Gilbert, who plays the divorced Davido and Darlena.
"Quickly what will join #TheConners ??!!
I met my brother from the Grizwald family again!
That's great.
The scenario TOKS GERAS. #JulietteLewissonTheConners", wrote Lewis.
Lewis and Galeckis named his brother and sister Audrey and Rusty Griswolds in the 1989 film "Kalėdas vacations".
According to Hollywood Reporter, Lewis plays Galeck's girl Blue, but it's not clear how many series they will appear.
The Koners' debut is scheduled for October.
This spring came back with a high serial rating and it was updated for another season, but it was revoked and the creator and star of Roseanne Barr was fired in May, because the Twitter network shared a racist joke about the former Obama administration officer.
"Conners" will play most of the initial "Rozanos" teams, including Gilbert, Laurie Metcalf and John Goodman.
"Showtime" after two seasons recalled the series "I'm dying here"
"Jimo Carrey's produced showtime drama "I am here in death" was cancelled after two seasons.
"Showtime" refused to order the third season of Jim Carrie's production drama- comedy "I am here dead".
The Deadline.com website says the cable television network has withdrawn the series due to low visibility.
The series entitled Melissa Leo, Aria Graynor, Michael Angarano, Clark Duke, R.J. Cyler, Jake Lacy's and Andrew Santino took place on the scene of the 8th anniversary of the live comedy of Los Angeles.
"I am very grateful for the last three years. When I am asked about the show, I say, "This is a complex series about difficult people... but it was hard to create it." Thank you for watching," wrote Angaran on Friday on Twitter.

Harts is no longer able to take advantage of the suspension option
The reserved winner, Jalenas Hurts, after this Saturday, will no longer be able to be suspended for this season.
Hurts is included in the top scored Crimson Tide on Saturday against the weaker Louisian team and this is the fifth player's match this season.
This year the NSAA has applied a new rule – it is possible to suspend the player involved in the four matches.
This month, Athletic reported that Hurts was planning to do this because of conflicting evaluations and team coaches' response to them.
Then Tagovailoa changed Hurts at the beginning of the season, but Coach "Crimson Tide" Nick Sabana said still planning to use Hurts' skills.
Last season Hurts helped Alabama to get to the matches for the national championship title against the Georgian team, but the second half replaced Tagovailoa, which contributed to the Crimson Tide victory result at 26:23.
Former South East Conference Commander Hurts started the latest 28 Alabama cats and entered the season with a record result – 26:2.
In Saturday's competitions, Hurts ended 22 of 31 Crimson Tide's first four episodes, escaped 276 yards, won four points and took the ball once.
He also ran with a ball 15 times and ran 54 yards.
Owens: Desas must sign the contract immediately
The former commander of Dallas Cowboys, Dezas Bryantas, said shortly after returning to the NFL.
A member of the Museum of Glory Terrell Owens said that I would be able to help Bryant.
In response to a question asked on Twitter when it is intended to sign a contract with the team, Bryant announced on Friday a message of one word "Twitter" : "In a short time."
Three times in Pro Bowl's match, Bryant is no match for any team since he refused to fight for pay in mid-April in Dallas.
Bryanta, who may have rejected the contract with the Baltimore Ravens and is constantly connected with the Cleveland Browns, said before the season that he wants to improve before signing the contract with the team.
In August, when Owens, still talking about the return to NFL, told the TMZ site that Bryanta should try to get back to sport as soon as possible.
"He must join the team and prove to everyone what he can," Owens said to the site.
“All the observers believe that he is not suffering and that he is no longer as good as he thinks he is.
Now he has to go to the team for any reward, accept a one or two year contract – it is absolutely irrelevant – and show everyone what he can."
Bryantas in the Dallas team won the ball 69 times in 2017, escaped 838 yards and earned six points.
In 29 years, the player was the longest in his career – 23 races – did not win 100 yards.
After signing a $70 million value contract for five years in 2015, Bryantas did not last a single season for 1,000 yards and did not catch more than eight points of winning balls.
"If the Director-General or the owner thinks that your skills are getting worse, you will not be able to secure or collect the desired amounts," Owens advised.
He also warned that Bryant had to get to the team as soon as possible, because it could not be achieved at all and said that it would be possible to return to the heavy-duty Cowboys.
"Of course, I don't know if their relationship is not damaged," said Owens, who won the three seasons at the Dallas team 38 times.
"I think that in the case of Dezo, if Cowboys will take it back and he will have the opportunity, it will be useful for Dezu and French."
The CERN Business Development Centre is being set up in Lithuania
Last week, representatives of the European Nuclear Research Organisation (CERN) in Kaunas, European Organisation for Nuclear Research, are assessing the possibility of establishing a CERN Business Development Centre in Lithuania.
Today, there are ten business incubators in Europe in which companies are assisted by commercialising CERN technologies, creating innovative products and adapting them to the needs of society.
Although Lithuania only became a member of CERN last year, the establishment of this organisation's business incubator was already mentioned in the country.
CERN representatives visited the University of Lithuanian Health Sciences (LSMU) and the University of Kaunas Technology (KTU) of Media Science and Biomedical Engineering Institutes in Santakos.
We meet at the National Innovation and Business Centre (NIVC) with KTU, LSMU, Vytaut University, Lithuanian Institute of Energy, Lithuanian Academy of Sciences, Ministry of Economy and Business discussed the Kaunas innovation ecosystem and opportunities for young, innovative businesses.
The visit of the CERN delegation is very important, because if the CERN Business Development Centre is established in Lithuania, it will be the only one in Central and Eastern Europe and will have a significant impact on the region's scientific and business innovations.
"This incubator would encourage the adaptation of CERN's knowledge and technology to key issues, such as new technology and artificial intelligence, to the diagnosis and treatment of diseases, to the processing of large data," says Dr. Leon Balashevicius, the proponent of KTU and innovation.
CERN incubators, as well as other new business development centres, provide business development assistance - provide information and expert advice in adapting technologies to product development and assist in the search for funding sources.
The difference is that the CERN incubator is more scientific.
This centre includes experts from various areas in Lithuania: information technology, materials engineering, as well as specialists in the medical field.
The CERN is best known for the high-end hadron-fighting speeder in Switzerland (LHC, The Large Hadron Collider), the world's largest and most powerful particle speeder.
However, CERN studies are conducted not only in quantum mechanics but also in other areas, ranging from cryogenics (very cold temperature effects) to partial monitoring and radiation studies.
The work done by these technologies and scientists has an impact on many areas of importance for society: medicine, security and industrial development.
"Vilniaus Burntė" has a new leader
The new Director-General of the AB "Vilniaus Burntė" appointed Roka Mituza, who will replace Raymond Pilču in these duties.
As of last summer, Pilka will continue to be the financial director of Vilniaus Fuelės, as stated in the report published by the Vilnius Stock Exchange.
Mr. Mitzus is a co-founder of a large-scale manufacturing company called Buga LT, listed in his LinkedIn section.
In 2012-2017, Mituzas was the director of the region's group "SPI Group", previously working in the "Reckitt Benckiser" and "Universal" groups.
The "Vilniaus Fuel" ended the first quarter of this year with a loss of 315,500 Euro.
Last year, the company earned EUR 392,300 in the relevant period.
The company's sales revenue without excise amounted to EUR 4,956 million and decreased by 13,16% compared to the first quarter of last year.
More than 100 people are working at the Williaus Firehouse.
STT detained R. Ača - Business knowledge
The former MP and the former director of the administration of the Rasei district municipality, Remigius Aza, are suspected of being harassed.
He's under arrest.
The Special Investigation Service (STT) shall report that the officials of the Šiauliai Board shall carry out a pre-trial investigation into possible corruption in the municipality of the Razeina region.
"The former director of the administration of the district of Raseių district of R. A. (Remigius Ajas - rep.) is suspected of being harassed.
The circumstances of the non-transparent procurement, R. A., in the course of the duties of the director of the municipality, are examined - the possibility of exclusive favour for a private company to conclude a public procurement contract with the municipality of the Raseis district.
R.A. is suspected to have adopted a high-value (more than 250 MGL) box", says the STT press release.
BNS adds that this company is the "Rasian Bus Park".
On Monday, officials also detained the suspected head of the company "Rasian Bus Parks" of the town of Rasian municipality, Vladislav Šimait.
This BNS confirmed the STT representative for the press Renata Ensjotytė.
The STT report states that the suspicions are also expressed by two representatives of companies who directly wrote to Mr. Ač or who participated in masking coughs through various financial operations.
All suspects are detainees, their jobs and the crews performed at home.
LSDD was suspended
In time, Remigius was the director of the district administration of the Rasei district, but he lost these duties in the wake of his failure to support his report to the Council in April.
He was also a member of this region in 2011-2012, Mr Ajas - a long-term member of the Seimas, he has been elected to parliament since 2004 as the candidate of the party "Sustainment and Justice".
However, in 2013 he and these parties were separated, and in 2016 the Seimas had failed to discharge its mandate.
Now Mr. Acza depends on the separate social democrats and on the newly created working party of the Lithuanian Social Democrats' Party (LSDD).
The president of the LSDD, Mr Kirkils, informed the press in his distributed report that he temporarily suspended membership of the party until the investigation was carried out.
"The actions of the Special Investigation Service and the suspicions expressed to Remigiu Achu are a rare surprise to us, but in all cases, the law enforcement must take all the necessary action to be able to ascertain the truth.
R. Time temporarily suspended membership in the party until the pre-trial investigation was carried out," says LSDD leader Kirkils.
In 2003, Aida was the leader of the group of consultants of the then President Roland Pakso, who was subsequently removed from office during the prosecution.
Meras A. Gricius: I did not directly control the work of R. Acho
Neither the mayor of the Raseių district, Algirdas Gricius, nor the current head of the municipal administration, Liudas Kavaliauskas BNS, said on Monday that there was no information on the specific purchase of the law enforcement investigation.
Meras Gricius said that Mr. Acho's detention was known from the media.
"I really can't say that we've been very excited about the functions, I've been doing my job as a mayor, he (R. Ajaz - BNS) is an administration job, and I couldn't say anything about the reasons why this was done for public procurement," the BNS said on Monday.
He also argued for the same reasons that he would not want to assess the administration of the former administration of the municipality of Acho.
I was afraid to say something that I could appreciate his activities, because I did not directly control his administrative work, as far as I was standing up for public procurement, for tenders, said that such and such public procurements, such tenders, after which everything in public space was seen, were concluded, which I had already seen as a mercenary.
Therefore, I cannot describe how he managed the administration at the time as its director," said Mr Grecius.
He said to himself that he was not involved in public procurement and that he had no influence on them.
Minister of Culture team - new advisor
Dr. Joseph Blažiūns added the team of cultural advisers from Lian Ruokytės-Johnsson.
He is an adviser to the management of archives, libraries, museums and cultural heritage.
The Ministry of Culture reports that Fr Blažiūnas, a professor of literature and art archive of the Faculty of Communication of the University of Vilnius, has been the director of Lithuanian literature and art archives in Vilnius since 2016.
In addition, students from the Faculty of Communication in 2017 selected Mr Blažiúna as the best lecturer.

S. Gentvils: 90 million Euro fines are in danger of non-impact GPAIS business
The vice-president of the Seimas Environmental Protection Committee, Simon Gentvils, said that, due to the poor functioning of the information system of products, packaging and waste accounting (GPAIS) for Lithuanian producers and importers at the end of the year, almost €90 million may be paid.
"At the end of the year and after the GPAIS system has not started to function normally, the systemic package management crisis is becoming increasingly real.
It is unofficially stated that the certificates certifying the handling of packaging waste have been issued as much as 1% of the planned processing tasks", says Mr Gentvils in the press.
On 7 November, the Seimun launches an extraordinary meeting of the Environmental Protection Committee, which intends to discuss the situation, to find out why the functions of this programme are not affected, why the programme module is not actually implemented and how the Ministry of the Environment intends to address the problem.
"Without the necessary legislative or legislative initiatives, producers and importers are at risk of returning huge environmental pollution taxes at the end of this year," said Gentvilas.
In his view, the shortcomings and inefficiency of the GPAIS accounting system signal a serious crisis in the packaging waste management sector, which can be compared to the Metrail crisis.
Concerns about tasks
Some experts also warn that part of the companies may not be affected by the waste recycling tasks identified by the State in 2018.
In the light of the results of the first half-year reprocessing of packages published by the organisations, the experts state the basis for concern that part of the organisations may fail to manage the required quantity of packaging waste in 2018.
As a result, part of the companies may no longer be able to benefit from the reduction in the pollution tax and would be able to pay the pollution tax for certain quantities of packages released on the market during the year.
The GOC stated that two out of the three producer organisations currently operating were rejected and one did not comment.
Kęstutis Pocius, Director-General of the General Green Point, said that at least formally it is possible to meet tasks depends on whether the problems of the product, packaging and waste information accounting system (GPAIS) will be solved.
"Green Point" is scheduled to be able to handle all types of packaging this year, except for glasses.
Although the Green Point's task of glass will not be successful this year, the organisation promises to compensate members for the losses resulting from it.
Experts doubt the benefits of food coupons
In planning to share food coupons with the government and thus encourage family or farm trade, experts doubt the benefits of such innovation.
They agree that the new system would create additional bureaucratic burden.
The head of the Lithuanian Business Confederation Tax Commission, Marius Dubnikov, says the coupons are alive and the problem is not solved, and the Government should focus on increasing people's income.
"The system seems to be quite strange and seems to be taken from older leaders.
If we want to help society acquire something or have more purchasing power, we have to focus all our capacities on how to increase people's income, and people themselves have to decide whether to buy in one or another store," said BNS Mr Dubnikos.
According to him, the government would benefit from lower incomes for the people receiving it by offering food coupons.
"It is obvious that it applies to the less-income people, as if they were on the sidewalk with a voucher on which to write, we, this Government, have given you a voucher, and be kind to us.
It sounds like some kind of anti-choice promises, where you want to write your signature very clearly," said the analyst.
According to him, the food coupon system will need additional investment, and it will increase the administrative burden, because it will need to monitor who and how they are protected from processing.
The Bank's chief economist, Nerius Mačiulis, says that with one instrument to achieve both goals - to support small-income residents and small entrepreneurs - would not succeed.
"If this is support for small businessmen, price differences are compensated and the people can buy cheaper goods in smaller shops, this price difference is compensated by the State from the budget.
Then it's a support for business, but not a support for the population," BNS said Mr. Mačiulis.
In his view, such a system would probably not have a significant macroeconomic impact and would not have substantially changed the competitive situation of small retailers, and would, on the contrary, create an additional bureaucratic burden and could make it difficult for new market participants to arrive.
"It seems that this would be a fairly bureaucratic instrument with large administrative costs, and that would also be quite uncomfortable for the people, they should buy not in any larger store with a higher range of houses, but looking for several specialised shops with a lower range," said the economist.
According to him, coupons are used in other countries where the volume of goods or services is limited and should be given to all alike, or to some social group.
The people then receive coupons free of charge and can be delivered to food.
According to Mr Mačiuli, they are also used in the labour market by granting temporary tax benefits to businesses in the employment of long-term unemployed or, for example, former prisoners.
Such practice, in the words of Mr. Mačiuli, was also successfully applied in Lithuania.
On Monday, Prime Minister Saulis Skvernelis said that a new system of food coupons is being considered by the Government to help the poorest people, to increase competition, to encourage small businesses or farmers.
The Prime Minister's adviser, Skirmantas Malinauskas BNS, said on Monday that the idea is most focused on farmers and family businesses, and buyers with coupons could get 20-30% discount.
According to him, the amount of coupons would be limited so that farmers could not misuse.
According to him, 3-5 coupons would allow a person to benefit 10-15 euros a month.
Although the state budget does not yet provide for funding for the programme, it could be financed from this source, perhaps also from the European Union funds.
"Not everything currently planned or not planned in the budget will be final, it will still change Seim, so it happens, the funds can be transferred from one line to another, and from ministries, the exchange of funding can be things.
There is always a priority for decision-making - or something to refuse to find another additional source of income and similar," BNS said on Tuesday, Mr Malinauskas.
The scope and timing of innovation are still being determined.
