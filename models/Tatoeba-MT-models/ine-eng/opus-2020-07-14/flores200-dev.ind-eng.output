The stars give light and heat, because the energy created when hydrogen atoms merge (or merge) forms a heavier element.
Scientists are working to create reactors that can generate energy in the same way.
It's, however, a very difficult problem to solve and it's going to take years before we see a useful fusion reactor built.
The tires are floating on the surface of the water because of the surface.
The pressure of the surface occurs because the water molecules on the surface are more attractive than the air molecules on it.
Water molecules create invisible layers on the surface that allow things such as the needle to float on the water.

To get back to the previous energy level, those atoms have to waste more energy than they get from the light.
"They're doing this in a way that triggers a small light particle that's usually called a photon."
"The scientists call this process "the stimulation of radiation emissions" because the atoms are stimulated by light, which causes the emission of light photos, and the light is one kind of radiation."
The next picture shows an atom that emits photos, of course, in the real photon world much smaller than the one in the picture.
Photos are even smaller than atomizing things.

If you stand on the surface of the Io, you're going to be a little smaller than when you're on Earth.
The 90-pounder on Earth will be 16-pounder in Io, which is why gravity has lower pull capacity.
The sun has no radiation like Earth that you can see. The whole sun is made of gas, fire, and plasma.
