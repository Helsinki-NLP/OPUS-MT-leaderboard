The product cost less than 20 euros.
The fee corresponds to 40% of the value of the goods....
I'm #PRS_ORG# wholesaler and so it's not a problem for me.
You only need a number or instructions that I should add to the package so it can be drawn by you as a return.
I ordered the #PRS_ORG# a few days ago... for 249€.
Today it costs 179€.
I find that to be very annoying.
Do I have to cancel the order and reorder it for the better price or is there any other possibility of credit?
I also find, in principle, that children should not be encouraged to take a parent role for their little siblings.
However, I find that it is also good for large sisters to take care of the small ones.
Take a look, help a little bit, bring the bottle, etc.
So they learn responsibility, help in the family with and are involved.
As long as they can be quite a child, I don't see a problem.
If your K1 works alone for the short time and it's OK for him, that's good.
You can do the best you can to determine whether it's appropriate for your children.
It's not like he's changing K2 and going to sleep for hours.
Legally, it's probably questionable.
Perhaps that is why the statement of psychologists is also coming.
Because if something really should happen like a fire, burglary, earthquakes, alien invasion, etc., it would actually be too much responsibility for K1, to take care of K2.
If this is a risk you want to enter, of course, is your estimate;)
Please help me find the title of a book again!
I remember having read a crime/triller a few years ago, and I can still remember almost all the action, but I don't want to get the title out of the way, maybe someone here knows that...
The story was about fear and to treat them.
At the beginning of the story, an animal keeper commits suicide by overexposing himself with feed and going to his robbery.
The case is taken by a Commissioner after a brief investigation of his therapists, who operates a clinic where he treats patients with fear.
The Commissioner has a small nonexist who has also a fear (before fire) and landed in this therapist.
It comes to more suicides and there is another protagonist - a photographer who is commissioned to go and document the scene of the suicide and put the photos on the Internet before any suicide.
In any event, it turns out that this therapy operates a kind of underlying therapy group where patients have a chip transplanted in their brain, which suppresses an anxiety center, and ultimately the patients are afraid of the most extreme.
(A woman jumps out of the window another one goes for death)
This fear is referred to in the book as "the fight".
At the end, there's a big showdown in the clinic that had to do with a fire.
This is the cruel act I am quite sure that the book was originally written by a French author/author.
If this action is known to someone or even someone can tell me the title of the book, I would be very happy.
Oh, yeah, I don't have the password for Wlan.
I just need to contact my husband.
But it can take a while.
What steps do I have to take then?
Is it also possible to return the price difference?
Child, 4 j., split under the thumb
The child, four years old, has over the entire length of wood splitter under the thumbnail (outside).
They tried to pull him with a pintette.
It's very hard to catch.
He didn't bite and hurt.
Now the child responds hysterically when we try.
No more chance.
It's going to the doctor tomorrow.

Due to Omikron: Johnson wants to proceed with re-suppression
New Omikron cases always provide politics and science in Britain.
Thus, until New Year, all qualified adults in England are expected to receive an invitation.
London - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson wants to make even faster progress in the Corona emergency vaccinations in view of rapidly increasing Omikron numbers.
Every adult in England should be given the opportunity to receive a booster dose by the end of the year, provided that at least three months have elapsed since the second vaccination, Johnson told his countrymen on Sunday night in a pre-registered video message.
So far, the target date was at the end of January.
The UK Government will also support the acceleration of vaccination campaigns in the parts of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
In view of the Omikron variant, one has to face an emergency, so the protection of vaccination must be strengthened urgently," said Johnson.
The good news is that the level of protection with a third vaccine dose can be increased again.
"Let's get out of here now!" said Johnson.
On Sunday, 1239 additional Omikron cases were recorded in Britain, increasing the total number to 3137.
Compared to the previous day, this was an increase of 65 percent. dpa

I'm for everyone to introduce themselves with pronoms.
I sent out an application.
Today the invitation came to a conversation by mail.
I want to answer the e-mail.
Unfortunately, however, the name is not "Peter", but a somewhat more complicated name.
I have swallowed him and wherever he/she has a cultural background it is either a man or a woman.
**I have no idea how to write the e-mail now.
Can someone help me?
** I'm an alien and I don't want to keep an officer on the foot.
Conclusion: everyone should introduce himself with pronoms.
Have a total of 5 books.
Four of them go.
It's just that one I bought today is not going
Apparently, the chair had a non-obvious defect in sales.
How can such a damage occur after 9 months ?
Just trying on the #PRS_ORG#.
But it's been working since about.
14 days no more.
That's why I always bought the last books on the website and then read on the #PRS_ORG#.
I bought 6 #PRS_ORG# and wanted to buy 8.
But there was no more.
Now they are available again and I want to add 2 chairs to your order and take this into account.
[CW] The feeling if I can't help.
Content Warning: I'll write something in detail here about domestic violence.
I just need to write something from the soul.
I (21) come in contact with victims (and victims) of domestic violence more often for professional reasons.
A topic that really nighted me and unfortunately is too often too often that many victims don't help themselves or think we couldn't help them.
I'm quite clear that we can't do everything and it's not perfect.
But there are fewer things in my profession that move me more than if I can do nothing in such situations.
I see the blue spots, the blood, the desperate eyes...
But even in the conversation under four eyes, with the actor far away from sight and hearing, I cannot reach all of them.
I don't know what the reason is, maybe it's fear, fear of smoking, fear of leaving the usual social environment, fear of getting the children out of it.
What I always want to make clear to everyone is, in part, very close to the tears, all are worth living without violence.
I want all women to know that they don't just have to take violence.
I often wish I could help in any case... I know I can't.
But this will never make it easier.
Please, always think that you are worth living without violence that is so incomprehensible.
"Arcane" on Netflix: What's in the series "League of Legends"?
Many fantasy, many complicated names, a stunning creation: "Arcane", the series from the "League of Legends" computer game universe, has recently started on Netflix.
Why do we look forward to the two staffs already announced?
basketball-Bundesliga: Derby-Debakel of the MHP Risesen Ludwigsburg at the Merlins Crailsheim
At least on Youngster Johannes Patrick was released.
Nothing again: For the second time in not even three months, the giants lost in Crailsheim - and how!
Before the game, Ludwigsburg's coach John Patrick had said with a look back on the Pokal descent at Hakro Merlins Crailsheim at the beginning of October: "We still have some anger in the belly."
He did not put up after the game - but again increased in view of the 61:72 (28:38) - defeat in the basketball league.
More than that, the naked result disappointed the manner of the performance.
A representative was called a statistics that expressed the whole dilemma: The triple quota was just 13 percent, 4 hits (all by young John Patrick) in saying and writing 31 attempts - even questions?
John Patrick replied: "We were simply not concentrated enough after the victory at Tenerife, and have not implemented what we have trained".
To move the ball.
On the other hand, he reacted to Sebastian Gleim: "A noble game to win for the second time against Ludwigsburg," said the happy coach.
"It has felt like 10,000 people."
On Saturday in Hohenlohe Arena, only 750 visitors were allowed, but they came at their costs.
Not least because of BBL-Topscorer T.J. Shorts, who marked 22 points and linked the game of his team.
"The best gamemaker I've ever trained," Gleim praised.
While in Patrick's team, the performance carriers such as Jordan Hulls (0 points) and Jonah Radebough (7) were lost on the whole line.
Only in the last quarter (2:15) the giants prevented a total debacle and came up to eight points after they had already fallen to 39:59.
In addition to John Patrick, Justin Simon arrived at twelve points.
Fortunately, there is no time to hate.
Already on Wednesday at 7:00 p.m., the giants receive the Skyliners Frankfurt, then also in Ludwigsburg, a maximum of 750 spectators.
We used to have another email address, but I changed it.
Yeah, I've already reported it a few months ago.
Unfortunately, all guarantees were rejected.
We have been legally informed again, and therefore we have written them down again.
We were first notified a year and a half ago.
Stets like Called from the Egg: Max Raabe Becomes 59
He is able to entertain his audience with new interpretations of battlers from the 20s and 30s.
Today he is on his way with the program "Good Day, Dear Happiness" - if he may.
In fact, Max Raabe would have wanted to celebrate his birthday on the stage in Leipzig this Sunday.
But it's not going to happen.
The planned concert was held in May 2022 - "on official instructions", in order to stop the Corona virus.
Other of his performances planned in the Advent season must only take place once, as it is called on the website of the singer who becomes 59 today, and his musician (www.palast-orchester.de).
From January, the artists will then follow up on their dates already set in 2020 due to the pandemic.
Born on December 12, 1962 in the North Rhine-Westphalia, Max Raabe has already sung much and gladly as a youth.
In Berlin he studied opera music, in 1986 he founded the Palace of Orchestra, together with Kommilion.
Since then, the Bariton has established itself with its repertoire of winners and chancens in the style of the Comedian Harmonists.
He was awarded prizes many times.
His live album from the "MTV Unplugged" series (2019) arrived - just like his successful album "For Women, it's no problem" (2013) - the second place in the charts.
He made it out of the nest in the mainstream.
Always elegantly dressed, the blonde hair coming back tight and considering labels, Max Raabe from the current German music landscape is no longer to be remembered.
With the program "Good Day, Dear Happiness" he has been on tour. dpa since 2020

Federal Ministry of Construction Klara Geywitz: There is no new apartment created by eviction
The new Federal Ministry of Construction Klara Geywitz (SPD) has spoken against the disposing of large housing companies, as was required in Berlin in a national decision.
"With a disinheritance, there is no new apartment, only the ownership structure changes," Geywitz said in an interview with the "day mirror" (Sunday).
My goal is to guarantee tenants that their rent will remain payable in the coming years.
A colourful mix of private owners, associations or housing companies is, for example, the best protection against monopolies.
In Berlin, the SPD, Green and Left-Party coalition intends to set up an expert commission, as the outcome of the People's Decision will be.
However, if the situation does not relax, Geywitz did not close talks directly with the FDP in the Ample Coalition on further abbreviations in rental law.
The Coalition Treaty provides for a rental price brake by 2029, a limitation of rental increases in tight housing markets and the extension of the rent level.
I will speak to the Minister of Justice to implement this as soon as possible.
However, if the rental market does not relax, "we will talk to the coalition partners about further steps," the SPD politician stressed.
Hello, I wanted to order something, and after a few days, I was surprised that I forgot the last step in payment.

At least 100 dead by Tornados in Kentucky
In a devastating storm system, numerous tornados have been pulled by the United States.
In Kentucky alone, more than 100 deaths could be reported.
The images of it remind us of a war zone.
In the night of Saturday, several tornados have set up heavy deserts in the United States and may require up to one hundred deaths.
The storms leave about 320 kilometers long snow of desert, especially in the state of Kentucky.
His Governor Andy Beshear said after a visit to the disaster area, wherever the Tornado is going, everything is gone.
Houses, shops, government buildings - just away.
Parts of industrial plants, roofs are in the trees.
It is hard to imagine that this is possible at all.
He alone counts Kentucky with up to one hundred dead in the Member State, the official numbers rising at an hour.
Hello, I just saw that she was selling Vitrine #NAME#.
That's too bad.
Will it still be produced?
Or did she just get out of the range?
Is it possible to order this vial in another country?
How long have you been logged in?
If delivery cannot be done in my apartment, I have to cancel the order!
I understand that, but can I just order the cover now and let it be delivered to Germany, which is in the shopping cart?
I had given back an article or a return via the contact form and wanted to ask whether it was obtained or processed, as I have not yet received confirmation.
Firms pay premiums and change advertising
While the Federal Government continues to reject proposals for a vaccination premium, companies in Austria have taken the initiative themselves and offer their employees money prizes for vaccination.
As a result, they are on a line with the social partners ÖGB and the Chamber of Commerce, which today called for financial incentives for vaccination.
The conversion of advertising logos to immunise - according to a German example - is also intended to increase the readiness to corona impressions.
He's changed into a company he's read about.
That doesn't make his situation better than yours.
Dinner and tea.
It's a year here.
He obviously didn't even stick to his old place and looked for something else.
You can do that, too.
And that he didn't find you any good at that time: well, don't worry.
He didn't find his job well, either.
There are too many variables.
Please accept the cancellation.
This will then be legally relevant.
I'm doing a screen shot.

Help with First Own Campaign
Boron to the bush!
I'm leading for a group of 4 friends the adventure over the grab pass and I want my heroes to lead in a special campaign written for the players.
We're playing DSA 5.
The big bow is made to write the evil weights and their motivations, the individual acts are supposed to be, and now I am writing the entrant, and I am proud to write on my own feet at the first encounter.
The award is that the heroes should bring a farm with grain of Gratenfels to a small village near the Thuran-Sea.
This is where further action is to be taken.
A few miles away from the village, the heroes are to climb a group of Goblins and lure them into a backyard.
I would like to give players the opportunity to solve the confrontation in different ways: convince, act, threaten to recognise the danger early, whatever the players always do.
Group strength: 8 common goblins, 2 with muscles, 6 with bows and swords armed
In the absence of any notice, the Goblins run the heroes on a high road and flange to every three left and right bows to me armed the vehicle while two with muscles stop the vehicle.
If it comes to fighting and under the heroes, I have two solutions
1. All the heroes are found unconscious and then found and healed by the son of the village school.
Of course, the career is gone.
2. If a defeat is inevitable, just like this half, with two of his servants enter and the heroes come in for help in the fight.
The car's still there, everything's great.
How do you maintain your God ex Machine of Solution 2?
Is the encounter too much as an entry into the adventure?
The Goblins group will play another crucial role later, so it is not just cannon feed.
EDIT: wow, I didn't count on so many answers, especially not with so many great suggestions and tips.
I will guarantee many of your ideas and now I have more confidence in my Narrative.
I built the lamp again.
And it's stuck together again.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
That's why I'd like to send her back anyway.
If you can get the back, then I can pack the lamp and bring it to #PRS_ORG#.

Here the lower part was damaged, so almost the part with stauraum.
Then will all be taken back or only the staurarum part?
I'm born of Sky Sport F1
Hello, dear F1 fans, over the season, the quality on the German cloud has dropped more and more, so I want to make a little air with this post.
For the first time today, in the middle of the F2 race, the transmission was interrupted to allow the F1 pre-reporting to begin on time.
Although it was due to the late beginning and the start of the schedule far behind the schedule, it would still have been possible to show the last ten minutes (planted) as well as the winning decision (!).
But it seems that for legal reasons, the F1 takes precedence and therefore has to restrict everything else, so Sky DE probably didn't have a choice here.
Still stupid, mostly Sky UK has transferred the race to the end.
Nevertheless, a small praise: Commentator Olivier Zwartyes has accompanied the difficult situation of the serious accident well.
Then there was rule knowledge in the F1 again among the commentators Sascha Roos and Ralf Schumacher, so they didn't know that you could change the tires under a red flag.
Although this was already the situation in Imola, Baku and Silverstone this year, both came to the conclusion that evaporatives may change the tires when there were corresponding radio languages on this topic to Hamilton.
At Sky UK and RTL, both commentators knew immediately that there was this possibility for disappearances.
I believe that such basic rules should be known simply when you comment on the F1 at a pay TV broadcast.
It is also not the first puzzle rate, which is now possible or prescribed according to rules, both simply have constant uncertainties on the subject of rules.
In general, it does not like the artificial comment style of Roos, but say that the taste is.
But I really like Heiko's water from RTL better.
To this end, permanent alberites that simply make both unprofessional effects, such as ordering coffee at (as well as unconscious) reporter Peter Hardenacke or "UuuuuuHD" by Ralf Schumacher.
Especially the latter brings a lot of unrest into the comment that he obviously does not take it seriously.
Not least, the advertising simply takes over with Sky, in which the only broadcaster who goes into the advertising is Sky, as can be heard with F1TV, where only the German soundtrack must come out without comment directly after the race.
Neither ServusTV nor ORF do that.
These two broadcasts also make training less advertising than Sky, and that as free TV broadcaster.
Although you have to praise Glock and Baumgartner for their work, that alone does not allow me to overlook the disadvantages.
The remaining Sky Sport F1 program is also very smart and full of repetitions.
In total, Sky is really the worst German-speaking transmitter that transfers the F1.
Unironically, RTL makes a better job until advertising at the four races they can still transfer.
In any case, the grandiose F1 season makes much less fun than it would be possible with a reasonable sender.
I would be interested in your opinion.
On the following: #PRS_ORG# flashlights, brass and multicolored glass x 1
Hello, I have an article that should be delivered last week and which is still not delivered.
I've contacted the chat twice, and so far nothing.
First Lady told me it was sent on Monday, second Lady told me yesterday that she would check and send an e-mail and she never answered.
Hello, I ordered two #PRS_ORG# on 12.12.19.
One of them has already shown a defect after a relatively short time (the substance has a hole in the front part of the chair).
I'm asking for your support.
Air pumps are excellently suitable to provide an additional aquarium with oxygen.
It is also possible to operate a filter system over air lifts.
This series is offered in 3 variants by us.
Look at the table at the end of the offer.
There you can see the services in comparison.
If the pumps are strong enough, you can operate all the systems.
If you have a large aquarium you can use pumps with 2 or more exits so you can connect several outlets.
The MK series has one, two or four outputs, depending on the air pump model, but they also offer to put an accent in the aquarium, for example with an air front (see us in the shop) or with a decor that turns the air bubbles into a function.
Here would be a treasured pipe, a muscle or something.
The MK series has a special, soundproof structure and thus ensures low operating noise.
The installation is very simple.
The air pump is connected 4/6 mm through an air hose to an oven, etc....and it can be released.
The air pump should be equal to or higher than the water level and be placed outside.
If the air pump is deeper than the water level, you should place a rear-view valve between them.
Simply cut through the air hose and place the valve between.
This would prevent if once the water runs backwards, the water from the basin runs through the pump...
If the air pump is applied freely, you should, as well as other air pumps, be covered and protected from moisture
The MK series pumps are pure power packages that consume little energy
Even if we specify the 3-day processing time here in ebay, the packages are packed daily and the packages are picked up here every day.
It's going well, it's going very fast.
We just want to avoid a little, so no one's gonna agree, just because it's been a little longer.
It would be so, not everyone has an understanding for all the employees who also work in the shipping industry... of course, there's no keeping Corona here.
Please do not consider it bad just because the delivery is delayed, which is exclusively due to package services.
Of course you would like to joke about these services, even if we're saying at the moment, they've got it damn hard.
This is also very different in the region.
Don't be mad at anyone, stay healthy and we all hope that there are even better times.
How long does it take to order the yellow with and without armrest?
Can you also order the legs in light here?
Amazon founder Bezo sends astronaut daughter and moderator into the worldall
The daughter of the first American in all, a TV moderator and four other passengers have taken a short trip to space.
They were transported on Saturday from the rocket system "New Shepard" by Blue Origin by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.
The start and landing of the approximately ten-minute flight took place in the west of the United States of Texas.
Under the shining blue sky, Bezos took the freshly cut astronauts in high person after their return.
"Come back," Bezos said, dressed in a blue rauman suit when he opened the Luke to the capsule.
Under the applause of friends, family members and employees of Blue Origin, the six passengers climbed back and forth and hugged the Amazon founder.
According to Blue Origin, they were 10 minutes and 13 seconds on the way and reached a height of 107 kilometers.
The 74-year-old Laura Shepard Churchley, daughter of the 1961 NASA astronauts, was named Alan Shepard (1923-1998), after which Blue Origin's rocket system was named, and the 50-year-old TV moderator Michael Strahan was honorary officers of the company, who had paid for their tickets to the other four passengers: space engineer Dylan Taylor, Investor Evan Dick, technology contractor Lane Bess and his son Cameron.
How much they paid for her ticket, Blue Origin didn't share with her.
Laura Shepard Churchley recalled after her short flight to her father's mission.
He worked hard at his positions and had to do everything himself.
She was just so scared, the 74-year-old said with a smile.
Michael Strahan too was thrilled.
He would like to return to everything at once, the moderator said.
"New Shepard" flies up to 100 kilometers high
The "New Shepard" rocket system is largely automated.
During the flight away from the rocket, the capsule reached an altitude of about 100 kilometres above the earth, timeless before the re-useable object was returned from large parachutes.
The International Aviation Association and many other experts view the earth as a border to space, but there is no binding international regulation.
It was already the third all-managed trip from Blue Origin: In the first July, Amazon founder Bezos himself was on board, along with his brother Mark, an 82-year-old US pilot and an 18-year-old Netherlands.
In the second October, the 90-year-old Canadian actor William Shatner was the world-renowned "Captain Church" in "Star Trek", as well as the former NASA engineer Chris Boshuizen, the entrepreneur Glen de Vries and the deputy chief of Blue Origin, Audrey Powers.
Critics propose Bezos and Blue Origin to advance the business with space tourism largely without scientific research interests for the benefit of mankind and without regard to the climate.

Someone who worked in biochemistry or studied biochemistry
I am currently studying in the first semester of biochemistry and find the case quite exciting and even in the laboratory does not bother me (have already the inorganic chemistry practice behind me).
Of course, I have also been informed before the study on occupational prospects, but I thought at the time, which I would definitely like to study until the promotion and will be.
At the moment, however, I have doubts, especially disturbing my career prospects.
On the one side (studycheck etc) you always hear great job opportunities and the job is sought in full, on the other side you always hear from unemployed biologists and incredibly poorly paid jobs.
That's why I'd really be interested:
1) What are you currently working on?
2) Are you satisfied with your work/content?
3) What have you studied/ what training you have done?
4) Would you do all this again?
Thank you for your answers!
I am currently really uncertain and more likely to interrupt the study in 2022 and to train the specialist.
If you have experiences there, you also like to write :)
Extra stress before holidays & holidays weekend
This topic came to my attention last week.
But now I had to use my long weekend to relax.
That's why it's just a joke.
Not just before big holidays, like Christmas holidays, there is great stress in our business.
As it seems, there are also the front days plus bridge days.
It was like this: Last week it was Maria Heavenly, which is called "Auffahrt" with us in Switzerland.
On Friday, most people and businesses make a bridge day, which is therefore semi-official.
So last week it was a long four-day weekend in the house.
So, what happened last week?
All over stress.
Lauter e-mails, who had to leave before departure, order here there, all *unconditional* before the long weekend.
Because... I because?
Because "the next week" sounds so much time and that shouldn't be?
Or because people want to do as much in a short week as they do in a normal week?
Not only was I upset on Wednesday, but I was also very nervous.
What's this self-satisfaction about holidays?
Then why do we still have a holiday if we cannot afford it properly?!
The stress was not well noticed from the top, the colleagues were all so self-contained.
My question is, are we the Swiss?
Is that our reformed-Evangelical way?
Or do you know that in the north?
Yvonne Catterfeld enjoys Christmas in Thuringia
Yvonne Catterfeld (42) rejoices at Christmas in her Thuringian home - but still has no gifts.
"The beauty, even if there should be no snow in Erfurt, is simply taken to Ilmenau in the Thuringia Forest," said the actor and singer Hit Radio FPH.
She will agree to the party by backing up and bastele with her son.
"I love that," said Catterfeld.
But until the strange days they have to do some more: "For the first time I have no gifts yet, I must finally leave."
NECTON-BIO supports the smooth running of the mouse and the breeding process.
NECTON-Bio contains all vital vitamins, amino acids, minerals, trace elements and 200,000 μg Biotin/kg.
NECTON-BIO gives the bird a smooth and shiny feathers.
The majority of the pests present in the holding of birds are due solely to food defects.
Since the feed consists of a protein-containing substance, a particularly rich and balanced protein consumption of the bird is a prerequisite for the formation of a non-intended feed.
For a functioning metabolism, the daily food must contain enough vitamins, minerals and trace elements.
Most of the animal losses occurring during the mouse are due to poor or unbalanced protein consumption and/or inadequate supply of vitamins and minerals.
In the composition of NECTON-Bio, the unfavourable ratio of amino acids in most plant feed is explicitly taken into account and balanced.
No further vitamin preparation should be administered during the use of NECTON-Bio.
NECTON-Bio is cold water soluble and can be supplied simply via drinking water or via wet food.
Thank you so much for finding it.
Unfortunately, it still doesn't work.
DDR-manufacturer model Altbau E-Lok E 95 03 DRG/ DR, the Lok was in use in Germany and in Germany, the very rare lok is likely to come from the redesign proposal of the model railway ME Heft 11/1968, used with play trails and flaws see photos, function well, the construction cycle E 95 is a heavy electrical locomotive of the German Reichsbahn Society (DRG) designed for the traction of heavy coal trains in the German network, possibly also originating from the small company ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN.
A locomotive is located in the DB Museum Hall (Saale) and we are able to operate
The German Reichsbahn company had commissioned the AEG in 1924 to submit proposals for an electrolocomotive that could carry 2,200 tonnes of carbon trains and 530 tonnes of passenger trains at 45 km/h.
The maximum speed was 65 km/h.
Thus, in March 1926, the DRG determined the delivery as 1Co+Co1' locomotive with Tatzslager Drive AEG with the delivery of the mechanical part, the Siemens suction plants with the electrical part.
From December 1927 to June 1928, the supply of six locomotives received operating numbers E 95 01–06.
All survived the Second World War and then returned to the territory of the later DDR.
In 1946 the locomotives arrived as repair goods in the Soviet Union.
They returned to Germany until November 1952.
In Dessau, the value of processing of all six locomotives was established.
[4] In 1959 the three locomotives E 95 01 to E 95 03 were developed with the progressive re-electrification of the medium-sized network, while the other machines served as spare parts donors.
At first, the preferred E 04, E 44 and E 94 were built up in larger numbers.
Only when E 94 saw that the number of processing could not be further increased, the E 95 went to the point of processing.
[4] Initially, the locomotives were stationed in the Leipzig railway station.
They arrived in 1960 at the Halle P.
They were used in their own cycle plan mainly in front of coal trains from the Geiseltal in the direction of Halle, Leipzig and Erfurt.
The complicated control of locomotives was problematic with increasing age.
In this way, it was more common for shields to remain glued to switch handles.
Then, on this locomotive, the constantly accompanying beeman with Hammer and Holzkeil had to re-launch the gun during the ride.
Damages to the motors often occurred and led to long-term accidents at the locomotive.
[5] Since by the end of the 1960s, sufficient new locomotives were available and a significant expansion of the electrical plant was not planned at the time, the railway could ignore old locomotives and most of the distributions so that E 95 was provided without service.
In addition, the German Reichsbahn wanted to occupy electrolocomotives only once again, which would have caused a problem in the train operation due to the difficulties mentioned above with the machines and the visual conditions of the driver.
[5] In the middle of 1969 the E 95 02 and E 95 03 were postponed, followed by the E 95 01, which left the service on 5 October 1970.
The proposed new name 255 001 has never been used.
Until E 95 02, all locomotives were destroyed.
The E 95 02 was replaced by the future museum locomotive E 77 10 as a heating plant on the main railway station Hall.
It took some time before the managers at the railway were convinced that the E 95 was a museum locomotive.
In 1979 the first external design of the locomotives began with the aim of presenting them to a vehicle show in the RAW Dessau.
[5] She has since belonged to the Dresden Transport Museum as a non-operable museum locomotive.
In 1986 the internal completion of the locomotives was carried out.
In the DB Museum Hall (Saale), the locomotive museum is maintained.
Since 1995 employees of the Bw Halle P community have been working on the operational development of the locomotives.
In April 2015, the locomotives were able to be presented for the first time to an exhibition in the Museum-Bw Arnstadt with new interior and exterior painting, with the transformers being checked and five motors capable of operating.
-The locomotives were in use until 1945 on the Schlesische Bergsbahn and the deviating sideways, where they proved themselves due to their reliable drive and the low maintenance effort.
In February 1945 the machines were converted into the medium-sized network after Leipzig.
Main use area was first in Schlesia
Handicraft model H0 in OVP, function well, there are optical retrievals at the hole in self-work required, stamped, with playback, kellerguch !!!, very rare handicraft model, very small design- which is possible also from the small firm ZSCHUTSCHKE and BACHMANN
The packages may contain labels and traces of storage.
Yes, the F-parts are
I got a bed from you.
However, there were problems with a part.
The middle bar is held by two feet.. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
What are we doing now?
I can't build the bed.
The middle bar is kept by two feet, they are unfortunately produced incorrectly.
The centre bar does not fit into the intended position.
So I'm getting new sent.
Then when will they be sent forth?
No flats.
These are, according to the assembly instructions, the right of form, they were just too narrow
But that's okay.
Main thing they fulfill their purpose
They're not flat with me.
Could I get this sent?
Hello #NAME#, shall I explain the problem to you again?
Household fire with two minor injuries and high damage
Two people were easily injured in a fire in a home in Oberbayern.
In addition, there has been a estimated damage in the six-stage euro area, as the police reported on Sunday.
The fire had probably spread from a carport to the adjacent residence in Kinsau (Landkreis Landsberg am Lech).
Two residents were sent to the hospital on Sunday with light smoke poisoning.
The exact fire was not known at first, but the police didn't go out of an intentional fire.
The Kripo Prürstenfeldbruck has taken over the further investigations.
But then it comes much later.
And I have to pay the shipping costs again.
To unlock fake-news - Bientech-CEO released Impf-Photo
Uğur Şahin published a photo of his first vaccination on the social network "LinkedIn" in early 2021
Bientech-Chief Uğur Şahin had not so far publicly declared his status of vaccination.
Now the company published a photo showing its corona impression.
The illness of a friend moved him, Shahin shared with him.
The CEO and co-founder of Biandech, Uğur Şahin, has published a photo showing how he receives a vaccine against the coronavirus.
In the social media, there was false information that I was probably not vaccinated.
In fact, my wife and I received 3 doses of the biotech pfizer vaccine," Şahin wrote on Friday in a contribution in the network "LinkedIn".
"For a few months, friends have forced me to post a photo of me on which I will be vaccinated to counter these false rumors."
He has so far rejected this because the communication should not turn itself around.
But a call last week changed his opinion: "I was deeply disturbed when I learned that an old school friend of mine was currently fighting for his life.
He has been struggling with a severe covid-19 disorder and has been hanging on a beatming device for three weeks.
The school friend and his family were not implicated, Şahin continued.
He didn't ask for the reasons.
"The most common cause, however, seems to be fear, which is often cut down by misinformation and mistrust."
Fear is only hard to deal with facts, sometimes it is better to share personal experiences.
On the Internet, an interview with the German Welle, in which Uğur Şahin says he is not vaccinated.
However, the video was produced in December 2020, as well as the Deutsche Welle himself explained.
"I am legally not allowed to receive the vaccine itself at this time," said Şahin at the time.
There is a priority in Germany for vaccination.
In the meantime, the priority has been lifted for a long time - and the Bientech Chief has, according to the appropriate information, allowed himself to be improvised three times.
Fire in Voltage: Ten thousand people without electricity
In several municipalities in Nordrhein-Westfalen the light went out on Friday evening: no more electricity, and in many cases it would also not be heating.
A fire had lit a revolving station.
After a fire with severe damage in a revolving station, tens of thousands of people in the Rhine-Vieg crisis in North Rhine-Westphalia have to leave for about 24 hours without electricity.
By the fire on Friday night, 41,000 affected residents and residents in several municipalities had shed their light.
The supplier Westnetz reported that on Saturday many emergency power units were in operation until the major disturbance was finally completely resolved in the late evening.
Firefighters and assistants of the THW provided support in the municipalities.
The authorities offered services in schools and called for neighbourhood assistance.
The provider thanked the people concerned for their patience and the helpers for their use.
We are very aware that the last 24 hours have brought significant restrictions.
We also thank ourselves for the affected municipalities, the circle, the firearms and the THW for the tireless use," said the head of primary technology, Florian Witt, in a statement on Saturday evening.
The repair of the damage will take a few more days, as the Westnetz monteures could only temporarily resume operations, he explained.
A technical defect led to the fire according to company data.
Power flows again
On Friday at 19.15 a.m., the fire broke down, according to Westnetz, in the Neunkirchen-Seelscheid station, part of the 10,000-volt-scaling plant was seriously damaged.
There is an urgent need for cleaning and repair work.
In parallel, a connection to a 30,000 volt voltage level has been created.
With the help of this bypass, the power supply is back.
Since Saturday at 6 p.m., more than 21,000 people in Much and Ruppichteroth have had electricity again.
Another 20,000 inhabitants of Neunkirchen-Seielscheid were gradually switched on from 21.30 a.m. to 21.30 a.m.
Since 23.15 a.m., the last electricity has been affected by the failure.
Over 80 sets of Westnetz and partner companies have been in use.
After the construction of a emergency power supply for important buildings on Saturday morning, the authorities also called for neighbourhood assistance.
"It is important now that citizens and citizens take care of older or self-employed people in their neighbourhood and report to local firearms if help is needed," said Landrat Sebastian Schuster (CDU) after a crisis meeting.
In the construction and operation of emergency power generators, the inhabitants of Altenheimen focused on the issue.
In addition, temporary care facilities have been established in schools according to the authorities for those people who were unable to provide themselves or the power-dependent medical devices have been referred to medical care.
Good day!
Unfortunately, the roof is sold out in Germany.
Can I buy those with you and pay in euro?
It's the day cover #PRS_ORG# in blue.
I hope you also have a nice day and keep you healthy.
But I can't put this on the table.
It's custom #NAME#.
There are 3 interpretations of this.
We wanted those with table plates diameter of #NUMBER#
We got 155cm diameter.
Today my #PRS_ORG# came in, but I can't move it in and so cut it short.
Can you help me out there?
Otherwise, I had to send them back, because otherwise it is not suitable for the purpose.
I'd be happy to report back.
Yes, that's really easier!
Then we'll do it!
Can you send me the back sign by mail?
the repair is now complete.
I've already tried this before the chat.
Before the purchase, however, I did not restart the E-#PRS_ORG#.
Do you want me to do this now?
I find such a low courtesy almost unforgivable.
That is why we do not agree.
Nordic combination: Combined Ribs Wins
The German Nordic combined Fabian Rießle and Julian Schmidt are printed at the World Cup in the Estonian Otepää.
The duo had to be beaten again to the prominent Norwegian Jarl Magnus Riiber, who had already started with a great lead after the ski jump into the loop.
Return of order #NUMBER#
When will the money be transferred back to my account?
Yes, we've made both of us again and used the version 4.5...
It could be that they've already heard more of problems.
Having directly with my #PRS_ORG#, a book bought it also seems to be on.
As soon as I want to open the message, ups!
This document could not be opened.
File may be incorrectly logged in with the customer service.
As far as I can tell, it's a #PRS_ORG# epub file.
Can they help me?
Chat connection is gone and now?
I have to work in the meantime!
In order to ensure uniformity and purity, you should clean the components with some soap water of dust, fat and fingerprints, clean and dry with clear water.
Before you bring the brush the first time with a new color on the model, it is recommended to practice 2 to 3 strokes.
You can do this on the later no longer visible inside the components or on a Joghurtbecher.
The first stroke on the piece
Draw the brush evenly next to the stroke.
Light overlapsing the colors later ensures a uniform area.
Avoid quickly and with the brush.
This creates unrealisticly effective areas.
A model is not a garden boy.
Start with the bright colors.
The darkness might appear later.
Metal tones and metal liquefied colours come to a complete end with a separate brush.
Otherwise, it can come to unpleasant metal slicks when mixed with normal colors.
Let the painted parts dry for a day before you blow them.
Originally trusted appearances reach the models through the decals or extractors.
From high-level signs on aircraft, through names of ships and signposts in car models: The decals give the model the last slip.
Bring the decals in the right order, as long as the components are still good to reach.
A plane cockpit can be either easier to hang before it is built into the ramp.
Even more important than the right tool, such as sheer shears, pinsettes and toothpicks, are at the right time, patience and a quiet hand.
Cut out each required Decal individually and set you right.
Decals are also called waterships because you will soon touch their back with water until the wearer paper gets dark by the nose.
Then move the picture just a small piece of paper and place the piece on the corresponding item on the model (which you have also mentioned earlier).
While holding the decal on the model with a tool, you remove the carrier paper from the side.
Attention: always check whether the picture is right before you move it completely out of paper, so it doesn't stick, knock or even climb.
Cut off excess water with a household sink.
Not suitable for children under 3 years of age
I can only open a book as soon as I look for something else then I don't read the book anymore and I have to sign up and sign up and reload the book and look for the place I've read to.
I've already been communicating with you on Saturday.
Can I get this by email?
Also for all 3 packages?
Because the lamp came to me in 3 individual packages.
Even so, thank you so much!
Then I'll buy somewhere else as soon as the money's back.
But do I get that back without problems?
Childcare at PKV / What is a "insurance case"?
Hello together,
We were in childhood treatment, now that it is about accounting with the PKV, this is all of a sudden.
Order by:
We had applied for the childish walk in front of the PKV and got the promise over 3 attempts.
The tests were limited in no way (e.g. time frame, success, etc.).
The first attempt led directly to successful pregnancy and birth and was calculated with the PCV.
Some time later, we tried to get a second child, and 2 (unsuccessful) attempts were made, but they still did not count on the PCV.
We applied again for the cost of the PCV and received three further attempts again.
After some further trials (we have performed more trials than we have promised, logically counting the most expensive with the PCV) we will correct the calculations at the PCV and get the evil surprise: instead of 5 trials (2+3) the PCV will only replace 3 trials.
The reason: With pregnancy/birth the remaining 2 attempts of the first promise are lost.
The second child wish was a new insurance case.
However, according to the AGB, "the insurance case begins with health treatment, it ends if the need for treatment no longer exists."
The questions to the experts in the round here:
* Who has the right here to replace the PCV (only 3 attempts are made) or we (it is 5 attempts to be made)?
* Did the PKV have to point out in the promises that with one birth the further attempts will fail?
* Is the desire for a second child really a new insurance case?
The infertility (subjected to closed ladders) is not healed by the first child.
It would be great if the experts would give your opinion here.
Thank you so much for your help!
Please let me get the three variants by email and tell me how to get them back to the best
All right.
We won't order any more with them.
If they add to the sales of me and my friend #NAME# (same address), they have obviously lost a good customer.
They'd like to pass this on to their manager.
This is not competitive.
Yesterday, the colleague told me that the refund was made and now tell me that I just had to send the thing back.
I don't think I can do anything to make the comedy completely ruined.
Please see in the screenshot what the colleague wrote.
There is clear and clear that the repayment has been made and I still have not received any repayments by #PRS_ORG#
You can tell your manager that they've lost two family customers now.
My friend also ordered various furniture for our apartment over his account.
We're not gonna do that anymore.
No, the defect occurred only after a few months.
An office chair must maintain normal use.
Otherwise they may not sell it as an office building.
Regardless, the guarantee shall be valid for 24 months.
No, I can't get another type of packaging.
I'm going to cut down the cabinet and make it available to the transport company.
Good day, I have a question about your series of #PRS_ORG#
These products will be purchased with additional hookers to purchase, but unfortunately we can't find them with you.
Can they help?
Topic of the week: Best Low Budget Films
What a low-budget film is, for that, there is no general definition with exact budgetary limits.
The Wikipedia has the following to say:
>A **low-budget film** or **low-budget mobile** is a motion picture shot with little to no finding from a major film studio or private investor.
In the network you can find plenty of lists of low-budget movies, such as on Letterboxd.com.
Do you know the interesting representatives of this category?
What's wrong with you?
And what do you think you might not like?
In a very good customer of you, 2 apartments have already been fully furnished with your furniture.
He wanted to ask the best price for the grey leathersofa Odelle.
The delivery time has now been extended, is it also reliable now?
Thank you very much
With friendly greetings
If there's no phone number, a chat where you have to wait 30min, it's not a chat!
Unfortunately, nothing changes to the waiting position...I'll be back up soon, because it just doesn't work here.
Hello
"Halber victory" against Belarus associated with high costs for the EU
In the conflict with the Belarusian regime, the EU can announce a "half victory" according to political expert Raphael Bossong.
However, the costs were very high and meant massive violations of the rights of migrants and refugees in Belarus" border with Poland and Lithuania, Bossong said to the Evangelical Press Service (epd).
Sustainablely, the EU has not solved the confrontation, the researchers of the Berlin Foundation for Science and Policy (SWP) explained.
This state of swimming - Belarus does not contribute very little, but the EU feels like a winner - it probably goes on for a while.
The treatment of people at the border was not in line with the European Convention on Human Rights, Bossong decided.
Clearly, there is an "increasing normalisation of pushbacks" by individual EU governments.
Since the EU as a whole has not decided on this, this is at the cost of fundamental rights.
At the same time, this development weakens the cohesion of the Union.
"It obviously cannot be carried out if a Member State is in the head to do its thing", like current Poland, which does not even allow Frontex to access the border.
In addition, the EU has paid another price for its policy at the border with Belarus, as Bossong: a basic agreement on asylum policy will be hampered as the line "Green Protection, Border Protection, Border Protection" has been strengthened.
Resumption of cross-border attempts
According to Poland's border guard, therefore, migrants have again tried to reach the Polish territory via Belarus.
55 migrants were arrested on Sunday night and brought back to the border, a speaker of the Authority said on Sunday.
In the case of Czeremsza, the Polish officials were stoned to death by the migrants.
According to the information, a soldier was struck in the face and had to be provided by a medical doctor.
A total of 52 border guards tried to cross the border within 24 hours.
Already on Friday evening, a group of 28 migrants had overcome the barriers.
Thousands of people from countries such as Iraq and Afghanistan have crossed or tried to cross the border between Belarus and the EU in recent months.
The EU, Alexander Lukaschenko, as the holder of power in Minsk, proposes to have them angels with a view to joining the EU.
Polish and Lithuanian press reports according to border sections.
The EU sanctions Belarus and threatened airlines bringing migrants and refugees into the country.
In addition, EU commissioners travel in the people's countries of origin to stop departures there.
The most effective element of the EU's response is the pressure on the refugees," Bossong said.
"As a result, the EU has put its market power in the scales and demonstrated its determination to operate with hard tapes and extraterritorial sanctions."
Minsk must also take account of domestic costs.
The Belarusian society may not be aware that the security system regularly shuts down thousands of people throughout the country.
Mercedes protests after controversial formula 1 finale
Max Disappearen is expected to have gone through two rule breaks during the race, in the view of Mercedes.
Abu Dhabi - After the controversial formula 1 final of Abu Dhabi, Mercedes filed an objection.
The silver arrows are the same as two rule breaks in the last Grand Prix of the year.
A protest refers to a alleged violation of Max’s escapes in the Red Bull in the last safety car phase when he should have been regularly caught.
A second opposition was filed against the valuation at the end of the race.
In Mercedes' view, the protocol was not followed on a regular basis.
On the last round, Lewis Hamilton was still in the Mercedes and was finished at his first Formula 1 title.
The Manover took place shortly after the end of a safety car phase, in which the Netherlands had taken over the car driving before him.
I'll check it out.
I'm talking to the bank and report to you again.
Thank you for the support
Free entry for members: Europe-Park organised SC-Freiburg-Fantag
The Europa-Park, the nominee for the Europa-Park Stadium of the Freiburg Sports Club, has invited the SC Freiburg Fantag.
As reported by the park, members and permanent card holders of the sports club from Breisgau and members of the Fan community were allowed to visit the European Park free of charge on this day.
In addition, there were also vouchers for drinks and herbs.
On that day, the rear trains lighted through the trikots red and white.
Füchsle, Ed Euromaus and many red-white balloons provided the perfect bullets," said the park.
Since the beginning of the 1990s, there has been cooperation between the federalist and the Rust, 40 kilometres north of Freiburg, a leisure park.
On the first SC Freiburg Fantag in the European Park, it has again shown how well the partnership fits.
Seeing brilliant fans who have fun together in the rear, confirm this," says European Park Owner Jürgen Mack.
Why is the €#NUMBER# and not like originally €1699 ?
Steps in the career of the new world champion Hide
The Netherlands Max Steppen is the new world champion of Formula 1.
Max's been able to escape.
The Netherlands holds its first WM title in Red Bull in its seventh year in Formula 1.
His way to the summit of the royal class:
Abu Dhabi - 2012, Italy: Disappearing plays the Kart World Championship after a crash in Sarno.
Father Jos escapes let him stand angry at a gas station on his return trip.
His mother, Sophie Kuppen, collects the teen in the rear-run car.
2014, England: The Junior Team of Red Bull gets in evaporative growth.
The 16-year-old thus enters the steps of Sebastian Vettel and Daniel Ricciardo.
It will then proceed first in the European Formula 3.
2015, Australia: Disappearances begin at the age of 17 and 166 days as the latest driver of history at a Grand Prix.
Because of a defect, he has to suspend his Toro Rosso in Melbourne in advance.

At the age of 21, he leaves Valteri Bottas and his Mercedes teammate Lewis Hamilton behind.
2021, Abu Dhabi: The summit is reached.
Disappearing celebrates its first WM title at Formula 1 finale in Abu Dhabi with an overholmanover against Hamilton in the closing round. dpa
At the time, I had a huge problem with you when I ordered the #PRS_ORG# code.
Judith Hermann read from her novel "Daheim"
As part of the series "LiteraTour Nord" by author Judith Hermann on Friday on the sold Blue Note from her current novel "Daheim" and also worked as a moderator.
She's gone, lives in a house on the coast and listens sensitively to the night noise at her house door.
I gave up the contact form yesterday to return an article, but did not receive email confirmation or similar.
My question would be whether my request was answered.
It doesn't everyone have the time for your elaborate chat and wrongly delivered cheapware from China.
Your mistake, which you correct and not everyone from our budget.
Contact Frau #NAME#.
I can't chat with them every day.
We had chatted yesterday and agreed that I or Mrs. #NAME# received an e-mail with a 60 Euro voucher, a new order of the #PRS_ORG# nighttable and a return note.
This e-mail hasn't come yet.
The package still wants to bring to #PRS_ORG# today.
Please contact me
With friendly greetings
The LokSound 5 decoder can play up to 10 channels at the same time.
Each channel can be dissolved with up to 16 bits / 31250 kHz and finally offers HiFi quality on your system.
It is virtually no difference to the original.
A class-D audio end-level with up to 3W output performance controls the speakers who may have an impedance between 4 Ohm and 32 Ohm.
The huge 128 Mbit sound storage ensures sufficient capacity.
All individual noises can be adjusted individually in volume.
The super-flexible sound engine without a rigid running plan allows for the precise simulation of all detectable rail vehicles.
Three separately adjustable brake functions and two alternative load scenarios give you the maximum control over your vehicles.
But I'm sorry just because he says he's not an anti-Semitic doesn't mean anything.
It's as if a blacksmith says he has nothing against foreigners.
Your i won't give it to both of you.
But colleagues constantly reproduce any anti-Semitic messages.
If you want to distance yourself, you should just let it complete.
Yeah, well, then you're just a little bit as serious as your colleague.
Those who seriously question Evolution in principle are simply completely solved.
For my sake, a God has put all this into effect.
But as soon as you're a creative, you have to believe that the earth is 10,000 years old and that science is only insanity.
And so you are an enemy of science and not to take any more seriously as a colleague.
In order to maintain an optimal field of vision, the lupe should be approached as close to the eye as possible.
The specially aplanatic acromically designed lens system allows you to use the lupe to the edge zone in a practical way.
Lupins are often marked with magnification data.
However, these data only apply to precisely defined conditions which rarely meet the conditions of use.
In order to make optimal use of your loop, please note the instructions in the table "Technical data" (see instructions for use in the package).
On the lens surfaces of all optical devices - i.e. also in impact lamps - there are light flexes.
These mirrors are significantly reduced by an anti-reflex coating.
In compliance with the optimal conditions of use - Lupe close to the eye - mirrors on the lens surfaces are less visible.
For further information, see the accompanying instructions (in German and English).

#PRS_ORG# I'll do a very nice and good service, it's been a while before you came to a person, you were great

I've already reported to you under customer contact with #PHONENUMBER# number.
Yeah, but it was before.
You can't deliver from England because of #PRS_ORG#.
Dental sales in Schönwolde: Women in the municipality of Krembz look out for Christmas trees
Farmer Frank Diets has already experienced so many strange situations when selling teeth.
One time a man should even go back home without his partner, because they could not agree.
Every year, he plants good 2000 pieces.
The 56-year-old has already experienced so many situations.
That makes Christmastime always fun, he says.
What about the credit card?
Or am I gone as a customer?!
However, I received a defective delivery and now paid the full price for it.
Then I'll evaluate it accordingly!
We do not need discussions here about the better court, but there is a certain similarity between the two.
Both consist of meat that is grilled at a rotating spirit.
So they both have their names.
In German, an equivalent might be as much as the "dreher", which in far away doesn't sound as nice.
Problems with glass fiber + Devolo DLan/Magic
We've had a new glass fiber connection in the house for a few weeks.
Unfortunately, I now have problems building a stable Wifi network.
Previously, I had a DSL 50 Mbit connection and used Devolo DLan, which has received and sent up to a few randoms without delay 50 Mbit.
The new glass fibre connector sends 500 mbit to the FritzBox 7590 and the DLan module, which is connected to the FritzBox, also comes in.
However, the other DLan module that sends the Wifi is no longer the full 500, but the further I remove with the module from the house, the less it comes (so use a stick dose that is 1, 2, 3, etc. rooms away from the other module).
This means that the Internet with the new glass fiber connection is now even slower on the first floor than before (\~45 Mbit).
I also ordered a new Devolo Magic set, which apparently used a new technology.
This was slightly better than the DLan, but there were similar losses.
Could anyone explain to me why with glass fibers so much Internet speed on the power line is "lost"?
And is LAN really the only solution?
It would be extremely urgent to lay down in the house LAN cable.
I'm really disappointed, so I've created an extra account here.
That's why I'd be so happy about an answer.
When it's time to change the giro account
Anyone who had thought, now would be quiet for the first time in the giro accounts, seems to be disappointed.
While many banks have used the autumn to confirm with all kinds of tricks their customers the fees of the past, the free interest rates for negative interest continue to decline.
For example, the Deutsche Bank was considered relatively generous with a limit of EUR 100,000 for a long time.
Now she's just half the amount of free money and she's even surrounded for day money.
In a first step, the limit was reduced only to customers of the Group's Postbank - to 50,000 euros in giro and investment accounts and to 25 .000 euros in day-to-day money accounts.
In the meantime, however, these lower amounts apply to the entire Deutsche Bank, as confirmed by a speaker on request.
And not only for new contracts, but also for "new individual agreements with existing customers".
The commercial bank had already gone down to a limit of 50,000 euros, which is still valid, as was the case with ING Germany.
The direct bank of DKB, who was directly popular with the most expensive customers, has reduced the free money in two stages, first to 50,000 euros, and now to 25,000 euros.
At the same time, more than 100 banks now have an amount free of 25,000 euros or less after the numbers of the Verivox Internet portal.
The Sparda Bank Berlin has also arrived at EUR 25,000: however, there is still a legal dispute with the consumer centres that have been first received in front of the Berlin Landgericht even against this regime.
It is now discussed in the banks whether the institutions should be able to make any adjustments - in the case that the higher authorities also declare negative interest on the principle of non-permissible and that many millions have to be repaid to bank customers.
The tableboard was delivered for 8 people instead of that for 6 people.
That's the one for 6 people.
Jennifer Aniston employs a whole beauty army
She's now officially at the top of Hollywood.
But your life is like a mountain and valley ride.
Jennifer Aniston (52) was selected by the US magazine "The Hollywood Reporter" as the most influential woman of the year.
For those who made 2021 with the "friends" reunion and the continuation of their series "The Morning Show", this success is primarily the result of much discipline and work.
A whole army of assistants, stylists and trainers is taking care of their appearance.
Anyway, so Aniston, she enjoyed a chip on the day (yes, read correctly: an EINZIEN chip from the Tute).
The fact that you have the hearts of the female and male fans is actually a miracle.
Maybe because she's just got Pech with luck - and she's still looking for the big love.
And the baby wish has been removed from the list.
Before, she was constantly asked when she was becoming a mother.
That hurt her.
The people who asked this, they have no idea what's going on with me personally, medically, why I can't.
It really hurt.
It remains to be hoped that success and fame will also be happy.
Invalid end of career: Queens must give up
Kimi Räikkonen's divorce from Formula 1 was even quieter than thought.
Abu Dhabi - The 42-year-old Finn pulled out the gloves and took off the sweat from the star.
That's it.
After a driver's error and a slight banding, Räikkonen had to postpone his Alpha Romeo at the great price of Abu Dhabi after not even half the race distance.
It was his 349th and last Grand Prix, the "Iceman" ends his career in the Motorsport royal class.
On the other hand, his wife Minttu and the two children were also traveling to the United Arab Emirates.
Räikkönen's greatest success was the win of the 2007 World Championship in Ferrari.
He made 21 Grand Prix wins, started 18 times from the pole and arrived 103 times at the podium. dpa
Friedrich holds 60th World Cup win - Nolte wins in Zweijerbob - Sport
The brand of the Norwegian Biathlet Ole Einar Björdalen with 94 success is the goal of the Bobpilot.
"I've figured it out once, I had to win nine-and-a-half a season, then I could make it up to Cortina 2026," said the double Olympic winner from BSC Oberbärenburg, who booked two successes in the Winterberg race in two days.
Only on Saturday did he refuse to attack Johannes Lochner by five hundredths, in which he ran from Rank three to one.
Then he changed something at the material setting and went out on Sunday with 0,30 seconds a greater lead.
With his team Thorsten Margis (SV Hall), Candy Bauer (BSC Oberbärenburg) and Alexander Schüller (SV Hall), he went through the British Brad Hall.
The third became the Austrian Benjamin Maier.
"We have gone at greater risk today and have been rewarded," said Friedrich, who also introduced his 22nd victory in series.
The Berchtesgaden Johannes Lochner, who was driving for Stuttgart, came to the square two times this time on rank five.
Christoph Hafer from BC Bad Föhrnbach landed four in the first race in place.
"If I knew what he was doing differently, I would do it," Lochner said.
Nolte with home victory - podium for Jamanka
Among the women, Laura Nolte took the third season in the pool.
After the previous day in Monobot only for the fourth place, on Sunday, she went to the World Cup victory with Deborah Levi in the German triple success.
Mariama Jamanka from the BRC Thuringen came with Germany's fastest sprinterin, Alexandra Burghardt from Burghausen, to rank two.
In addition to her Olympia qualification, she booked the first podium in this winter.
The Wiesbadener Kim Kalicki landed with Leonie Fiebig on site three.
For me, it was supercool, the first post office in the World Cup, I'm superhappy that Mariama takes me.
I'm super pleased with the development.
There is still a lot of potential at the beginning, but today's starting times were okay," Burghardt said and stressed: "It's not just driving, but there's a lot to do through it."
Jamanka was a little upset about the not completely wrong driving, but he said, "It's going in the right direction."
I already had the lid in the shopping cart and could now buy it!!!!
What am I supposed to do?
I did not receive it, and therefore I cannot redeem it, which is why I have finally asked for it.
Because of Corona last year, I had a whole lot of other problems and never time for it.
And now he's been running out of things that make me very angry.
Look at the chat it went around the Asare Sitzbank.
I would like to give it back and then order it again, as it is just reduced :)
Why is the shipment started on 16.3.?
There was nothing of such a long delivery time on your website
No, not until I'm on tip comes an extra field with the message
I was taken from your colleague yesterday.
Why is this a problem today?
I've also sent you pictures of the wrong delivery.
But we want the regal module, however, to be a new one.
And don't cancel the whole order.
Just this day, just this week, just until XY...
Hello, lovely girls and girls and women,
I've got some things I just want to write, and maybe it's one of them or others like that.
I am 24, have kPTBS, full-time student and dogema - sometimes apart from that my dog doesn't scream or goes to the children's gardens, he's actually 1 to 1 my child.
My friend (since 6J together) has been sick, a 2nd degree burn has been taken on Monday and has been depressed for years (but is now in therapy).
Yesterday I visited him because I also have emotional needs and because I want to see him and feel, we had a lot of boiled and it was nice.
I helped him to shower (because hand is in the combination wg burning).
It is cooled down and we see at present less (1-2x week) what makes me very sensitive and loving with my needs.
My dog's dope has just got buchweh, I've cooked for him, and now he's in his cupboard, and he's a little relaxed after I've been there with the heatlight and shaking for him.
I live alone with my sister and my mother, and that's just for a month.
Now we are still doing housework, which we are, of course, dividing.
But cooking yourself is just a lot of work for me...
My PTBS disease is just very well adjusted, I'm half-treated well and I'm right.
Not good, but I'm getting right and I'm almost out of symptoms.
My uni just requires a lot (for me), tomorrow at 3:00 a.m., I have made a written test for which I have not done anything and overtime anatomy hours for which I should at least prepare something.
And next week I have a oral exam on Tuesday, and what comes next is in my calendar and not in my head because there is no room.
So my week goes like this: until tomorrow, then is the weekend.
But then all of this goes on?
Only until the day of birth.
Just until the start of the vacation.
Just until the weekend.
Just until...
And so it goes on forever.
I think I'm just so upset that I need these spiritual points because otherwise I'm packing it down.
Somehow I feel guilty and "chaotic", but otherwise I can't...
Is that how you feel?
Honestly, I'm infinitely grateful that I don't have to work.
I can't say that. I can't say that.
Don't know if I'd survived my kptbs.
I believe that this also has some to do with the mental load of women, and that's why I thought I'd find a safe sense of suffering here...
I wish you at least another relaxing evening, the week is almost made!
I have received my order today, unfortunately the whole other color plus surface is scratched and table bone has print.
On the first delivery, the color was exactly the same as on the website.
We are very disappointed!!!!
What can you offer me?
If we change the table now, will I get another color or how?
The email for cancellation was sent on 26.12.#NUMBER#.
The other two times.
But she wasn't confirmed.
Once a completely different thing: I then found in school that many religious teachers do not believe in God and it is just another matter for them, such as math or earthly science.
For me, it was always something strange, perhaps because I was raised Christian and I always believed in it.
How are you doing?
Perhaps you can also talk about work and study colleagues with different attitudes.
In principle, I understand the difference between private and professional and it is sensible to separate.
Also give the curriculum etc.
But it was also strange to have a physical teacher who did not believe in the theory of relativity.
What, then, makes one want to teach religion if you don't believe it?
Is culture real or something?
Hope your question isn't too private.
Can't be changed or not?Write it in English I understand it also well
It's been a long time, then I'd look away from it.
It's good, thank you.
I expect a return notification from time to time until the beginning of next week.
Thank you for your support #NAME#.

Hello, dear people,
I'm looking for a film from my childhood (by 24).
I think it's been a movie for young people.
In the film there are two time axes (or parallel worlds).
To one the modern (real world).
On the other hand, the past (or the kingdom of the dead) (not quite sure).
Because I can't describe it any more in the real world, there's a young woman.
And in the kingdom of the dead a young soldier (Uniform like those of the soldiers of the Caribbean).
For some reason, the paths are crossed and there is an action.
The antagonist is also a soldier from the kingdom of the dead who wants to bring the woman into this realm in order to live himself I mean.
The transition is, I think, also the soldier's graveyard.
In the end, both soldiers are fighting each other.
If that's what I'm saying, I'm grateful for every answer.
Our little one slept on the belly only from Week 1.
Fast forward: still alive :D
Relax.
Such a child is much more dependent than you think.
Make sure everything is right around there, no cubs, often run around and watch, but no minutes of monitoring.
That makes you crazy!
Fresh air in the room.
Good mattresses.
No kisses.
Axo and we didn't have a sleeping bag, but we've always had a blanket.
Watch your child when he's asleep.
Does it turn your head to the side?
Can it get out of the belly?
Or is it in front of the face directly in the mattress?
You can talk about it if you're okay.
We have all grown up, and when my husband has come to the world, it was for example a walk and it seemed that you put the baby on the belly to sleep.
Besides, we're already with you and we've already bought a lot of articles
But why are you offering me only 20EUR?
Hello, I already wrote with a colleague from you yesterday and so far no feedback.
It's about my wardrobe, which came before us (order number: #ALPHANUMERIC ID#).
The right shoulder doesn't fit in the closet.
Please contact me as soon as possible.
The cabinet is currently not to be used.
To make it quite clear.
RBTV has promised a lot.
And yes, I know, not everything can be kept.
And I also had a lot of fun with RBTV.
It's just that the politics of this sender is now under all the Sausa.
Almost every format is sponsored (ok), but then go on a large bed tour at the same time.
It was said to be an "independent" Internet transmitter.
Citat Arno: You want to be "no running sheet".
What are you doing now?
A 0815 advertiser who is trying to bring his BilloMerch to the elite fan.
And then we still have Marah's Do's & Don'ts.
Of course they apply to everyone, except Simon and Etienne.
Of course, they can continue to influence people.
A krogman who completely lacks empathy and tries to make ash at the cost of the action with the exploded rooms.
How can you find all this good?
Great if you like it, I think it's scary.
I'm asking for backup, since my delivered wood table was made defective.

Whether as a comforter at Buchweh or just for cooking – My little warm friend is versatile.
Kirschkern cushions are a traditional home material for healthy heat applications, as Kirschkerne heat can be very well absorbed and dosed again.
The removable inner pockets can easily be heated in the microwave or in the oven.
The soft reference makes the application particularly pleasant to make the little ones feel secure, even if they are not doing so well.
For the following applications only, the chirschkern box with reference is suitable as a heat supply:
Before heating the pillow on unusual smell, check the floor or fire spot and immediately dispose of it in the presence.
Please remove the inside pockets for heating before the reference!
Warm up in the microwave at a maximum of 300 watts for a maximum of 2 minutes (note the microwave manufacturer's details!)
Directly after heating, distribute the heat through shields evenly in the pocket!
Then put the inside case back in the case.
In the first heatings, there may be a slight moisture formation on the surface, but it disappears in repeated applications.
Keep in mind the heating instructions given, as longer times or higher energy performance can cause damage (flaming and burning risk!).
Before heating the pillow in the microwave, check that it is allowed to heat grain products in the manufacturer's instructions.
After the heated inner pockets have been put back into contact, please check the temperature of the pillow for fit for babies (max. 43 °C) on your wrist!
Do not use the pillow in acute and chronic, inflammatory or febrile diseases, cycle complaints, fresh haematomas, blood clots and open sores as well as in people with reduced pain.
For existing skin, heart, veins, diabetes or tumours, and pregnancy, please refer to a doctor before use.
If nails have been opened and loose cores emerge, dispose of the product and the loose core immediately and inaccessible to children.
If the product is used in babies under 1 year of age, the child’s temperature should be regularly controlled during the application to avoid overheating!
All serious incidents involving the product shall be reported to the manufacturer and the competent authority of the country in which the user is placed.
The reference is removable and washable in the machine at 30 °C.
Please note the care symbols on the product!
Darmstadt after Henserie Second - Pauli wins in Düsseldorf
Darmstadt 98 can dream from the return to the football-Bundesliga.
This is why Hannover 96 is working from the table cellar.
For Ingolstadt it is also not running under the third coach.

Is the battery broken?
Yesterday evening my laptop (thinkPad E480 20KQ and about 3 years old) was no longer loaded by my network part.
I bought this again about 5 months ago, so it should still work.
I thought the net part alone was enough for the operation.
The battery is empty and the laptop does not start any more despite the embedded network part.
After that, I've grown the battery, but there's nothing here either.
Do you want any ideas?
A new battery is ordered, but why can't I use the laptop in the network operation?
Was there any other part of it?
Thank you so much for your help!
I want the delivery of the #PRS_ORG# to the room.
How can I book this?
I'm interested in the #PRS_ORG# chair.
But don't know how high the seat is....
Often on a tour and yet a lot of equipment?
With the everyday V2 Backpack of Peak Design, no problem!
20 litres of capacitors also swallow larger photo equipment without problems, which can be understood safely by using the polished FlexFold components.
And what you still need in everyday life remains well organized and separate from the photo equipment thanks to practical access in the individually configurable interior.
With the "Update" of the Everyday Line on version 2 (V2), the series presents itself in a new look.
The elegant, minimalist design has it literally in itself - with the Everyday Backpack series, Peak Design has developed some highly innovative solutions that are reliable to protect the interior of the backpack and yet provide quick access to photo equipment in seconds.
This works with two options: Once conventionally via the lid that can be closed with the MagLatch locking system, an excellently designed solution for effective protection, which has already proved to be at the Messenger Bags.
In the locker there is a metal cap with suitable anchor bars on the front of the backpack.
Unlike most backpacks, Peak Design has thought of various "fills": there are 4 anchor bars, which can be stuck in the lock hooks.
If the backpack is full, you just take the top bar, it's rather empty, a deeper one.
The locks and hooks are also magnetic.
The backpack can also be locked reliably without the hooks being torn.
The second option distinguishes the everyday backpack also fundamentally from other, photo backpacks: In addition to the lid, there is a zipper opening on both sides of the backpack.
This eliminates the greatest disadvantage of conventional backpacks with access from above - you don't have to feel through the contents anymore!
At the same time, this smarter detail increases the daily routine of the backpack: if you take not only your photo equipment, but also everyday items or luggage.
In every day backpack, you can individually configure the interior (more below) and, without any problem, evaporate each other - and access it independently through the two side openings.
You can also pull the backpack from the right side in front of the body, for example, to access the camera equipment in the right main case, while the everyday things remain safe in the left half of the backpack and do not come between.
Comfortable, uncomplicated wear belts help.
And since the outer cover of the backpack is also fully made of 100 % recycled, weatherproof nylon, the content remains dry even if it is to go to Scotland in the autumn.
Unfortunately, I look forward to the email from your support.
#NAME# has me an e-mail yesterday confirming the appointment of the
Contact information has been announced since the shipment to collect the wrong table delivered.
So far, I haven't received a message.
I'm asking for immediate settlement.
I am already writing with the third support staff, with no one else but to promise that I will receive an e-mail as confirmation.
It's about sending back the wrong custom delivered #NAME#
Is it to be seen when the cabinet could be delivered again?
Keeping him like that is no option for me...
It's working.
Many thanks for the help
Wish you another nice evening
Hello, my order is #NUMBER#. When will the article be delivered?
Order and payment were made on 12.1.2.1.
I was delivered a completely different lamp than I ordered
Please call me.
If you give me the credit card, I'll give up a bigger order immediately, but I still kept the damaged furniture and didn't send it back.
And that last year was different than thought I couldn't deny and I just couldn't fix it up and clear it up.
But I don't accept the damage as a customer.
Rotinger brake discs are designed to assess the demands of the dynamic driver, the reliability and safety of braking also under difficult conditions.
Rotinger brake discs are made from rubber and then mechanically worked (dried and cut).
All removed discs are produced in short series according to individual technical characteristics, which are peculiar to certain discs and patterns.
On the basis of the individual technical drawing, a special manufacturing program is created, which is aimed at expanding the disc according to the characteristics of the original assembly.
High comfort and braking efficiency are ensured by the devices that are designed in this way.
Additionally created openings increase the efficiency of the cooling of the disc, with the sections improving the cleaning of brake discs and brake locks.
The aesthetic properties of our discovered discs emphasize the character of each car by its attractive and striking appearance.
Coloma is the city where an unexpected event marked the history of the West Coast.
In the winter of 1848, a man discovered glowing fractures in the water at the southern bay of the American River.
Although he tried to keep his discovery secret, the news quickly spread and dissolved the so-called "California Gold Rush" of ‘49.
Thousands came from Nah and far and made Coloma one of the fast-growing and flourishing cities of the country.
Areas were hidden, tents were erected, and saloons and hotels were created almost overnight.
Everyone wanted their share in the wealth of the country.
For many it was called "Coloma or Bust" (Coloma or Bankruptt).
In this game you are a pioneer who is looking for a name in the West and wants to make a name.
You will search for gold, recruit workers, collect horses and build companies.
You will also be given the opportunity to explore the surrounding rivers and adjacent areas.
You're not alone - the other pioneers seem to have the same idea!
You have to overcome your pioneer colleagues so you don't have to go with the rest of them.
Coloma is a fast strategy game with many ways to win.
At the same time you choose your actions, you have to keep your resources at home and create a table that "works more and more for you" (so-called "Engine Building").
The buildings on your table allow you to become more efficient, to receive additional actions or to convert rules to your favor.
With these buildings and the dynamic bridges, you can develop your individual game style through fine adjustments.
Coloma plays over a period of three years from 1848 (the year when the gold was discovered in Coloma), the year 1849 (the year of California Gold Rush) to 1850 (the year in which California reached the official state).
A year in Coloma consists of five rounds.
During each round, the players will select a location on the game plan where they can perform actions.
Then their selection is discovered and they place their pioneers in the appropriate locations.
If a place has the most pioneers, it gets a lock!
This disables one-half of the location - thus reducing the possible actions there.
Then the players perform different actions, such as the acquisition of resources, the movement of cars, the construction of tents, the search of rivers, the construction of bridges, the opening of shops and the positioning of revolvers.
If all the actions are completed, the pioneers will return.
At the beginning of each round, the applicant turns to a new location and thus changes the available actions.
This goes on for as long as the attacker moves five times, so every place has been hidden once and the year ends.
There is a shooting in which players Coloma must defend against an attack of angry bandits.
If the players have done enough revolting and the bandits are oversized, they will receive rewards.
However, if they fail, they will receive fewer rewards or end up in the cemetery.
The game ends after the third shooting, then the final evaluation takes place.
The player wins with most winning points!

"Why children are not tyrants" Doku, ARD Mediahek
CW mental violence, sexual abuse, abuse of power
The ARD documentation has been published today in my Twitter-Timeline, and I have just looked at it.
>The child psychiatrist Michael Winterhoff is a well-known guest in Talkshows and holds talks across Europe.
With his book "Why Our Children Become tyrants" (2008), he launched a strong educational debate.
Former patients: In-houses and educators are now raising serious objections against him.
Please be careful, the film is hard to bear.
And I am very grateful that many people now think and act differently.
Our parents and other responsibilities may never, never, never! go to power over the child.
Our goal must always be to give the child a room for his development and to make the framework for the child as meaningful and possible in the situation.

At its next meeting, the Minister of Health of the countries intends to decide on a three-fold basis for the test obligation.
"We countries need rapid clarity, whether and from when the test obligation can occur for three-time immunists," said Klaus Holetschek (CSU), Chairman of the Health Minister's Conference, "Picture on Sunday".
The drop of 2G plus for three-fold vampires is "not only medically meaningful, but also delivers an additional impenetrable cycle," Holetschek said.
Federal Minister of Health Karl Lauterbach (SPD) said that "he will be making a proposal to the Health Conference on the next Tuesday".
So I want to send the lamp back
How do I get the best out of it?
Hello, I find the #PRS_ORG# chair very nice, but I can't see how high the seat is.
Can you help me?
I can't run any more shopping about my #PRS_ORG#.
Display: Ups, there was an error.
Buy over the #PRS_ORG# page on the computer.
I updated the account data.
Where can this lie?
What you describe as *Awareness* is called “synthesis” under full-narcotics.
These occur at a frequency of about 1 to 1000.
Most often it comes to hearing sounds/votings, more rarely to see pictures and more often to experience pain.
For this topic: Kaiser cuts are operations that deal with an increased rate of Awareness, as one avoids a very deep narcosis to protect the child until it is decommissioned.
Previous episodes of Awareness should be mentioned in the Narcotics Talk.
Certain anaesthesia procedures such as total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) are associated with a slightly increased risk.
**EDIT: Dear everyone, this comment from me describes whether Awareness is correct, however, had** u/Nitemarex **by definition none.
She was wrong to read her comment.
But the chair is defective.
Unfortunately, the 20€ will not help us either.
These are legal guarantees.
The absolute minimum would be that they would take back the defective chair.
This is also a standard for eCommerce in addition to the legal obligation.
Please check again if they take back the defective chair at least.
We sell the second chair in private.
That's where we lose some money.
I already sent you an e-mail that you haven't answered.
Again the question.
The order and the invoice says that the goods are delivered to a room of my choice.
The sender is company #NAME#.
I just called there.
I was told that they only delivered in front of the door - because of #PRS_ORG#.
Is that so?
If so, I have to cancel the order because I don't know anyone who can wear the heavy furniture on my first floor.
I'm not gonna call you?
I had formulated a question
Theatrical historian Günther Rühle 97-year-old dead
He's profiled himself as a theater critic and as an intendant.
Later he wrote a monumental drama story.
On Friday Günther Rühle died at the age of 97.
There's still the new book on the table, pressurized: "An old man is getting older."
The frightening period of a slow separation from the world, which led the theatre historian and journalist Günther Rühle until April 2021.
And in the middle of the reading, the message comes that the author is dead.
The last sentence in the book says, "I've already witnessed my life's thought."
There are different types of pallets.
One of the most common are European lettuces, named wooden pallets, which are used primarily in the European area as cargo carriers.
They are certified by the European Palatine Association EPAR
According to data from Statistics Austria in Austria, more than ten million pieces of pallets were produced.
The value of production was well worth EUR 79 million.
How many pallets are imported annually to Austria will not be raised
New York wins MLS for the first time
New York City FC won the title in Major League Soccer for the first time.
After the 1:1 in the regular playing time against host Portland Timbers, the team from the Eastern Conference decided the final in the eleven-meter shooting at 4:2.
At the end of the Eastern Conference, New York had passed through against Philadelphia Union, the team of the German Kai Wagner.
Rouladen Tips & Tricks
I had received a lot of great tips here a week ago for the perfect gulag.
It was Christmas and it was incredibly delicious and buttered!
So thank you again for :)
Now I've come to taste and I want to cook the first rouladen.
I'll set up a cattle fund tomorrow.
Do you have any other tips for me?
Note: I don't have a oven, but just a big pot.
How's it going now?
What about the books or how do I get them back on my #PRS_ORG#?
My English isn't so good anymore, but I get it.
I's about a refund of €#NUMBER#
I was already informed by mail on 18.01 that the refund was made.
But until today, the money hasn't gone to my place.
Please check there.
Where there are still Christmas breads in the room Lübeck
For many people, Gans or Ente belong to the Christmas days such as the tooth tree and the gifts.
You haven't taken care of a bird yet?
Now it's about time.
We'll tell you where you get another Christmas break in the Lübeck room.
The "drive" of a pipe level contributes significantly to the heat and fat content of the guitar booster sound.
These features are perfectly implemented by the Valve Reactor switch.
With the VOLUME, GAIN and MASTER VOLUME rule, you can set the desired level on the one hand and the level of your sound on the other.
In addition, the VT+ series amplifiers offer a unique POWER LEVEL ruler that can reduce the signal level without changing anything at the "Gain" and the distortion.
Further above it was already stated that with the POWER LEVEL rule, you can even make a performance reservation if it goes smoothly.
Thanks to POWER LEVEL rules, the entire potential of the VT+ series can be used in any situation.
The headphone can also be used as a line output.
This signal here will be edited with a box simulation so that you get an impressive "acoustic" sound impression yourself when using a headphone or direct shots.
The AUX book can be connected to a CD or MP3 player so you can match your favorite songs.
A Tuner function is also on board - so you do not need a separate voice device.
In addition to a VFS5 foot key, it can also call the sounds comfortably by foot, turn on/off the effect blocks and the tempo of the currently compatible effects "lap".
This is actually unacceptable for the live input.
With its new power packages, VOX will take another step in the future!
But you'd have seen it with others like that.
Is it possible to send the lamp back to you?
Because it's too low for a table?
So I'd like to send her back.
Can you help me with that?
What about the comet?
In the next few weeks, will we receive an update for the exact delivery deadline?
Hello, they've been sitting on the #PRS_ORG# chairs
If it wasn't for me, I'd be happy with a legacy or a chance.
Under circumstances I find a buyer for the furniture.
Just over 1,000 euros for goods that I don't need then are a little bit.
I just received my delivery and would have known if screws were intended as part of the delivery.
I would like to mount the #PRS_ORG# mirror (door) on the intended hooks.
This is not a satisfactory answer and the waiting time has not been paid

Iran sees progress in negotiations on nuclear agreements
In the negotiations on a resumption of the International Atomic Agreement, progress has been made, according to Iranian data.
"Both sides are about to agree on the issues that should be on the agenda," said Iranian Chief Dealer Ali Bagheri on Sunday of the news agency Irina.
This was a "positive and important development", because at first it did not even agree on the topics to be negotiated.
The agreement is intended to prevent Iran from building nuclear weapons.
On Thursday, Vienna’s talks on the revitalization of the agreement were continued after almost a week’s interruption.
The negotiations are attended by distributors from Iran, Germany, the United Kingdom, China, France and Russia.
A US delegation is also on-the-spot in Vienna, but only indirectly involved in the negotiations.
Thuringia Overwhelmed Saxony - Frestatat Now Germany with the highest Corona incident
Thuringen has dissolved Saxony and currently displays the highest incidence in the Federal Republic of Germany.
As the only German country, the value is above the mark of 1000.
At the Corona incident on Sunday, Thuringia was the only German country to have placed over the brand of 1000.
The Robert Koch Institute gave the 7th day value of 1025 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants.
In Saxony, which was the last ever to show the highest incidence across the country, this value was at 990.5.
On Friday and Saturday the incident in Thuringia was slightly reduced, but it also had a value of 1000.
Within a day, 2242 new strains with the Sars-CoV-2 virus and 16 more deaths were reported in Thuringia in connection with an infection.
200 severe to Covid-19 patients were treated intensively on Sunday in hospitals.
In the weekend, there may be delays in reporting.
In addition, the health authorities have been overloaded for weeks and are barely behind the record of new cases.
I get it.
As delivery takes place at the beginning of March, it may be possible to do so.
I have to print it and stick it to the package and put it at the post office, was that it?
I don't have to click/add/fill anything here?
That's exactly what I want to avoid, which is why I'm writing to you.
I would like to take back my own costs.
8 euro Return fee is a frequency in my eyes.
It is time for changes
##MBunde day greets me, I am u/stratorDE in the plenary room in the heart of Europe on a fantastic day!
# Why the post here?
If you look at the activity in the past months of the MBundaday you can find one: it is not extensible.
We came to a winter star and extended the summer hole for a few months.
#What's the problem?
Yeah, where did it come from?
For the most part, this should simply be linked to the dissatisfaction, how some things have gone down here and how we are in general.
In the last few days, the impression has increased that many here have still bock on the MBundesday.
#What we need to change
In this place the community is asked around the MBundes day which wants to keep them alive.
The attack came from u/edizVEVO, who has been paying attention to this project in the last days and has found one, simply said, screw caps.
After some writing and writing, several people from the community have found themselves looking forward to rebuilding the project.
However, I would like to call on everyone to participate once again, only if this project can exist in the future.
We have created a discussion platform in the form of a dispute server on which we can exchange and develop concrete things.
You can access the server via this link.
Destination:
* How will the MBundesday work in the future?
* Which existing arrangements must be modified / adjusted / removed?
* How are we going to go abroad in the future?
* How should new members be appointed?
* How do we create a fair electoral system?
I'm pretty sure I've forgotten a few things, but what's not bad, we've got the disagreement at the end.
If you have a desire and time, come to the dispute, work with and let us democratically decide about the future.
I've ordered a lamp screen with you that it will still be delivered.
Now I see that the article is too big for it and not suitable for my taste.
I've already ordered another suspension for this.
I put it together and noticed this when I took the soft foam.
Very sad about that.
I hope this will be returned and I have a full refund.
This is also rather sad, as the #NAME# is much darker than expected.
I have another question: the day cover #PRS_ORG#, is it also in excess, so in 240/240 for example?
#PRS_ORG# needs to be able to guarantee me that the wrong lock will be removed from time to time.
And I'm asking you to let that happen now.
I don't have a suitable packaging, but will unmount the cabinet as much as possible for the collection - they need to clear with #PRS_ORG# how it can work.
#PRS_ORG# can call me on the phone at any time to agree a collection time.
Is there any instructions for the assembly?
How long would I have time to get these or decide for the return?
How do you answer the question, why are you vegan?
Today I had a conversation with a colleague I like.
She has lived a while of vegetarian life herself, at present perhaps even rarely eat meat.
I was also a vegetarian a few years ago.
On the question of whether I have always wanted to be vegan, and Vegetarianism has been a planned step, I have answered honestly without much thought.
And although I thought for a long time that as a vegetarian, I would support animal welfare, but at some point I reflected and understood that I would ultimately also support animal quales.
That's why my decision is to be vegan.
At the moment, I had the impression of this on her part of mismut, she then defended Vegetarianism, and she said she knew where her meat came from, and she reduced it as Vegetarian animal feed.
Now I wonder if my answer to "pump" was?
How do you answer the question?
Have the feeling that you are quickly stuck in a corner as a Veganer and conflicts arise without you going to put it on.
It welcomes a harmonious vegetarian (;
This is clearly not an exception to § 312d BGB.
Your #PRS_ORG# do not disconnect from the legal requirements for remote setting.
I am on the assigned date on which #PRS_ORG# does not collect my returns on site.
Because I cannot be on the spot because of an act of worship, this cannot be changed.

Lahnsteiner Wehr for Water Rescue Equipment: 45,000 Euros Country Grant
Recently, the Rhineland-Pfälze Interior Minister Roger Lewenz delivered an allocation decision of EUR 45,000 in the Lahnsteiner Rathhaus for the new vehicle water saving of the Voluntary Firefighting Lahnstein to Mayor Peter Labonte.
The total costs of the vehicle used since November 2020 amount to EUR 135,000.
A good and important investment in security.
I am pleased that the country of Rheinland-Pfalz supports us here," said the Mayor of Lahnstein, Peter Labonte.
The vehicle is used by the diving staff Lahnstein, one of seven units in the Rhineland-Palatinate.
Over and under water they perform tasks in water and ice recovery as well as technical assistance.
In Lahnstein, you can count on increasing rates: the tree of the hotel boat on Rhein and Mosel, as well as the continued increasing use of the Lahn as a free-time flow, contributes to this.
I bought a book that I could only read 10% and then the problems started.
I can't open the book.
However, following their recommendations, it has synchronized, removed and the app re-loaded NECCHTS has not worked.
I'm a little frustrated because the whole action has cost me a lot of time and I hope now for help.
Okay, then it's like that.
I would like to order 3 items from the #PRS_ORG# collection to June.
Can I enter an appointment in the order procedure?

For the first time, thanks to the fact that you've been here for the whole thing, I've spent almost a decade in the state service in a similar activity, I'm also saying we were armed in the executive, I don't want to go on!
The question of the right and the left is always very simple.
Basically, however, it should be said that, of course, the civil servants come from the liberal to conservative spectrum rather than from the revolutionary left, which should be clear to everyone.
That, of course, also in the particular uniform and weapons of human rights, it should also be clear to everyone that, of course, these people can hardly deal with the reality of life, of course, is also clear, because you have, of course, in addition to the average white, now many Germans with migration grounds, women and also homosexuals (and so I do not now mean the exaggerated female nuns, because they exist in the execution rather than quite normal men and women whom it is not noticed if they can't tell one) and also to these people, and I have to leave me, because they are no doubt saving your life or putting it for you.
But also these marginal groups are represented even if it sounds funny for the first time my experience in a conservative attitude, they are proud of Germany and feel less relaxed by exaggerated left-wing policies, even if this policy is probably used for them or if it is supposed to make them right, they simply want to be treated normally.
Back to the rights, since of course police and combat forces are also a cross-section of society, you will also find extreme rights there that these may say openly there or even openly harm any state-threatening plans are totally exaggerated and upset me too.
Of course, even policemen and soldiers who were often in foreign service often began to pause out because of negative experiences, and sometimes things are said to be politically wrong.
It is also true that right-minded people are also at the same time involved in a proper exchange of views.
Nevertheless, what I think is well fought, and it is also counterproductive with political education and enlightenment!
Germany is so internationally restricted and that is also good in my opinion that we could not afford to have real racists and Nazis in our ranks at all!
Yes, what I don't understand, the other basket I also ordered on the German side.
Why would this come from England?
When I ordered, it wasn't sold out.
I ordered in November.
But it was confirmed to me in your confirmation of the order
It's still about my order, which is no longer available.
I used to chat with #NAME#.
Alternatively, you could deliver the other #PRS_ORG# basket for #NUMBER# Euro in Black yet to Germany or this basket in Germany is available somewhere.
I always find you a partner company.
but on the top of the wood, there are two deep grasses, which have been filled with some yellowish thing;

Ordinarily through a child?
Hello, I (w32) have been busy for a long time.
I am very disciplined and organized at work (by myself, very little leisure time), but for a long time, I have been getting worse than being right to my household to keep clean and orderly.
There are always phases in which everything stays, and then and when it packs me and I pack up and drink.
But it's never really that "someone could come to visit spontaneously."
My husband is also not better, although I am upset somewhere, but most of the time, the household simply loses work and unemployment.
The kitchen is even the most regularly cleaned, as we like to cook.
Now on my question, have you made it more orderly with the child?
We haven't worked yet, and I've been busy with this question for a long time.
Because for me I don't have any tension, it just doesn't bother me so much until a visit comes and for example, there's always fresh clothing there and the kitchen can be used.
Do you have a bigger drive with the child or do you keep your mouth shut?
I'm happy for your answers.
Exclusive, new, and qualitatively high-quality and anatomically pre-formed cut, offers a maximum of comfort, a perfect fit and thus enables an almost unlimited freedom of movement.
Preforming with special, further bending to the joints for improved freedom of movement (on arm and knees)
For Focea Comfort 4 the area covered by the Flex System 2 was more than doubled to further increase the comfort.
Bendless stretch panels on the edges reduce friction (axles, arm and knees)
High-quality preforms in the lower back and step provide an attractive, perfect seat.
Elaskin 8.8 Stretch panel in the Land Wire area increases flexibility for the backrest lock and thus improves comfort, especially when building and mounting and installing the equipment on the surface.
The Free Flex Zone, which is around the shoulders and back, guarantees increased flexibility in the movements of the arms and back.
Fireskin is a warm, waterproof material with a special surface structure that provides a high degree of cooling protection.
Positioned on the chest, it brings heat into a sensitive area of the body.
Nailless, thin (-2 mm) closure on the face of the hood increases comfort, sealing and durability (separate head fitting)
Weighing, the zone in force improves the sealing with finely adjustable wetting by means of a flexible, sleek klett lock which does not hold on the cassette or on the nose
Double sleeves with zipper closure on arm and foot straps connect a translucent inner sleeve with a soft, cassette-shaped neoprene outer sleeve
45° Insertion at the end of the inner sleeve for increased elasticity and wearability.
Long ass lock on the neck with an Elaskin reinforcement, for an anatomical cut with increased comfort on all without a hood
Longer G-Lock P Backrest Lock (overall without a hood) with metal screws and built-in water Dam System for improved sealing (beachat patent)
Assemblies of arms and legs
Neuprene reinforcements at all ends of the cracks to prevent a crack if excessive force is used.
New Panels tied together with external and internal overlap
Borders of outer sleeves for greater load
Border of inner manganese embedded for increased flexibility
The original Beuchat system was designed to fix the computer in its place, especially in deeper dives (the system is compatible with all common armband computers)
Career in social work - as someone with a more self-insecure personality disorder?
I've been training in software development and I've been trained for about a year now.
Unfortunately, however, I increasingly notice that this profession is not the right thing for me, and I have been thinking about starting again and studying social work for a long time.
The problem: I have a more self-insecure (or fearfully preventing) personality disorder (AVPS).
That means that I don't have a sense of self-esteem and I'm afraid accordingly.
I don't have a problem with talking to people at a real level, but I like to have very hard conversations and I've been told more often that I'm acting unbearable (in which I think I've already gotten better).
Can I become such a social worker?
I do not want to work as a streetworker or in the open youth meeting, but rather in the search for advice or family assistance.
But I don't know if the actual working day really is the way I imagine it, and it's hard to find something on the Internet.
The EVPS is already leading to problems in my job (for me, emotionally) because it pulls me down every time there's something to ask about in my code (the simplest things are already hidden) and it's hard for me to ask more experienced colleagues for help ("I should now really know how to do it"/"I keep him up with my stupid questions from work"/"he really needs to keep me down" etc.).
I will probably have the problems in every profession, but I wanted to mention it at the place.
But you've got the sofa back yet?
Because there was no confirmation for that.
I'm waiting for a date to pick up.
What do you mean by giving them back?
If I have downloaded a book on #PRS_ORG#, your #PRS_ORG# message does not authorise this book
Are there any problems?
I was in the chat with #PRS_ORG# who asked me if I got a delivery confirmation for my closet.
The protein (protein) taken with the feed, depleted the bird in its stomach-damm tract into the individual protein building materials (aminoacids) and from these, builds its own body protein, which it also needs to feed.
The breeding of the nestling and the breeding of the fertilising bird are extremely complex procedures and are associated with a particularly high demand for the whole organism of the animal.
Please note that NECTON bio should not be administered during breeding, as it may otherwise occur during pregnancy.
Following this short-term administration of NECTON-BIO, the daily vitamin supply with NECTON-S (multivitamin preparation) and NECTON-MSA (mineral preparation) should be returned.

It is only recommended to prepare as much drinking water/weighing feed as the bird consumes daily and to change water/food daily.
A narrow measuring rod (integrated) corresponds to 1 g of NECTON bio.
In the case of severe foetal damage, the double or triple dose of NECTON bio may be given at the beginning until the approach of foetal retraining is visible.
Thereafter, the normal dose is reached until fertilisation is complete.
Storage: NECTON-Bio should be stored without sunlight, between 15° and 25°C.
Please excuse them, but the chair is sold as an office chair.

Statement by a Community employee in opposition to the constitution
Hallo r/LegaladviceGerman,
I have the following problem.
Our plot should include a walnut tree.
So a case application was made to the municipality.
An employee writes to me that the cases of fruit trees and thus the Walnuss are not part of the constitution.
In the Statute, however, the Walnuss is explicitly indicated as a protected tree.
Can I leave now to the employee's statement or not?
On the one hand, I must be able to leave myself to an expert opinion.
On the other hand, the constitution is clear.
Thank you for your answers
We understand that.
Then we will use the new packaging for it.
I didn't get a message.
Well, then I still have a sofa without use.
Could you offer me a pass or a warrant?
What was more expensive then?
Yeah, I think that's just the question is whether I can pay in euro and let me deliver the cover to Germany
Can you check that out?
E-mail: Severe traffic accident at Selfb
Recently, a serious traffic accident occurred in St 2179 between the connection station Selb-Nord and Plößberg.
As the police's press alarm is currently reported (14:03 p.m.), a Pkw came over in the counter traffic.
There are injured.
I understand.
Well, then thank you so much again, that it was so simple!
Council and ideas for further professional life
For the first time happy Christmas to you!
Unfortunately, my Christmas is pretty good, because my dear head just remembers everything you can think about.
Before I go out here now .. briefly: I need advice and the best of people who know my situation - so from you.
I'm just making the reef as a queer.
Originally, I studied something else and worked there in an area (in order to remain at least a little anonymous, I call it nothing more precise).
All of this was too boring for me, and I looked for alternatives that could make me more fun.
Sometimes I landed at the teaching center and was sure that it was - even though the framework conditions are significantly more unfavourable than in my previous profession, but that was not fair to me.
I have now arrived at the third "I google other job invitations".
And it's only half a year away.
At times before, I have always decided to continue and at least to end the reef, after which I can still wander.
But I'm absolutely done.
I've had so little time in the last month that I've been completely out of my mind.
Now they're vacations, but there's still a bunch of work waiting for me.
Before the Ref I always thought I would be stress-resistant, but there my weekend was also my weekend and my holiday evening.
I was free.
And the stress at work was equal in the moments.
Now I have the family holiday too much stress myself.
And then there's these bright structures that make me more nervous.
Basically it makes fun and viewed from the outside also runs well, as far as feedback is concerned.
But I'm completely exhausted and ask me how much stress my body is suffering before it completely closes - if it doesn't already.
I wonder whether I would like to have the rest of my life like this - just if I read some contributions from you here - or if I should not go back to the old area, because I was valued, could take free time if I needed it, and the work was somehow boring, but it was paid properly for it and worked together in a team and not as a single fighter, as is now the most time in the case.
But then I wonder if in one year I have not come back to the same place as now and am unhappy.
You see, it's all kind of wrong, but maybe you've got it as an external council or ideas, like I'm out of this situation that I'm completely done and almost at the slightest thought of starting to cry about it.
I'm not going to make decisions so emotionally right now, which probably leads to nothing good.
But perhaps your views help me to see at least a little light at the end of the tunnel - or to enjoy Christmas, which is enough for me for the first time.
Thanks for reading and apologizing for my wine cellar.
I hope my situation has become at least a bit clear.
Since its introduction in 2001, the VOX Valvetronix series has continued to develop, including the combination of advanced modeling technology with the "Valve Reactor" switch, which perfectly imitates the behaviour of a pipe amplifier.
With the VT20X/VT40X/VT100X Amps, we present a brand new modeling engine that is absolutely at the latest state of the technology in matters.
Thanks to VET technology (Virtual Element Technology), which is based on the analysis of components and amp circuits, the VTX amplifiers are waiting for an authenticity that is absolutely impressive.
These amps also of course contain the multistage Valvetronix tube boosters.
This is partly based on real analogue switchings, because they just get the sound variations and nuances of a tube enhancer better than any simulation.
In addition to this sophisticated switch, the VTX amplifiers offer a closed case and a bass reflex system, from which the natural resonances only spread.
With the "Tone Room" software from VOX, you can even correct and connect historical facts on the virtual level until the Amp and the effects sound as you have always imagined.
The perfect combination of pipe sound with modeling technology is primarily due to the VOX Valve Reactor technology presented in 2001.
Of course, it has been refined several times since now in order to meet newly arrived sound requirements, which in 2010 has again led to a VOX Valvetronix series performance boost - with more dynamics as well as more and significantly improved amplifier models.
From handy VT20+ to VT120+ with two speakers, the new VT+ Valvetronix series was also designed to find all guitarists looking for a maximum sound diversity here.
All guitarists dream of the pressure and dynamics of a pipe amplifier: they expect a fat sound, a nuanced playback of play dynamics and string stroke as well as a prompt response.
During an in-depth analysis, the VOX engineers discovered that the end-stage determines the pipe character of an amplifier and developed the VOX Valve Reactor technology on the basis of this finding.
The Valve Reactor switch, equipped with a 12AX7 tube, represents the behaviour, subtle nuances and the sound character of a tube amplifier perfectly.
NBA: Despite 20 points of Wagner: Magic lose at Clippers
The Orlando Magic series is held in the NBA.
The Wagner brothers can shine - however, it is not enough to win against the Los Angeles Clippers.
Despite 20 points by Franz Wagner and seven figures of his older brother Moritz lost magic on Saturday 104:106 at the Los Angeles Clippers.
The main feature is also adaptable: with three individual placid and foldable clept lockers it is directed to your photo equipment according to the need and is therefore suitable for any type of cameras - from mirrorless system cameras of all sizes to full-format mirror reflex cameras.
What finally fits in the backpack depends, of course, on the size of the camera and the lens.
A possible location would be a DSLR camera with a set objective, two to three variables and a flashlight.
Larger DSLM cameras such as the different models of the Sony-a7 series or a Fuji X-T2 leave room for other targets.
In addition, you can see every amount of accessories.
And whoever has a small DSLM camera (MFT cameras from Olympus, Fujifilm X-A or E-Series) can use the backpack for his equipment and for photo-foreign things.
Drone pilots also meet with the Everyday Backpack 20L an optimal choice, because the backpack offers enough space for a DJI Mavic Pro including remote control and accessories.
Volcano explosion on La Palma: probably longest of history
In the almost three months since the outbreak, the lava flows on the Canary Islands have caused great damage.
Is there an end to sight?
With a duration of 85 days, the volcanic eruption on La Palma has been the longest in the known history of the Spanish Canary Islands since Sunday.
So far, the eruption of the Tehuya volcano in 1585 was 84 days long on the Atlantic Peninsula in front of the West Coast of Africa.
There are no reliable data on previous outbreaks.
The activity of the unnamed volcano in the Cumbrre Vieja has decreased somewhat in the past days, but Vulcanologists were still not waiting for a forecast when it could end.
The indicators indicate a slowdown.
The best news is that they are stable," said the President of the Island Council, Mariano Hernández Zapata, the State TV broadcaster RTVE.
Damages in millions
In the nearly three months since the outbreak, the more than 1000-degree hot lava has destroyed nearly 2900 homes and other buildings as reported by RTVE.
Nearly 1200 hectares were covered by a central lava layer.
This corresponds to almost 1700 football fields.
More than 7,000 inhabitants had to be evacuated, the damage was estimated at more than 900 million euros.
Two new landings with a total size of about 50 hectares were created before the coast.
It was particularly affected by the important banana cultivation for the island, of which about half of the approximately 85,000 people live directly or indirectly and which was already before the volcanic eruption in the crisis.
225 Hectar banana plantations were destroyed, other areas were severely damaged, the newspaper "El País" wrote.
Christmas and Gifts
Christmas stands in front of the door, and especially the children will not be able to expect the heavenly feast.
The many colorful gifts under the Christmas tree are associated with the spiritual atmosphere and the censoring tension of some seductiveness.
Christmas is one of the few traditional occasions that continue to unite our increasingly divided society.
The more important it is to become aware of the Christmas tradition of the gift, so that the gesture of the gift, which, according to the French sociologist and ethnologist Marcel Mauss, has become a peace-making "the social agreement of the peoples of nature", can be avoided and, in the context of this tradition, can be refilled with life.
How the Christ Child Became From Nikolaus
The Protestants were strictly taken, by which the Christmas days were closely linked with the gift.
Gifts were previously handed over on the Nikolaus day in some way.
The reason for this popular seat today is that St. Nicholas, as Bishop of Myra, secretly threw three women into her window one night to save them another life in sin.
From this unconventional kind of gift, the custom of the popular in Germany was to fill the boots with gifts, especially the children.
Protestants took advantage of this use because they reject mediators between God and men as "holy worship".
For these reasons, they defend themselves against the institution.
Martin Luther made the Christkid out of the Nikolaus and thus founded a new line of tradition.
The focus of the gift thus moved to the Holy Evening.
Since most Protestants do not see such detailed questions so closely, it is only the least that the use of St. Nicholas is still the same as Martin’s use of Martinsingen and Martin’s collection of the Christmas season.
Today you can find all that the heart wants in the steps ahead of the door and under the Christmas tree of socks to wish for luxury hours.
Diversity of traditions in Christian countries
Sources have been a tradition of giving since the 13th century on the day of Saint Nicholas.
With the reform, the day of the gift moved to the Holy Night.
In all the marked Christian countries, however, there is a joyful cave model about the question of who now brings the gifts to the children.
In Germany it depends on the region in question whether the Christmas child appears on the Holy evening or the Christmas man, who is in principle a kind of Nikolaus, who was assigned some of his own by time.
These include, for example, his white noise bar, which is only a little more common with the rather strict asynchronous of the historical figure, his slabs drawn by renters and the preference of the fireplace to gain access to the houses.
In the Netherlands, St. Nicholas remains the central figure at Christmas.
In Spain, the Holy Three Kings give the gifts, while in Italy there is the Hexe Befana, who should have shown them the way to Jesus.
In Scandinavia, fable beings sometimes bring the gifts, while in Russia it brought Father Frost to some glory.
Here are not reindeer, but three horses that draw as a troika his slabs.
In the Czech Republic, the mother country of the reform in the course of the Hussite Wars, the Christian child is responsible for the delivery of gifts.

Police shoots mercenary bank robbers near the Royal Palace
Near the Kensington Palace in London, an armed man was shot by the police on Saturday.
The police reported that callers had reported a man who was supposed to have gone to a bank with a gun and a bookkeeper's business.
The man fled, according to the authorities, in a vehicle which could not be stopped by officers later.
It was shot and the man was hit.
He was still declared dead at the Tator.
The police didn't go out of a terrorist background.
Several messages are located in the area around the Kensington Palace.
The palace is the official London residence of Prince William, his wife Catherine and the three children.
Other members of the royal family also live there.
What then?

Pills problem
Hello, dear Weibsvolk,
I hope I do everything right here, after a year is actually saved my first post.
My problem: I started taking the pill again about five years ago, mainly because I had so incredibly bad pain during the period and had dirty PMS before the period.
Now I'd like to let it go again, because I have to take enough medication I can't choose from because of chronic diseases.
My main problem, of course, is not the pain, but my skin.
I had received my last about two years' break from 0 to 100 explosion-like pickles and these everywhere.
That's so superficial, but I've had a really good time, and I didn't feel like it.
In the two years of break, the whole has never really been normalized.
Maybe he's got some tips to avoid this time.
Perfumes-free and without mercy is my cosmetics already, but maybe there's something that someone can recommend.
I'm sorry, ma'am, I didn't take this seriously, and the deadline is still coming.
Thank you very much for everyone who has read through the novel!
Yes, the love skin is so new.
Had prebuppertaire bad neurodermitis, then a time of rest, then large-scale bone marrow and the acne theme.
Food I have also tried everything possible in the course of chr. Disease and I am left hanging on low sugar, milk and meat-poor mixed food because otherwise nothing has worked so well.
It may also be good that Hormonell is simply inside the worm, but if you like me everywhere you want to stop looking for something else that is going wrong.
I already had everything from her colleague's seminar.
Written and now I have lost the conversation and I don't know what was answered to my concerns.
I have to work through it all the time and on the phone, and suddenly everything was gone...
What's there to check if the money is there, I'd have seen it.
Please check my bank data, maybe there was something wrong.
but it is generally large
because it is available in black size

110-kV-Earth cable will be rebuilt in 2022
The approval for the release of the new high voltage cable at Tann shall be valid.
The plan-fixing decision of the government of Niederbayern opens the way for the construction to begin in 2022.
This was now shared by the network operator Bayernwerk.
The approximately seven kilometres of ground cable will connect the Tann circuit in the north of the municipality and the existing 110-kilovolt line between Simbach and Pfarkirchen.
The cable is connected to a mast of release near the village of Edermanning at Reut.
Good morning,
my order of 03.01.21 with the order number #NUMBER# has so far only come in parts with us.
The blue cell number:#PRS_ORG# with the transmission number #NUMBER# was returned by #PRS_ORG# with the note "not possible".
All three other packages have arrived, so a delivery is definitely possible.
Can you tell me how the next procedure is now?
A nice start in the week!
You can forget that I explained that several times yesterday!!
This is a glass comedy and all the pages are covered, so the glass is everywhere and the cardboard is cut
The comedy is in my apartment and #PRS_ORG# refuses to come into the apartment because of the #PRS_ORG# terms
This means that the como can't be picked up, because no one in my apartment can clean up.
Thank you for the message
But why only EUR 20?
The original value of this chair was #NUMBER# EUR
No, it's all books, so the question at #PRS_ORG# is probably a general problem.
Ref: Plan training (EC)
Hello, ladies and gentlemen,
I've been in the Ref since summer, teaching makes me fun, but I still have great problems planning my teaching in the field of Earth science in time.
Unfortunately, my school is not technically well equipped, so in principle I can only use the table, the school book and an OHP as a medium.
In addition, at school I can only copy s/w for free (which nerves for land art).
I just need a very long time to plan my hours.
For example, we are currently making geofactors and I actually have every hour for myself.
In principle, the methods are always repeated, but on the other hand, I don't want to invest too much time for simple lessons (that I need for UBs, etc.).
I'm actually always out of the goal of planning (what I want to achieve) and think about how I can build it (mostly I create a worksheet with texts from books that don't have my school).
We have the book Terra and with most of the tasks in the book I am rather unhappy.
That's why the worksheets.
Maybe I can work with the book as an earthly teacher.
I'd really be happy.
I would like to return the #PRS_ORG# from the #NUMBER# order.
In fact, I have already decided for a new at #PRS_ORG# but I would like to settle the returns as quickly as possible for the first time.
Trade fears about Christmas business because of the 2G regulation.
In most cases only those who are vaccinated or healed may be allowed to do so.
Trade considers this unnecessary and burdensome revenue cuts.
He's got a possible solution, too.
The 2G regulations destroy the important Christmas business from the perspective of the German Trade Association (HDE).
In dealing with non-day needs, sales broke out, HDE chief businessman Stefan Genth criticised.
According to a current survey of the HDE under 1100 traders, more than 70 percent of the companies looked negative on the rest of the year.
Many had already written off the Christmas business.
"What should actually be the positive height of the year is now often a hole without soil," Genth said.
Traders with 2G access restrictions thus lost almost one third of their pre-crisis rates in the last week.
It only runs in food retail and online.
The association called for consequences from the dramatic development.
The purchase with mask, distance and hygiene concept was a safe matter, said the chief businessman.
"2G does not bring us forward in the fight against the pandemic," he stressed.
The current regulations frightened customers and required high staff use.
The bond regime had to be approved throughout the country, he demanded.
After that, each customer had to be checked only once on 2G (infused or healed) and had access to all the shops with the tapes received on this day.
In addition, in retail trade - as already in public transport under the 3G rule - sampling checks should be sufficient.
The Deutsche Euroshop, specialized in shopping centres, also spoke of a difficult Christmas business.
The frequencies were last placed without 2G at a good 75 percent of the pre-Corona level, the sales at approximately 90 percent.
These figures will now be safe in the middle of the so important Christmas business," said Chief Executive Wilhelm Wellner of the "Economic Week".
Due to the high personal and administrative effort, it will be tried for the Centre to find and obtain solutions.
This includes the so-called bond solution, where "for example, visitors at a central site in the center once give their 2G instruction and then - equipped with an armband similar to in a club hotel - can enter all shops unbreakably". dpa
I recently ordered and delivered the #PRS_ORG#.
The mirror has a scratcher and the frame is also an error that has been tried with a yellow filling.
That looks unpleasant.
I'd like to return the mirror and I already packed it back into the package and glued it.
How do I have to proceed for the return now?
The lamp is designed for dual-balance, based on new, flat SMD LEDs with high performance and high colour rendering.
A modern microprocessor with exceptional possibilities provides for the setting of the colour temperature and brightness of the lamp.
In addition to the adjustment of the brightness, there are two standard colour temperatures: daylight and artificial light.
It is also possible to manually set and store the colour temperature in the range of 3100 - 5650K.
Use the current settings in the flash memory.
A special feature of the controller, it is simple and intuitively operational.
The light creates a very light stream with soft light of high quality, completely flammable.
The 120-degree radiation angle with which you can illuminate large areas at relatively small distance is excellent.
Other than in reporting situations in small rooms or short distances.
You can adjust the brightness practically without changing the color temperature.
It is a great tool to work both on the film set or on the studio.
The optional DMX512 controller allows remote control of the lights in television studios or when the lights are installed in difficult accessible locations.
On the back of the lamp is the control panel, it consists of buttons and a luminous display.
The display shows the current brightness setting in percent and the current colour temperature in Kelvin.
There is also the slot for the NP-F battery (not included in the delivery range)
User Memory The memory has up to three panel settings for brightness and colour temperature.
In order to perform the settings of the individual settings on the storage sites, it is easy to set up and complete one of the storage keys by pressing longer.
The storage controller saves the current state of the lamp when switched off, so that the known situation is re-established in new inclusions - very practical in the studio work when, for example, the camera is set to certain colour temperatures.
Working with battery one of the largest strengths of the DL3120 functionality comes from the possibility of the company with cheap NP-F batteries.
These are often already owned by photographers and camera crews (and women) - so you can go back to existing equipment.
The DL3120 can also check before the set whether the battery has sufficient power - it is a battery battery with the same installation - for each of the two battery trays a value in the two displays (the left battery top display, the right on the bottom display).
In addition, it is possible to provide the light bulbs over the supplied network part continuously with electricity.
The construction of the light bulb is very easy.
You have a 16mm hole attached to you, so you can directly access your photostat.
The inclination is to be set reliably by means of indicators on both sides.
It was considered that the mechanical components are also extremely high and therefore are also designed for longevity and hard use.
In addition, a new gel is included in the delivery range.
Great is that also contains a bag in the delivery range.
This way you can buy the lights with all the accessories you may still want to buy without safe transport or storage problems.
The damage I have received and it is too small :(
"Party that we wanted to mock": Frankfurt celebrates after a dry comeback against Leverkusen
What a spectacular reaction from Entracht Frankfurt.
After 22 minutes, the last two times in a series of sieglosen Hessen were probably on the way to the next Bundesliga square.
But then the SGE turned up, in a good hour, to shake the frost over a grown season start of the soul and beat furios with 5:2. "It's crazy what the boys have done today," cheered Coach Oliver Glassner at DAZN and said a "pauschal-lob, to every individual who was with it",
At first, it looked after a renewed damper for the nine present-day Frankfurters who are still behind their expectations.
Patrick Schick had led the Leverkusner with 2:0.
What happened then also impressed the SGE trainer.
"How the players then came back and showed a fantastic performance," said Glasner.
I am crazy happy with the performance we have shown and of course also with the result.
Also dissident Christopher Lenz, who was able to stand back on the scene for the first time since the fourth day of the game and his surpassing muscle injury, stressed the morals of his teammates.
"I believe our mentality is incredibly large," said the 27-year-old and was pleased with the result, especially for the audience.
That was the party we wanted to make today.
For the next tasks, Glasner wants to keep the focus on himself, but he also looks well on the staff situation.
It is exceptional that we have all players fit in December that all players are physically in a top constitution.
It is top work in our medical department, but also the players live highly professionally.
Now you want to "go on step by step and stay modest" and to "go through the tasks at this level" until the year-on-year change.
As the next thing you know, on Wednesday, the English week's tour of Borussia Mönchengladbach (18.30 p.m., Sky) is on the program.
Grade I get the mail that my package comes back to you due to an error on my part.
I've been trying to call #PRS_ORG# and have it redirected, no chance.
Can it be sent back to me directly or do I have to wait until the money is returned and the order is returned?
Unfortunately, for me, that's not what I'm going to order, because it's been a long time.
Have they ever sat on the #PRS_ORG# chairs?
Damper for handball women in front of quarter-finals against Spain
Germany's handball women are different after being humiliated against Denmark with hanging heads and empty views of the park.
At the end of the World Cup, the DHB election at 16:32 (8:13) before 800 viewers in Granollers cast a defeat and now has to run against the Spanish host in the quarter final.
"We were too scared and had too much respect for the opponent," said Bundestrainer Henk Groener.
We must take action against Spain.
After the first defeat in the tournament, Germany closed the main round group III with 8:2 points as a second behind the Danishs (10:0).
It's a shame we couldn't take the river.
That was a bad game for all of us, which we need to delete," said Captain Emily Blok.
In the fight to enter the semifinals, a significant increase is needed against the WM Second of 2019 on Tuesday, in order to maintain the delicate dream of the first medal since 2007.
The best German publisher in duel with the three-time Olympic Denmark was the back-room player Alina Grijseels with six towers.
"We just weren't there - not in the attack, not in the defense," said Xenia Smits, and asked: "We need to look ahead quickly now."
From front to back not above
Unlike the previous five tournaments, the German team with the anpfiff was not on high.
Errors and technical errors in the attack and gaps in the defense were responsible for a quick 0:4-back stand after seven minutes.
Just Torfrau Dinah Eckerle was immediately at operating temperature and prevented with some paradisaic slimmers.
The first door reached the DHB team after 9:30 minutes, when Grijsiels successfully completed a rapid opposite.
However, this was not the expected initial ignition.
Against the aggressive coverage of the Danishs, the German women were barely able to get into the scene - and if so, they usually failed at the strong Althea Reinhardt in the gate of Scandinavia.
So the party was running early at 3:10 after 20 minutes, especially the back room player Mia Zschocke saw even red because of a hard fool on her opponent.
But in the fourth final, it can be re-invigorated.
Only in the final phase of the first half time did the DHB selection get a little better into the game and to break up to at least five doors.
Nevertheless, the only hope for a resurrection after the change was seven minutes at 9:19 there.
Again, the Greeners in all areas committed sin and made it the well-established opponent, who was simply among the medal candidates at the end of the day.
As a result, the German team could no longer reach an increase in performance and went as a clear loser from the park.

as in #PRS_ORG# gift vouchers
Is that with them?
The title suggests that I am involved in mobile immpheams in which the bioNtech/Pfizer immffofstof is immunized in care secrets.
As these are soon completed to a large part, I will then continue to be part of the vaccination centres.
I would like to answer questions without a time limit to the organizational and human aspects and also medical questions if they are not related to a personal (e.g. "I take medicine X, it is subject to vaccination.").
In my task area, the explanation for vaccination, the indication position (Person has a claim for a vaccination according to coronaimmpment and no reason to speak against it), the medical documentation, and, if necessary, the supply of allergenic reactions (we have not yet happened).
The vaccination itself can be delegated to qualified personnel, such as medical professionals.
However, we often have no "only" (for God's sake, no lack of appreciation!) pharmaceutical-technical assistants for the preparation of the vaccine, but they can't carry out vaccines (must?), so that I carry out most of the vaccines myself.
Severe "slippers" question: Amberger knows the solution
What's a "Huidler" please?
With this dialectic word, sent by an Amberer, "We in Bayern" has been provided in the BR-Finnish transmission.
However, unlike in many days before, the term "Host me?" remained unchanged this time by the callers.
No, it wasn't a "man who's nervous."
And no one who's got to go fast.
That, people heard from the TV moderator, be completely wrong.
On the other hand, the man from Amberg announced the solution and thus probably also provided for surprises in many upper floors.
"The Huidlers," the viewers experience, "is a lamp with which someone wipes the oven."
Dialectt researcher Antony Rowley, who has been interviewed as an expert on Bavarian television for years, confirmed this.
With the note that this is a typical suprapilatory term, somehow derived from the more well-known word "hounds".
What led to a successful education – perhaps even in some who have lived in the room of Amberg for a long time.
I can't buy books anymore for 2 weeks.
It comes after confirmation always the following error message: oops - something won wrong - try again later.
I started the #PRS_ORG#gel#PRS_ORG#n, relaunched, synchronized and repaired with the PC.
Nothing has helped.
Do the wheel selection really look so good?
Today, I am fully committed because I wanted at least a little training to prepare my bicycle trip in the coming week.
I said, I did, and I ran with my bike, which I bought yesterday on eBay.
The first 40km were also really nice - but then what is going on in every city in this way (this time: Thank you Krefeld!).
Glass splitter on the line.
Zack, loud pockets and my back ribs didn't want to join the rest of the track in any case.
Since I had no real opportunity to get me replacement coat and replacement hose due to the week-day, I had to turn back with half a bad salary and take the first train home.
It wasn't that bad, either, that's how it might be better if I do that before the bike tour.
But now I'm asking a question and I hope you can help me.
Since I have a relatively long journey over several days before me, I would get very close to this problem more often.
Now it was really not bad, since even the old tires of the predecessor (very nice old man, on the day I got the bike to get rid of up to 14 o'clock 120km!) and who had already described it as suboptimal because he had been in the role with them for many years.
But if I think that when I drive 80-90km, I have to make another tire change, then I think I'm really bad paid :D
Now I came to the conversation with an older man on the train, who was wondering why I didn't have the marathon plus tires; they should be indiscriminate.
Now, of course, the whole thing sounds very captivating.
But are these really so incapacitating?
I have little desire now to issue 40€/reifs, just to be disappointed.
I'm also asking myself: I'm on the racetrack at the moment I believe 25x622.
There are also (apparently?) tyres at the Marathon Plus, but the majority is already wider.
Is this a problem?
Or would you generally advise me on a racetrack to other tires?
The Schwalbe side seems to be my absolute! Laiewisen prefer to recommend the Durano DD?
Thank you already in advance for the help and love welcome!
Car bent against tree: Driver fatally injured
The 53-year-old was on the B57 between Rheinberg and Xanten with his car for an inexplicable cause against a central island and then hit the counterroads, as the police reported.
There it came to a frontal collision with the vehicle of a 27-year-old.
The 53-year-old car was then pushed against a tree and the man was dragged into the car.
The 27-year-old and his 23-year-old companion were severely injured in the accident and brought into surrounding hospitals.

After the release of our new High End Band B 100-6 OHM it was only a matter of time until our SOLO series would be re-advanced.
SOLO 15 is called the new Sprøssling and remembers the large samples with the B 200 - 6 OHM.
However, in this proposal, an appropriate design foot is included directly to raise the speaker to the correct voice position.
This has no influence on acoustics and can therefore be adjusted in length according to the circumstances at home.
The principle is that the SOLO 15 is very good for people with a more subordinated role in the maximum sound level, but a very high level is to be achieved.
A 10 cm speaker is simply not able to produce almost unfiltered large signal pressure level.
However, this does not mean that the SOLO 15 sounds weak.
On the contrary, it grows considerably and is extremely impressive and accurate to its size.
Tonal was adjusted to SOLO 15 with a slight increase in height.
This is generally used in broadband to optimize the high frequencies of highly increasing binding.
The SOLO 15 with very clear and fine sound convinces the audience.
Lightly turned outwards can reduce the high-level range and thus make the sound image warmer.
Thanks to the point signal source, the location of the individual components of a piece of music in the optimal stereodreieck messerscharf and stunning precision.
The reference suspect extremely low mechanical losses of B 100 - 6 OHM provide an enemy dynamic that is looking for the same.
The SOLO 15 thus complements not only our SOLO series, but expands it in matters of resolution and accuracy.
As with all of our building positions, it is recommended to start thinking about the final optics of the speaker to plan appropriate changes in the construction process.
For example, if the case is to be handled, the reduction of the speaker needs to be adjusted accordingly, as the Furnier is again fitted.
After all the plates have been cut (e.g. in the construction market), you should first drill an 8 mm hole into the floor at the appropriate site to be able to run the cable without any problems later.
With the help of an over-grey, the soundspeaker is now following in the front, so that the B 100 - 6 OHM can be used together later.
On the other hand, this opening should be provided with a 45° phase in order to make the opening area of the speaker room as large as possible inside.
The four screwing points of B 100 - 6 OHM get a break in the phase as shown in the picture "Detail phase".
Then you start with the actual construction of the box and place one of the two sides on a level surface.
The back wall, the lid, the front and the floor are now attached to them.
The three stamps should also be used and flagged.
The distortions themselves may vary in material strength if, for example, they want to return to finished performance from the construction market instead of producing them from 16 mm MDF.
In the next step, the second page will be added.
Then follow all the plates of the foot, that is, the two sides, as well as the front.
By means of a suitable hole circuit or drill drill, the opening of the bass reflex tube as well as the connection glue on the back wall will be facilitated.
Then you use a round phrase to round all the edges of the actual box.
This can also be rounded up on the surface of the floor.
After that, the floor plate is firmly glued to the floor of the house, and additionally screwed with long wooden screws.
It follows the marking and front drilling (2,5-mm drills) of the screwing points of the soundspeaker box and the connection glue.
After the housing of wood dust has been cleaned (swallowed / blown off), you begin to lay down the cable.
The easiest way to do this is by the 35 mm bass reflex opening in the back wall.
It moves the entire and uncut cable piece for pieces through the 8 mm drilling in the foot to the terminal opening and allows it to appear there about 30 cm.
In the upper part of the house, the cable is used to open the speaker and it can also be locked out.
The frequency weight is then prepared and used.
The frequency weight construction plan, as well as the corresponding connection plan, can be taken from the following document: assembly instructions Weiche Solo 15.
If the frequency weight is installed and the connection terminal is shut down, then the closure of the 8 mm cable opening within the box, which is not fully closed.
Through the 35 mm bASSREFLEX opening and with some gear, you can drop heat adhesives on the opening and close.
By opening the B 100 - 6 OHM and with a small lamp you can check the closure accordingly.
Now the evaporation follows according to description.
The B 100 - 6 OHM is then connected to the corresponding screws.
The polarity plays an important role in this, so that the additional wire (marked cable) must be killed at the Pluspol of the speaker (larger contact).
Finally, the bass reflex tube is cut and inserted at the specified length of 28 mm (total length of the pipe).
For evaporation, a matt of the evaporative material is cut into two parts and loosely distributed into the housing.
The opening around the bass reflex canal should be kept free.
Can I give up an order now and let the beginning of June come first?
> Hello all,
> at last we can announce that we are again organizing the OSCAST this year!
> Unfortunately, for well-known reasons, it is not possible to get more than four people into the studio, which means a higher planning effort and explains the short term of the announcement.
ABER: There will be at least three people per switch so that we will follow the Oscars 2021 with at least 7 beans in the stream and hopefully thousands of you!
> We do our best to avoid Delay or other problems.
But hey, it's still like before pandemic – yet we'll give everything to accompany the Oscars as entertaining as possible.
> It will be released at about 0:30.
Have a cold drink, plan good food and prepare for a long, but very interesting night.
