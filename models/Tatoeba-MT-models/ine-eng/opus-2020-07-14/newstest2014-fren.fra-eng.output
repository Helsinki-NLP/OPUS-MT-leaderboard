Fresh spectacle in "wingsuit" above Bogota
Sportsman Jonathan Florez jumped Thursday from a helicopter above Bogota, the Colombian capital.
Equipped with a Wingsuit (a combination of moustaches), it passed to 160 km/h above the famous St. Monserrate, located over 3,000 meters high, where many Badads gathered to observe its operation.
A black box in your car?
While U.S. road network planners have a hard time finding the money needed to repair the decommissioned motorway infrastructure, many are those who are investigating a solution in the form of a small black box that is located above your carboard table.
The devices, which record every mile through a car driver and transmit the information to the officials, are at the centre of a controversial attempt in Washington and in government planning offices to maintain the obsolete system of financing major American roads.
The sector generally without interest in the planning of the major axes has suddenly led to a strong animated debate and moving alliances.
The liberators have joined environmentalist groups to pressure the government to use the small boxes to keep track of the thousands you will travel, and possibly of the road on which you travel, then use the information to draft a bill.
The Tea Party is landed.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also very concerned and expresses its concern about the protection of privacy.
And while members of Congress are not able to agree to whether to continue, several States have not waited.
They are looking for how, in the next decade, they will be able to move to a system that allows drivers to pay for thousands of percours.
Thousands of motorists have already loaded these black boxes, sometimes equipped with a GPS monitoring system, for an experimental turn.
This is really important to our nation.
"It's not like we had the choice," said Hasan Ikhrata, Director General of the Southern California Association of Governments, which provides that the state will begin to record thousands of cars by 2025.
There will be a change in how we pay these taxes.
Technology is here to do it.
The pressure comes from the fact that the country's Highway Trust Fund, financed by taxes paid by Americans at the pump, is financially dry.
Americans don't buy as much essence as they used to.
Cars can travel more than a mile with a gallon.
The federal tax itself, which is 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased for 20 years.
Political men are reluctant to increase the tax, even 1 cent, while the prices of the essence are high.
"The essence tax is simply not tenacious," said Lee Munnich, a transport policy specialist at the University of Minnesota.
His State recently installed tractors on 500 cars to test a mill payment system.
"This has been the most logical alternative in the long term," he said.
Wunks calls this the cost of using the kilometer.
It is not surprising that the idea seduces the citizens' liberals, as taxes could be used to change the behavioural habits in order to reduce the congestion and emissions, for example.
California planners are interested in the system as they develop strategies to achieve the objectives set out in the State's ambitious climate heating laws.
However, representative Bill Shuster (R-Pa.), Chairman of the Committee on Transport of the House of Representatives, said that he also considered it the most viable alternative in the long term.
The free market participants of the Reason Foundation also appreciate the idea of making drivers pay a mile.
"It's not just a tax going on in a big black hole," said Adrian Moore, Vice-President of Policy at the Reason Foundation.
People pay more directly for the benefits they receive.
The movement was also supported by two former US Secretarys in Transport, who, in a 2011 report, urged Congress to go on the way to payment to the mile.
The U.S. Senate approved a $90M pilot project last year that would have carried about 10,000 cars.
But the Presidency of the House has killed the proposal, responding to the concerns of rural legislators representing voters who have to spend many thousands of days going to work or in town.
Several States and large cities, however, make progress on their side.
The most determined is Oregon, which has mobilized 5,000 drivers to conduct the country's most important experience.
These motorists will soon pay the State of the km rather than taxes on dust.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
The city of New York considering one.
Illinois is trying a test on a limited number of trucks.
And the I-95 Coalition, which includes 17 agencies involved in road transport in States along the coast, is American (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida) studying how it could implement the change.
The concept is not a universal success.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteers had recently equipped their car with a device, drivers were concerned that the government could follow their minor actions and practices.
“The concerns about Big Brother and this kind of thing are a big problem,” said Alaudin Khan, who manages the strategic management of performance in the Nevada Transportation Department.
It's not something people want.
From the beginning of the test, the Nevada ACLU warned on its site: "It would be relatively easy to turn these devices into whole-scale location devices."
There is no need to build an enormous and comprehensive technological infrastructure that will be inevitably expanded to preserve the records of people's trips and daily arrivals.
Nevada is one of the few States that are now moving to find an affordable technology that would allow the State to know how many thousands of cars travel, but not knowing the exact time or place.
If we can do that, Khan added, the citizens will be more comfortable.
The research of this technology has led some state agencies to appeal to a small start-up in California called True Mileage.
Originally, the company does not intend to help car drivers who pay taxes to States.
She was looking for a search in the emerging car insurance market, in which drivers would pay on the basis of their mileage.
But the devices it tests have plenty to plan large axes because they do not use GPS and provide a limited amount of information, periodically downloaded by modem.
"People will be more inclined to do this if you don't register their speed and do not locate them," said Ryan Morrison, Director General of True Mileage.
Major errors have been made in the pilot programmes of some States.
There are far less expensive means and less intrusive methods to be done.
In Oregon, planners try to experience by offering different car drivers choices.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
They can still choose not to have any equipment at all, preferring to pay a fee based on the average number of thousands of travels by all residents of the State.
Other States hope to sell the concept to suspicious citizens by allowing devices to do more, rather than enough.
In New York City, transport managers are looking to develop a taxing device that would also be equipped to pay the parking costs, provide a "car payment" insurance and create a set of real-time speed data from other drivers that motorists could use to avoid bottlenecks.
"Carmakers would be encouraged to participate because of the benefits the system offers them," said a document on urban planning.
However, some transport planners wonder if all the debate on the payment to the mill is not simply a huge diversion.
At the Metropolitan Transport Commission of the San Francisco Bay Area, officials say that Congress could manage the bankruptcy of the Highway Trust Fund by increasing taxes on essence.
A single or annual additional tax could be imposed on hybrid vehicle drivers and on other vehicles whose vehicles do not consume a lot of essence, so that each pays its own share.
"It is not necessary to resort to radical surgery when we simply need aspirin," said Randy Rentschler, the director of legislation and public affairs with the Commission.
If we do so, hundreds of millions of motorists will worry about protecting their privacy and a lot of other things.
David Bowie: Four Unpublished
The English musician has not finished surprise this year.
From The Next Day, released in January, he completed a luxury edition scheduled for 4 November, with several unpublisheds.
Four have already emerged on the Table.
The announcement of the release of a new album by David Bowie had left the whole world pantois.
On the day of its 66th anniversary, on January 8, 2013, he stated that a new album would come out in March.
After ten years of silence (the last disc, Reality, date of 2003) and too few public appearances, English musician proved that he could still be counted on to spark the pop scene.
A party for his fans
No surprises, David Bowie had more than one tour in his bag with The Next Day.
The Thin White Duke thus planned to re-edit this album on November 4th.
For the occasion, he cooked a real party for his fans.
This edition, entitled The Next Day Extra, will be presented in the form of three discs: the original album, unpublished studio sessions and remixes, as well as a DVD containing the four clips already opened.
The Next Day Extra will contain a total of ten additional songs compared to the original album: the three pieces of the Deluxe edition, five songs specially released for the occasion, as well as two replays.
David Bowie also made the presentations of this beautiful box in a video.
It introduces both disks, but also the accessories provided with: exclusive photos and pockets, a book to share its own impressions, a book with words...
And, above all, it gives a taste of its new title Atomica, typically in the vein of The Next Day, with very early guitars and a highly mastered rock electricity.
Incentives already listening
But Atomica is not the only title to reveal her charms.
The Informer, Like A Rocket Man, Born In A UFO are also available on the table.
The Informer is double-face: a disturbing intro before a light-chain that slows down gradually to place a pop ballad.
On Like A Rocket Man, did Bowie want to make a small reference to Rocket Man of Elton John, or even to Gravity?
With this title played, the singer seems in any case in his element when he no longer has his feet on earth.
Space Oddy, besides, was much more serious.
On Born In A UFO, David Bowie makes a new reference to his strangeness: would he come from another planet?
The guitar riffs, sendin', give you the desire to leave the Earth.
Bowie is in any case fun to play on the chameleon with these titles: turn to informant, man on board a rifle, potential martian...
He dissimulates and reveals both, plays to adopt different personalities, as he has done throughout his career, including with his characters Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane.
No wonder he has a mask in his hand in the photography of the campaign L'Invitation au Voyage, of the Louis Vuitton brand, which includes the new face.
It will appear in one of their advertising spots, broadcast from November 10.
The Minister of Defence Rob Nicholson insisted that the wounded soldiers were not completely released from the Canadian Armed Forces, and stressed that a transition process was followed by all the soldiers before they returned to their civil life.
Attacked by the Liberals and the neo-democratics in the House of Commons, Mr. Nicholson made sure that prior to their release, members of the army followed a transitional plan in collaboration with their superiors.
All wounded soldiers receive appropriate care for their return to civil life and none of them is released before being ready, he said.
Detractors accuse the government of wanting to save money by not allowing injured soldiers - who do not meet the "university of service" rule of the army demanding that staff be able to perform a variety of tasks - to reach the 10-year eligibility period required for retirement benefits.
In particular, they cited two cases reported by the Canadian Press, including one of a free soldier on Friday last.
Corporal David Hawkins, a London reserver in Ontario, has been released from the army despite his request to remain a year longer in order to receive a fully indexed retirement.
His case occurred after Corporal Glen Kirkland, who told a parliamentary committee last month that he had been moved to the exit before being ready because he did not respond to the universality rule of service.
Mr. Hawkins pointed out that a soldier could be prepared from time to time, with plans and consultations, but that this was completely different from the fact that he wanted to leave the ranks.
"I told them I wasn't ready," he said during an interview with The Canadian Press Wednesday.
I asked for months if there was a way for me to stay, and they said no.
Since the beginning of the major wars in Afghanistan, the army has hardly been able to determine the latitude it can afford to wounded soldiers who want to remain in the ranks but who are not fit to fight.
Under the current rules, the brutally wounded soldiers have to be restored for up to three years.
If they do not meet the criteria for deployment abroad, they may be forced to leave the army.
Data submitted last year to Parliament indicate that among the 1218 soldiers released for medical reasons, 199 had not reached the service time required to obtain pension benefits.
The Liberal spokesperson for former combatants, Jim Karygiannis, called for the reintegration of Corporal Hawkins on Wednesday, while the neo-democratic Jack Harris called for the immediate end of "this shameful practice".
Disney put on tablets to launch an animated series
The American media and entertainment group Disney has decided to take the tablets to its own television channels for the next release of a new series for children.
The first nine episodes of Sheriff Callie's Wild West will be available from November 24 on the watchdisneyjunior.com website or via its application for phones and tablets.
Its global launch on the Disney Group's chains is scheduled only in 2014, details the communication of its Disney Junior Division.
The animated drawing, for children 2 to 7 years of age, tells the adventures of the Callie chat, sheriff of a city of the Western American where she rules the order with a magical lasso.
Each episode includes two 11-minute stories.
"Interfering with smartphones and tablets is a second nature for children today," commented Albert Cheng, vice president of digital products at Disney/ABC Television Group, quoted in the communiqué.
This type of experience comes within Disney's efforts to "widen the life span of its series and build new relationships with its audience through increasingly important digital platforms", he added.
A survey published at the beginning of the week by Common Sense Media showed an explosion of use of mobile devices by young children in the United States: 38% of the under 2 years of age had already been used on a tablet or phone, and 72% of the under 8 years of age, compared to 10% and 38% two years ago.
Snowden is ready to "cooperate" with Germany on the issue of American surveillance
Edward Snowden, the U.S. Information Service Prosecutor, stated that he was willing to go to Berlin to testify to the German parliament if the United States National Security Agency and its Director Keith Alexander did not provide answers to their activities.
German MP Hans-Christian Ströbele met on Thursday, Mr Snowden in Russia, where he was entitled to asylum, to discuss his testimony in Germany.
In a letter to the media in Berlin on Friday, Mr. Snowden said: "Although the result of my efforts has been positive, my government continues to treat the difference of opinion as a fugitive and seeks to penalise the political discourse with accusations against which it is impossible to defend itself."
However, telling the truth is not a crime.
In his letter, Mr. Snowden wrote that he felt that the support of the international community could persuade the American government to abandon the criminal charges against him.
As part of the complaint filed by the U.S. Department of Justice, he is accused of espionage and theft of property of the State.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, Minister of the German Interior, said at Zeit Online: "If Mr. Snowden is ready to speak to the Germans responsible, we will make this possible."
The relationship between the United States and Germany was severely tested following complaints that NSA had been listening to the German chancellor Angela Merkel's mobile phone.
Thomas Oppermann, the member of the parliamentary group who oversees foreign secret services, said that if there was a chance of hearing Mr. Snowden as a witness "without endangering him and completely ruining relations with the United States", he had to take advantage of it.
Mr Ströbele, German MP Vert, posted a photo of him with Mr Snowden on his Twitter account.
On his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr. Ströbele said that, according to the former NSA counsel, Mr. Snowden could not return to Russia if he left the country.
If Mr Snowden witnessed in Germany, he would have to be assured that he would be "safe" there, he said.
Mr. Snowden wrote in his letter that he had been subjected to a "serious and sustained persecution" campaign that forced him to leave his country.
However, he said that he had been encouraged by the global response to "my act of political expression".
People around the world, as well as the seniors in charge, including the United States, have considered the revelation of an inexplicable system of permanent surveillance to be of public utility.
The letter promotes an offer of cooperation with the German authorities "when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved".
Cogeco Cable could soon offer interactive TV
Cogeco Cable subscribers may well have access to applications such as Facebook, Twitter and ultimately the Netflix video service on request via their television in a future that doesn't seem so far away.
Cogeco's branch indicated Thursday that it was currently undergoing preliminary testing of the beta version of this platform with some of its users.
"This will allow us to develop more friendly interfaces and more options," explained the President and Head of the Cogeco Directorate, Louis Audet, in an interview.
Cogeco Cable thus stimulates its competitors, such as Bell, even though the branch of Cogeco has not yet a precise date in relation to this new platform.
"It is necessary to adapt and change or resist change and failure," said Mr. Audet.
The ultimate goal remains to provide tools that our customers do not currently have access to.
The Rogers Telecommunications giant has already indicated that it could offer Netflix if some technical details, which were not quoted, could be regulated.
In the United States, the popular video service says to be in discussions with some major cable distributors so that its service is available through their broadcasting platforms.
The father of Cogeco and Cogeco Cable also welcomed the announcement made by the Harper government during his talk on the Throne on 16 October.
Ottawa wants to force cable and satellite TV providers to offer customers the opportunity to pay for the services on the map.
"It has been almost two and a half years since we said that the idea of forcing consumers to buy important chains doesn't work," said Mr. Audet.
However, he hoped that the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council's consultations (CRTC) would lead to interesting recommendations.
"It will have to emerge from these discussions a kind of new reference framework to define our new Canadian cultural policy on television," said Cogeco's father.
The CRTC has been conducting consultations with the public since last week and should continue with the industry in the next spring.
On the side of the results, Cogeco indicated that it had recorded a net profit of 43.8 million in the fourth quarter, or 82¢ by action.
This is a rebate compared to the net profit of 44.9 million, or 83¢ by action, of the same period last year.
The company established in Montreal explains this decline by depreciation costs related to new acquisitions.
In 2012, Cogeco acquired the Atlantic Broadband cable distributor, established in the United States, for 1.36 billion.
This was the first major acquisition of the company after the failure in Portugal.
In December, the Montreal company also purchased Peer 1 Network Enterprises, an Internet provider established in Vancouver, for the amount of 526 million.
As for Cogeco's income, they had a growth of 41.5% in the fourth quarter to reach 504.7 million.
They are 1.8 billion for the current financial year.
The net benefit of its main subsidiary, Cogeco Cáble, was 43.9 million, or 90¢ per share, compared to 45.7 million, or 93¢ per share, from the same period last year.
Cogeco Cable's income, however, increased by 45 per cent to reach 470.4 million.
The company lost 15,237 customers during the fourth quarter.
However, for the financial year 2013, Cogeco Cable's number of customers increased by 5546.
Mr. Audet is not worried about seeing the number of clients fluctuating in the way.
For me, it's not the indication of a change in trend, he noticed.
It varies from quarter to quarter with a very lively competition.
Of horses in beef products
The horse meat was found in beef-based containers, sold by two small British low-price distribution teachers, today announced the food hygiene agency.
Routine tests revealed that the products, developed in January in Romania and sold by the Home Bargains and Quality Save channels, contained 1 to 5% of horse's DNA.
"As horse meat is not mentioned in the list of ingredients, it should not have been present in the product," the British agency explained.
A scandal on the presence of horse meat in cooked dishes broke out in Europe at the beginning of the year, following tests carried out in Ireland.
According to the European Commission's examinations, France has been the most affected country by the presence of such meat in products intended to contain only beef.
A collision between two vehicles caused four wounded, early Friday, on road 131, in Lanaudière.
Shortly before 4h, a motorist who was traveling north, in Saint-Félix-de-Valois, lost control of his vehicle and hit a car that arrived in the other direction.
The four occupants of the two vehicles were injured, but they were not afraid of their lives.
The movement was returned to normal at 6:00 p.m. on Friday.
Frontier Airlines plans to pay the luggage by hand
Frontier Airlines plans to pay up to $100 to passengers carrying luggage by hand on its flights.
Frontier Airlines plans to start making up to $100 for a hand luggage and $2 for a coffee or soda, although in its announcement Wednesday, it indicated that passengers could bring the unopened canteen with them down the plane.
The new hand luggage costs relate to the bags in the upper compartment, so the small bags installed under the seat will always be free.
Frontier said it would pay $25 if the charges were paid in advance and $100 if the passengers only paid once at the port of boarding.
Frontier's spokesman Kate O'Malley indicated that the $100 was planned to encourage travellers to pay the costs in advance.
"We don't want to pay this price," she explained.
Air carriers began to pay the first and second baggage registered in 2008.
Passengers who tried to avoid these costs put as much stuff as they could in hand luggage in the upper compartments, so there was often no more room in these compartments.
These charges are a means of ensuring that passengers carry fewer items on board.
O'Malley said that these new charges would not really serve to collect money.
This is to make it clear to Frontier's most faithful customers that it becomes increasingly difficult to find the place in the superior compartments.
Passengers who buy their ticket on the airline site will not have to pay.
Thus, a passenger who makes the queue at a port of Frontier boarding could carry a bag for free, while the next person in the queue might have to pay $100 for a similar bag.
O'Malley explained that Frontier's registration site and procedures are changing to ensure that passengers know the existence of these costs before they arrive at the door.
Frontier's baggage costs will not be applied before summer, although no date has been set.
Passengers often boast about baggage and other charges, but airlines love them.
They believe that baggage maintenance costs are important and that passengers who want this service should pay for them.
Many people at Wall Street consider adding baggage costs as a sign that airlines make enough money to cover the cost of the flight after years of loss.
However, many of them did not touch baggage costs.
Spirit Airlines Inc. had applied the first hand luggage charges three years ago, and the low-cost Allegiant company followed a little later.
The only other company imposing such costs is the Hungarian company Wizz Air, said the consultant to airline Jay Sorensen, who follows the additional costs.
He estimated, in a December 2011 report, that the cost of luggage by Spirit was $50 million a year.
Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines framework, recently travelled on Spirit and asked what he was going to find at the boarding door when passengers would discover the unusual baggage costs imposed by the company.
"I've never seen a shipping procedure so fluid in my entire professional career," he says.
I was expecting to see a toothbrush and a bagarque to explode at the door.
The plane was full, he added, "passengers are mounted at the speed of light".
Frontier also makes like Spirit and applies $2 for a coffee, tea, soda or fruit juice.
Frontier indicated that passengers who take a soda or fruit juice can bring the unopened canteen with them, and those who take coffee can be reserved for free.
It will always distribute water free of charge.
US Airways briefly tried to pay for the drinks in 2008 but returned seven months later after the passengers complained and no other large airline followed.
Frontier's decision to pay baggage costs by hand when passengers do not buy their ticket directly to the airline is his last effort to encourage customers to go to his site.
Air companies pay online travel sellers like Orbitz $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.
This has prompted all airlines to encourage passengers to buy directly from them instead of addressing an online travel agency.
However, Frontier went further in this area.
In September, she began offering only half a thousand loyalty to customers who bought their ticket via an online travel agency.
Wednesday, it reduced the premiums of thousands of 25 per cent on a trip.
Thus, a 1,000-mile border trip purchased from an online travel agency would make 250-mile.
It also allows passengers to choose their seat in advance only if they buy their ticket directly on the Frontier site.
Frontier has a loyal clientele in his home city, Denver, but his activity retreats and she loses money.
Income fell by 9% and its flight capacity decreased by almost 13% during the first quarter, according to the financial results published by its mother, Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
The Republic attempted to re-establish Frontier's finances by selling the airline.
The NSA introduces a "internal error" rather than computer pirates for its site panel
The National Security Agency working in the shadows said on Friday that it was a bug that had caused the panic of its public site for a few hours, not hackers like some of them claimed it online.
"NSA.gov has remained inaccessible for a few hours tonight due to an internal error that occurred during a planned update," said the spin-off agency in an e-mail statement.
The problem will be solved tonight.
The allegations that the panel was due to a widespread duty attack [DSD] are false.
Earlier this evening, online server trackers noted that the NSA site had been on board for at least 6 hours, and some users still cannot access the site.
Earlier, an NSA spokesperson told ABC News that the agency's sensitive internal network was "not entirely" compromise.
No classified information is in danger, explained the password.
At least one online group of activists claimed to be responsible for the NSA site panel by a DSD attack.
The DSD attacks aim to launch a targeted site until the servers are overloaded and the site collapses.
Cyber-touch is not very sophisticated and attacks are not intended to enter the internal network of the system.
The NSA has once been extremely secret, a time named "No Such Agency", found itself under the fire of the projectors and was strongly criticized in recent months following a wave of disclosures about its extensive national and foreign communications monitoring programs – which are part of the NSA's secret files stolen from the agency and disclosed by the former consultant dissatisfied by the NSA, Edward Snowden.
This growing controversy around the agency has caused many speculations that the incident this evening was the result of a targeted cyber operation.
Delta Centre-Ville is now closed
The Delta Centre-Ville hotel closed its doors on Thursday in Montreal, after 36 years of existence.
The investment fund that owned the building sold it to promoters who are going to turn it into student residences.
Three hundred and fifty people worked at the hotel.
Among them, 200 have not yet found a new job.
Delta promises not to let his employees fall.
Employers came to meet employees directly on site, employees were met individually to assess their needs.
"This support will continue for the next six months," explains the Regional Director of the Delta Hotel Work Relations, Félix Bisson.
Delta's closure takes place in a very competitive hotel market.
The investment fund that owned this building had choices to make.
So he reinvested in the building to continue operating it, so there were tens of millions of investments while the competition is very ferocious, there are many new hotels that have appeared in Montreal.
"Or he sold it to someone else and that's what happened," explains Paul Arsenault, owner of the Transat Tourism Chair at the UQAM Science School.
Other hotels in Montreal will also be converted in the coming months, such as the Crown Plaza, which will become a residence for older people.
In the meantime, four hotel projects totaling nearly 600 rooms will see the day of two years.
For Titan's PDG, "the Goodyear Amiens purchase project starts with zero employees"
After throwing the spray with failure in January for the partial resumption of the Goodyear of Amiens-Nord promised closure site, Maurice Taylor, the U.S. PDG Titan, declares today that it is ready to save 333 jobs on the 1,137 that the factory has.
Arnaud Montebourg, Minister of Production Recovery, had already announced it on Monday, 21 October.
After giving up the plant purchase project in January, you come back today.
You spoke of violent attacks and insults, speaking of "so-called workers", who "work three hours" a day, of "false" unions, targeting the CGT.
We don't understand this face.
Is it to please Mr. Montebourg?
I'm not trying to please anyone.
Except for my wife.
Mr. Montebourg is a charming young man who tries to save industrial jobs among the best paid.
If I hurt someone by my words, I'm sorry.
But France also has a high level of tax and unemployment.
Does the truth hurt you?
Working seven hours a day when working in other countries, eight hours are disabled in France.
In India, China and many other countries, ten to twelve hours a day work.
But I have no prejudice over France.
What I see is a plant that manufactures good agricultural tyres, has good equipment, is well located and has space to expand.
Why does Titan need this plant so much?
Titan doesn't need to buy this plant.
But with the right price and competent workers, it's worth trying.
What kind of agreement do you expect between the CGT and Goodyear?
If, since the announcement of the closure of the plant, Goodyear had offered the employees a good starting compensation, I think 100% of the employees would have accepted it.
Now, let's imagine that Titan buys Goodyear's closed factory.
At that time, Titan could move the machines to Poland or to any other country of the European Union that still has its own currency.
I think Mr. Montebourg knows that.
However, he wants to keep the Amiens plant with at least 333 well paid jobs.
Titan agrees to recruit them among some 1,200 current Goodyear employees.
So does Mr Montebourg need a Titan commitment before he tries to take the CGT to the table with Goodyear.
The first step is that the CGT and Goodyear set up an agreement on the starting allowances for all employees.
As a result, there will be no more employees in the factory.
Mr. Montebourg said that you were ready to guarantee these 333 jobs for four years.
Will you confirm it?
The only number I mentioned to the minister is 333.
I know he'd want a four-year guarantee.
But, as I told you, the CGT and Goodyear must first agree on the starting allowances.
If all employees accept them, the plant purchase project starts with zero employees.
How can we provide long-term employment guarantees when there are no more employees on the site?
If Mr. Montebourg finds that the CGT and Goodyear agree and that Titan buys the plant, we are well planning to stay in Amiens-Nord for more than four years.
The profits of Bombardier are low, while air delivery and command are down.
Bombardier Inc, a Canadian aeronautical and railway manufacturer, reported a 15 per cent drop in its net profit on Thursday, under pressure from lower command and delivery of aircraft during the third quarter and contractual problems in its Trains division.
Bombardier, based in Montreal, has no longer provided flight test data for his new CSeries aircraft or information to determine whether the aircraft will comply with its ambitious commercial service schedule before next September.
After the inaugural flight of the test plane about a month and a half ago, the pilot only flew three times, and then the question was asked whether the test phase was in the right direction.
The results were not at the level of the forecast and the course of the actions declined by 8% at the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at the National Financial Bank, reduced his rating on Thursday, from "surperformance" to "sector performance" due to the low potential of raising the scholarship during the next quarter or two quarters.
"Although the drop in air deliveries has been largely anticipated, we are really disappointed by the profit margin in the Transport Division," Cameron Doerksen said in a note to the customers.
We believe that Bombardier will record new commands for its CSeries aircraft as the flight test program will advance.
However, if no new order has been announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more skeptical about the programme.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries family will be able to catapult it in the lower segment of today's market dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was launched in March and was first flying in September after months of delay.
But the number of firm orders for CSeries planes is modest so far to the height of 177. It seems that potential buyers are waiting for the results of the flight tests to validate the company's claims regarding energy efficiency and the potential of the new airline's savings.
Currently, the company has recorded a total of 403 purchase orders and commitments from 15 customers and operators.
Pierre Beaudoin, president and head of the board, is convinced that Bombardier will achieve its goal of 300 firm commands before the first aircraft commercial service.
The leaders also reassured analysts and the media on Thursday, indicating that the program was progressing in accordance with the timetable.
"The test aircraft did not remain on the ground longer than planned," said Mr. Beaudoin at a telephone conference, adding that the ground tests and software updates were planned during the flight stop time.
Each manufacturer plans differently.
We decided to take the first flight and provide for an update period, and that is what we did.
This will take place throughout the flight program.
The second of the five pilots should fly in the coming weeks, the others will follow shortly thereafter, the company indicated.
However, analysts are skeptical that the first client can fly a CSerial only 12 months after his inaugural flight.
Bombardier indicated that she was evaluating the schedule of entry into service and will provide new information in the coming months.
"This slowing of flight tests – although it appears to be in line with Bombardier's internal calendar – strengthens our view that the entry into service will be re-established in the first quarter of 2015," said Doerksen.
In the third quarter closed on September 30, Bombardier's net profit fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per action, compared to $172 million, or 9 cents per action, one year earlier.
The result by adjusted action remained unchanged at 9 cents.
Income has slightly decreased from $4.2 to $4.1 billion.
Analysts expected 10 cents per action and $4.56 Md income, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The fourth aircraft manufacturer in the world indicated that he had delivered 45 planes during the quarter, compared to 57 a year earlier.
Net controls are hit by 26 planes, compared to 83 previously.
The delay in the Aeronaut Division was $32.9 billion as at 30 September, with an exchange rate compared to 31 December of the previous year.
“In Aeronautics, the results were consistent with our forecasts, but the low number of orders and the general market conditions were disappointing,” said Beaudoin.
Aeronautic revenues fell by 13 per cent to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world's largest railway manufacturer, said that income from this division had increased from nearly 11 per cent to $2.1 billion.
The transport division's order book totaled $32.6 billion to 30 September, a slight increase compared to 31 December of the previous year.
The margins of the Transport Division have suffered execution problems for some large contracts.
The leaders announced that new indications would be provided during the fourth quarter.
The course of Bombardier's actions, which also announced that Patrick Pichette, head of the financial management of Google Inc, would sit in the board of directors, dropped from 8.5% to $4.83 in the afternoon of Thursday.
The Brazilian company Embraer SA, the third aircraft manufacturer in the world and the closest to Bombardier, reported a 10% decline in its quarterly profit on Thursday.
Two 23 and 27-year-old theologians have been missing in a Düfre under the Dent de Crolles since Thursday night, we learned from the rescue Speléo of Isere on Friday.
They were located this Friday-after-midday.
The two men, one in practice and the other in no way, went underground on Thursday at 21:30 to perform a crossing of the Dent de Crolles, located in the municipality of Saint-Pierre-de-Chartreuse.
So we've been out of news since then, it's just the same source.
"Spelegologists should have been aware of around 5 o'clock in the morning," said Thierry Larribe, technical adviser to Speléo's relief organization.
Tens of persons on site
Twenty rescuers, ten French Speléo members, as well as gendarmes, CRS and firefighters were on the scene.
At the end of the afternoon this Friday, the two spies were located.
"It is another group of speculators who, after having found them exhausted but in good health in the cavitate, transmitted the information to one of the relief teams involved in the network," explains Le Dauphiné.
The two soldiers at the 13th Battalion of the Alpine Hunters of Chambéry were found "expulsioned but not injured".
They lost themselves in the network, returned on their steps while waiting for relief, specified the prefecture.
In fact, they should come out of the cave with the help of the rescuers in the evening.
German journalists invited to flee Google and Yahoo
The German journalists' union invited its adherents on Thursday to stop using Google and Yahoo's online services following new revelations on the activities of the United States and British information services.
"The German Federation of Journalists recommends journalists to avoid until a new order to use search engines and Google and Yahoo messages," she said in a communiqué.
It considers the information of Washington Post as scandalous, according to which the US National Security Agency (NSA) and the British Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) collected mass of information by infiltrating the international networks that allow both firms to synchronize their servers.
"The research carried out by journalists is as confidential as the coordinates of their sources and the nature of their communications with them," added Michael Konken, president of the union who claims 38,000 members.
Repeatedly: a Member requests the resignation of Brigitte Grouwels
The project by Minister Brigitte Grouwels of "relifting" the flagships in Brussels does not please everyone.
To remind us, the Brussels Minister for Public Works and Transport launched this Thursday at the centre of Brussels a test project consisting of reopening 16 light beams from the region to the yellow and blue colours of Brussels.
The aim is both "to increase security" and "Brussels identity".
Finally, the idea is to reopen all Brussels signal lights for an estimated cost of about EUR 1 million.
But the blue chosen by the minister is "too dark", according to Brussels Member Emmanuel De Bock, who speaks of "flaming" the capital and demands the "decision" of Brigitte Grouwels.
"It is not good to spend entirely the money of the Brusselsans in the lifting operations of the signaling poles to the colours of the Brussels region, Brigitte Grouwels continues his flanging operations of the Capital," said Mr. De Bock in a communiqué.
After her black-and-black taxis, she finally repeated herself in dark-blue yellow-and-black the Brussels bridges.
According to the honourable Member, there is now no "more difference in visual continuity between Flanders and Brussels".
The Brusselsers deserve better than to see their money spent by a CD&V minister who himself carries out the NVA program.
It's a long time to stop Troie de Flandre's horse.
"For the record, Brigitte Grouwels was only elected by 2 245 votes to 0.5% of the Brusselsese!" concludes Mr De Bock.
the Portique de Pont-de-Bus removed
The Portique Ecotaxe de Pont-de-Buis, which took place on Saturday a violent demonstration of opponents to this tax, was removed on Thursday morning.
Grapes arrived shortly after 10 a.m., and the movement on the national side was diverted into the crowd.
The decision of the dismantling, announced by the prefecture of the Finistère Wednesday, was taken by Ecomouv, port manager.
This is the last of the three ecotax ports to operate in the Finistère department, both of which have been dismantled or sabotaged.
Launching a accessories store for Google Glass
An online store, offering multiple Google Glass accessories, has just been made available to thousands of developers with a prototype of Google's connected lenses.
They can thus acquire an audience, a charger, or even an event.
This shop, strictly reserved for developers already with Google Glass, offers a few accessories such as a charger and its USB cable, for $50.
For the same price, it is also possible to acquire a microfibre-made protective house or an intra-auriculal listener.
Although Google is currently working on a Google Glass model equipped with correction glass, no large-scale marketing date has yet been confirmed.
Five years ago my father disappeared from the world of the living.
At the beginning of his death, I was talking about him right now,
I was so afraid to forget it, or I didn't know how I was going to continue to "frequently."
There is no recipe, no way of employment to pass the wall of the invisible and find his senses.
Then there were signs.
The first time this was the very strong feeling of his presence on the passing seat while I was driving.
Another time, a soft wake in the night to watch his watch that doesn't leave me, put on the night table.
It's the image of my smiling father who accompany me in my daily activities.
Our mother left us after her fight against cancer.
That's at least what I thought the day I found his empty body, stuck on this hospital bed to the frozen drapes.
Similarly, his funerals were a glacial adjure focused around the soft light of the candles that would fall into his circle.
I thought she was part of it.
Little by little day or night appearances, a little shy, a little deleted, she quickly came back into my mind, evolving in the fur and as she took her place in the landscape of my thought that was in mourning.
And then she showed up while revealing to me my own faces that I had not yet perceived, masked by my relationship with her.
So I learned and understood that I had never lost my mother's person but just a woman I didn't really know, a woman who incarnates that person during her stay in life.
By dying, this woman had perfected her life and freed the person I loved, and here I found her full and complete.
This distance from the path of my life remains the most unexpected and beautiful.
It's a privilege to know that loved ones never leave us.
I look like my father, "at the bottom like outside" he's gone.
I've always been told.
I never believed him at the time.
I've had difficult relations with him until he gets old, sick.
There, I was no longer afraid of him, and I could love him.
One day, he's dead.
For a long time, he accompanied me: when I stopped smoking, when I was scared, when I was sick...
He was talking to me, he was constantly encouraging me, he lived my body.
I saw his hands looking at mine, and I lent him my body.
But it was never indiscriminate.
I could have had a personal life.
He left me my privacy.
It took a long time and then one day he left.
Finally, it was comfortable and reassuring to be included, encouraged, advised.
I no longer know who said that the deceased are not forgotten but invisible.
My parents are not anymore, but I always feel close to me.
Every event, every moment of my life makes me feel their presence, because I always mean it: what would they have said? what would they have thought?
I keep dreaming about them, maybe not all night, but several times a week it's certain.
I often dream of the last moments that I have to share with them before it's too late, only there's always something that keeps me from fulfilling this moment.
I often wake up anxious when this happens to me and I feel deeply about their absence.
Sometimes some dreams lead me to the contrary and to my history and actually, they continue to live and share my life.
When I was about to know my baby's sex, I dreamed that I would wake up, get out of bed, my father was waiting for me on the floor, and he was smiling, and I was happy to wait for a little boy.
The next day, I had the feeling that he had visited me in my sleep to tell me that he shared with joy what had happened to me.
And of course, it was a little boy in my belly.
I loved sharing this moment with him, and I'm happy to tell you this shared memory after his death.
Just five years ago, my grandmother died of cancer.
A year ago, she was traveling with my family to Cuba.
That's the shock that his disappearance caused in the young bachelor I was at the time.
I've done everything I've done pretty quickly.
But she continues to influence my life, especially when I find myself in trouble, or when I have to make important decisions.
Learning Arabic and interested in the Middle East, at the point of making it a master in a large school, was not, with the decline, anodinous choices.
In fact, I often heard him speak Arabic in my childhood, and talk about Morocco, where she had lived for decades - before returning to France at the time of independence.
The values she has laid down for me are always present, so I can think about how she would like me to act at a given time.
The same goes for my attitudes: I try to be at the height of generosity and the rightness of the spirit of the one who was a believer.
Now, I feel it like a daily presence, a welcoming soul, a saving spirit.
I see her eyes staring at me.
My mother died 10 years ago now.
He died after talking to me on the phone.
I have gone through all stages: misunderstandings, anger, pain, tears that start alone, no matter where, in unusual places, unconventional moments.
Then, the time has come to abdicate the pain.
It's just the lack of it, the lack of answers, the need for it, to trust me, to reassure me at the cross of its sweetness.
Yet she's here, silent presence, she's here and she's looking at me.
Every morning, I see her eyes anxiously looking at me, I see the hearts that gloat over her eyes, the rhythms around the lips that grow cigarettes, the most that mark the front of the days of anxiety.
My mother took possession of my face and she looks at me every morning in my mirror.
And every morning, I turn my eyes away.
My wife and mother of my 3 children died of cancer at 43 years of age.
We always feel his protection, nothing serious can happen to us.
It was his promise on his bed of pain, so we had little to cry, and to pronounce his name is no longer taboo but a comfort.
Of course, I'm talking to her at night when the absence is too bad, she's invited to my dreams when morals are a little caught up.
We feel worn out and protected in difficult times, the waste of time makes us realize how much she was the head of the orchestra and we try to stay in the way she had led us.
If a person has loved you very much, the absence can not draw you from the heart and memories.
In a way, being loved becomes your inner energy.
I lost my father on August 22, 2008 from the suites of an amateur cancer.
I was very close to him, I always acted according to what he thought or what he liked.
I couldn't attend his inhumation, and three weeks after his death, I gave birth to a little boy.
If I sometimes have different beliefs than hers, I still wonder if my actions are consistent with her vision of things.
I have also had problems in my work for these beliefs.
For me, it's impossible to go in a different way, I don't sleep in it, and I always wonder what he'll think of it.
I don't know if I've adopted his way of being or if I'm just like him: is that genetic?
In any case, it will always be my reference.
It was a bit like an alter ego, there was no need to talk to each other.
In short, it's there every day.
I feel his presence, and that makes me happy.
It was soon 30 years old that my husband died at the age of 33.
I was 28 years old and our son was 6 years old.
The immense pain that then invaded me certainly slowed down, but it's always close to me.
Very often he "departs" in my dreams in such a precise way, so vivid that on awakening I am even more sad to find that it was only a dream.
The other night, he asked me if I was going well, I told him no, he answered me "I'm coming down" but with a voice so real that I woke up upstairs, anxious, and I lit the headlight looking everywhere, convinced that he was coming.
I live in the same house, and often, I feel watched and I come back to see if he's not there, I know it's him and I'm talking to him.
In all the parts I feel his presence and that makes me happy.
For nothing in the world I would leave this house where we were happy and his spirit lives with me.
I am 58 years old, I have always lived alone since I left, it is and will remain the love of my life.
I want to make it clear that I am social with a responsible profession, I laugh and I sing, I come out, I am a grandmother, I am full of friends, but my heart and soul belong to him and I never talk about him except with my son, and I never go to the cemetery.
Iraq: October has been the bloodiest month since 2008
October was in Iraq the most deadly month since April 2008.
Baghdad published official figures this Friday: 964 people lost their lives last month: 855 civilians, 65 policemen and 44 soldiers.
This publication shall take place on the day on which the Prime Minister of Iraq was received by the President of the United States.
Noury al-Maliki wants help from the United States.
"We do not tell the world to be on our side and to support us, we have the right to ask the world because we are part of it," Al-Maliki said on Thursday in Washington.
And also because if what is happening in Iraq is not regulated, it will spread, and what is happening in Syria will spread too.
And what happens when a live terrorist virus spreads?
Noury al-Maliki expressed himself at the United States Peace Institute, an independent institution created by Congress.
Outside the building, protesters protested against the Iraqi leader.
They were marketing banners to the accused, among other things, to be a murderer and calling on the United States to refuse to provide him with help.
The cocaine lawyer who informed a drug parent of a police investigation was imprisoned
Basharat Ditta, 42 years old, gave information to the Lord of Crime Neil Scarbrough
The lawyer was afraid that his secret addiction to drugs would not be revealed in the big day.
He was sentenced to three years in prison by Liverpool's trial.
A major defense lawyer, who had informed a drug sponsor of an important police investigation because he feared that his secret addiction to drugs would not be revealed, was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42 years old, gave sensitive information to the master of the crime Neil Scarbrough regarding investigations into his drug-related activities after being compromised due to his habit of consuming cocaine.
The lawyer, who was named "Bash" and considered by the criminals as a "first-rate case", was arrested at his home in 2011 following police hearings directed to Scarborough, which he had represented during a previous drug trafficking trial.
Police officers reported on Sarborough, 32 years old, depositing three bags of cocaine at the lawyer's home in Blackburn, in Lancashire, while he attended a Barreau dinner with sisters.
Investigations revealed that Ditta was a "regular consumer" of this class A drug after tests showed traces of cocaine in her hair, on her wallet and credit cards.
During an eight-month period between January and August 2011, he sought unlawfully information on the arrest of two men for Scarborough's account as well as one of his associates.
The four suspects were then monitored by the police in an important investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking taking place in the counties of Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
With 32 other men, they were subsequently imprisoned after the police seized heroin and cocaine for an amount of £1.5 million, and more than £200,000 in cash during a series of raids.
Ditta, 42 years old, provided information to the criminals because he feared that his drug addiction would not be revealed to the great day.
Today, at Liverpool's trial, Ditta, who works in the Forbes Enquiring counsel's office located in Blackburn, fell in disgrace after being found guilty of two charges against justice after a trial of three weeks.
He had accepted the possession of cocaine during a previous hearing.
The lawyer's drop occurred after the police, investigating Scarborough, discovered that he had been regularly in telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspect and picked him up at Ditta's home and placed the drug, which is 60 per cent, under the lawyer's cupboards in a black golf club.
Shortly after the deposit, Scarborough was regularly in contact with Ditta, who was at a dinner at the Ewood Park football stadium, a member of the Blackburn Rovers club.
The lawyer came back to him, discovered the drugs, and they called nine times.
The court heard that Ditta was a "regular consumer" of cocaine after tests showed traces of this class A drug in her hair, on her wallet and credit cards.
Ditta was arrested later but refused to consume cocaine. He stated that he had spoken to the drug trafficker suspected because it was his client and claimed that their discussions were subject to a "legal privilege".
During his arrest, Ditta picked up his wallet and tried to remove several credit cards, but they were all seized and a sample of hair was taken.
In an interrogation, he stated that he had an office at his home, as well as at his place of work, and that customers would call him at his home for legal matters.
But the court heard evidence that he called major actors in the drug trade, some of which he had represented, after key arrests to tell them which investigators were aware of.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said, "If anyone should know that he doesn't have to violate the law, he's a criminalist lawyer."
Mr. Ditta was accused of abuse of his position as a criminal lawyer, and of being too involved with particular clients.
The relationship we are talking about is not just a drug dealer, but a drug dealer providing drugs to his own lawyer.
Some of his communications will undoubtedly be legitimate communications because he was his lawyer.
But this went well beyond the normal limits of a relationship between a lawyer and his client.
He obstructed the police investigation as much as he could to enable him to continue his criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta did not honor his profession, but dishonored him.
He was too close to some customers, especially Scarborough, and he let himself be compromised by independence.
Ditta refused any illegal action and said, "If I was a corrupt lawyer, what I am not, and if I wanted to provide information to Mr. Scarborough, I would not have waited 15 hours, I would have done it immediately."
But after the hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead of the Lancashire Police said, "Mr. Ditta has been a criminal lawyer himself since he began to seek drugs from criminal organizations."
Its addiction to cocaine has never been compromised and has made it vulnerable to the back-up of members of organized criminal groups who have been responsible for obtaining valuable information on police investigations.
Lawyers should observe the strictest rules of integrity and establish a climate of trust with the public.
Mr. Ditta betrayed this trust and tried to get behind his profession's paint.
The Lancashire grave and organized crime unit investigated Mr. Ditta, who had been found guilty of the three cocaine-accused leaders and now is in violation of justice, testifying to his commitment to prosecute the criminals.
That this case serves as a warning to criminals so they know that no one is above the law.
We'll find you and bring you to the courts.
Scarborough himself has been imprisoned for 14 years after committing a criminal offence of trafficking in heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty-five other persons involved in trafficking were sentenced to a total of 153 years in prison for drug trafficking.
On his site, Ditta organized a question/response session on herself during which he said his dream job would be a lawyer to represent clients in the death row in America, his last invitation to dinner would be Mohammed Ali and inequality would motivate him to work.
Aretha Franklin will be on stage in December
Detroit News reports that the queen of the soul will take place on December 21 at the Sound Board room at the Hotel MotorCity Casino.
Ms. Franklin dealt with recording an album for Clive Davis and Sony Music in November, produced by Don Was and Kenny "Babyface" Edmonds.
Without specifying the disease she suffered, the famous respected interpreter had said to the media on 16 October that the secondary effects of treatment she received were "hard".
She claims to be "happy to be back."
Menton reduces the cost of his Christmas lighting
420 motifs, 2,2 kilometres of sea-side covered with a light cap: we could break the heat blow in Menton with the lighting bill.
An invoice that, contrary to many commons, is also regulated by taxpayers, not by associations of traders.
In order to alleviate its costs, the city resorted to aid.
But also a different management of the public lighting network and Christmas decorations.
Los Angeles airport evacuated after a shooting
A shooting took place at Los Angeles International Airport.
It was 10:00 a.m. in the morning when a man opened the fire.
According to local police, there would have been at least 2 injuries.
This would be an employee working for the United States Transport Safety Authority (TSA) and the author of the firefights.
The incident would occur in terminal 3, causing a panic wave.
Travelers and staff went to the exits or on the tarmac.
The police were soon involved and a man suspected of being the shooter was caught on the roof of an airport parking lot.
The airport is being evacuated and air traffic is interrupted.
From classical song for teenagers
Every time, it is the school client that will be targeted, an initiative that had been very successful during the previous season.
Through five Sayettes imagined and interpreted by artists in the region, vineyards with a high dose of humor, adolescents are allowed to take advantage of the classical song.
In addition to this show, the lyrical Art Society of the Kingdom will return with its lyrical Destinations, a formula that now completes the Pulperie de Chikutimi.
Two other concerts will take place in summer 2014, which gives artists in the region the opportunity to demonstrate what they are capable of.
The lyrical Apero was added to these activities, the award concert held in August, with the soprano color competition Marie-Éve Munger.
It was a beneficial activity, parallel to the artistic dimension, and it helped the non-profit organization to produce a financial balance that is as soft to the ears as an air of the Chauveau-Souris.
Without providing specific figures, the chairman of the board, Yves Bergeron, took advantage of the press meeting held yesterday in Chikutimi, to prove himself reassuring.
Despite the caution that is the lot of so many cultural institutions, the future is well drawn, even in the long term.
We have stronger and more constant support.
"The finances are fleeting and we hope to last until the 50th anniversary of the opera, a step we will take in seven years," the administrator commented.
"I would say even further," added the Director General, Hélène Gaudreault, smiling.
The 37-year-old man who took a child hostage at the Gabrielle Roy school in Surrey faced six accused heads, according to the Royal Canadian Gendarmerie.
Omar Moustapha Hassan has been accused of taking hostage, kidnapping, threatening, carrying weapons in a dangerous destination, kidnapping, and failing to comply with an order.
"The rapid reactions of the police officers involved and their ability to disarm the situation immediately were essential to the safe conclusion of this incident," said Corporal Bert Packet via communication.
Omar Hassan is still in detention and will have to appear in court on Friday.
New application for collective appeal against the Sainte-Croix brothers
A new application for collective redress was filed against the Sainte-Croix brothers regarding sexual assaults that would take place this time in St. Joseph's speech as well as in several orchestras, colleges and schools.
The application is based on the complainant's testimony, identified as "J. J", which would have been masturbed in the 1950s, first in Notre-Dame-des-Neiges by his professor, Brother Sumis, then by his confessor, Father Bernard, in the speech of Saint-Joseph, where he was serving as a minister and where his father worked as a painter.
The first appeal was aimed only at three institutions, and when the regulation was announced, many people said to us, "I, I was in such a place, can I sign up?" says lawyer Alain Arsenault, who defends victims in both appeals.
The collective appeal that has just been filed is in particular to allow for the addition of complainants to any institution where abuses could have been committed by members of the Saint-Croix Congregation.
At present, the appeal brings together the complaints of 25 people who claim to have been assaulted by the Sainte-Croix brothers.
The alleged facts are generally older than those mentioned in the first appeal, as several of the institutions concerned closed their doors in the 1960s.
The appeal also underscores that the Saint-Croix Congregation and St. Joseph's Speech, which is a distinct entity, "have allowed sexual abuses against children to be committed", that they have "executed moral, religious and psychological constraints on victims", that they have been "currently aware of the sexual abuses committed and yet have been stupefied", and that they have "chosenly and conscientiously chosen to ignore the problem".
These recent accusations are based, among other things, on letters written by Sainte-Croix's lawyer, Me Emile Perrin, in the 1990s, but also on the research carried out in the archives on this subject by Brother Wilson Kennedy, a former Sainte-Croix brother who publicly denounced the abuses.
The collective appeal must first pass the stage of admissibility in the Supreme Court.
Once the admissibility granted by the Court is accepted, the second stage is taken, namely the substantive hearings.
In the case of the first appeal, the congregation of Saint-Croix had agreed to settle with the friendly before hearings were held on the ground.
Important fires in a trade
A fire seriously damaged a trade in the LaSale district in Montreal on Thursday to Friday night.
The reliefs were called about 1:00 a.m. on Friday, because of a fire that had been declared underground from an Indian kitchen restaurant on the Dollard Avenue, near the intersection with Réjane Street.
Thirty firefighters who were sent to the places spent almost an hour controlling the brewery.
The fire "caused significant damage to the structure of the building", said the Chief of the Fire Safety Service operations in Montreal, Richard Bordeaux.
The cause of the fire was unknown, but there was no one at the restaurant when the firemen arrived at the scene.
There were no injuries, but almost twenty dwellings, located on the first and second floors of this range of commercial premises, had to be evacuated.
The Red Cross was requested, as residents of one of the apartments might have to be temporarily accommodated, the SIM indicated.
Many opposition to medical assistance to death at the Congress of Palliative Care
The Canadian Congress of Palliative Care, which takes place this week in Ottawa, occurs a few days after the vote in favour of the Bill on Medical Assistance to Die in Quebec.
It is an opportunity for several palliative care associations to reaffirm their disagreement.
If all the sick had access to effective care to soothe their suffering, in addition to being able to stay at home, very few of them would want to end their days, according to a spokesperson of the Canadian Palliative Care Association, Maryse Bouvette.
If the focus was on palliative care in Canada, the approach of euthanasia would become minimal.
The President of the Quebec Palliative Care Network also rejects the bill on medical assistance to die.
If adopted, Alberte Déry is concerned about the consequences of future generations.
"What is the meaning of life," she laments.
Most palliative care houses will refuse to help patients die, according to the Vice-President of the Palliative Care Alliance, Suzanne Fitzback.
Ms. Fitzback, as well as the Director of the House Mathieu-Froment-Savowie in Gatineau, believes that the service would be useless in any way.
We're never asked, "I want to die, give me an injection."
The Director of the Ontario Palliative Care Association, Rick Firth, believes that the Quebec Bill dissipates the population about the vocation of palliative care.
He doesn't think Ontario's gonna push the move.
On the other hand, the Liberal Member of Gatineau, Stéphanie Vallée, said that the concept of the end of life should be clarified before the bill was adopted.
The Kenyan press insists on the controversial media law
"It is a defamatory country and it is legitimate to ask the following question: will Parliament prevent the independence of the judicial system tomorrow?" said the newspaper in contesting the bill and asking for it to be declared unconstitutional.
"This law is draconian and very punitive, and we reject it," said Cyrus Kamau, Director General of Capital Group, owner of CapitalFM, one of the most respected independent news stations and Internet sites in Kenya.
He stated that the new media tribunal "will always be partial because it is an extension of the government" and that restrictions on content and advertising would harm Kenya's place in the world economy.
"I hope the President will listen to us, and we ask him to reject this bill and send it back to the MPs," he added.
According to The Star, the new bill will allow the government to have "hand over the media". The Standard, as to him, indicated that democracy and freedom of opinion in Kenya had "suddenly suffered" and the bill had suffocated the "draconian".
The adoption of the bill takes place at the same time as a train of measures to strengthen national security in the siege of the attack by armed Islamists in the Westgate shopping centre last September.
The Kenyan media aroused the anger of the authorities by spreading images of video surveillance cameras on which the troops deployed on the attack scene were operating in the luxury shopping center.
The chief of police, David Kimaiyo, responded by summoning two journalists and a media officer to question them, although the summons was withdrawn as a result of an increase in loopholes in the media.
Under the new bill, the media may be subject to amendments reaching up to 20 million shillings keniens and journalists up to 1 million with the additional risk of being "radiated" or no longer being able to receive official press accreditation.
The court also has the power to seize the property of an offender if he has not paid his fine.
According to the Daily Nation, “even one fine is enough to paralyze most FM stations. ”
He also said that the measures could have a devastating effect on what he described as Kenya's "animal blogosphere".
By reducing the media to silence, political men know that they can do what they want to do without impunity.
"No one will ever know," wrote Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist at The Nation, describing the media as a key source of control in public life.
"In books themselves, political men would put the country into bankruptcy and bring us back to hunting and shooting."
The laws of Kenya have been the target of the anger of the people in the past.
In May, they took a stand against the cuts ordered by the National Commission on Salaries and restored their Mirobollant Salaries of approximately 532,000 shillings per month exempt from tax – which are among the highest in the world.
A year of difficulty for pharmacists
The departure of nearly 10 pharmacists to the Health and Social Services Centre (CSSS) in Laval has caused a great deal of excitement at the direction of the Hospital de la Cité-la-Santé, which was in 2012-2013.
Due to multiple retirement, maternity leave or short-term leave, the pharmaceutical department was very poorly staffed.
Almost 30% of the required staff were missing, making this financial year "very difficult", according to the head of the department, Gillian Beaudet.
However, the CSSS decided not to engage in independent work, which can cost up to three times as much as a full-time pharmacist.
We didn't use the lockdown, Mrs. Beaudet explained.
Some of our activities within the institution have been rationalized or reduced, while things are changing.
Of course, we have worked hard to interest our young [pharmacians] so that they come and stay here.
There is a competition of circumstances that caused us to be in a bad situation last year.
Improved situation
After this severe period, the year 2013-2014 is much easier for the pharmacy department of the CSSS.
Already, three pharmacists have returned to work after their maternity leave and three other pharmacists have been employed in the last few months.
In addition, the Department's efforts to retain fruit have been successful, as the four students are currently resident in Laval also decided to remain in the use of the CSSS.
Now, it's going a lot better, highlighted the pharmacy.
By the end of the financial year, we will have seven new pharmacists and three maternity returns.
So this will end our departures last year.
As ever-growing business
However, the situation remains delicate.
Several factors, such as the shortage of hospital pharmacists or a predominance of young women in the workplace, make situations such as the one in 2012 difficult to predict.
For us [the number of officers] is always important, because we have a young environment and many young women are employed, so with pregnancy, we are almost always on three maternity leave when it goes well, she added.
Last year, we had a lot more and there are no pharmaceuticals available to make replacements, so it was more difficult.
The 22-year-old top model doesn't start his career in cinema by the small door.
The director Lars von Trier chose to incarnate Charlotte Gainsbourg young in Nymphomaniac, her next film.
This pornographic drama, in eight chapters that will come out in two parts (January 1 and 8, 2014), is the erotic memories of a quadrantian who has been an increase in sex since her adolescence.
Stacy Martin's look like his old man is striking: a toaster silhouette, a diaphane tent and Franco-English origins.
Without forgetting a certain taste of the risk: the one who had not hesitated to put a nuisance on the ice paper will appear in much more sulphurous situations on the large screen.
An extract from Nymphomaniac has caused the temperature to rise on the Table: Stacy Martin appears in bed and full of exacerbation with Shia LaBeouf.
If the provocative filmmaker has asked his actors to put their powder on the plate, he has used X professionals for the sexiest scenes before mixing all the bodies numerically: above the belt, it is the star; below, the double.
From Björk to Charlotte Gainsbourg, passing through Nicole Kidman, Lars von Trier is used to pushing his actresses into their last resurgences, always for the best.
Stacy Martin hasn't finished talking about her.
A Narbonne CGR room evacuated Thursday night
On Thursday night, the first session of a film was interrupted at the Mega CGR of Narbonne, by a precautionary measure, following picturing at the gorge felt by the spectators.
Immediately, the director of the facility had the room evacuated and prevented firefighters for a suspicious smell.
About 70 persons left the meeting.
People have been examined and full recognition of the room has not given anything.
Bad pleasure on the bottom of lacrymogene jets?
Or an involuntary incident?
The film management has always played the precautionary principle and the security of its clients in the background.
The room was aired and everything came in order.
The cinema has been able to resume its rights and customers find pleasure in images.
On screen only.
It tries to import 2 kg of cocaine into lemons
Benefiting from Halloween Day, a woman tried to get two kilos of cocaine dissipated into the country in Montréal-Trudeau airport on Thursday morning.
It was during the passenger baggage check that the drug was detected.
The cocaine had been distributed into three lemons that had been previously seen.
The drug was then transported to Canada's Royal Gendarmerie Office (GRC) which took the lead in this investigation.
The Canada Border Services Agency (ASFC) did not reveal where the woman arrived when she was intercepted.
This is part of the investigation, said Jacqueline Roby, CBSA spokesperson.
What I can tell you is that she was coming to the country.
Since the beginning of 2013, border officials at Montreal-Trudeau Airport have carried out 173 drug seizures, including 10 cocaine seizures for a total of 44 kilograms.
In 2012, border service officers in the Quebec region carried out a total of 1653 seizures of narcotics.
Air raid against military installations in Syria
According to the Lebanese army, Israeli planes entered Lebanese airspace Wednesday at the beginning of the afternoon, but the strikes took place in the evening.
A short-range SA-8 ground-air missile cargo would have been targeted and destroyed.
This new raid on Tsahal's aviation in Syrian territory (the sixth since the beginning of the year, according to Israeli daily Haaretz) has not been confirmed by Israel or Syria.
The raid took place in circumstances close to the one that had taken place on July 5th: at that time it was also an anonymous U.S. officer who had confirmed to CNN an Israeli attack, aimed at this time at the self-mar Yakhont missiles delivered by Russia to Damascus.
Israeli officials had not concealed their irritation from seeing Washington reveal the attack, at the risk of forcing President Assad to react.
Ukraine is approaching bankruptcy
The Standard & Poor's rating agency has reduced Ukraine's solvency note on Friday, questioning the capacity of the former Soviet republic, in recession for more than a year, to meet its financial obligations.
The country's public debt notes go to "B-", focusing on the category of speculative investments.
It has a negative perspective, S&P seeing at least one chance of three that it is again reduced by one year.
"It is less and less likely that the government's strategy will ensure sufficient foreign currency to meet its high external funding needs," the US agency explained.
The Agency notes that Ukraine's exchange reserves fell by 26% between September 2012 and September 2013 and expects the trend to continue.
This complicates the reimbursement of foreign loans.
These reserves, to which the authorities have used massively to support the local currency, hryvnia, by sinking, the agency is increasingly considering an evaluation, which would lead to the loss of its external debt.
Kiev also needs liquidity to settle its gas imports to Russia, which is charged with not paying an invoice of $882 million.
This announcement is a bad news for the Ukrainian power in a period of living tensions with its Russian neighbour, angry with Kiev's willingness to sign an association agreement with the EU at the end of November.
It was made public on the following day of the publication of official statistics showing that the country's economy had entered into its fifth quarter between July and September following the contract.
In the past few years, it has still been relatively modest, and S&P estimated it to be 33.5% of GDP, compared to less than 10% before the 2008-2009 crisis.
The country, in budgetary deficit, has been calling for the assistance of the International Monetary Fund, which had been granted to it in 2010 for $15.3 billion, and has now only $3.4 billion.
However, the Fund refuses to pay any new instalment until the country has adopted unpopular reforms to reduce its deficit, including by increasing gas prices to the population.
As a result of a new unfavourable mission in the country, the IMF found this week that "the important external financing needs" constituted "vulnerability", as well as "significance of economic improvement".
However, for economist Oleksandr Joloud, from the Centre for Political Studies, "no short-term improvement can be expected".
"There is little hope that unpopular reforms will be launched in a pre-election year," the presidential elections are scheduled in 2015, according to the expert, interviewed by the AFP.
The only hope is to improve the international economy.
S&P also refers to the "insecurity" related to the possible signing of an association agreement between Ukraine and the EU, which Brussels is conditional on the release of opposition Ioulia Timochenko.
"Signing the agreement would be positive for long-term trade, but there could be negative consequences in short and medium-term terms related to Russia's reaction," S&P explained, which fears the "commercial restrictions" on Moscow.
Russia, which represents the fourth of Ukrainian exports, has predicted that in the event of the creation of a free trade zone between the EU and Kiev, it should strengthen its border controls on imported goods.
United States Green Fire at the Publicis-Omnicom merger
Publicis and Omnicom said Friday that they had not received any objection from the US authorities to their merger, thus drawing on the creation of the first world advertising agency.
The merger actually approaches the second world agency, Omnicom, and the third, Publicis.
"Omnicom Group and Advertising Group today announced the expiry of the review period of the merger previously announced by Publicis Group and Omnicom, as foreseen by the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended," announces both groups in a communiqué.
They state that they have also received the necessary authorizations in Canada, India and Turkey, after South Africa and South Korea.
The expiry of the review period provided for by the HRR in the United States and the authorisation decisions issued in the other jurisdictions will meet many of the conditions for carrying out the operation.
"The merger is also conditional on the acquisition of other regulatory authorisations and the approval of shareholders of the two groups," they add.
The Congolese Army persecutes the M23 rebels
The Congolese Army (FARDC) announced Thursday that its units were going to chase the rebels of the M23 into their bases in the forests and mountains of the North Kivu border of Rwanda and Uganda.
The M23 appears on the point of being beaten after being hunted out of the northernmost parts of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) that he had been in control of the insurrection since the beginning, 20 months ago.
"We will pursue the M23 and welcome it wherever it hides because it is criminals," Colonel Olivier Hamuli, spokesperson for FARDC, told Reuters.
We must not let them reorganize because they have martyred the Congolese people for too long.
The time has come to restore peace.
M23 officials explained that they had evacuated the localities under diplomatic pressure, and Bertrand Bissimwa, the political leader of the rebellion, said on RFI that these military appeals would not alter his claims to peace talks in any way.
The latter, according to Ugandan mediators, took place in Kampala on Wednesday between the Kinshasa government and M23.
Crowds are reported in the hills that dominate Bunagana, the last locality in the hands of the insurgents to fall this week, as well as around Runyoni, a hill where the rebellion of the M23 was seen today in 2012.
In November, the insurgents occupied Goma, the head of the province of North Kivu, benefiting from the escape of the government garnish and the passivity of the blue shells of Monusco.
The fall of Goma has led the United Nations Mission to RDC, the world's most important in terms of personnel, to strengthen its mandate and to form a rapid intervention brigade composed of South African, Malawian and Tanzanian soldiers.
On the other hand, the FARDC's status has been remanded and the army has turned to the offensive against the M23, changing the course of war.
The pace of progress of government forces today is unprecedented.
"The M23 seems to reach its end," predicts a Congolese business expert, Jason Stearns, on his blog Congo Siasa.
This would be historical - it would be the first time Kinshasa’s government managed to overcome a major insurrection.
And it would also be the first time since 1996 that no armed group affiliated to Rwanda would be present in the east of the DRC.
United Nations experts have accused Rwanda of refusing to provide military support to M23, which is the departure of the former Congolese military.
The head of the British diplomacy, William Hague, invited the Rwandan President Paul Kagame to prove his detention, announced a spokesman for the Foreign Office.
Last week, Kigali had referred to the possibility of military reprisals as a result of shells falling within Rwandan territory.
Wednesday, the inhabitants of Bunagana invaded the streets of the castle to greet the entry of the FARDC soldiers.
"We lived with the M23 for a year and it seemed unimaginable to be a day released by the army," one of the inhabitants of this border town of Uganda witnessed.
"We lived in terror (from M23), we were traumatized," he added.
The tests conducted by the Pasteur Institute on a patient suspected of being infected with coronavirus have proved negative, the Ministry of Health announced.
He states that "the two cases identified in May 2013 therefore remain the only two cases confirmed in France to date".
Tuesday, this 43-year-old patient had been suspected of being caught, after returning from Saudi Arabia, a country where the disease has already killed fifty.
Chevron, the second US oil company, reported a decline in its quarterly profit due to the decline in its refining margins, while its production of oil and gas increased still in decline compared to the group's objectives.
Its net profit for the third quarter decreased to $4.95 billion, or $2.57 per action, compared to $5.25 billion, or $2.69 per action, a year ago.
The analysts interviewed by Reuters averaged $2.71 on an action benefit.
The group produced 2.59 million barrels of oil equivalents per day during the quarter, up from 2.52 million bpj produced a year earlier.
The company aims at 2.55 million bpj for this year, with a 25% increase in production expected by 2017.
Most of the growth in the coming years will come from its liquefied natural gas projects in Australia.
As a result of the cost of these projects, annual investment expenditures have increased by $7 billion in two years and should amount to $36.7 billion in 2013.
Profits from production activities decreased slightly to the third quarter, while the profits of down-turn activities (including refining and chemical production) dropped from 45 per cent to $380 million.
This drop in refinery margins affects the whole sector.
As a result, Chevron's main competitor, Exxon Mobil made Thursday a net down profit, despite the increase in its production of gas and oil.
School transport: judgmentable complaint
The Sherbrooke Regional School Commission (CSRS) has been demanding from the beginning of the school year the cost of $150 per student (up to a maximum of $300 per family) for students who are receiving school transport at two residences, a service provided by the organization when it is able to do so.
Before the last budget changes, no financial contribution was required.
"There is a mediation service that is proposed by the committee and I was interested," she explains.
According to it, the CRS was invited to mediation and requested an additional time to reflect on it.
"It's always better to talk about it, work together and find solutions," says Mrs. Lefèvre.
The Sherbrooke School Committee (CSRS) did not want to comment.
The organization only meant that mediation was part of the process during a complaint.
Imbroglio around the closure of the Urgency of the Hotel-Gode
Faced with a number of months of staff and a number of trade unions, including CGT, Health Minister Marisol Touraine, decided on 10 July to "cut down the project implementation schedule, and in particular the date of the closure of emergencies that will not occur on 4 November".
An official application was made "to avoid any risk of emergency in Paris at the beginning of winter" but also aimed at not generating the PS campaign for a few months from the municipalities.
In spite of the ministerial mandates, the closure should still be effective at that date.
Even though the APHP prefers to use the term "transformation" or "change in continuity".
As of 4 November, firefighters who would provide about a quarter of the 40,000 annual crossings at the Hôtel-God emergency will have all received to ensure that 30 serious cases are taken daily to the emergency of other Paris hospitals.
This date of 4 November also corresponds to the renewal of the premises.
At the Hotel-Gode, the interns in emergency will be held on Monday to five interns of general medicine.
With regard to the transfer of internal medical beds, it is programmed for the current month.
"The hotel-God emergency reception service must close as soon as possible, and for us, it is November 4th," says Loïc Capron, president of the APHP Medical Committee, who supports the draft direction.
"On 4 November, there will be no more patients brought by firefighters, only people coming by their own means," confirms Professor Jean-Yves Fagon, the medical officer of the new Hotel-Gode.
"But we will continue to welcome patients in an emergency," he said, claiming the permanent presence of SMUR vehicles on site to transfer serious cases.
Senior emergency doctors will remain in place, he will also make sure.
But it is for the ARS to decide on the closure of the emergency reception service.
"The things are going on progressively," says Nicolas Péju, spokesperson of the ARS for whom, on November 4, "there will be no change in terms of service made."
"The minister lied to us or we lied to him," laments emergency doctor Gerald Kierzek.
Leaving its position as head of SMUR early July to have led the front against the reorganization project, it is defined as a "warning launcher" against a "cynic" decision made by "the medical-administrative technology".
"They are emptying and asphyxiating the emergencies that were renewed less than five years ago," he says.
For him, "if the other Paris emergency services could absorb the surplus, there would be no problem."
But they're being used to it all the time.
For example, there are sometimes nine hours of waiting for Lariboisière's emergency.
At the ARS, it is argued that thirty "dispatched" patients on several sites are not at risk of representing a "valanche" in other emergency services, whose human resources will also be strengthened.
In the ARS as in the APHP, the "new hospital model" has already been on the way since 7 October and should continue to welcome 30,000 to 35,000 patients per year.
By the end of the year, liberal generalist physicians should also be involved in the establishment of an "abundant care".
"Where do we go if we ask people to self-diagnosis," Gerald Kierzek asks why "the concept of non-serious urgency" is "dangerous" and marks a "medical regression".
This will happen as for grade 3 maternity.
People aren't crazy, they're going where there's the best care offer.
If the Minister does not take action this Monday, we will change our arm, Christophe Prudhomme, an emergency physician and a member of the Health CGT.
We will be even more present in the municipal campaign and we will consider presenting a list.
In the Nathalie Koscisko-Morizet team, Vincent Roger, Paris's UMP adviser and elected to the 4th roundabout, clearly announces that "even though the Parisian UMP was for the maintenance of the emergencies at the Hotel-God, it would be technically and financially impossible to recover them if they were to return to the responsibilities".
Anne Hidalgo, the PS candidate, once again recalled on Monday morning on France Inter that she had voted in favour of a moratorium so that there was no closure on 4 November.
If that were the case, she would mark her net disagreement, says Bruno Juliard, her spokesperson.
Although the restructuring of the Hotel-God has its legitimacy on the ground, we cannot accept it without an acceptable return schedule to the other hospitals.
Obama stops listening to the IMF and the World Bank
Barack Obama ordered the National Security Agency (NSA) to stop listening to the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank as part of its information activities, a U.S. official said on Thursday.
This decision is part of the White House's attempt to resume its hand in the matter of NSA hearings after the revelations made by former analyst Edward Snowden, a refugee in Russia.
This is the first time the monitoring of the IMF and the World Bank has been mentioned by the information agency since the start of the scandal.
Questioned on this issue, one U.S. government official replied: "The United States does not conduct electronic surveillance aimed at the headquarters of the World Bank and the IMF in Washington."
Expressing itself under the seal of the anonymity, the person responsible did not specify whether such supervision had been established by the past.
Another official told him that Barack Obama had ordered these practices to be discontinued over the past weeks.
This instruction was given at almost the same time as that at the end of the United Nations headquarters in New York.
In this context, the Senate Information Commission approved a strengthening of controls on government monitoring programmes on Thursday, but allowed them to continue.
The Commission has introduced new restrictions on the data authorized by the information agencies to collect and has imposed a five-year limit for the preservation of that information.
The United Nations welcomes the new goals for the fight against poverty
The United Nations will now work on a new set of goals to replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which had been established 12 years ago to combat poverty in the world.
Australian diplomats played a key role in the development of the "sustainable development goals" to replace the MDGs, which will expire in 2015, before the United Nations Summit on Sustainable Development, which began in Rio de Janeiro.
They were in the final draft document, which will be adopted by world leaders, including Ms. Gillard, during the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said that he was now “overcoming national interests”.
"I am pleased that the Member States have agreed to launch and adapt to the process to set universal sustainable development goals (DDGs)," he added.
These ODS will build on the progress made in the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will do my utmost to fulfil the mandate given to me by the Member States to achieve our vision of sustainable development goals based on the success of the MDGs.
Security-related concern in Mozambique is growing at the same time as conflicts between powerful personalities
At the feet of the statue of Samora Machel, the founding president of Mozambique, while tossing them, thousands of people gathered in the center of Maputo to scan peaceful slogans during a rare public demonstration.
"We want peace to come back; we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, director-general of an investment company.
Concerned about the future of her country, she exchanged her work clothes against a tea-shirt with the word "we want security" in Portuguese before joining the crowded crowd on the site of the Independence of Thursday capital.
For two weeks, there have been almost every day of reports of conflicts between government forces and Renamo, the worst violations since the peace agreement signed over 20 years ago.
In the past, Renamo was a famous rebel movement, supported at the outset by the white Rhodésia, then the South African apartheid government in its efforts to destabilize the country's independent government.
After a peace agreement signed in 1992, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe that the country should not fall into an open conflict, but recent events have shaken foreign investors and the local population.
The issue is considerable for the economy in full growth as the discovery of huge offshore gas reserves and carbon leakages in the north-west could attract more than $50 billion of investments in the coming years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale du Brazil, Eni d'Italia and Anadarko of the United States.
Frelimo, the power party and the main political force since 1975, and Renamo reject each other's responsibility for tensions.
Renamo states that the government is the origin of the recent confrontations and that it launched an attack on its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional base of Renamo on 17 October.
The attacks on the former rebels were degenerate when the government forces attacked the bases of the Renamo and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the leader of the group, and Fernando Mazanga, the spokesperson of the Renamo, according to the Financial Times.
The Government has made Renamo responsible for triggering the conflicts, and the charge of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza sought to minimize the concerns about instability.
Mr. Guebuza said to the AFP on Wednesday, the French press agency, that Mr. Dhlakama was considered a "lost" who wanted to use "all the forces left to him to try to prove that he could impose his decisions on the government".
Frelimo and Renamo insist that they both want to avoid war.
But concern grew after Mr. Mazanga declared that Renamo had abandoned the 1992 peace agreement.
He told the FT that he meant that the agreement was no longer respected by Frelimo.
"We want to resume negotiations, but with the greatest seriousness," said Mr. Mazanga.
The previous discussions between the parties failed to alleviate the tensions fueled by a series of conflicts this year.
"These are two great men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who don't stop arguing," explained Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer at the open and specialist university in Mozambique.
None of them know how to negotiate and none of them are ready to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, who is in favour of electoral reforms, had already said that she would boycott the municipal elections to be held in November.
Presidential and legislative elections are scheduled next year.
Some commentators interpreted its use of force as the attempt of a sick movement to obtain concessions and a war treasure on the part of the government.
The share of the supplies collected by Renamo has continued to decline since 1992, while a new party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM), which was created by a former member of Renamo, is expected to receive a greater number of electoral supplies.
Mr. Mazanga said that Mr. Guebuza – who should withdraw at the end of his second term next year – wanted to destroy democracy in the country.
"He does not want a multi-party democracy, he does not want transparent elections, he does not want peace because he does not want to leave the presidency," Mr Mazanga said.
We do not know exactly what the capacity of Renamo is, but it has carried out disturbing attacks on police stations and vehicles on a major north-south motorway axis.
Most of the excavations took place in the province of Sofala, which is located several hundred kilometres north of Maputo, but where Beira is located, the port from which mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, export coal.
In June, Rio could no longer use the railway for about a week after Renamo threatened to attack the railway line.
Mr. Mazanga was falsely shy when he was asked if Renamo would repeat that threat.
Renamo wanted to "warn the international community that things were going wrong in Mozambique," said Mr. Mazanga.
The instability has strengthened the frustrations of the government, says Fernando Lima, director of Mediacoop, an independent media company, and many people are also concerned about corruption, slow development and the recent wave of kidnappings.
"People think that the country's future leaders are the government and the president, and that it is up to them to find solutions to the problems," he explained.
Omar Sultuane, a protestor, said that people only wanted stability.
"No one cares about Renamo or Frelimo, they just want to find peace, they want free access to the roads," he added.
Myths and legends should be taught to children as "life-style models," says the author.
The Legend of Thor could show that "the brutal force doesn't make the weight against subtle Russians," while the legendary Arthuris reveal the importance of having a dream.
In saying that many myths would be "very violent, very scandalous and in some cases, too obscenient to be taught at school", Crossley-Holland recommended a "minute selection" of works adapted to age.
"I find it amazing that in America, myths and folklore are already part of education," he said.
I've been complaining about this project for 20 years.
He added that the fact that the authors and teachers are “openly educational” makes the children“ completely disassembly, ” the messages being “sublime” in pleasant stories.
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon and wrote The Penguin Book of Norse Myths and British Folk Tales, said: "You may have good intentions, but you prefer to keep them out of sight."
Perhaps the great difference between an adult author who writes for adults and an adult author who writes for children is the need to offer hope.
Not that everything must be simplified or ended well, but there is an innate sense of good and evil.
And it must be subdued; revealed through a story rather than declared.
The known basis of what we show and not what we say.
A fighter of the Hamas army was killed this night and another wounded by an Israeli car shot in the Gaza Strip, learned from medical and security sources in Gaza.
According to these sources, these activists carried out a surveillance operation in the border area between the Palestinian territory and Israel when they shot an Israeli blind.
NSA espionage: the United States is "going too far", Kerry admits.
The United States has sometimes gone "too far" in the matter of espionage, acknowledged the Secretary of State John Kerry, in this first Duke of Washington in controversy with Europe on the massive collection of data by the National Security Agency (NSA).
After ten days of scandal, revelations and slander between the United States and their European allies, it is the first time that an American government official explicitly admits the practices disputed in the interception by NSA of communications and data in Europe.
"In some cases, I commend you, as the President has said, some of these actions have gone too far and we will make sure that this is no longer happening in the future," John Kerry said at a conference in London that he has been participating since Thursday, October 31, by video link.
In his retransmitted speech, in the presence of British counterpart William Hague, the head of the U.S. diplomacy has long justified the information and information practices by means of the necessary counter-terrorism and the prevention of possible attacks.
Invoking the attacks of 11 September 2001, the attacks of Madrid in March 2004 and those of London in July 2005, John Kerry assured the US authorities that many attacks had been committed since the launch of many projects, thanks to the interception of communications and the collection of information.
"We have actually prevented airplanes from falling, buildings from exploding and people being killed, because we were able to be aware of these projects," said the American diplomat.
And John Kerry said to the Europeans, "I assure you that in this process, innocent people have not been misled."
But we are trying to collect information.
"And yes, in some cases, it went too far in an inappropriate way," admitted the Secretary of State, who had already expressed himself on this international scandal during a tour last week in Paris, London and Rome.
He assured Thursday night that President Obama was "resolved to try to clarify and that he was conducting a review of these practices so that no one would feel cheated".
But the controversy between Americans and Europeans continued to spread this week with new revelations in the press.
According to Washington Post, the NSA intercepted hundreds of millions of Google and Yahoo users.
The newspaper, which cites documents obtained from the former NSA consultant Edward Snowden, states that the "MUSCULAR" program, and conducted with the British counterpart of the NSA, the GCHQ, allows these two agencies to recover data from the optical fibers used by Internet giants.
To believe one of the documents, some 181 million items had been collected during the only month of January - with metadata on e-mails, text elements or audio or video documents.
These interceptions would take place outside the United States.
But Yahoo and Google have denied any connection to these practices.
For ten days, several major newspapers in France, Germany, Spain or Italy have revealed that the NSA would have had massively intercepted data and communications from allies of the United States and their leaders, including German chancellor Angela Merkel.
Faced with the anger of European states and while leaks in the U.S. press claimed that the U.S. President was not aware of such rumors, Barack Obama refused to express himself in this regard, calling for national security.
On the other hand, the master of the powerful NSA, General Keith Alexander, accused him of having captured tens of millions of communications from European citizens.
He even sent the ball back to European intelligence services that would take hold of these communications before providing them to NSA.
This would be "military operations" in countries where these NATO allies cooperate with the United States and that would not be the case for Europe at all, General Alexander said.
And the controversy extended to Asia on Friday.
Indonesia has convened the Ambassador of Australia, whose mission is accused of being used by the Americans as part of a vast international spying network that has also set up the island of China.
The Paris Saint-Germain will receive Lorient on Friday without his master's duty, the Swedish Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who is injured, announces the League 1 club in a communiqué.
The PSG, leader of the championship in front of Monaco, has published the list of players held for this 12th day match, without including the 32-year-old attacker.
The communiqué simply indicates that he is "injured", without specifying the nature of the injury.
However, he suffered a left knee inflammation at the time of his selection return, at the beginning of months.
A commemorative ceremony of crematized deaths
At 11 a.m., the Crematorium of Father Lachase organizes a lay ceremony, in memory of all the dead cremated in his establishment during the year.
Anne Hidalgo, a socialist candidate at the Paris mayor's office, must attend, and then explain at a press conference his funeral proposals.
To follow the ceremony, click on it.
For their own obese, more and more French choose cremation rather than inhumation: 53%, according to an Ipsos study conducted on September 6 and 7, 1009 people, instead of 47%.
For the obsects of a close, this is the reverse: the French prefer inhumation (53% versus 47%).
If they have the trouble of losing a child, they're only 15% to choose the cremation.
In his book La Mort en cendres, Damien Le Guay, philosopher and vice-president of the National Funeral Ethics Committee, stressed the "violence" that constitutes cremation for survivors.
There is, with cremation, "a violence committed to the beloved body", which will be "reduced to a heap of ashes" in very little time, and not after a decomposition process, which would "be accompanied by the phases of grief".
There is also "a symbolic violence", which holds to the "effectuality of singularity and distinctive signs" reduced to the "anonymate" of ashes.
Why is what is widely accepted in some Nordic and Protestant countries still poorly lived in France?
"Because cremation is a new fact," answered Marie-Frédérice Bacqué, president of the Society of Zoatology and author of the book Approve death.
It has only been tolerated since 1963 by the Catholic Church, which has limited its attempts to adjudicate it.
It is for François Michaud-Nérard, Director General of the Funeral Services of the City of Paris, to arrange for the deceased a ceremony as worthy as the one he would be entitled to with an inhumation.
The annual survey of Ipsos shows a strong commitment to the organization of the ceremony.
77% of French people want one, for their neighbors, to be religious (53%), or civil (24%).
Now, 73% of the people who have chosen a cremation want to organize a ceremony.
66% of atheists or unbelievers want it too.
Crematoriums have adapted to this evolution of society.
"For ten years, they have been trying to avoid the violence of waiting for families, without doing anything, for an hour and a half, immediately following the lifting of the ashes," observes Michaud-Nérard.
70% of the institutions now propose ceremonies, which are taking place in the presence of the body at the following ritual: to welcome the assembly, to name the deceased, to associate it with others, to evoke it, to give meaning to its death, to organize the adjournment.
This has been the case with Father Leachae's crematorium since 1998.
Ceremony masters are often people who have converted.
There are also former Catholic priests.
In this context, since 2010, La Toussaint's day has been organized by Father Lachase's crematorium, a number of commemorative, secular and non-religious ceremonies, to which he invites the families of the people who have been cremated in the year.
For the second consecutive year, one of these ceremonies is retransmitted in line, with the attention of those who could not move.
The crematorium has allowed us to relax.
A The Seyne, Relogation for Rats Turns to Polyemic
Early in the week, a family left their apartment on the ground floor of the Fructador D2 building due to the presence of rats.
In view of the urgency of the situation, the director of the South Habitat Land Office proposed, exceptionally and provisionally, to relog the couple and their three children in a new T4.
However, the family refuses "for financial reasons" and the situation is blocked.
The case took excessive proportions, according to Joël Canapa, the director of the office.
Rats, there's always been in the cities.
The deratization company takes two steps per year, and in addition, we intervene, at our own expense, at every request of the inhabitants.
We have thus carried out 64 interventions since the end of the last winter.
The neighborhood is not left behind, and rats do not pulverize in the city.
For reasons of protection of the environment and public health, deratization products are four times less effective than in the past, certainly, but for two rats, a cat will not be killed.
"We did not invite rats to our home," defends the father of the family who left his home to settle in the hotel.
We are soon out of breath and expect a new home, at the same rate as the old one.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange is down by 0.88%, News
The Tokyo Stock Exchange ended on Friday in spite of good Chinese manufacturing statistics.
The quota suffered from the withdrawal of the dollar from the yen, detrimental to the export values and the warning of its annual result launched by Sony Thursday.
The Nikkei index lost 126.37 points (0.88%) to 14 201.57 and the Topix gave 11.23 points (0.94%) to 1 183.03.
Sony dropped from over 11% to 1 668 yen.
A house for the fires in the Old Quebec
A fire that broke out on Friday afternoon in the old Quebec was quickly controlled.
More than thirty firefighters were sent to the 9th of Hebert Street.
Flames were declared in a house of three houses divided on four floors behind the Québec Seminary.
All the tenants were missing during the fire.
The fire was controlled one hour after the arrival of the firefighters, who were many to intervene.
As soon as our first firefighters arrived, they really saw the apparent smoke.
"Then the alarms happened, because it took the strength to attack the building, because it is buildings that are attached here," explained France Loiselle, spokesperson of the firefighters in Quebec.
An investigation is under way to find the cause of this fire.
Ben Greenman : Tenth Anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival : The New Yorker
The city of New York could be said to be the place where the stand-up was born in America: almost 100 years ago, the actor of the vaudeville Frank Fay, who held the role of ceremony master at the Palace Theatre, on Broadway, began to tell lies directly to the public, on the tone of the conversation.
Fay's innovation continued over the years, until it was recently resumed by the New York Comedy Festival.
Created and supervised by Caroline Hirsch, founder of the Carolina stand-up club, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year, with more than 60 shows presented in small clubs and large theatres.
"Most of the posters came out to Carolinas, and they were very successful, until they became too famous to play in a club," Hirsch said.
We created this festival in order to be able to continue working with them.
This year's event will see the participation of Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher and the presentation of "Stand Up for Heroes", a comedy and music evening for the benefit of former combatants, organized at Madison Square Garden, to which Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby will be present.
The festival has taken its place, just like the world of comedy.
Several comedians participating in this year's festival have passed through non-traditional circuits, featuring, for example, small television shows, such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll made his appearance on the front of the scene in a sitcom on a wired chain ("The League" on the theme of fantasy football cheerfully lascif of the FXX chain) and now has his own show of sketches on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate participated in the "Saturday Night Live" show and was part of the casting of the series " Parks and Recreation", but she is still more known for her series of viral videos "Marcel the Shell with Shoes On".
Kroll and Slate, as well as other young comedians in the single voice (the surrealist pessimist Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic defender of racial justice W. Kamau Bell), are pure products from the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the main attractions of the festival this year will be an interview: David Steinberg discussing with Larry David.
Steinberg started as a stand-up comedian, but he became a film and television director, as well as an official comedy historian.
Between 2005 and 2007, he launched a broadcast on TV Land called "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg".
The meeting took place at the Hotel de Ville, in downtown Manhattan.
"The city is definitely in the comic DNA of all Larry's work," Steinberg said.
He told me that, when he was here, sometimes he went down a street between two buildings and said, "Well, if I lose all my money, maybe I'll come live here."
The price of oil continues to decline and closes to $96 the barrel
The price of oil continued to decline on Friday, while the concerns about the importance of stocks were commensurate with a report showing that the Chinese manufacturing industry was growing in electricity.
The US gross delivery reference price in December fell from $14 to $96.24 at the end of the morning in Europe during electronic exchange on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX).
The contract lost 39 cents on Thursday, leaving it with a 5.8% decrease for the month of October.
The abundant supply of crude oil has weighed on the price over the last few weeks.
The U.S. Department of Energy reported on Wednesday that US supplies had increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over five weeks, supplies increased by more than 25 million barrels.
But two reports on the Chinese manufacturing sector arrived on Friday, which showed growth in activity, suggested an increase in demand.
This suggests that China's economic recovery could continue to be strengthened after growth has increased to 7.8% in the third quarter, after a decline that had not been known for two decades in the previous quarter.
The Brent gross, a reference to the international gross already used by the American refineries, lost 26 cents to $108.58 the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) barrel in London.
Issue of the right to abortion in Texas
A Federal Court of Appeal restored to Texas certain restrictions on the right to voluntary abortion that had been blocked by a court of first instance this week.
This judgment means that a law adopted in July in that State and that the right to abortion is widely challenged will enter into force.
The judgment of the Court of Appeal means that doctors who will practice IVG should have a "admission privilege" at local hospitals.
The privilege of admission is the right of a doctor, under his membership status, to admit a patient to a hospital or a medical centre in order to deliver a diagnosis or treatment.
IVG's defenders claim that the content of the law is likely to result in an immediate closure of a third of the state's clinics because these clinics have failed to obtain this "admission privilege" for their practitioners.
In total, it would be almost 22,000 women who would be deprived of access to these institutions.
On Monday, a court judge had taken the view that the provisions dealing with the right of admission were anti-constitutional at the time of the entry into force of the law.
But the Attorney General of Texas, Republican Greg Abbott, who is in charge of the Governor's position, asked the court to cancel the court's first ruling that blocked the application of the law.
A plenary hearing on this issue is scheduled for January.
The New Star has managed a return to force, on the part of the audience, with 1.3 million TV viewers behind their television station, or 5.6% of the audience.
But the show was on your way?
Some 10,000 candidates came to the hearings of this 10th season, to face the jury: Maurane, the wicked Sinclair, the Percy André Manoukian and Olivier Bas.
On Twitter, viewers shared their comments.
After the excitement of finding their favorite program, many were disappointed.
But why so much disappointment?
No candidate seems to have really scored at this first prize.
As in each year, the first hearing shows offer a wide selection of herb singers, for the best and sometimes for the worst.
Or, on Twitter, we want the show, the emotion, the originality, the music...
Fortunately, a few found their account.
They are many to have tried the New Star, and sometimes even to be gone to the end.
Behind television screens, successful singer vocations are always here, season after season.
Others just have the ambition to laugh.
The Court blocks a decision on NYPD's control and search policy
A federal appeal court blocked Thursday's decision of a judge demanding changes in the New York Police Department's control and search program and demanded it from the file.
The U.S. Court of Appeal (second circuit) indicated that Judge Shira Scheindlin's decision was suspended until the end of the city's appeal.
The judge had ruled in August that the city had violated the Constitution following the implementation of its programme to monitor and interrogate citizens.
The city appealed to its conclusions and correctional orders, including a decision to assign a controller to assist the police department in changing its policy and training program associated with it.
The Court of Appeal heard the arguments on the application for suspension on Tuesday.
The Court of Appeal stated that the judge had to be sued of the case because it violated the code of conduct of the judges by compromising the need for a judge to avoid any appearance of partiality, in part because of a series of objections to the media and public statements in which it responded publicly to the criticisms of the court.
The judge had ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by targeting black and Hispanic men as part of their control and search program.
She appointed an external controller to monitor changes, including policy reform, training and oversight, and ordered the establishment of a pilot program to test cameras on the body in areas where the largest number of controls are taking place.
In August, the city of New York agreed to put an end to the practice of preserving the names and addresses of persons whose case is rejected after a police check.
The hearing of the call by the city should take place after 14 March 2014.
The tactics of control and search were criticized by many civil rights defenders.
This control and search system has existed for decades in some form, but the number of controls recorded has increased dramatically under the administration of the independent mayor Michael Bloomberg, to reach its highest historical level in 2011 with 684 330 controls mainly concerning black men and Hispanic origin.
A judicial action was introduced in 2004 by four men, all from minorities, and became a collective action.
Participants proposing changes in the NYPD's control and search program say that they will put an end to unfair practices, allow for more effective police forces and confidence, and will be able to change how police departments use policy.
The opponents say that these changes would undermine police morale without reducing crime, represent a waste of money and do not solve the wider problem of pressured police forces after police officers have been severely reduced in the last decade.
The judge pointed out that it did not put an end to the practices of control and search, which were constitutional, but that it reformed the way NYPD implemented its controls.
The tenants must go to vote, because each of them pays an average of $100 per month on the price of the accommodation that goes in taxes in the City.
When the owner pays $5,000 in municipal taxes, he divides this amount between each apartment.
We are forced to increase rents to help us pay the new taxes.
By voting, we send a clear message.
We need to make things change in the City.
All the candidates told us that they would attack scandalous debt.
We no longer have the means to pay for fireworks at $100,000, land of $4 to $5 million for the case where...
Go vote, that's the best way to express yourself and say it's enough.
End of service for the chef of the Elysée
Entering the 500 m2 of the elysean cuisine as committed after working in embassies, the cook took all the steps to become a chef, nine years ago.
He served six French presidents from Georges Pompidou to François Hollande by passing through Nicolas Sarkozy, including on their holiday places, and fed an incalculable number of greats in this world in a nearly anonymous one that he only breaks today, at the time of retirement, at 60 years.
The man with the open face, skull degarni and intellectual glasses, born on 24 October 1953 in Ferté-Saint-Aubin, is the holder of a CAP of pastry.
His mother was herself a cook in a castle in Sologne.
"I have passed from castle to castle!", irony Bernard Vaussion, who knows not only the hands of the six presidents for whom he has served, but also of their wives and some of their illustrative guests.
"It's always the head of the state or his partner or wife who chooses the menus," he recalls.
"Miss Chirac was a little more involved, she came directly into the kitchen," as she had forbidden women in the kitchens of Elysée!
It does not move to state leaders who showed relative indifference to earthly food, "they are all gourmets," politely protested Bernard Vaussion.
Jacques Chirac had some "a little more developed appetite."
But with Nicolas Sarkozy, who had removed the cheese, the seats returned empty!
As for François Hollande, who restored cheese, "there's someone who likes to eat" and "there's no big deal he doesn't like".
The current head of the state, who has recovered the pounds lost before the presidential campaign, has "no specific regime application".
Bernard Vaussion also remembers the pressure that weighed on his shoulders, especially during the state dinners at Elysée: it should serve "between 200 and 250 people in about an hour".
The previous night is almost white.
These people wouldn't understand that there were errors.
The former chef of Elysée's cuisine, who took a glass Tuesday night with his team, his family and friends, shared with a painting in the heart."François Hollande came to greet me."
He said compliments.
"His human side is risen," he says.
The boss will be replaced by his assistant, Guillaume Gomez, 35 years old, who has been for his part since he was seventeen years old at Elysée.
Fire in a house built in 1850 in Quebec
A historic house built in 1850 was the flame scene in the Vieux-Québec on Friday afternoon.
The four-storey building, located on the 15th of Hebert Street, was subjected to three fire alarms.
The fire went on ahead, but it rose on the three floors of the building.
France Voiselle, spokesperson for the Québec Fire Protection Service, pointed out that the rapid intervention of firefighters has prevented the spread of fires to adjacent buildings, a large challenge for this sector of the city where buildings are built in close proximity.
The fire house opened four apartments, but no tenant was in the places at the time of the fire.
The damage has been limited, even if the water has caused damage.
An investigation will be carried out to determine its origin, but the wise men have failed the thesis of a criminal act.
The Wall Street Loop: Out of the Second Trailer
Martin Scorsese lets out some images of his next film whose title role, that of an ambitious New Yorkian broker, is incarnate by Leonardo DiCaprio.
Forget to be reasonable and get your tickets out.
Leonardo DiCaprio is going to decouple you in his role as a trade agent.
Martin Scorsese tells us the true story of a "seller in Long Island Exchange, who refuses to cooperate with the authorities in the context of a large corruption case in Wall Street".
In the 1980s, Jordan Belfort went up to a river that would make him a rich, very rich man.
The opportunity to follow his incredible rise, but also the vertigo fall that will follow.
Without a limit, man robs the parties, the women, the drugs.
Decadenness and excess in all kinds are the master words of this crazy story.
The Scorsese-DiCaprio couple seems to have found the magic that had joined them in Shutter Island.
The release of the new Scorsese took too long due to its installation.
It would seem that the film lasts at 2:45 a.m.
In the room on 25 December, he will be able to participate in the course of justice in the oscars.
Coulson used phone piracy to check a tube
The former editor-in-chief of News of the World Andy Coulson would have used "telephonic piracy, surveillance and confrontation" to try to confirm a twin tube on a link involving the Minister of the Interior then operating, Charles Clarke.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC stated before the court of Old Bailey that News of the World had heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with Hannah Pawlby, her "beautiful special adviser".
It was reported to the court that the newspaper commissioned Glenn Mulcaire, a private detective, to hack Pawlby's voice box and to "plant permanently in front of his door", but Coulson also called him and left him with voice messages.
"The charge suggests that Mr. Coulson, who is now the editor in charge of NotW, is not the kind of man to stay in front of the people's house while waiting to surprise them, is the kind of man to love to present the story to people to see what they say," said Mr. Edis.
He stated that NotW used three means to investigate topics: telephone piracy, surveillance and confrontation.
The editor in charge is personally involved in the third.
It is obvious that he is aware of the second, surveillance, it cannot be otherwise.
But what about the first one?
Did he know about phone piracy?
He claims otherwise, but we say, “Of course I do. ”
The rumors on an implicit connection Clarke was first repeated by the NotW editorship office when a source, experiencing a sexual attraction to Ms. Pawlby, said that she had been told: "Don't waste your time with her, she's with Charles."
A band, on which voice messages were recorded hacked on its phone at least three times, was seized at the home of Mulcaire in August 2006.
The investigators also found arrests on the private detective's computer concerning Ms. Pawlby and her sister listed in a "Projects" file.
During the period when the detective investigated her, Ms. Pawlby's grandparents received anonymous calls asking for information about her, Mr. Edis added.
Meanwhile, the former chief Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup supervised the monitoring of Ms. Pawlby's minor actions and actions.
In a voice message he left on June 18, 2005, Coulson said: "I have a story that we plan to publish tomorrow which I would really like to talk to Charles."
Mr. Edis explained that Coulson's involvement in history followed the same pattern as with other important men, such as former Interior Minister David Blancett.
The jury heard Thursday that Coulson had confronted Mr. Blancett about a relationship with a married woman while he himself attended the co-defender Rebecca Brooks, who was also married at that time.
Coulson and Brooks did not talk to anyone else to hack phones between 3 October 2000 and 9 August 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup admitted to having committed telephone piracy.
Barack Obama receives Iraqi Prime Minister, full of violence
The U.S. President was to receive Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki on Friday, 1 November 2013, in search of United States aid to fight the strongest wave of violence for five years.
In October, Iraq experienced its most deadly month in five and a half years, according to figures published on Friday 1 November by the Iraqi authorities.
964 people died in the violence in October, 855 civilians, 65 policemen and 44 soldiers, and 1,600 people were injured.
The United Nations provides an even higher balance sheet with 979 deaths and 1,902 injuries.
These violences have been increasing in spite of increased security measures and major military operations launched by the government of Nouri Al Maliki, dominated by Shiite.
The total number of deaths in October was highest since April 2008, when 1,073 people had been killed.
Approximately two years after the withdrawal of American troops, the level of violence made a new impression on the marriage while Syria is in the process of a civil war.
Bombs hit markets, mosques, marriages and funerals.
Men were beaten in the streets or even in their homes, and security forces were also the target of frequent attacks.
The growing discontent of the Sunni minority, under Saddam Hussein, who complains of being marginalized politically and of being the target of unjust arrests, has promoted this flame of violence.
On Friday, new violence killed four people in northern Iraq, at least 26 persons died in a series of attacks, including the explosion of five cars trapped in northern Baghdad.
Much of the violence was attributed to the Islamic State in Iraq and Levant (EIL), a group affiliated to Al-Qaida (sunist extremists), also involved in the civil war in Syria.
Nouri Al Maliki wants a "world war" against Al-Qaida.
The violence is at the centre of the United States interviews with Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki, who will be received on Friday by President Barack Obama, two years after their previous meeting, on December 12, 2011.
At the time, the American President, elected on the promise to end the military commitment in that country, had set up an optimistic picture of the situation.
Since his arrival in Washington on Wednesday, Nouri Al Maliki has multiplied the meetings with the executive, and the election of Congress.
On Thursday, he appealed for the international community to wage a “third world war” against Al-Qaida.
The principle of increased security assistance to Iraq is supported by republican and democratic senators.
But the latter also criticised Nouri Al Maliki, a Shiite, for giving him partial responsibility for the resumption of violence through his "sectoral and authoritarian policy".
They also demanded from Barack Obama that he understand in Nouri Al Maliki that "the pernicious influence of Iran within the Iraqi government is a serious problem in our bilateral relationship".
Beijing accuses a Uighur group of the Tiananmen attack
The Chinese Home Security Chief accused a group of Xinjiang segrets on Friday to be behind the attack on the captured car that killed five people in the place Tiananmen in the center of Beijing on Monday.
The vehicle, a SUV, was buried on the popular location of the Chinese capital, a symbol of the deadly repression carried out in 1989, and took fire killing its three passengers and two passersby.
Meng Jianzhu, a member of the Political Office for Internal Security, accused the Islamic movement of East Turkey of being the founder of this attack.
Many ears, a Turkish-speaking minority located in Xinjiang, call this Chinese province the eastern Turkestan.
For the Chinese Government, this movement is responsible for the frequent outbreaks of violence that are being committed by independent claims.
"The violent terrorist incident that occurred in Beijing was organised and pre-empted," Meng said at the Hong Kong-Phoenix TV channel.
"The group that was on the march was the Islamic movement of eastern Turkey," he added, his speech being repeated by the new Chinese agency.
The Chinese police identified the driver of the vehicle whose name suggests that he was of the origin of the car and pointed out that his wife and mother were in the car with him.
The latter also contained essential containers and a flag with Orthodox religious inscriptions.
The incident has caused 42 injuries.
The Islamic movement of East Turkey is considered a terrorist organization by the United States and the United Nations.
The Vatican polls on contraception, divorce and homosexuality
The Vatican has undertaken a major survey throughout the world on how parishes manage sensitive cases such as contraception, divorce, and married couples of the same sex.
The survey asks participants how priests deal with gay couples and their children, and how they treat men and women who live together without being united by marriage.
The survey was sent in mid-October to each national conference of bishops, with the aim of getting as many answers as possible.
The information will serve as an important gathering on the family that Pope François intends to organize next year.
The news was reported Thursday by the National Catholic Reporter, an independent Catholic journal of the United States.
A spokesperson for the Conference of the Catholic Bishops of the United States confirmed that the document was authentic and that each bishop would decide in an appropriate manner to investigate the Parisians.
In the United Kingdom, bishops published an Internet survey asking Catholics to participate.
RDC: The Army Attacks the Last Feast of the rebels
Irreducibles of the M23, a few hundred combatants, were reduced to nearly 2000 metres above the agricultural hills of Chanzu, Runyonii and Mbuzi, near Bunagana and Jomba, two locations approximately 80 km north of Goma, the capital of the province of North Kivu.
"It hasn't stopped since this morning, the fights continue despite the night," said an AFP resident of Jomba, connected by phone at 12:30 p.m., and said that a girl was injured by a ball in the morning.
"The intensity of the clashes has decreased somewhat," he added, "it seems that the FARDC Armed Forces of the DRC have a little repressed the rebels."
According to this witness who wished to remain anonymous, the soldiers had "passed the night" in Jomba before going up to the front for a "rescue operation".
It was very clearly heard behind him of the food of small arms.
From Bunagana, political fief and the last strong place of the rebellion fell on Wednesday, an AFP journalist could hear heavy weapons detonation.
According to a source to the United Nations Mission for the Stabilisation of the DRC, the fights have entered "in a final phase", the FARDCs having "closed the positions of the residual M23 to disband them".
Since the resumption, Friday, of the clashes between the 23 March Movement (M23) and the army, Monusco has not been directly involved in the fights, but it provides the government troops with strong support for information, observation and planning.
At the end of the afternoon, several dozen soldiers, well equipped in ammunition, mounted in the direction of the front line.
They were armed with kalachnikov and rocket launchers.
A little earlier, on the road leading to Bunagana, borderline with Uganda, civilian-aid soldiers were carrying a multiple rocket launcher mounted on a new FARDC fire truck, to ensure that another machine was used to lift the M23 positions on the hills.
The Congolese President, Joseph Kabila, called again on the rebels on Wednesday night to "demobilise voluntarily" without being disarmed "by force", but left the Kampala process open, where Kinshasa and M23 have been discussing since December without a result for the moment.
On the spot, M23 political leaders were hoping to reach an agreement.
"We have finished the talks, there is no longer any more than the Ugandan mediation to organize the signature," said Roger Lumbala, vice-president of the delegation of M23, without any confirmation of this information immediately on the government side.
M23 was born of a mutiny in April 2012 of former rebels, mainly Tutsi, integrated into the army in 2009 after a peace agreement.
The United Nations and Kinshasa regularly accuse Uganda and Rwanda of supporting M23, which reject Kigali and Kampala.
North Kivu is one of the most densely populated regions of the DRC, and its sub-area is dedicated to mineral resources.
In Bunagana, on the Ugandan side of the border, where some 5,000 people had been refugees between Monday and Wednesday, according to the United Nations, the return movement to the DRC that had been closed in the morning turned into the middle of the day.
"This morning we went back to our fields, but the soldiers told us to return," told the AFP Imelda Nyirankusi, surrounded by her nine children, including a baby on her back.
It is felt that firefights are approaching people.
Early in the evening, dozens of residents crossed the border, some with a mattress on their heads, to spend the night in Uganda.
The musical comedy, this stage beast
Classics, sophisticated, popular, English or French, song and dance productions take over.
After Broadway and London, Paris finally finds its vote.
It is a revolution: the musical to French affirms itself as a sort of success.
Long time, from Notre-Dame de Paris to Mozart the opera rock, most of the attempts would take place in the ridicule.
And the successful ones like Cabaret or the Mistresses wore the mystery eagle.
The arrival of Jean-Luc Choplin in Chatelet and Stage Entertainment in Mogador changed the woman.
Today, these two scenes maintain the titles as successful tubes.
The first one, this Christmas, is excellent My Fair Lady and announces the following world creation of "An American in Paris".
In Mogador, "The Beauty and the Beast" could well be one of the success of the season.
On the other scenes, musical shows such as "1789", "Bastil's lovers" and little musical comedies such as "Disco" or "Life and Times" take on the range of success and quality.
Patrick Niedo, author of the reference book "History of musical comedy" and lecture at the Theatre of Chattel, analyzes the reasons for success so hard.
How do French musical comedies evolve?
The offer has doubled.
There are first of all the "musical performances" that evolve in favor of producers...
Some use beautiful image projections and a real history as in 1789, the Lovers of the Bastille.
Others make a 15-year-old back bond under the pretext that we can serve almost anything when we have Matt Pokora in the head of the show.
After that, we have the musical comedies with the suspicious productions of the Chattelet that bring us back to Broadway's golden age and discover the universe of Stephen Sondheim, the largest living composer.
Entertainment stage popularizes English-Saxon musical comedies of variety by adapting them in French.
The independent French producers are trying to achieve a breakthrough.
But current projects such as "Rent", "The Baiser of Araigned Women" or "The Awakening of Spring" are bad to be financed.
Do we have enough capable artists like Broadway singer, play and dance?
In Paris, when there are eight musical shows in a season, it's a big year.
We have 200 talent artists who turn projects into projects.
In the United States, the music comedy berque is very different.
Young people are trained in these fields in many schools.
The jobs are numerous among the regional theatres, tours, Broadway, the off-Broadway...
The living of talent is also a consequence of the number of positions to be held.
Why are the tours in the province so successful?
With the exception of opera, the province remains the poor parent of culture in France.
Few plays go on tour and it's often the Boulevard Theatre for adults and not for young adults.
The music shows match this lack.
These are the same young people who love television and what it produces as ephore stars...
Offering beautiful young men (often talented) at the head of a musical show is the assurance of the engagement of these young girls and often of their entire family.
The Facebook pages of these shows are certainly held by professionals who answer questions.
These shows are very expected when they arrive in a Zenith province.
The Mayonnaise is up in Paris and tastes the Provincials.
The show is designed to enter all the large halls of France in the same form as in Paris.
A serious injury in an accident with a ghost driver on the Brussels ring
A road accident caused a serious injury, Friday morning at 5:30 p.m., on the inner ring of Brussels at Hoeilaart, in the direction of Waterloo.
A driver's car was hit by a ghost driver, who was paid for it.
The ring was closed to the traffic, up to 9 a.m., at the site of the accident, the time when the road is derailed and an expert determines the circumstances of the accident.
However, this situation has not caused much confusion because the accident occurred at the height of Hoeilaart exit.
The circulation can therefore be diverted by this output/entry of the ring.
A child severely injured in an attraction in Disneyland Paris
A five-year-old child was severely injured as a result of an accident on an attraction in Disneyland Paris.
His vital prognosis is no longer engaged, but he is always hospitalized.
At the time of the fall, the boy was with his father on a boat of the "Phirates of the Caribbean".
It was closed to a new order.
RDC: Army prepares a new test
Children play on a carbonized blindde that belonged to the rebels of the M23 in Kibumba on October 31, 2013, in the East of the DRC.
The Congolese army was preparing for a new trial on Friday against the last bases of the M23 rebels near Bunagana, in the East of the DRC.
The goal is to disarm the M23 from the hills that overlap Bunagana.
Yesterday, we took the hill of Bugina, which overlaps the hill of Mbuzi.
Today, Mbuzi should fall from herself.
There will be no more than the hill of Runyonyi.
"Celle de Chanzu is not very strategic," said the AFP Governor of North Kivu, Julien Paluku.
Mr. Paluku planned to return to Bunagana on Saturday.
Five political and last strong places of the rebellion, this town is located at the Ugandan border, approximately 80 km north of Goma.
It was resumed on Wednesday by the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo on Wednesday.
Since then, a few hundred M23 irrevocables have been reduced to nearly 2,000 metres above the Canzu, Runyonii and Mbuzi agricultural hills, close to Bunagana and the nearby locality of Jomba.
In Jomba, a resident who had been fighting every Thursday during the whole day indicated that the situation was "slow since this morning".
According to him, a woman and her child were killed by the battles of the guard and buried.
One girl was injured by a bullet, and three others were injured, including a scratch, evacuated by the FARDC, added this witness quoted by the AFP.
Since the resumption of the fights between FARDC and rebels on 25 October, the two belligerents have not given any consideration to the loss of human life.
NSA's revelations increase business paranoia with respect to State surveillance
In a beautiful late August day, a German police helicopter overrun the British Consulate of Frankfurt, Germany's financial capital.
On behalf of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), the German National Information Agency, its mission was to photograph the roof of the US front post, located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
The German media explained that BfV was expected to identify the presence of listening antennas and that the operation caused a trade between the United States and the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Berlin.
James Clapper, the director of American intelligence services, again stressed in September that the United States did not use its foreign intelligence capabilities to "receive the industrial secrets of foreign companies on behalf of American companies in order to increase their international competitiveness or increase their profits".
But since Edward Snowden, the counsellor has become a criminal, has begun to reveal his inexhaustible treasure of information on the secrets of United States surveillance, European governments and business leaders no longer know whether to believe the director in words.
Reports, according to which the American National Security Agency spyed on Brazilian oil company Petrobras and had access to data held by American cloud storage service providers, including Google and Yahoo, have more than ever raised company paranoia with regard to State surveillance.
The revelation that the German chancellor Angela Merkel's phone had been hacked, perhaps even for a decade, was the drop of water that caused the vessel to be swallowed.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then business leaders are certainly also potential targets.
Snowden has made intensive collaboration between American information services and businesses transparent.
I believe it is conceivable that these data are used in their mutual interest.
"Germany must wake up," says Oliver Grün, president of BITMI, who represents German SMEs in the IT sector.
German companies believe that the United States is at risk as important as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data flight, according to a survey published in July by the EY Council Office.
However, in all the documents published by Mr. Snowden, nothing to date indicates that the United States has transmitted industrial secrets from foreign companies to American companies.
Political men expressed concern about the fact that the EU does not have sufficient IT and Internet capabilities and believe that it should try to reduce its dependence on the United States.
Business leaders are skeptical about this.
A German MP says we should create a German Google.
I can't just close my eyes and open them slowly...
“It’s not the right way to do it,” says Hasso Plattner, president of the German company software company, SAP.
If we wanted a strong European IT industry, then we didn't have to let it die 20 years ago.
Everything is subsidized in Germany, from coal to cars, passing through farmers.
All except the IT industry.
However, the scale and sophistication of American spy agencies exposed by Snowden's revelations was a shock to some companies who thought until then that China was at the greatest risk in terms of surveillance.
A major change is taking place in cloud computing as European officials are aware of the fact that data stored in the United States is governed by the laws of this jurisdiction and thus potentially vulnerable.
According to an investigation conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a professional agency, about 10% of non-American members have abandoned their plans to use an American cloud storage service provider after the US Data Exploration Program (PRSM) revelations.
Jim Snabe, co-director of SAP, says: "Our clients today ask us a question that they did not ask us a year ago: where my data are stored and can you assure me that they will remain physically in this jurisdiction?"
Many German leaders point out that the latest reports are only a confirmation of what they already knew, namely that powerful states want to steal their most precious secrets and that these data should therefore be kept at any price.
It is not surprising that there is economic espionage.
There's always been one.
"It has been a recurring subject for many years and nothing has substantially changed in the context of the current discussion," says Kurt Bock, Director-General of the chemical company BASF.
The Americans are spying on us commercially and industrially, just as we are spying on them, because it is in the national interest of defending our businesses.
Business leaders are generally reluctant to reveal the prevention measures they have put in place, if that would leave the advantage to an opponent.
The large companies have long fought the message that it is at least unwise to recover a free USB key in a professional living room or to leave a laptop without surveillance in a hotel room.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of the Audi car manufacturer's board, says that collecting mobile phones before the council meetings, so that they can't be used as remote listening devices, is a common practice for years.
The BfV of Germany advises its leaders to consider using simple mobile phones prepaid when travelling abroad due to the risk of meeting the integrity of smartphones.
The prepaid mobile phones are then discarded.
However, it is feared that small and medium-sized enterprises remain vulnerable to piracy and surveillance.
In Germany, many SMEs are global leaders in their particular niche.
"SMEs often lack experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect their industrial secrets against unauthorized access," warned BfV in a report.
The United States warns its own companies about the economic espionage activities carried out by other countries.
The National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) carried out in February by the United States cited France, as well as Russia and Israel, as guilty of having committed acts of economic information piracy, behind China, according to The Washington Post.
A member of the board of directors of a well-known German company believed that when it comes to economic espionage, "the French are the worst".
Bernard Squarcini, former director of the French Interior, DCRI, said in an interview this month: "The services know perfectly well that all countries, even if they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, spy on their allies."
The parents of a teenager in Georgia, who died in unusual circumstances, believe that their son was murdered
The parents of a teenager in Georgia, whose body was found in a carpet of fighting in the gymnasium of her high school, think their son was murdered, said the family's lawyer on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, from Valdosta in Georgia, was found on January 11 in a tape set up behind the gradients of his high school.
The investigators of the Sheriff of the County of Lowerdes concluded that Johnson was dead in unusual circumstances, but the young boy's family of 17-year-olds challenged these conclusions.
"They are absolutely certain that their son was murdered," said Benjamin Crump, lawyer representing Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, on FoxNews.com.
They never thought he was dead as indicated in the sheriff's conclusions.
“They think that this challenges any logic, the laws of physics, and the common sense,” Crump added.
They are convinced that these conclusions have been delivered in the sole purpose of covering the person(s) responsible for the death of their son.
"They sent their son to school with a cartridge and they were put in a morgue bag," he added.
The U.S. Attorney Michael Moore stated Thursday that he was conducting an official investigation into Johnson's death, stressing that several important questions remained unanswered.
What is the cause of death?
Is his death the result of a criminal act?
Moore spoke at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I'm going to follow the facts where they're going.
My goal is to discover the truth.
"I consider that there is a sufficient basis" to open an official investigation, he said.
Moore told reporters that the first autopsy indicated that Johnson was killed by "positional asphyxiation".
However, a second autopsy identified another cause of death, according to Moore.
"Several questions still deserve an answer or confirmation," he said.
Moore added that if he updates elements of nature to justify a civil or criminal investigation into Johnson's death, he will ask the FBI to do so.
The representative of the sheriff's office in the county of Lowdes was not available to give us his opinion when we contacted him on Thursday.
A South Georgia judge ordered the authorities on Wednesday to return all the video surveillance records that the investigators had examined.
Adolescent parents stated that they expected video images to contain indications of the circumstances of their death.
CDC publishes advice on allergies in children for schools
Wednesday, the U.S. Centre for Disease Control and Prevention published a series of guidelines on how to manage children's food allergies at school.
This is the first series of guidelines published by the U.S. government, as the number of children of school age who suffer from food allergies has become very high.
A child in 20 in the United States today suffers from a food allergy.
The CDC found that the prevalence of food allergies in the child had increased by 18 per cent between 1997 and 2007.
The guide contains information for schools on how to sensitize the teaching body and staff to food allergies in the child, and how to treat them in case of an allergic reaction.
It also recommends that schools have an epinephrine stock – the EpiPen brand auto-injector being the most commonly used – in order to be able to react quickly in case of potentially fatal anaphylaxis.
The legislative assemblies of States recently updated the regulations to allow schools to have more easily than the epinephrine in stock.
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms reported by children who have an allergic reaction.
Children can say, "I feel like I've got something to pick up my tongue," "I feel like I've got a hair on my tongue" or "I've got pictorials on my tongue."
The NSA case highlights the total lack of debate on information
How can we explain the contradictory attitude of the French government, which on one side goes public by summoning the US ambassador on 21 October, and on the other, prohibits the overcrowding of the territory by the Bolivian presidential aircraft, on the basis of the noise of the presence on its board of Edward Snowden?
In my opinion, there are two levels of response from the French Government.
When François Hollande phoned Barack Obama or when the Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius calls the US ambassador, they respond to a real discovery, which is the extent of American surveillance over all communications in France.
Isn't it surprising to read in the world's columns a few weeks from the time of the reproduction of American diplomatic correspondence and, on the other hand, a condemnation of the ears of the Quai d'Orsay by the NSA?
Wouldn't there be a vague hypocrisy on your part?
The journalistic approach is not a moral position, but a search for the interest and relevance of information that enables every citizen to have an opinion.
When WikiLeaks lifts the veil on the analysis by American diplomacy of political issues or others around the world, we consider that, in the view of the American power, this is an important enlightenment.
When we describe the American interception systems against the French diplomacy in the United States, it is in no way to insult us with this practice, it is to describe the world as it is.
Has France received information from NSA regarding terrorist operations aimed at our interests?
Can we get rid of American collaboration?
The establishment of very powerful technological interception tools by the United States, but also by France, has been officially justified by the fight against terrorism.
Moreover, in this area, France and the United States have, in particular, established procedures for cooperation and exchange of information almost daily, which are described on the one hand and on the other as essential.
For example, the presence of Mohammed Merah in the tribal areas in Miranshah was reported to the French through NSA.
France can be led, for example, to transmit entire data blocks on the Sahel region to American services, and, on the other hand, it has already been said quickly - the Americans can provide information to the French on other regions of the world.
Therefore, the substantive question behind this NSA case is not as much the ability or right of countries to have intervention tools as the question of the total absence of prior debate, particularly within Parliament, on the justification of such systems, the perimeter that must be theirs, and finally the issue of freedoms.
What do the United States really risk? a degradation of their image?
It's nice to tell them, I don't see how they can be punished.
The risk posed by Americans can be double.
The first is when their allies - and this has been the case recently - learn that their leaders, sometimes at the top of their state, have been monitored.
This is the case with Brazil and Germany, two countries where diplomatic relations with the United States have developed.
Another effect may be more economic: increasingly European or South American companies refuse, in the light of the revelations, to provide their confidential data to US suppliers subject to US laws, and thus to the start of the NSA.
Last element: the widespread movement of revelations undertaken by the media around the world, which helps to engage in a debate on the monitoring practices of information services up to then almost non-existent, could encourage legislators, including Americans, to reconsider the powers they have given to their information services.
Intersexed children's parents can choose "unspecified sex"
Germany has become the first European nation to recognise a third sex for infants born with ambitious sexual organs.
The male or female sex of the newborns will no longer be assigned to them, strictly, at birth.
Under the new law, parents will no longer be required to declare the sex of their child, allowing them to register an "unspecified" or "unspecified" sex on their birth certificate.
The purpose of the law was to remove the pressure on the shoulders of parents who could make hasty decisions regarding a sexual re-assignment surgery for their infants and to combat discrimination against the intersexedents.
According to the BBC, an intersex person would have said years later, "I am neither a man nor a woman."
I will remain the patchwork that the doctors have created, confused and embellished.
It is estimated that a child of 2,000 is born every year, not a boy or a girl.
They are intersexed, the intersexuality of the group of sixty diseases diagnosed as sexual development disorder, a generic term that designates people with atypical chromosomes or gonads (ovaries or testiculars) or abnormally developed sexual organs.
Wallis Simpson could have been intercepted.
Sexual identification is still not well understood, but most specialists in the United States say that when sex cannot be determined, it is better to use the best information available to assign it, then wait and follow the child's psychological and physical development before considering a surgical act, if necessary.
Dr. Jack Drescher, a psychiatrist in New York and a specialist in sexual identification, said that the new German law "seems to be a good idea".
Intersexed children have an ethical dilemma.
“Some people suffer from extremely serious diseases that require surgery, but this is not the case with most children,” he added.
It is possible to make a sexual assignment without surgery, and see how identity develops.
Science is about how a child will develop a sexual identity is not very precise.
No one can answer the question of why this is happening.
It's like the mystery that surrounds homosexuals.
A report submitted to the European Commission in 2011 described persons intersexed as different from transsexual or transgender persons, because their status is not related to sex but rather to their biological constitution, which is neither man nor woman alone, but is generally both at the same time and clearly defined as one or the other.
These characteristics may manifest themselves in secondary sexual characters (such as muscle mass, pilosity, chest and stamina), primary sexual characters (such as reproductive organs and sexual organs) or the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
The report also provided an overview of the discrimination faced by persons intersexed and transgender in employment, as well as the extent of acts of harassment and violence and crimes motivated by prejudice.
Young boys of non-conformity now have fields that are specifically intended for them.
Australia and Nepal already authorize adults to register male, female or "third" on their official documents.
In June, a 52-year-old Australian, Norrie May-Welby, became the first person in the world to have been recognized as "neutral" after winning his trial in appeal that allows him to keep a "unspecified" sex alive.
German passports will include a third designation next to M or F – X for intersex, according to the Ministry of the Interior.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are always the subject of controversy, according to a report published on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of legislators from this country were signing a petition to remove the "theory of genres" from school books.
The American Catholic Online also opposed German law, writing that "because the world is drawn into a new realm where gender is a choice but where sexual activity is not one, two other pillars of civilization are reversed."
In Maryland, a nursing mother also stated on Baby Zone that she would prefer that a sex be attributed to babies at birth.
"The role of parent is sufficiently stressful without additional restrictions, especially if you do not know the sex of your child," she said on the website for young parents.
Children need stability and certainty.
Historically, children born without male or female sexual organs were called hermaphrodites, according to the name of the beautiful Greek god who had a double sex.
And hardly a decade ago, the medical community considered the kind as a charade, which can be deleted and on which can be redesigned.
But now many are those who challenge the ethical foundation of the surgery, knowing that sexual identity is complex and that sometimes doctors can cheat, not knowing how a child will feel his sexual resuscitation when he grows up.
“ In the middle of the 20th century, it was called a psychiatric emergency, ” Drescher said.
When these children were born, we didn't call the psychiatrist, we called the surgeon.
The dominant theory on how to treat children with ambiguity sexual organs was launched by Dr. John Money, from Johns-Hopkins University, who considered the gender to be malnourished.
He devoted the term "sexual identity" and supported that social and environmental signals – the way parents raise a child – interact with the genes and hormones of a child to shape it so that it would be identified as male or female.
But in a 1966 case known as "John/John", his theories gave rise to controversy.
He had advised the parents of a young boy whose penis had been cut during a bacle circumcision to cast it completely, also taking out the testicles, and to raise it as a daughter.
"Money presented this as a successful transition case, but that was not the case," Drescher said.
At about the age of 15, he returned a boy and married a woman.
But at 38 years of age, he committed suicide.
Drescher said that some doctors “are always repeating this model. ”
But in the 1990s, with the arrival of the Internet, those who have survived these sex-change operations say "that they are not satisfied with the result."
This is the case with Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with male chromosomes XY but ambiguity sexual organs.
The doctors could not really say whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never have a "satisfying life" as a man.
So not long after his birth in 1976, Bruce underwent surgery from the external body and testicles and was raised as a daughter.
He was given female hormones at the age of 12.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," he said on ABCNews.com.
I wasn't happy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At 18 years of age, he suffered a vaginoplasty.
But depressed and realizing that something was not going on, he asked for his medical file.
What he discovered has horrified him.
I was sterilized at birth – and no one had ever told me.
Bruce was born with a sexual development disorder (DDS) that prevented his body from producing enough testosterone so that his sexual organs could develop.
After learning the truth, a man was returned, after treatment with testosterone and had his breasts removed.
The surgery made him sterile.
Today, he defends the cause of others in an organization called Interface Project, which tries to normalize the perception of intersexuals.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, director-general of the non-profit organization based in California Lawyers for Informed Choice, fears that the German law "is inviting labelling and stigmatization".
"Many activists are concerned that the German law encourages parents to make quick decisions and gives their child an "unspecified" sex," she said.
We are afraid that she will encourage the interventions.
We think it would be better to assign a male or female sex, and wait.
But we have not seen what the law was going to give, so we can only advance assumptions.
Tamar-Mattis stated that her organization supported Australian law because "it allows adults to choose to be recognized under the name of the third sex."
"Adolescents should be able to make their own decisions about a legal kind," she added.
The German law concerns the allocation of sex to birth.
It is not a battle that young children should lead at that age.
When they grow up, they can make decisions about their own body.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a radiologist who specializes in mammography in Pittsburgh, whose daughter is affected by a sexual development disorder and who helps thousands of people in a support group, said that the German law would "responsible" parents and children.
Dr. Baratz's daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but she suffers from a DDS called complete insensitivity syndrome to androgens.
Because of the failure of her androgens receptors, Katie developed female characteristics.
She's got a vagina, but not a uterine or a ovary.
Today, at the age of 29, Katie is married and internal in child psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although it is sterile, it hopes to have children through adoption services or fostering mothers.
"The law leaves some flexibility for parents not to make urgent decisions," Baratz said.
This leaves them time to do some tests and to understand them, and a period before entering "male" or "female".
So it's all right – you can raise your child and love him.
You have a beautiful baby and enjoy the pleasure of being a parent.
You don't have to rush for a surgical intervention that is irreversible.
"This puts children at the heart of the decision and alleviates the feeling of anxiety that motivates parents because they are afraid not to do what is necessary," she said.
Finally, the child will decide with what sex he/she feels more comfortable – and that is something great.
This allows the child to make the decision for himself.
Letta trusting in the longevity of her government
The President of the Italian Council Enrico Letta considers that his government will hold until 2015 despite the strong tensions between left and right within the coalition to power in the approach of the Senate's vote to abolish Silvio Berlusconi's mandate.
In an interview with the daily La Stampa, the left-wing leader said to have "firmly the intention" to continue to rule with his coalition until the next legislative elections in 2015.
The High House of the Italian Parliament will meet in the course of the month to decide on the fate of the former President of the Council condemned for tax fraud in August.
Silvio Berlusconi threatens to withdraw his support from the government if the Senate, where he has more opponents than a party, pronounces his resignation.
But a part of his camp, grouped around the National Secretary of the People of Freedom (PDL), Angelino Alfano, continues to support the government, as demonstrated on 2 October last, his refusal to surrender to the injunctions of Berlusconi, who already wanted to cut down the cabinet.
L.A. Times reports that an agent of the U.S. Transport Safety Agency, TSA, and a suspect were injured during the exchange of firefights.
Firefighters called at the places of the drama claimed to have responded to a call making up "multiple wounded".
"The forces of the order are on-site," says the airport on its Twitter account, while the images of television showed people evacuated in ambulances.
"There was a shooting," the AFP stated a spokesperson of the US Transport Security Agency (TSA).
ABC's local antenna showed a person evacuated on a branch card, and a second transport on a wheelchair.
The incident took place around 9.30 a.m. (12.30 a.m.) at the airport terminal 3, also specified the airport.
The Los Angeles Times states that the 2 and 3 terminals are being evacuated.
The TSA spokesperson was unable to confirm immediately if one of its employees was injured.
All flights to and from the airport have been suspended.
The Israeli army kills a member of the Hamas in Gaza
Israeli chariots shot on Thursday killed an Islamic Palestinian militant from Hamas and brutally injured another in the southern Gaza Strip, learned from sources of health services.
A source from Hamas explained that fighting broke out in this region, because Israeli chariots crossed the border and were targeted by your shootings from Palestinian mortars.
The Israeli army was pleased to call for a "targeted action" in the area near a well-known tunnel of "terrorist" by the Hebrew state, crossed the border, whose discovery was announced in mid-October.
Report: Obama's campaign considered to be falling Biden for Hillary Clinton
The closest advisors to President Barack Obama considered, in the most secret, replacing Vice-President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton on the 2012 list, according to the New York Times.
This revelation is the most remarkable event in the very expected book of the 2012 campaign by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann, "Double Down: Game Change 2012".
The Times received a copy of the book to be displayed and reported on Thursday night that the next collaborators of the president had carried out "deep work in groups and polls at the end of 2011" to see if Biden's escape could help Obama in his reelection while his hopes were diminishing.
According to the political correspondent of Times Jonathan Martin, the book provides a detailed analysis of the work of the campaign's and House-Blanche seniors, namely the former Secretary-General of the House-Blanche Bill Daley, to measure the impact of the Vice-President's replacement by the former Secretary-General of Clinton could have on the poll.
The possibility of an exchange is a secret that has been thoroughly stored within the Chicago campaign QG and within the oval office.
Only half a dozen close advisors of the president – including Daley, the former leader of Obama's campaign Jim Messina and the former councillors at the House-Blanche David Axelrod and David Plouffe – knew that the change was under investigation.
"Double Down" indicates that Daley has carried out the task of replacing Biden, despite their "close personal links", before finally deciding against the change when the figures showed that having Clinton on the presidential list "would not greatly improve Obama's chances of success".
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the administration had actually planned to replace Biden by Clinton.
"I said that I had examined a whole series of questions, and that was one of them," Daley said in the newspaper.
Remember that at the time, the president was not in shape, so it was said, "Lord, what can we do?"
While Daley qualified the "con concerted" review, Martin told Anderson Cooper of CNN that the re-election campaign had a lot of investments to find out if the change would be beneficial during the poll.
"The campaigns don't spend much money on polls and discussion groups unless they seriously plan to take action," said Martin on AC360.
However, it is not known whether Obama was aware that his team was considering the replacement.
Martin said about CNN that he had asked Daley if his employer was aware of any change.
Although Daley said that he did not think that the President "was aware" of any change, the former Secretary-General admitted that he was "possible" as Obama said.
Martin added that "Double Down" did not ultimately answer the question of whether political polls had arrived at Obama's office.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought Obama didn't know that Biden's escape from the presidential list was being examined.
"Maybe," answered Martin.
You want a fluo ice?
A British contractor created the first fluorescent ice in the world based on meduce.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of this marine animal to develop a luminous collision.
He came up with this idea after having read a study on the media and convinced Chinese scientists to re-create the brilliant protein chemically.
The ice cream reacts with the language by increasing protein pH to make it shine.
Chris explains that, since ice cream starts to glow when it reacts to the heat of the mouth, more milk, more it becomes brighter.
Charlie, the founder of the ice company "Lick Me I'm Delicious", said: "It's something amazing but we are still only at the beginnings of production, and 2 g of this trick costs about £200."
The protein we use in the ice reacts with the neutral pH language.
So when your mouth heats the protein, the pH increases and the ice becomes bright.
We tested it in the last few months and it seemed appropriate to share it with everyone at Halloween because it gives a brilliant effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice I've ever created because the light of the medals is worth four times as much as gold.
So every bullet costs me about 140 pounds.
But she tastes pretty good!
Charlie's experimental approach society, based in Bristol, is known for its unusual ice fragrances such as beer, cheese, beer and gold leaf.
But his next creation is even more ambitious.
He added: "I would really like to develop an invisible ice."
It is intrinsically impossible because of the refraction caused by ice crystals that constitute the ice cream, but I think I will find a way to get there.
The ice uses fluorescent properties of the medusa synthesised by Chinese scientists.
Lou Reed died during a Thai chi session
The singer Lou Reed died while he was practicing Thai chi, his wife, Laurie Anderson, revealed on Thursday in a letter published by the regional newspaper "East Hampton Star" to the inhabitants of the city of Springs, where the couple had a home.
The artist died last Sunday at the age of 71.
"He died on Sunday morning while looking at the trees and performing the famous 21st Thai chi movement, with his hands as musicians who were blowing the air," says Laurie Anderson.
Lou Reed was the master of chi, a Chinese martial arts.
The singer's wife also explained that she had promised her husband, the week before her death, to get her out of the hospital and take her to their house in Springs (Long Island).
Lou and I have spent a lot of time here in recent years.
And even if we're citizens, it's our spiritual home.
"Lou was a prince and a fighter, and I know that his songs on the pain and beauty of the world will convey to many people the tremendous joy of living that he had," she added.
Lou Reed had been on a liver graft last May.
Halloween 2013 : In figures
When I was little, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat beans, go to bed late and give us a break to go to the neighborhood.
Today, I've become more pink.
In the last two years, I haven't distributed one candy and I'm certainly not going to do it anymore this year.
But the cities show that I'm the gay sheep when we talk about Halloween.
The majority of Americans – 158 million of them in fact – will celebrate Halloween this year, spending a total of $6.9 billion in bonuses, decorations and decorations, according to the National Retail Federation.
What I look forward to every Halloween party is trends.
The disbursements should represent $1.2 billion over the $6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.
This year, sexy inanimate objects rage.
Women no longer need to be sexy professionals; they can also be sexy foods such as pizzas, burgers and carrots.
As for men, I look forward to seeing many zombies, thanks to the TV series The Walking Dead, and I bet that the men of the Daphpunk space will be among our Instagram photos this year.
According to Google, the most sought-after discounts are zombies, Batman, pirates and snakes.
I guess there's nothing wrong with being traditional.
We had our dogs washed last year and, to my great surprise, they weren't the only ones.
In fact, Americans will spend $330 million in animal waste this year, according to the NRF.
It makes a lot of lovely dogs tasted in hotdogs.
When it comes to beans, we don't shine.
The Americans will spend $1.9 billion in bonuses this year, according to the Nielsen firm.
This represents approximately 272 million kg of Hershey bars, sucetes, Milk Duds, Twizzlers and Clark bars.
It's a great news for 41 million children who go hunting for candy in their neighborhood, according to the American Department of Commerce.
In fact, we're going to buy and, we don't tell stories, consume 41 million pounds of chocolate during Halloween.
The corn beans are the only thing we don't want to eat; yet almost 16 million kg are sold for Halloween, according to the National Confectioners Association.
This represents about 9 billion corn grains.
It's a mystery that I haven't been able to elucidate yet.
There's nothing more representative of Halloween than the houses.
They carry the best names, such as "Terror Behind the Walls" (which is actually a real prison), "Howl-O-Screen" and "The House of Shock".
In fact, there are 1,200 houses officially recognized in the United States, which generate about $500 million of revenue, according to the America Haunts, and this includes these amazing photos of you as you pry over what your friends put on Facebook and that you can't remove and on which a type you like well leaves a comment of the style "beautiful head".
Finally, let's talk about citricles.
Charlie Brown showed us La Grosse Citroille when we were playing, and digging a candle in the shape of a lantern, it's like decorating a Christmas tree – it's something we've been doing since we've been little.
Fortunately for us, the "baby-citrollium trend" began only last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us carved these potions and didn't have to sit there.
This year, the Americans will spend about $106 million in citricles, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
The Lantern citricians who flaunt your house's pig probably came from Illinois, where 542 million citricians were cultivated this year.
If you are trying to make you notice more, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California, and try to sculpt their 922 kg citricle.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will create an internal bankruptcy structure ("bad bank") comprising 38 billion books (EUR 45 billion) of the most risky assets, with the aim of maintaining its relationship with London and accelerating its privatisation.
The bank wants to reduce the ratio of questionable assets in its balance sheet by 55% to 70% in the next two years and hopes that it will be completely cleared in the next three years.
RBS also said that it would include a provision for depreciating suspicious claims of four to 4.5 billion books per quarter, a writing related to the constitution of the cantoning structure.
RBS also stated that this internal restructuring would release between 10 and 11 billion capital books, thus strengthening its lending capacity.
The Bank and London stressed that the "bad bank" would make it possible to deal with the past, and the government, in particular, had been accused of engaging in the management of the RBS.
"We can now move forward, we are concerned about the future and 90% of the assets that constitute a really good bank and build a large bank for the clientele and the UK," said the new Director General Ross McEwan to the press.
Land Rover announces his sponsorship of a series of rallyes
The interior has six-point copper seats and a Intercom system.
Among the options, include improved brakes, a service providing access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistics support and vehicle storage between two events.
Drew Bowler, Director General of Bowler Motorsport, said: "The rally lovers who join Bowler have changed."
They are not all experienced, some are looking for excitement and adventure and real access to international events.
We are very happy to offer such an approach in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA, and we are convinced that this will be a new way to try out various forms of rallying in the UK and the international, and to prepare for the rigors and realities of raiding.
We have had a great pleasure in developing the Defender Challenge vehicle – the championship will really be striking.”
In addition, the Defence Challenge will propose a day of training and testing in February and the possibility of participating in events in the deserts of North Africa and the Middle East.
The firefighters were called to rescue a missing hatch after being stuck to 15 m above ground on an unstable corner in a career
Ruby, a gambler, had escaped after a road accident without gravity
It was recorded three days later by a person who walked his dog trapped in the career
The firefighters came down to remember along the façade to recover the dog and save her from a certain death
One shot had the chance to escape the worst after the firefighters were called to recover it safely while it was lost 15 m above the ground on the unstable sand of a cliff.
Ruby, a 9-month-old cocker, escaped after an accident on Sunday afternoon and survived for only three days before being saved in a Wednesday career.
His owners, Scott Alderson, 25 years old, and his little friend Becky Hall, 20 years old, went to the Flappit career in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to meet Ruby and thanked the West Yorkshire Fire and Relief Service.
They desperately sought out their lost dog and launched a call on social networks sites after she disappeared in her career following an accident without gravity.
About 14.15 a.m. on Wednesday, a person with a sharp look who walked his dog noticed Ruby on a corner in the career, located 15 m above the ground.
A technical rescue team from the Cleckheaton firehouse crashed on the sites and came down in a reminder to save Ruby using an animal civir to transport it to the top of the cliff.
Technical relief specialist Andy Clayton said, "She was in an emergency."
It was in the middle of the valley, 15 m from the top and 15 m from the ground.
She had absolutely not moved during the rescue – she was frozen.
But she's fine now.
She ate cookies after.
It was a very unusual call.
It's amazing that someone noticed the dog.
The technical support specialist Peter Lau said: "Ruby had a lot of chance of getting out of it."
She could have been seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to the veterinarian for a check; her general condition was satisfactory, except for exhausting and dehydration.
Ms. Hall, from Halifax in West Yorkshire, said, "I was terrified by watching the rescues."
I didn't think she was up there at first.
It was amazing having it back in your arms.
The veterinarian said that if she had been too exhausted and had been evaporated, she would probably have fallen.
The firefighters were hot.
What they did was really brave.
We are so grateful to them, each of them has been absolutely formidable.
Mr. Alderson, from Keighley, added: "We were afraid that she would fall, but she did not move."
The firefighters were great.
I can't believe she was up there.
Mick Jagger said he never touched Katy Perry when she was 18.
During an interview with an Australian radio broadcast this week, the pop star said she was choristic about Jagger's song "Old Habits Die Hard" in 2004.
Perry said she had lunch with the rock veteran and explained, "He took me out when I was 18 years old."
She added, "It was a long time ago, and it was very nice."
In a statement on Thursday, a 70-year-old representative of Jagger said he "did not categorically make any progress in Katy Perry".
The representative added: "Maybe she confuses him with someone else."
Perry was one of the singers to make an appearance at the Rolling Stones tour this year.
His new album, "Prism", landed at the top of the charts this week.
Pékin brings and causes an Islamic Turkmen movement
"The support for the attack was from the Islamic Movement of East-East Turkey based in Central and West Asia," said the pattern of Chinese security bodies at a Hong Kong television channel, according to a video online Thursday night on a website.
Meng Jianzhu, who is a member of the Chinese Communist Party Political Office (PCC), spoke at Tachkent on an official visit to Uzbekistan.
This is the first time a Chinese official designates a special organization after Monday's assassination.
According to the Chinese police, three Uighurs of the same family of the Muslim-dominated region of Xinjiang, bordering several Central Asian countries, rushed their car to the city of Pekin, in a suicide attack that caused two deaths and 40 injuries.
The driver of the car, his wife and his mother died in the car fire.
Etim, who claims to fight for the independence of eastern Turkey, the former name of the Chinese Xinjiang, was ranked by the United Nations in 2002 among the organizations affiliated to Al-Qaida.
This movement is often designated by the Chinese authorities as responsible for sporadic disorders in Xinjiang, but its real influence is questioned by several experts.
George Kerevan: The outbreak of Europe gives the Scottish people the choice
Another day, another worrying story of independence.
This time, we are expected that an independent Scotland would be required to join the European area of free movement in order to join the EU.
And here we hear passport control stories in Berwick and a border of barbeled wires along the Hadrian wall.
If it is true that Strathclyde's journal has indicated the possible economic consequences of greater freedom of movement with the rest of Europe, that was not the case in the major titles (and was to be expected).
No one has ever said that EU Member States spend a large part of their time breaking their formal rules when it arranges them.
Since Scotland is not part of the Schengen area for the time being, a continuing non-compliance with the rules would be a small concession that Brussels could offer in return for all it wants from the Scottish.
So it's a story that's not a story.
And a story so old that it's now fixed: I've heard for the first time the bobard that "independence means passport control" over 40 years ago.
However, we have forgotten an interesting point in this interpretation of an old dusty account.
Why should an independent Scotland follow the instructions of Europe, in fact?
Why exchange the London yoke against Brussels, in particular now?
Here's the real news about Europe: the great post-war plan aimed at uniting Europe is finally at the point of death.
With the euro crisis, the European Project is officially dead.
Through Europe, the parties who oppose the EU or who fight for the abandonment of the euro as a common currency win the ground.
Even in Germany, the Alternative Eurosceptic Party for Germany, founded only this year and came from nowhere, gathered almost five million votes during the federal elections in September and came out the Liberal Democratic Party (equivalent to our Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag.
There has always been a national opposition to the federal European project.
However, the current economic crisis has marked a turning point.
The austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, associated with the carcan weighing on national economies through the accession to the single currency, has led many people to think that the European project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has nothing to do with national governments that record excessive budgetary deficits – this was only true for Greece.
Instead, the European system has weighed on its members with exchange rates that favour German exporters – what German politicians want to preserve.
Without the possibility of an assessment of the national currency, the countries of southern Europe are facing an intrinsic productivity problem for Germany.
The only remedy is to make dark cuts in public salaries and expenses – encouraged by Berlin.
In addition to the current budgetary and monetary problems, there is a deeper malaise related to productivity in Europe.
Following the "green" energy policies imposed by Brussels – which are a reason for subsidising French and German companies in the energy sector at consumer costs – the European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times more for gas than the United States.
This is a cost-reduction disadvantage, as we have already seen in Grangemouth.
All the world's wage freezes will not prevent the European petrochemical industry from being penalized by a good-market American ski lift gas.
As a result, the riot rages, particularly in France, one of the major EU leaders.
After the war, the French political elite considered the EU a way to control Germany and put Paris on an equal footing with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport of its political legitimacy and imposed its own economic policy in Europe, allowing the French economy to get worse.
Result: Marine Le Pen, the National Anti-European Front, has just won a crucial partial election, sending the Socialists back to power in the third place.
The National Front is now the most popular party in France with 24% of the suffrage – an appropriate warning for the British Labour Party, which reminds him that it cannot depart from the principle that a right section will automatically favour the left.
What does Marine Le Pen do with its new popularity with the French white working class?
It wants to use European elections next year to create a single and anti-European anti-monetary bloc within the European Parliament.
If anti-European parties are good at these elections, what is very possible, such a block could control the European Parliament for the first time.
This is what I think: very soon, the single anti-European and anti-monetary sentiment in Europe will unite and end up killing the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will return to something that will look more like "the Europe of Nations (Sovereign)" freely privileged by the General of Gaulle.
Germany and some of its satellite economies could retain the euro, but France and South Europe will find their own currency.
I look forward to the United Kingdom taking its distance from this project, and I hope that it will give the United States a soft eye.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be left on its own in the Atlantic.
And Scotland, in all this?
We can decide to be a region of small England (essentially).
Or we can defend our own economic interests, which includes sending to Berlin and Brussels.
I believe that Scotland could accommodate a more freer European agreement, provided that we keep our own currency.
Cooperation with other countries in similar views would be easier in a non-Federal Nations Europe.
Otherwise, we should imitate Norway and maintain our economic independence.
The Scottish SNP government is – and it is worth noting – the most successful anti-austerity political movement in Europe, as it won a spectacular majority in 2011 based on its opposition to the proposed dark cuts (and implemented) by the Chancellor of the workers' team, Alistair Darling, and the conservative/liberal-democratic coalition that followed.
It would now be ridiculous for Scotland to vote for independence if it were to accept the austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early puberty: Age earlier
Studies show that young Afro-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach the age of puberty earlier than young white girls.
Physical changes do not mean that puberty is imminent
Nothing proves that hormones or other chemicals are responsible.
Experts believe that the obesity epidemic could be a trigger for early puberty
The trend towards early puberty is not as pronounced in boys
The former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a child's family and health journalist.
Should a mother worry if her daughter's boobs and hairs begin to grow at 7 or 8 years of age?
At the annual American Academy of Pediatrics conference held this week in Orlando, Florida, Dr. Paul Kaplowitz, pedo-endocrinologist, explained that these early physical changes are quite common among young Americans and represent a new standard.
"I spend a lot of time reassuring my parents – generally this does not lead to a rapid evolution towards full puberty," Kalowitz said.
The obvious signs of development, such as breast mutilation, hair under the arms and in the public area and body smells, appear early in girls.
But there has only been a slight improvement in the age of the first rules over the last four decades.
In the United States, the average age is 12 and a half years, while it was 12 and three quarters in 1970.
"When the breast begins to develop, it takes at least two or three years before the first rules appear," said Kaplowitz, also the author of "early puberty in Girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem".
Time is the most accurate test to know how puberty will evolve.
There is a debate as to what constitutes the real appearance of puberty, but it is considered as "early" when the development of breast cancer is accompanied by sudden growth before the age of 8.
In most cases, development slows down or stops – this is something a pediatrician can follow closely.
A faster evolution can justify tests carried out by an endocrinologist to avoid serious problems such as tumors or cysts.
There are treatments to delay the appearance of the first rules and prevent other consequences: premature aging of the bones that can slow growth and a small size of the adult age.
The recommendations for drug and hormonal treatment are based on the age of the child, the rate of development, the rate of growth and the rate of affective maturity.
The psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is careful with medications but recognizes that “the control of puberty can mitigate some behavioral problems and the feeling for young girls to be different from others”.
The other major problem is understandable: Parents simply don't want their very young girls to have their rules.
"They fear the risk of pregnancy or even how they will manage hygiene issues," Kalowitz said.
“It was a shock, ” recalls a woman whose daughter had her first ten - year rules.
Although there were signs and we talked about the rules, she was not emotionally prepared.
She came back from school and was upset to be the first of her friends.
There are many theories of public knowledge about the causes of early puberty.
However, there is no consistent theory that the hormones contained in milk or other foods, the chemical products present in the environment or the sexual messages carried by the media are responsible.
The boys, like the girls, reach their puberty sooner.
Kaplowitz claims that the most credible hypothesis is that of the obesity epidemic.
He participated in a study conducted on girls aged 6 to 9 who linked the percentage of fat to the onset of puberty.
Other findings support this conclusion, but there are many other influential factors.
In this country, young African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach the age of puberty earlier than young white girls.
There are several explanations.
At the global level, early puberty mechanisms seem to be influenced by everything, economic conditions to the climate, passing through genes.
Another problem: Although boys have hair on their face and in the younger public area, the trend towards a real early puberty is not as pronounced as in girls.
Other doctors participating in the AAP conference insisted on the complexity of the subject.
The appearance of acne and pubic hair is common, even in infants and infants.
"We must be careful about how we identify the true appearance of puberty," said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pedo-endocrinologist working at the Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to ask their pediatrician for advice on how to speak with their child.
"This may mean having a conversation earlier than planned," Kalowitz explained.
If you stay calm, your child will generally respond well.
Girls whose puberty is early must be assured that, even when this happens sooner than expected, the process is part of life.
Honoring the People of the Coen Brothers
"Inside Llewyn Davis" by Brother Coen, the Grand Prix of the Last Cannes Festival, is a nostalgic and funny film on the Greenwich village of 1961 and folk music that began to resonate, before Bob Dylan arrived.
Joel and Ethan Coen, whose filmography has just become the subject of a retrospect to the French cinema, had brought the Golden Palm to Cannes in 1991 for Barton Fink.
The lack of power to hire Dylan or the Trio Peter, Paul and Mary, Joel and Ethan Coen have cast their debut on the star amount of American cinema, Oscar Isaac, 33, but also on the planetary pop Justin Timberlake.
In this humoured film where music is a central character and the songs interpreted live, Oscar Isaac is a performer and singer, while Timberlake, his friend in the film, leaves the pop for folk music with a contagious retirement.
As for Carey Muligan, she left Daisy Muligan's rich actresses in "Gatsby the Beautiful" for less brilliant clothes, a soft voice when she sings, but she owes the oath to the machine when she speaks.
"Inside Llewyn Davis" tells about one week the tribulations of a folk singer who can't find and get angry with the whole earth.
It accepts the uphill replacements in the studios.
Without accommodation, he makes the tour of his friends who still want to receive it.
Documentary air
"His relationship with success is tortured, that's what we were interested in: a mixture of evil, a man who is not there at the right time, who is not a careerist but integrates, with self-destructive behavior," said the press Ethan Coen, crowned with his brother Joel from several Oscars and prizes in Cannes.
If Llewyn Davis did not exist, the two folk music fans built their story on real personalities of the time like folk musician Dave Von Ronk.
The idea was to show the time before the Greenwich village event, this New York district called to become "the epicenter of the essor of folk music that would generate international stars" as wrote journalist Elias Wald, friend of Van Ronk.
The film then takes documentaries, the 33T-envahi dusty music label invented by an unimaginable old secretary, to the musical choices of the studios of the time and to the cafes where the singers were produced.
The magic of the Coen brothers still works by integrating a character play that passes through the film permanently: a beautiful red cat looking cracking, Llewyn Davis's fortune companion.
Asked about how he composed his character, the actor and singer Justin Timberlake had recalled having "great in Tennessee, bathed by the blues and the country".
"My first music lessons were given to me by my grandfather who taught me to play guitar," he added.
For Justin Timberlake, if the work is necessary for "to be considered as good", "the gambling can also start someone's career", and "more and more today".
As Llewyn Davis, who refuses to compromise his music, the star pop explains that in a career, "the most important thing is not to get started with anything that can prevent us from expressing ourselves."
Gerard de Villiers, the author of "SAS", died.
He will never have known the word retired.
The phenomenon of the French edition, Gerard de Villiers, died on Thursday at 83 years of age, came just to publish his 200th SAS, "La Vengeance du Kremlin".
In February, the New York Times devoted it as "the author of spying novels who knew too much about it."
He then spent ten days in Afghanistan, the 198th and 199th operas of the famous series of espionage novels.
Physically reduced by a very serious heart accident in December 2010, he moved on this journey with a walker.
And before Afghanistan, he was also assigned to Libya, Russia, Lebanon and Mali.
With four SAS published a year, Gérard de Villiers, born December 8, 1929 in Paris, would have ignored the exact number of books sold since 1965 and the publication of "SAS in Istanbul", the first of the series, almost half a century ago.
"No doubt between 120 million and 150 million all countries in conflict," he moved on last March.
His bierman chat on his knees, in the living room of his immense apartment of an apartment of the avenue Foch at two steps of the Arc de Triomphe, the malignant eye under his white hair, he quoted some of the languages in which the adventures of SAS were translated: Italian, German, Russian, Greek, Japanese or Korean.
"Without counting the pirate editions," he added, designing a stack of books on the low table between the bronzes or Ivores reported from the 130 Arpentian countries to place his novels there.
For the price of a pack of cigarettes, the reader has the right to the traditional cover with the photo of a young woman at the advantaged chest, carrying a gun or a gun.
Inside, its highest Serene Highness (SAS) Prince Malko Linge, aristocrat of Austria disarrayed and CIA contractual agent to pay for the repairs of the family castle, launches to the vaults of all the earth's wicked, communists of the 1970s and 80s, then jihadists from the 1990s.
In each book, the same recipe: a large dose of geopolitical and exoticism, a few scenes of hard sex, a set of violence and torture.
"I've never pretended to be a literary author," explained Gérard de Villiers.
I consider myself to be a counter that writes to distract people I don't send a message to.
He worked "like the great pre-war reporters, like Albert London, who went on the spot and came back with real and long investigations".
SAS's father said "makes a kind of geopolitical leaftone."
"I am permanently my files (Afghanistan, Syria, ...) before leaving," Gérard de Villiers added.
On the spot, I meet journalists, including AFP, diplomats, people I have known for some twenty or thirty years.
Suddenly, many of its SASs are often premonitionary: so, a month before the attack of an Syrian regime command center that killed several senior officials, he had told the story in "The Road of Damascus".
In "Les Fous de Benghazi", he had been the first to reveal the existence of a CIA secret command center in this city, the berque of the Libyan revolt.
In 1980, he staged the assassination of Egyptian President Anouar El-Sadate in "The plot of Cairo", a year before the assassination.
In October 2012, in "Panique in Bamako", he reported the columns of 4X4 jihadists based on Malian capital.
I am not a virgin, Gerard de Villiers defended himself, I simply make assumptions from countries I know well and, from time to time, some of my assumptions come true.
After these travels in frequently troubled areas, it was set up for a month after his machine to write IBM to Marguerite dated 1976 "from which all the parts have been changed".
300 pages later, he wrote the word "FIN" and corrected each page in style.
AK-47, erotic photos, and pictures of the author with African warlords are being added to the walls of his office.
Regularly involved in masquerading by feminist leagues and racism by human rights organizations, Gérard de Villiers dismissed these accusations in two sentences.
Some women are sexual objects in my books but others are beautiful, intelligent and brave women.
I'm always very welcome in Africa where I have a lot of readers.
Gerard de Villiers said, "Malko Linge, like all heroes, is not old."
He won't die and he won't retire.
Not more than me.
Airplanes want about the width of seats while large commands are in play
The dispute among the major aeronautical manufacturers about the width of the tourist class seats on long-run flights, opening the way to a bitter confrontation at the Dubai aeronautical lounge that takes place this month.
The conflict focuses on the width of the seats proposed for long-term flights to the passengers of the economic class – which are not always the shortest by airlines, but to which space is essential to increase the efficiency gains in the latest aircraft presented by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
This week, Airbus called on the aeronautical industry to establish a standard that imposes a seat size of at least 18 inches (45.72 cm) in economic classes, but its major American rival Boeing states that it should be for airlines to decide.
The dispute erupted while the aircraft were seeking to sell even larger versions of their bi-engine long-run aircraft, possibly waiting for a command record during the event that will take place from 17 to 21 November.
The way in which seats will be available at the rear of the plane – in particular, there will be 9 or 10 front seats – is essential for the economic performance of the mini-jumbo segment.
Boeing states that its refurbished "777X" will be able to accommodate 406 people in seats over 17 inches wide, and will be configured with 10 seats per row.
Airbus indicates that the competitive version of its A350 will carry 350 people in economic class in seats of 18 inches wide configured in rows of 9.
Aeronautics giants often exchange cuttings on technical issues by advertising in the professional press.
Today, Airbus calls it directly to the public before the Dubai Aeronautic Salon, where 777X should take the step on its competitors with more than 100 orders.
One recently reported what might be the beginning of a new advertising war with the presentation to the finance of a photo showing three people against each other at the restaurant, entitled "Would you accept this?".
"Boeing offers long-run flights in closer seats than in regional turbopropulsors," said John Leahy, commercial director of Airbus.
As food habits change, people grow, but the seats in the planes have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when Boeing's jumbo 747 defined the modern long-term journey, and the turning of the century, the average U.S. weight of 40 to 49 years increased by 10%, according to data from the U.S. Department of Health.
The average American turnover of the 21st century is 39.7 inches, according to U.S. health statistics.
Airbus states that its rival adheres to a concept of seat that dates back to the 1950s, when the circuit of the newly baptized device "get set" was more narrow.
Airbus adds that it ordered a study indicating that an additional drop in seat width would improve the quality of sleep by 53 per cent.
Boeing contests Airbus figures with regard to the width of seats and claims that it is not for the builders to decide how airlines balance the price of tickets and equipment.
He also says that the study shows that cabin experience does not only depend on the width of the seats.
"It is really about providing flexibility to airlines and allowing them to do what they think they should do in order to do their business well," said Kent Craver, in charge of the satisfaction of passengers at Boeing.
They don't want to be told what will allow them to be profitable.
They know their business better than anyone.
For passengers, it is more about having some freedom of movement, but for suppliers, it is increasingly a question that could affect their results.
After the dispute, there is a race to aircraft orders for an estimated amount of at least $700 Md at the market price in the coming decades, enough to balance US and European exports.
As Reuters indicated for the first time in July, the configuration of the seats is exactly what feeds the battle between all the last devices.
Airbus and Boeing both claim a seat performance in their latest models of long-distance bimotors 20 % higher than the market leader in this segment, the Boeing 777-300ER of 365 seats.
The performance announced by Boeing depends partly on the comparison between the 777X configured with 10 seats per row and a 777 model of origin configured in rows of 9.
The unit cost gain is low compared to the device configured with 10 seats per row currently in service.
"Boeing does this in order to be able to accommodate more seats and make its aircraft more competitive by relation to our products," said Kevin Kenston, Director of Comfort Passenger at the European Airbus aircraft.
On the other hand, analysts say that cabins with 10 seats per row in the 777 existing ones suggest that many passengers speak for a more denser configuration, which can be paired with cheaper rates.
"A seat width of 18 inches would be perfect for passengers, but the reality is that from a commercial point of view, the Airbus proposal is motivated by the threat of 777," said the expert inside Mary Kirby, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not provide seats, but offer a supplier catalogue among which airlines must choose.
The aircraft vendors that make the world's tour even carry a meter with them to check the competitive configurations.
While offering comfortable appliances, all manufacturers also offer aircraft with high density configurations for low-cost airlines and for regional travel.
Airbus offers an A350 configured with 10 seats per row but indicates that it has not yet been sold.
Until recently, Airbus stressed the need for greater customization of cabins by offering wider seats on some of its planes.
Without the support of the only major manufacturer of large modern devices, experts say that it is unlikely that his appeal to the aeronautics industry will set up a size standard for the cutting-edge seats, but that it could make it forget the sales wave of 777X.
The shareholders of Oracle are mistaken for Ellison's salary
A majority of Oracle shareholders voted on Thursday against the compensation proposal for the founder and director general Larry Ellison, given the financial performance of his group.
The vote is not binding, but it is due to slow down the image of Larry Ellison, the third world fortune just aureolated from the victory of his ship at the U.S. Cup.
The billionaire still holds 25% of the capital of the software group he co-founded 40 years ago.
Last year, Ellison had voted negatively on his remuneration.
Oracle's boss resigned to a $1.2 million bonus for the fiscal year 2013 closed in May due to the group's poor performance, which lacked its growth goals, but he found about $77 million related to stock options.
His fixed salary is just a symbolic dollar.
Over the entire fiscal year of 2013, Oracle's net profit increased by 3.5%, while the bonded stock exchange rate of 27.5%, exceeding the S&P-500 index that took 24% at the same time.
The new anti-nicotinic vaccine may eliminate the pleasure of smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotinic vaccine that could eliminate the pleasure of smoking a cigarette.
A single dose of the vaccine has been able to protect the mouse from nicotine dependence.
Other tests are required before testing on the human being, but Professor Ronald Crystal of the Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the first signs were encouraging.
"We really hope that this kind of vaccine strategy will help millions of smokers who have tried to stop, exhausting all the methods available on the market today, but discover that their addiction is strong enough to overcome these different approaches," said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains an harmless virus that has been modified to transport the genetic information needed to design anti-nicotinic antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then begins to produce a regular flow of antibodies.
Antibodys trace all nicotine molecules present in the blood system and neutralize them before reaching the brain, preventing the smoker from having its dose of nicotine.
In the tests, the vaccineed mice to which nicotine was then given continued their activity normally.
But the mice that had not been vaccinated were "suffered", the researchers said, sign that nicotine had reached their brain.
Experiences are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines were ineffective because they contained antibodies.
Injections should be repeated so often that levels of antibodies remain high that they were too expensive and little practical.
But the cost of the new vaccine should be much lower because it transforms the liver cells into antibodies.
Professor Crystal said that if the future human-use vaccine was completely safe, it could be administered to children before they are tempted to try a cigarette, which would prevent any addiction to nicotine.
But it is more likely to be used by smokers who want to stop smoking.
"They will know that if they start smoking again, they will not enjoy it because of the anti-nicotinic vaccine, and this will help them to lose their bad habit," he added.
British scientists have stated that the results were interesting but have reported that much more thorough research was needed.
The leader of Pakistani Taliban killed by a drone
The leader of the Pakistani Taliban movement, Hakimullah Mehsud, was killed in a hit of an American drone in Pakistan on Friday, learned from security services.
The death of Hakimullah Mehsud has been announced several times in the past.
But information, army and activist movement officials said this time that he had lost his life in this strike, which was carried out in the North-Waziristan region.
"We can confirm that Hakimullah Mehsud was killed in a drone," said a high security officer.
The guard, Pakistan's Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, moving to London, had informed the British government that discussions had been initiated with Tehran and Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the Pakistani Taliban movement.
Tripodi not affected by Obeid
The former New Wales Labour Minister Joe Tripodi will be investigated by the State Anti-Corruption Regulator.
The former Minister of New Wales of the South Joe Tripodi refused to change the commercial goods policy at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three property located in the government-controlled area.
Friday, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) expanded its investigation to find out if Mr. Obeid had pressured several government ministers to renew his bags in Circular Quay, where the Obeid had two restaurants and a coffee, after their expiry in August 2005, without any tenders.
She now investigates the allegations that Mr. Tripodi was aware of Mr. Obeid's secret interest in these properties, following the testimony of the former Deputy Secretary-General of Mr. Tripodi, Lynne Ashpole, on Thursday.
During the years of discussions started in 2005, the government pressured the banks to make a bid.
The tenants were opposed and wanted longer periods as well.
In 2009, the bonds for Circular Quay companies, which related to Obeid about $2.5 million a year, were renewed without any calls for tenders.
Mr. Tripodi, who served as Minister of Ports from February 2006 to November 2009, was at the forefront of the tenders.
However, he refused to change his policy at the request of Mr. Obeid, who, recognizing Mr. Tripodi, called for a change in the government's policy in terms of wages.
The transcription of telephone conversations presented to ICAO showed calls in August and September 2007 between Mr. Obeid, Mr. Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had arrived in the Ports department after working under the order of Mr. Obeid in the Fisheries Department.
"Was the subject discussed during these telephone conversations the development of the commercial lease policy?" asked Deputy Commissioner Anthony Wheely to Mr. Tripodi.
"No," answered Mr. Tripodi.
I don't remember what we talked about, but in any case, it wasn't.
Certainly not between me and Mr. Obeid.
Israeli warplanes target Syria, declare a responsible
Israeli warplanes reached a target in the Syrian port city of Latakia on Thursday night, confirms a military officer in Fox News.
The manager did not specify the target, but said that there was at least one target.
The Associated Press reports that the target was Russian production missiles SA-125.
At least twice this year, Israel has launched air strikes against missile shipments in Syria.
Foreign workers in possession of a visa 457 may have to pass a "authentic" test
The Government is currently examining the possibility of establishing a "authenticity" test for foreign workers in possession of a visa of 457 while considering extending the measures of repression.
The test, if adopted, would be applied according to a criterion to prevent 457 visas from being used to occupy unqualified positions or as a diversional means to bring his family and friends to Australia.
A government working paper was released today, while the working MP Maxine McKew denounced the government's speech on foreign workers, saying he could offend the neighbours of Australia.
"Failure statements about "foreigners returning to the end of the file" and "work for the first Australians" are a distasteful return to the time when trade unions asked for a protected labour market," she told Australia India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that the work of the Whites should be protected – and I would not be surprised that some countries in the region see it as an echo to this historic artefact.
The working paper refers to the 12 measures previously envisaged by the former Minister of Immigration Chris Bowen.
The Minister of Immigration Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka to meet with seniors responsible for discussing trafficking in human beings, implemented five of the recommended changes, while the others were under review.
If the "authenticity" criterion was adopted, a visa applicant could be checked to know "if the job offer is authentic in the case where the applicant is a personal relationship or associate of the owner or person concerned within the sponsoring company".
Businesses could also be required to declare the number of visa holders 457 after some of them, having intended to sponsor a small number of workers, have actually employed hundreds of them.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum-seeker would have died of a heart attack after arriving on a ship carrying asylum-seekers to Christmas Island this week.
The angry son of the man, 9 years old, had been in Australia with him and found some comfort since the death of his father on Wednesday at an adult cousin who was also on board.
The man was transferred urgently by the Australian authorities to the hospital on Christmas Island, where he died.
A study aimed at increasing the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland was launched by the British Government.
The work carried out by HS2 Ltd suggests that high-speed services to Scotland and the north of England will start as soon as Phase 1 opening in 2026.
The Minister of Transport Baronne Kramer stated that the project would "assemble the United Kingdom".
The Scottish Minister of Transport Keith Brown called himself "excited" to work with the British government on the project.
Phase 1 will be on a new high-speed rail line between London and the West Midlands.
When Phase 2 is completed, the lines will serve Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government revised the estimated cost of building the high-speed link between London and the north of England, from $32.7 billion to £42.6 billion.
The British Government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, has asked HS2 Ltd to study the strengthening of railway capacity and the improvement of the length of the roads for northern England and Scotland.
This must include the possibility of a three-hour trip between Glasgow and Edinburgh.
Baronne Kramer said: "Our goal for HS2 is to build a truly national network that will bring the United Kingdom and its cities closer together."
We push the HS2 project because the benefits it presents are huge.
Without it, we are facing a capacity problem of our rail network.
But it is also about developing connectivity between the 18 major British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, so that links between them are better thanks to HS2.
The British Secretary of State for Scotland, Alistair Carmichael, added: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
For the Scottish government, Keith Brown called on Mr. Carmichael to support the inclusion of Scotland in the HS2 network.
Mr. Brown said: "The high-speed train has the potential to offer considerable economic benefits to Scotland, but it also brings the economic weight of Scotland in the overall high-speed rail network project throughout Great Britain.
"We are therefore excited about working in partnership with the British Government to examine options to bring the high-speed train network to Scotland, creating an advantage for all and complementing the line Glasgow-Ediburg that the Scottish government is already planning.
"I am reluctant to read the review report with the British ministers next year and we will then decide all the next steps."
The rules on the use of on-board electronic devices remain in force for the moment in Australia
Australian air passengers will have to continue to expand their tablets and smartphones during take-off and landing, despite the United States gesture, to speed up electronic devices regulation.
The Federal Aviation Administration has left the door open for US carriers to change their procedures so that passengers can read electronic books, watch videos or play games on their devices during critical flight phases provided they are in "aircraft".
Passengers can already do so during most of the flight, but many people find it painful to be unable to access their electronic books during take-off and landing.
Australian carriers are considering the decision which obliges US carriers to do an important job to meet the requirements, but have indicated that they do not intend to change their procedures immediately.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also stated that it was reviewing the ad but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices during critical flight phases were still in force in Australia.
"CASA does not have specific regulations governing the use of electronic aircraft," she said.
The issue is the subject of a regulation which obliges aircraft operators to ensure the maintenance of safety at all times and passengers to comply with the safety instructions given by crew members.
Virgin, who had already spoken to CASA of her intention to extend the use of her on-board entertainment system using Wi-Fi technology, was open to a change, but stated that she would follow the regulator.
"We would welcome a revision of the CASA that would allow the use of electronic devices because we really think this would improve our customer experience now that we have (from the on-board entertainment system using Wi-Fi technology) on our planes," said a spokesperson.
Quantas stated that she was in compliance with the current rules for the time being.
"In accordance with our current policy, electronic devices cannot be used during take-off and landing, and we do not intend to change this immediately," she said.
The FAA decision applies to US airlines.
However, we are still interested in regulatory developments that could benefit passengers, and we will look closely at the decision of the FAA and its reasons.
For American carriers, the impact of the decision will vary from one airline to another and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Transporters will have to demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate radio interferences from electronic devices, as well as manuals, training equipment, hand luggage delivery programs, and the instructions provided to passengers.
"As soon as an airline has verified the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use light portable electronic devices, such as tablets, electronic book readers and smartphones at all altitudes," the FAA said.
In rare cases of low visibility, the crew will ask passengers to extend their equipment during landing.
The group also recommended that the heavier devices be classified safely under the seats or in the upper compartments during take-off and landing.
Pia: at least four injured in a violent baccarare
The small town of Pia experienced an unusual excess of fever on Thursday night.
Three gendarmerie vehicles, two ambulances and a group of thirty people according to the evidence collected...
On this Halloween day, the evening was agitated by the side of Pia where a race involving several people exploded on the side of the Post.
At least four minor injuries would be regrettable.
Alertly, the gendarmeries have become available to separate the belligerents and to ensure that the wounded are taken care of.
The Singaporen loaners benefit from the average class forced to close the bond
Janani Amirthalinga, a gold earring ringer and a pair of golden earrings to pay the school fees of her daughters, is a lender at the Bendemeer shopping centre in Singapore.
"My husband and I just bought a house, so all my money is gone," says Ms. Amirhalinga.
Although she earns $3,000 from Singapore $2,400 a month as an administrator and her husband also works, the monthly family income is not enough, she says.
In fact, the application is such in some parts of Southeast Asia – where the housing of households increases – that ValueMax, where it carried out its transaction, became the third bank loan company this week to be introduced to the Singapore Stock Exchange.
Making jewelry is not only a quick way to get money from Singapore – $1,300 in the case of Ms. Amirthalinga – but it is almost as good a market as non-guaranteed bank loans.
In general, Singapore's loan lenders receive an effective annual interest rate of 17%, just above the 15.4% offered by the United Overseas Bank, a local funder with a branch in the same commercial centre.
However, the lenders in charge have the advantage of not asking for a solvency check or evidence of salary, and they can unlock loans more quickly than banks.
As a result, millions of people across the region turn to bankers while families feel the pressure to increase the cost of living and overcrowding households and consumers.
After five years of strong growth since the global financial crisis, and the sound market credit provided by a monetary policy that is too lax in advanced economies, low and medium-income families turn to gambling lenders to fill the difference while their economies are slowing down.
This week, the Standard & Poor's rating agency quoted the growing debt of households, mainly due to the rise in mortgage loans, as a risk factor for the solvency of Asian banks.
It stated that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had recorded the high-end ratio of households/gross domestic products in Asia.
Malaysia ranks at 80% of GDP, while this rate rose to 60% in 2008.
Economists also fear the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which came out of a technical recession this week.
On Thursday, data showed a continued drop in exports and a slowdown in consumer demand.
"The balance sheet is that with higher costs, people in the middle or bottom [of the salary scale] are trying to complete their income as they can," says Song Seng Wun, an economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
The historically high prices of gold over the past two years have forced people to take care of their personal effects to touch the value of their jewelry.
In Singapore, about 70 per cent of the items in the 200 loan shops in the city are in gold.
People say, "The price of gold is high, let's take the gold chain off and we'll get it back next month."
In Thailand, the largest retail lending operator, EasyMoney, has recorded an increase of 20% of customers using its stores over the last few months.
The increase is such in the stock loan sector as ValueMax, operator of the store in Bendemeer and of 15 other shops like that in Singapore, plans to develop not only in neighbouring Malaysia – where it already has four shops – but also outside Asia, says Yea Lee Ching, its Director General.
The company will finance them using 60 per cent of Singapore's $66 million that it raised this week at its introduction to the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some low-rate lenders have challenged the criticisms of the exorbitant interest rates that they are practicing, Ms. Yeah points out that the lending offer not only lower rates than other lenders, but also does not directly increase debt.
"Customers are assuming assets they already own, and moneying their personal property does not increase the debt of households," she said.
The management is better socially accepted as a means of obtaining a guaranteed short-term funding.
The people who go to the banks in charge are not only those who have financial problems.
Singapore's easy-to-use people also go to ValueMax's cash-purchase loan shops to pay for Gold Coats or Rolex Watches, which can account for up to 60% of their cash-purchase prices.
We see customers from all layers of society.
"It may be easy people who need to borrow in the short term for business or investment, or small businesses who need to spend a hard time," she adds.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
Pastor charged with juvenile pornography in Nova Scotia
A pastor who took care of young people in the Halifax region in Nova Scotia is accused of juvenile pornography.
Aaron Hudgins, aged 30, was arrested on Friday morning following searches at his home and at the National Research Council office where he works.
The Baptist Church of Timberlay, where the pastor was an official, was deeply attuned to this news.
In a communiqué, church officials indicate that Mr. Hudgins resigned from his position.
The pastor was released under conditions.
In particular, it must not communicate with persons under the age of 18 and should not access the Internet.
It will be compared in provincial court in Halifax in December.
He goes in Nazi uniform to the supermarket, before being kicked
A man dressed in a Nazi uniform surrounded by a brassard with the glammed cross was asked to leave an English supermarket, customers complaining to the head of the establishment that called the police, said the store on Friday.
"We received several complaints from customers, so we asked him to leave the store," explained a spokesperson from the Asda supermarket chain.
The store called the police to the rescue, but "the time she arrived, he was already gone without a spark," she added.
I was making the tail when I saw a woman who seemed to be upset.
People were good mouth.
"You don't go out in the street like this unless you want to draw attention," said a customer, Rosina Rusin, 60 years old, at Cambridge News.
This incident took place Thursday, Halloween's day, where it's customary to take off in a monster, but it was hard to know if it was a canal.
A Cambridge man claimed responsibility for this act on his Twitter account, where he posted pictures of Adolf Hitler.
"I've been wearing a black SS brassard twice a week at Asda for three years," said Paul Dutton, explaining suffering from "mental problems".
Saving plan of $325 M devoted to the health system of Tasmania
The federal government maintains that the $325 million rescue plan for the vacillating health system is subject to strict conditions to ensure that the Government of the State will not waste funds.
The Federal Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth is currently taking "emergency measures" to end a crisis caused by the ageing of the island population, the high rate of chronic diseases and the constraints of the system.
Funding, scheduled for 4 years, was decided after government consultations with the independent Member of Tasmania, Andrew Wilkie.
"The government has proposed an emergency rescue plan that, we believe, will address the unique challenges facing the State," said Ms. Plibersek today.
The $325M plan includes a $31M campaign for non-emergency surgery.
2 600 additional operations, particularly in the field of orthopedic surgery and cataract, will help to delay delay.
Funding is also provided for unrestrained clinics in Hobart and Lanceston, with better external care, training of medical staff, mental health services and the deployment of electronic medical records systems in local hospitals.
"These investments correspond to the idea that, according to first-line clinicians, it is the best way to care for the health system in Tasmania," said Ms. Plibersek.
The Minister stated that the Government of Tasmania would face a strict reporting and accountability regime.
The State will have to maintain the current funding levels in order to receive the money from the Commonwealth and prepare monthly reports on the sectors where it spends the additional funds.
A three-person commission will be established to ensure that the State provides the services as efficiently and efficiently as possible.
Today, Mr. Wilkie said that the $325 million would not account for anything “unless they were followed by a real reform to consolidate the public health system in Tasmania”.
However, he commended the Government for responding to the urgent request for assistance submitted to the Prime Minister in early May.
"I hope that the federal aid plan will greatly contribute to removing the public health system from the black list of Tasmania," said Wilkie.
According to the Government of the State, these non-emergency additional procedures will largely reverse the recent coups.
But Peter Dutton's spokesman for the health opposition thinks today's announcement is a "a solution of fortune."
"The reason why we are here is that the state laborist government has withdrawn $430 million from its health system," he said on ABC TV.
We cannot have a government of the state that pulls almost half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth that puts $300 million, and claims it's a fast day.
Mr. Dutton visited Ms. Plibersek to ensure that no dollars of the rescue plan will be spent in additional bureaucracy.
The adaptation by Guillaume Nicloux of Denis Diderot's novel is a remarkable artistic direction and a minute-time reconstruction, but it is also more laborious than it should be.
In France in the 1760s, she tells the dark story of Suzanne, a young aristocrat sent to a convent by her family.
When she rebels, she faces cruelty without the support of a Mother Superior deliberately sad and becomes an object of erotic fascination for another.
The film will never be seen in morbidity or sensationalism, and that's the problem.
Consciousness of the narrative could also become a prison for the public.
Syria destroyed its chemical weapons production capacity, states the monitoring body
Syria destroyed essential equipment for the production of chemical weapons and ammunition filled with toxic gas, said the International Chemical Weapons Monitoring Agency on Thursday, while violent confrontations were raging in the north of the country, near one of the sites where toxic agents are supposed to be stored.
A group of Syrian militants also stated Thursday that more than 120,000 people had been killed since the beginning of the civil war in the country nearly three years ago.
The announcement of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OIAC) arrived with a day of advance on the deadline for the
On 1 November, the Hague-based organization ordered Damas to destroy or "make useless" all chemical weapons production units and machinery for mixing toxic gases and filling ammunition.
The completion of what is essentially the initial phase of destruction is an important step in the ambitious timetable for the destruction of Damascus's chemical weapons by mid-2014.
With the destruction of equipment, Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus still has to begin the destruction of existing weapons and reserves.
It is believed that the country has about 1,000 tons of chemical products and weapons, including mutated gas and the sarin neurotoxic agent.
The announcement was made while fighting Thursday in the city of Safira which, according to experts, opens a chemical weapon production unit as well as storage sites, reported the Syrian Human Rights Observatory in Great Britain.
The group of militants, following the evolution of the human balance through a network of Syrian-based militants, said Thursday that 120,296 people were dead.
Among them, it is estimated that there were 61,067 civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the Government's side, it is estimated that 29,954 members of the armed forces of President Bachar el-Assad were killed, 18 678 of whom were pro-government soldiers and 187 of the Lebanese Hezbollah militants.
Among the dead, it is also estimated that 2,202 were deserters and some 5,375 of the opposition fighters, many of whom were foreign.
On 25 July, the United Nations estimated that 100,000 people had died in the conflict since March 2011.
She hasn't updated that figure since.
Some 2 million people had to flee the country because of the conflict.
El Assad's troops have been fighting rebels, many of which are linked to groups of the Al-Qaida network in Safira for weeks.
The Observatory stated Thursday that there were losses on both sides, but it did not specify.
The fights highlighted the importance of the dangers faced by chemical weapons inspectors when they were to complete their mission, which was to disband Syria from its toxic arsenal in the midst of a lost civil war, in close times.
A OIAC statement, working closely with the United Nations, indicated that its team was "now satisfied with having controlled – and destroyed – all the critical production and machinery for mixing and filling".
She added that "no other inspection activity was planned for the time being".
Earlier this week, the inspectors stated that they had completed the first phase of the audit work, visiting 21 of the 23 sites reported by Damascus.
They were unable to visit the last two sites due to concerns about their safety, the inspectors reported.
On Thursday, OIAC said that the two sites were, according to Syria, "refused and... that the elements of the chemical weapons program they contained had been moved to other reported sites, which were inspected".
It was difficult to know at first sight whether the Safira unit was one of the two sites that OIAC inspectors could not visit.
Syria submitted a plan for the total destruction of its chemical weapons, which was approved by the OIAC Executive Committee the following month.
"I welcome the moral strength and courage that you all have shown in the most difficult mission ever undertaken by this organization," said the Director General of the Ahmet Uzumcu organization, in a comment published by the OIAC.
Now in its third year, the civil war mainly opposes the Sunni Muslim rebels to the government of El Assad and its security forces, which are supported by members of the Alaouite sect, a branch of Shiite Islam.
On the other hand, the Director of the Syrian Human Rights Observatory stated that there was a strong explosion on Wednesday in an air defence base in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion remains unknown, he added.
Anger caused by the sentence pronounced against one of Bali's bombers
The survivors and close relatives of the 202 people killed in the attacks of Bali in 2002 reacted with anger to the sentence against the last of the conspirators to be brought to justice, saying that Umar Patek should be shot by an execution platoon.
Patek, who spent almost 10 years running as one of the most wanted men in Southeast Asia, was sentenced to 20 years in prison yesterday for his role in the manufacture of explosive devices used in attacks.
It could be released at the end of 15 years under conditional release.
The 45-year-old man was found guilty of mass murder for attacks targeting two night boxes in the popular tourist district of Kuta, which caused the death of 202 people, including 88 Australians, and caused many injuries.
It was also found guilty of many other charges in relation to terrorism, including a wave of attacks on churches throughout Indonesia in the wake of November 2000.
The prosecutors have applied for a permanent detention penalty, but they could have asked for a man, qualified as "Demolition Man" for his reputation as an expert in the production of bombs, or sentenced to death.
The decision overturned painful memories for June Corteen, a mother of Perth who lost her two twins 39 years old, Jane and Jenny, in the destructions experienced by Patek and other conspirators nearly 10 years ago.
On the side of the tears, she stated that Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really think he should have followed the same path as the other men.
"It should be brought to the execution platoon," Mrs. Corteen told the AAP.
I have to live every day without having any other children or seeing my daughters.
The Sari Club was completely destroyed when an enormous bomb, loaded in an outdoor van, exploded just after 23.00 a.m. on 12 October 2002.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's Bar when a kamikaze jumped a back bag with explosives just 20 seconds earlier.
He smeared in the coma the next day of the attack and remained unconscious for a month, and he was "dead" three times while he was in respiratory assistance.
Mr. Hughes said that Patek should have known the same way as the other three members of Jemah Islamiyah's terrorist cell responsible for the carnage – Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra – who were executed 4 years ago.
In fact, this man should have been sentenced to death before the others.
Keeping it alive, therefore, there is no reason to keep it alive.
Spend 20 years in prison after killing 202 people and hurting hundreds of others, that's not much.
Patek is the last of Bali's bombers to be translated into justice.
He had managed to avoid being captured for almost 10 years but was finally arrested in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where the American forces will kill the former leader of Al-Qaida, Oussama ben Laden, less than four months later.
During the trial, an FBI officer stated that reports of intelligence services had revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet Ben Laden in order to restore ties between the terrorist groups in Southeast Asia and Al-Qaida.
"He didn't make it," she added.
Until recently, he felt overwhelmed by the grief he had caused to others.
The verdict was brought to the attention of the 10th anniversary of the attacks that will be celebrated later this year and marked by ceremonies in Bali and Australia.
"There will be a lot of tears this year," said Mrs. Corteen.
Patek may, however, appeal for his conviction.
FAA: Air passengers can now use aircraft gadgets (but do not pass a call with their mobile phone)
Passengers from airlines will be able to use their electronic door-to-door devices to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music – but not to talk on their mobile phone – under the new very expected directives published on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration.
But passengers should not expect immediate changes.
The speed with which the change will be introduced will vary from one airline to another, said FAA administrator Michael Huerta at a press conference.
Air carriers will have to prove to the FAA that their aircraft complies with the new guidelines and that they have updated the training manuals for crew members and the rules on the handling of equipment for compliance.
The FAA stated that it had already received plans from certain airlines to expand the use of electronic devices on their aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue are among the companies that have already submitted plans.
"On the basis of the plan, we could approve an expanded use of electronic devices very soon," the FAA stated in a statement.
Currently, passengers must extend their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the doors of the aircraft are closed.
They are not supposed to light them before the plane reaches a height of 10,000 feet and the commander gives its green light.
Passengers shall be required to extend their devices during the landing of the aircraft before landing and not to let them down until the aircraft has landed.
Under the new guidelines, air carriers whose aeroplanes are properly protected from electronic interference will be able to allow passengers to use their equipment during take-offs, landings and ground rolling, the FAA said.
Most of the new line and other aircraft that have been modified so that passengers can use the Wi-Fi at higher altitudes should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Flight Expectants, said he was pleased with these changes.
" Once the new policy is implemented safely – and we will work closely with the carriers for this – it will be beneficial to everyone," Glading explained in a statement.
We are quite tired of feeling like "room supervisors" when it comes to this issue.
But it will always be prohibited to connect to the Internet to browse, exchange emails and SMS or download data below 10,000 feet, the agency said.
Passengers will have to put their smartphones, tablets and other aircraft devices.
So not always from Words With Friends, the Scrabble-style online game that actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011 when he was kicked out by a American Airlines plane after refusing to extend his device while the device was locked at the door.
And the heavier devices like portable computers will always have to be arranged because they could hurt someone if they flew through the cabin.
On-board mobile phones will also continue to be banned.
The regulatory power for mobile phones belongs to the Federal Communications Commission and not to the FAA.
The FAA may impose a ban on certain electronic devices during take-off and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, a national safety expert on CBS News, said that mobile phones were always considered at risk.
"The portable phones are really a problem, not only because they could possibly create interferences with navigation tools, but because we know, according to the FCC, that they could disrupt mobile phone antennas if they are used on board," Rosenker said.
An industrial advisory committee established by the FAA to address the problem recommended last month that the government authorize the wider use of personal electronic devices.
The pressure on FAA has increased over the last few years to increase restrictions on their use.
Detractors such as Senator Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., argue that there is no reason for security for these prohibitions.
Restrictions are also increasingly difficult to apply because the use of devices has become omnipresent.
Some studies indicate that at least one third of passengers forget to extend their devices, or deliberately do so.
The FAA began to limit the use of electronic devices in 1996 following reports on the presence of interference with navigation and communication tools when passengers were transporting FM radios, the high-tech gadget at that time.
New line planes depend much more on electrical systems than the previous generation of aircraft, but they are also designed to resist electronic interference and approved by the FAA.
Air carriers allow their passengers to use Wi-Fi to cruise altitudes for several years.
The modified planes to host Wi-Fi systems are also better resistant to interference.
The vast majority of online aircraft should allow wider use of electronic devices under the new directives, Huerta said.
Today's electronic devices generally emit radio transmissions much lower than previous generations of devices.
E-book readers, for example, only emit minimal transmissions when a page is turned on.
But transmissions are stronger when the telex devices or send data.
Amazon.com is part of those who pressure to lower restrictions on the use of electronic devices by passengers.
In 2011, the company's leaders loaded a plane from Kindle's e-book readers and made it fly to see if there were any problems, but there was no one.
This has inspired the members of the FAO Advisory Committee on Mitigated Feelings on whether or not the use of devices presents a risk.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airlines Passengers stated that he thought interferences from devices were real, even if the risk was minimal.
Other committee members stated that there are only anecdotic reports from pilots that indicate that devices can interfere with the systems of an aircraft, and that most of them are very old.
However, the Committee recommended that FAA allow pilots to request passengers to extend their equipment during landings to instruments under low visibility conditions.
A group of the travel industry welcomed changes, calling them full-fledged arrangements for technology-equipped travellers.
"We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passerby experience is not incompatible with security," said Roger Dow, president and director of the U.S. Travel Association.
A helicopterd bird of a North Sea platform has been released in nature
A bird, helicopterd after being found exhausted on a North Sea oil platform, was released in nature.
The water line was mounted on board a helicopter in the direction of Aberdeen last month before it was delivered on foot by the Scottish SPCA in its rescue centre of Alloa.
The director of the centre, Colin Seddon, said: "This river of water was probably a winter migrant coming from northern Europe and was caught in the middle of violent winds in the North Sea."
It seems that the exhausted bird would have managed to find shelter on the oil platform.
He added: "It was impossible to fly again, so we were contacted to provide our help."
The water stream was in good health when it was released.
Is the European elite ready to do business with Britain?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with the promise to bring businesses together and to define what rich and employment creators want to see change in our relationship with the EU.
To this end, we ordered the widest and most complete investigation of British business leaders and asked them what they thought of Britain, businesses and the EU.
YouGov interviewed more than 1,000 business leaders, generally representative of all sizes of businesses, sectors and regions of Great Britain.
The findings of the investigation will be a surprise for many.
We have found that the vast majority of companies are now looking for exports outside Europe, focusing on countries that are modernising and developing while the EU states are stagnant.
They want the government to give priority to new trade links with countries such as China, India and Brazil rather than to get involved in the long and hard process of reforming European institutional arches.
When asked for their opinion on specific political issues – from the regulation of monopolies to product laws – most business leaders believe that controlling these key skills should return to Westminster's hands.
The single market has brought general discontent, companies saying that the cost of the Brussels Regulation is disproportionate to the benefits of the European trade area – 40% of the largest companies, traditionally the most pro-European ones, are even agreed.
Finally, and even more so, our investigation with business leaders revealed that an important majority wanted to see Britain pursue initiatives to change the Treaty and develop a trade-based relationship with the EU and not politics.
This conclusion, which is found in all major groups and businesses of all sizes, shows that the company's world insists on a "significant change" that gives power to the United Kingdom.
The issues are high – to change the Treaty and better represent the interests of Britain would make it possible to see 16% of the vote in favour of the country's maintenance in the EU at a referendum.
The Prime Minister should not doubt just one moment: this survey shows that British companies support this plan to renegotiate the terms of Britain's accession to the EU.
It also shows that companies expect renegotiation to be a significant change in the current balance of power in favour of a return to the United Kingdom.
It is possible, and increasingly necessary, to better represent the interests of British companies, as the euro area is engaged in a closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be employment and growth in Britain and, as the conclusions of our survey show, this means that for businesses this means re-emphasizing trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels regulatory approach.
United States of America in Halloween colors
In the United States, President Obama did not derogate from the Halloween tradition.
With his wife, last night, he distributed friends to hundreds of children invited to the gardens of the White House in Washington.
Last year, Halloween celebrations on the east coast of the United States had been cancelled due to the passage of the hurricane Sandy.
This year, therefore, the festivals have fallen apart.
In New York, thousands of people customarily participated in the parade organized in the district of Greenwich village.
Everyone is excited, tells one of the participants, Andrea.
I was finally able to put on the costume I had last year.
We're having fun like fools, adding Rhonda.
People are happy.
He's a good kid, he's cool.
We really need that.
Halloween is a pagan festival in the care of the Toussaint, mainly in the Anglo-Saxon countries.
Alexei Miller de Gazprom says Bulgaria's gas pipeline will open a new era of gas
The start of the construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of Europe's largest energy projects, said Gazprom Director.
"A historic event took place today: The construction began in the Bulgarian part of the South Stream pipeline, the largest-scale project in Europe," explained Alexei Miller, Director General of Gazprom, in a Thursday statement.
This project is a key element of energy security throughout the European continent.
South Stream should diversify Russia's export routes to Europe.
A contractual dispute between Gazprom and his counterpart from Ukraine, a country through which most of the Russian gas destined for Europe is transiting, increases the level of risk compared to conventional routes, adds the Director.
Miller added that direct association with Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are eliminated "forever".
Bulgarian consumers will receive South Stream gas at a reduced rate as soon as the entire project is implemented in 2015.
Gazprom indicated that construction should start in other countries down by the end of the year.
The gas pipeline was designed for an annual capacity of 63 billion cubic metres of natural gas.
Pitcairn wants to create the largest marine reserve in the world
Pitcairn Island wants to create the largest marine reserve in the world, announced Thursday the daily The Tahitian News, reviewing information from Radio Australia.
This island, east of the Gambier Archipelago (French Polynesia), is the last British territory of the South Pacific, halfway between New Zealand and Chile.
This territory measures 47 km2, if there are three other small islands nearby.
He's been British since his occupation in 1790 by the Mutinies of the Bonity, an episode of the history of the English Navy that led to three Hollywood adaptations.
A few dozens of people, mostly descendants of Bunty's mutants, still live in Pitcairn, and their income depends on 95% of London's generosity.
The Council of the Island voted unanimously in favour of the creation of a marine reserve around the small archipelago, 836.000 km2 corresponding to its exclusive economic area.
A deputy to the mayor of the island went to London to ask Britain to validate this request.
Mike Warren, Mayor of Pitcairn, believes that the creation of such a protected area would be a first step towards more financial autonomy for his island.
The project must be accepted by the English governor of Pitcairn, resident in New Zealand, and by the British Government.
The creation of such a marine reserve would allow the United Kingdom to sanctify these 836,000 km2, provided that it has the means to monitor it, which is not the case.
There is no airport in Pitcairn, which makes it impossible to base one or more aircraft dedicated to the surveillance of the area, and there is no port where to place military surveillance vessels.
With regard to France, it must already carry out the very costly air and maritime surveillance of the five million km2 of the French Polynesian EEA, neighbouring Pitcairn.

Life imprisonment for a former Chinese deputy governor
A former deputy governor of the province of Jilin, north-east of China, was sentenced to life imprisonment for corruption on Friday.
Excluding the Communist Party in July 2012, Tian Xueren was accused of touching more than 19 million pot-vin yuans, reports the Chinese official media.
Between 1995 and 2001, the Deputy Governor, who was also President of the Bank of Jilin, a public institution, helped businesses and responsible for obtaining contracts, loans or promotions in exchange for money or gifts, declared Beijing's first interim court on its microblog.
President Xi Jinping, who took up his duties last March, made the fight against corruption a national priority, believing that the phenomenon was a threat to the very existence of the Communist Party.
If the head of state promised that justice would be as intrusive with the powerful "tigers" as with the "mouses" - the under-alternal officials - only a handful of high-ranking officials were condemned, including former oil giant Petrochina's leaders.
The recent most spectacular case was that of the former head of the PCC in Chongqing, Bo Xilai, sentenced to life in September for corruption and abuse of power after having targeted the highest functions in the state.
However, the Government has not expressed its intention to reform the system of combating corruption by creating, for example, an independent party body.
Two YMCA employees accused of sexual assault following allegations made against Jonathan Lord at a hearing by the Royal Commission.
Two employees of the YMCA of New South Wales were accused of sexual assaults against children following allegations made against the educator of Caringbah, Jonathan Lord, in 2011, at a hearing by the Royal Commission on Sexual Abuse on Children.
But in its opening statement to the Commission, YMCA stated that it had "never had to deal with a problem of sexual assault on children within its organization".
Director General Phillip Hare was questioned about two cases: an employee of YMCA was charged with child pornography offences and a physical education monitor of YMCA Caringbah Hall was found guilty of sexual assault on children in the centre where he worked in 1991.
Mr. Hare said to Gail Furness, a counsellor with the Commission, that he had been aware of the first case but that he was not aware of the second.
He also admitted that the YMCA's opening statement was inaccurate by emphasising that "the external controls of YMCA were carried out and indicated that the safety of children was an absolute priority for the organization."
It was demonstrated to the Commission that YMCA had been informed that it had received the worst second assessments on four institutions during a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communities carried out in August this year.
Mr. Hare, who began working at the YMCA at the age of 21, admitted that staff management was a failure with Lord's recruitment and that he had failed to verify that employees knew that they had to report any violations of the child security policy.
Earlier in the year, Lord was sentenced for sexual assaults on twelve boys during the two years he worked at YMCA.
He was sentenced to a minimum sentence of 6 years.
But Mr. Hare rejected the idea that the YMCA would have a cultural problem preventing staff from reporting Lord's shortcomings to the safety of children.
Staff members testified that they had observed some shortcomings, including the fact that Lord remained alone with the children, that he kept them in private, that he had sat on his knees, that he loved them and that he had let them play with his mobile phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was led by Lord and who had asked for training in child protection because she was concerned about her behavior, indicated that she was responsible for the services of the YMCA Caringbah, Jacqui Barnat, who was going to bring Lord "very intimidating and difficult to approach most of the time".
The Director-General said that he rejected the testimony of staff that they were reluctant to report these shortcomings to their superior hierarchy.
Instead, he stated that the friendly relations they had with Lord had clouded their judgment, making them unwarranted.
Mr. Hare said that he had expressed his views before the Council of the New Wales YMCA of the South, saying that the lesson learned from "Jonathan Lord incident" should not concern "the signal" by staff, and the Board agreed with him.
Mr. Hare said that the decision to have staff sign confidentiality agreements, shortly after the allegations were made, was taken by the Director-General of the YMCA responsible for child services, Liam Whitley.
He stated that this decision was intended to avoid any contamination of the evidence but that it was an "exceeding of zeal" and that it had been misimplemented.
The YMCA of New South Wales was not a safe organization for children at the time Jonathan Lord was employed, i.e. between 2009 and 2011, said the expert on sexual violence against children, Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University in front of the Commission.
He indicated that there were "serious problems" in recruitment, control, initiation, training and supervision of staff.
The hearing was updated until 20 December.
Tony Blair said he would take the opportunity to return Prime Minister, but he recognizes that his return is unlikely.
In an interview last night marking the 5th anniversary of his departure at the end of his term of office, 59-year-old man made his views known on various national policies.
Since its departure in June 2007 after a decade at the head of the country, Mr. Blair has largely avoided discussing British policy, limiting his comments to foreign affairs and his special role as envoy of the Quartet for the Middle East peace process.
When asked if he would like to find the Prime Minister's position, Mr Blair would have replied, according to the London Standard Evening: "Yes, of course, but it may happen, so..."
When many experts in equestrian events met at Cardiff to face and win the horse's trophe of the year, they knew that the competition would be rough.
But no one was expecting to see Fenton Kirkland, a three-year-old.
Not yet at school and only a few months after making his first weapons, the small and his pony Shetland Toffee trolled during the three rounds with a great ease and won the first prize, leaving behind them the other 30 adult competitors.
The two inseparable – which are of the same size – were welcomed for the presentation, attitude and style during the annual competition that took place at the Sunnybank equestrian centre in Rudry near Cardiff.
In front of men and women in elegant melon hats, he wore his plate helmet slightly on the side undiscovered to depict his 2-year-old Toffee ponie around the track.
Fenton was greeted by the judges for his natural qualities of little common dress for a child of his age.
And Toffee received very good notes for his presentation and personality.
Fenton had Toffee as a gift for his 3rd anniversary last March and has been in with his pony Shetland every day.
His mother, Donna, aged 30, said, “Fenton and Toffee make a great dueo. ”
They appeared against and against all, but both drew the gold cut and the rosette.
It was only the second time he competed with Toffee and we were not happy that he won.
On the track, people who didn't know him thought it was so phenomenal that they wanted to take a photograph with him.
This young boy, from the village of Nantyglo, near Ebbw Vale, in the south of Wales, follows the tracks of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been participating in equestrian competitions for more than 10 years.
Ms. Howells said, "There was electricity in the air, and everyone would encourage it and praise it."
He traveled all the length of the track running and even if he seemed to be all small, he did a wonderful job.
Fenton is crazy about animals – he loves horses, tractors and the rural world and has two chickens he deals with.
In the way he began, he will certainly soon participate in the event of the Year's Horse – and I am sure he will make a good performance.
A spokesman for the annual equestrian event said: "Fenton is only 3 years old, but he knows how to drive his poniey."
They're forming a good team.
The judges noted that Fenton and Toffee were well present and the way they displayed on the track.
They are looking for an effective teamwork between the pony and the coach – Fenton and Toffee were the best on the track.
I'm sure his beautiful clothes helped Fenton, he was really proud.
A Chinese newspaper that launched a call "Will Be Remedied"
A Chinese newspaper that launched a first-page appeal for the release of a media journalist accused of defamation will be removed, says a press regulator.
The New Express based in Guangzhou published a rare public appeal for the release of the journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Mr. Chen later admitted to television that he had accepted pot-vins to make stories about a semi-public society.
Now the New Express will come up with a "full replacement," the regulator said.
The "remote" order is issued by the administration of Guangdon for the Press and the Edition, Radio, Film and Television.
A preliminary investigation showed that the New Express, belonging to the Yangcheng Evening News group, had published several wrong articles on the Zoomlion listed company between September 2012 and August 2013.
"New Express's drafting was unorganized," said the regulator in a statement.
He indicated that he had decided "to impose an administrative penalty in Chen Yongzhou by withdrawing his press card".
He also "ordered the Yangcheng Evening News group to undertake a complete replacement of New Express, and recommended that he conduct an investigation into the persons responsible for New Express and immediately withdraw the newspaper management team".
Mr. Chen wrote several articles for the New Express on the alleged financial irregularities of a manufacturer of construction equipment called Zoomlion.
After his arrest, his journal published a first-time appeal for his release, writing that he supported his journalism.
But then Mr. Chen appeared on a public television channel where he admitted to having published false stories against money.
"In this case, I hurt Zoomlion as well as the media industry and its ability to gain public confidence," he told the CCTV public television network.
I did it mainly because I ran after the money and the celebrity.
I realized my mistake.
Following Mr. Chen's excuses, New Express issued his excuses on the first page, writing that he had not properly verified his articles.
Several important suspects have recently made television broadcasts.
Experts say that people are systematically forced to make their own opinions, despite a change in the law that was voted earlier in the year banning the authorities from forcing anyone to commit themselves.
Charles-de-Gaulle aircraft port in "inaccessibility"
In Toulon, the plane's on fire.
The launch of radioactive vapour detected on one of Charles-de-Gaulle's two nuclear fuels in mid-October and while the ship was in the sea, was "without danger for the marines", but it is not without consequences for the Marine.
In fact, the Royale has just confirmed the "inaccessibility" of the ship until "November", "the time to take the corrective measures that are imposed" on the reactor.
On the other hand, the company DNCS, a specialist in the defence ship, ensures that its teams and Areva's teams, which are rushed into the Var for the occasion, are "currently involved on the aircraft".
It is for them, among other things, to change a pump on the defective heater.
"All is implemented so that Charles-de-Gaulle can make its planned deployment by the end of 2013," explains DCNS.
And the National Marine to make sure that "it doesn't cause the ship's activity program at any point" to nuclear propulsion.
Let us remember that Charles-de-Gaulle's plane takes off a six-month interim maintenance period.
He had been equipped from Toulon to mid-October for training.
This, in particular, is intended to qualify the young hunting pilots.
A "small accident", surrounded by the reactor's confining space, was then produced on the amiral ship of the French fleet.
According to the National Marine, the crew had not been exposed to any radioactive contamination.
For more than a year, I have been able to find a great discontent on the part of the people I meet: a monstrous reassessment of their properties, a tax discharge, the cost of permits of all kinds, administrative costs to end.
Brief, no limit to our pockets.
Millions of dilapidated dollars could be spared in order to allow for a very respectful taxation of those who pay.
Any money taken from strength to taxpayers reduces their freedom of consumption and contributes to their recovery.
In Shawinigan, despite the closure of all major enterprises, there is no mention of sudden spending and the maintenance of housing candors: a poor cultural centre, a strong grant to the City of Energy, etc.
If these facilities are not profitable, either they are sold to the private company or they are demolished.
It is also difficult to detect the expropriation of several properties in order to host a major industry that has never come.
However, I give an honourable mention of the transformation of former Wabasso into an industrial incubator, but what is the cost for taxpayers?
It is not for the public to invest in such companies, but for the private sector on the basis of consumer demand.
Citizens were happy to learn that lakes in the Fish and Piles will continue to supply the city with drinking water.
Following the departure of all industries (large water consumers) and the major decline in the population, the use of water decreased considerably throughout the territory.
Without saying to waste it, the city will never lack water and the severe regulation on its use could be heavily charged.
In short, it is very easy to achieve great things with the money of others.
I'd be ashamed to defend such a balance.
With a gross debt of more than $200 million, this city is not even able to buy a style without a loan settlement.
For more than 40 years, we've been managed by tieups with beautiful diplomas for most people, and I don't think a raiser of sheep gets worse.
Discovery of a drug tunnel between the United States and Mexico with its own railway
One of the most sophisticated tunnels used for drug trafficking between the United States and Mexico, with its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail systems, has been discovered.
The American authorities described the tunnel of 4 feet by 3 as one of the most sophisticated secret passages they've ever seen.
The tunnel, with an equivalent length of almost six long football pitches, connects the warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, San Diego, the United States.
The area has indefinable storage facilities, which allows easy to dissipate drug-loaded trucks.
The tunnel was closed before drugs were responsibly absorbed, the authorities said.
The authorities seized 8.5 tons of marijuana and 148 kg of cocaine after the discovery of the tunnel, according to the court records.
Three men who, according to the authorities, worked as drivers, were accused of possession of marijuana and cocaine for sale.
They are sentenced to 10 years in prison to life imprisonment if they are sentenced.
In Nogales, Arizona, traders operate large underground drainage channels.
The tunnel has been the eighth major passage to San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels have been discovered following the harvest of marijuana in the center of Mexico in October, thus challenging drug cartels that must quickly deliver their products to consumers.
In 2010, the authorities found a passage of about 700 yards equipped with railways that was part of the kitchen of a house in Tijuana and went up to two San Diego warehouses.
The British Police issues an extradition mandate against Assange
The British police today issued an extradition mandate against the founder of WikiLeaks Julian Assange, who fled to the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and asked for political asylum.
Scotland Yard stated that she had issued a "delivery notice" against 40-year-old Australians, asking him to present himself to a police station, adding that if he didn't, it would be possible to be arrested.
Assange could be extradited in Sweden following allegations of sexual crime, after having exhausted all possible ways under British law after the Supreme Court invalidated the appeal he filed against his extradition at the beginning of the month.
Fearing that Stockholm would allow its transfer to the United States, he found refuge at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on 19 June, asking this country of South America for political asylum.
Scotland Yard "issued a notice of surrender against a 40-year-old man who asked him to present himself to a police station, at the date and time of his choice," said a spokesperson.
It continues to breach the conditions of its release under bail.
The Embassy refused to comment on the issue of the notice by the police.
He was afraid of being expelled from Sweden to the United States where he could be accused of espionage, after having deployed more than 250,000 American diplomatic cables on WikiLeaks' website against classified information.
How biometrics invaded our lives
Do you end the password to tap to access your smartphone or pay your purchases?
American, French or Japanese researchers predict a future where we will be recognized by the biometric sensors of phones and computers.
Bernard Didier, Deputy Director General of Morpho, believes that "the century will be biometric".
Only biometrics will ensure the identity of a person carrying out transactions in a transverse and transnational universe as well as the Internet.
The organizations dedicated to the protection of privacy confirm this commitment to biometrics, but worry about it.
In 2011 and France, the National Commission for Information and Freedoms authorized 774 systems for the recognition of fingerprints, hand-forms or hand-linked network in companies, administrations, canteens...
"Everyone will soon be able to be identified, wherever and whenever," said Justin Brookman, who is responsible for the private life of consumers in the CDT (Center for Democracy and Technology), in Washington.
The reasons for such optimism, one at a time, and one at a time, the other at a time?
Biometrics will be based on new techniques, which will allow new services to be provided to citizens and consumers.
Today, in France, the most widely used biometric data are digital prints, hand contours and the neighbouring network of thumbs or fingers.
But each of these techniques has its own constraints.
"For example, some people who work concrete have very thin fingers and their prints are inaccessible," says Philippe Robin, technical director of the field of identity at Thales Communications & Security.
And the collection, as well as the verification of the neighbouring network and the surrounding hand, assume a voluntary and precise gesture of persons.
It is both security - we cannot capture this data at their own expense - and a disadvantage: the procedure must sometimes be repeated and therefore takes time.
As a result, research has been conducted for twenty years on other approaches, such as facial recognition or iris (the colored part of the eye).
The increase in the accuracy of the sensors and the ability to calculate the computers required for the analysis of the data makes these techniques operational.
The precision of facial recognition has been multiplied by ten in the last five years, calculates Cyrille Bataller, director of the Accenture R&D laboratories in Europe.
With our help, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands have deployed automatic border posts using facial recognition.
It is now possible to identify a face or an iris in motion.
"Today, we conduct research on the recognition of the voice or how to walk with sound sensors, but there is a need for a quiet environment," says Sridhar Iyingar, director of Intel Labs' safety research.
A unique and infallible marker, DNA also arouses hopes and concerns.
"In the current state of knowledge, it can be considered as the ultimate biometric data," confirms Sophie Vuljet-Tavernier, Director of Studies, Innovation and Perspective at CNIL.
But DNA analysis is still very long and very expensive.
NEC offers judicial police services a voucher of €90,000 to analyse DNA samples at the scene of a crime and in an hour.
The use of biometrics is divided into two groups: identification (recognizing one person among others) and authentication (to ensure that the person is what it claims to be).
The identification concerned the issue of identity papers so far: biometric elements (prints, photos, iris) must be compared with information that the State has on all citizens already posted.
This ensures that no one tries to abuse someone else's identity.
This principle of comparison may have other applications.
NEC thus proposes the recognition of VIP at the entrance of a hotel or store.
"We will recover the images from surveillance cameras and compare them to photos of celebrities that circulate freely on the Internet," explains Dany Nassif, in charge of commercial development at NEC France for biometric identification solutions.
Another use: take a photo of a person who makes the queu in a store, follow his progress through facial recognition and calculate the waiting time.
The authentication initially concerned physical access (frontiers, protected premises, canteens...) or logical (opening a computer).
More recently, the presence control has been added.
"One biometric point avoids the phenomenon of the peer that points to another," explains Cyrille Bataller, of accenture.
Moreover, authentication will also cover transactions, in particular those made from Internet-connected devices.
In Japan, it is already possible to withdraw money from some distributors by entering his card and placing his hand on a biometric reader: this gesture replaces the trap of the secret code.
A similar technique is tested in Villeneuve-d'Ascq and Angoulême by the Natural Security company in partnership with banks and teachers of the large distribution: when paying in store with its bank card, the customer does not type his code, but introduces his finger into a reader who scans the veins.
The experiment is planned for six months.
If it is conclusive, biometric readers could soon arrive at the French traders.
Guides to Ensuring Users
There are three ways to make biometric seductive in the eyes of the general public.
The first is to explain that she can make time.
"If, thanks to biometrics, a client stays in a box for 30 seconds less, it is valuable," explains the director of a large surface.
The second is to offer personalized services: in a few years, a voice server will be able to recognize your voice and offer you measurement options.
And, finally, make sure by putting the precautions taken to protect the databases.
"The digital prints are stored on a first server; the identities of people are in a second base: the correlation between the two numbers is encrypted and stored in a highly secure box, which blocks if you try to move it," says Philippe Robin, of Thales.
However, due to extensive studies, it is impossible to know if these speeches really convince users.
Private life protection specialists, they, they, continue to worry.
"The progress of facial recognition, the multiplication of surveillance cameras and the enormous amount of photos available on Facebook, Flickr or Picasa make me afraid of the worst: generalized surveillance," said Andrew Patrick, of the Canadian Privacy Commissioner.
A 210 km/h wheeled driver with a hot drink between his legs saw himself inflamed with a pound of £1,000
A car driver was charged a fine of £1,000 for having rolled at 210 km/h with a hot drink placed in balance between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35 years old, from Tiptree in Essex, was re-elected to lead his Mercedes Benz on the A120 at Braintree on May 27.
When the police arrested him, they discovered the drink to carry between his legs.
To the Colchester Court of First Instance, Howie admitted the offence of conduct without the necessary caution and attention.
The seven points withdrawn on his permit led to a six-month withdrawal.
Howie was also sentenced to pay a fee of £90 and a surplus for a victim of £100.
A tax on foreign real estate owners to blow up the London bubble
The Treasury has provisionally numbered the capital gains tax measure but expects a final decision by Mr. Osborne, who, in the 2012 budget, has recorded a 7% stamp right for properties that cost more than £2 million and annual costs for buyers who choose to hold property in a company rather than individually.
The stamp right already applies to the residential properties of the districts of Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea, and represents £708 on the 2012/13 fiscal year, which exceeds the total amount of Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, North-East, North-West, Yorkshire and Humber gathered.
Mr. Cook said, "As a result of the increase in the right to stamp on high-value property and the introduction of anti-avoidability law, it is very difficult to advance that high-value property is subject independently of the effects of the obsolete housing tax system."
"But this change could make foreign investors reluctant to buy properties in London or the current owners reluctant to sell," he added.
The real estate – the 5-10% of the highest prices in the real estate market – in the prosperous sector located in southwestern London, which extends from Fulham to Wimbledon, increased by 11.8% in the last year.
Prices in the centre of London show regular annual growth of 5.6 % but have been driven by a "internal market" in full growth, the south-west of the city, the north (7.4%) and the east (6.5%) with a recovery, according to Savillas' studies.
Scientists have just revealed how the movements of a dog's tail are linked to its humour.
Previous studies had revealed that happy dogs had more to do with their tail to the right (from the dog's point of view), while nerve dogs had to do more with it to the left.
But now scientists say dogs can detect and respond to these subtle differences.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trente, said: "Everyone knows that, in man, the left side and the right side of the brain are involved differently in the stimuli that produce positive or negative emotions."
Here, we tried to see what was in other species.
He added that, as in man, in dogs the right side of the brain was responsible for the movement to the left and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played a different role in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to the movements of other dogs, researchers have followed animals by watching movies where other dogs were.
They measured the heart rate of animals and analyzed their behavior.
It certainly won't take long before we understand why their tail sometimes goes on one side and sometimes on the other.
Professor Vallortigara explained: "We presented to dogs of the films where other dogs were – either a naturalist version or a silhouette to avoid any other factor of confusion – and we were able to traffic the movement of the queu and present it as going to the left or to the right."
When animals saw a dog without expression remove the tail to the right (from the dog's point of view that removes the tail), they remained perfectly restrained.
But when they saw a tail, mainly due to the left (again from the dog's point of view that removes the tail), their heart rate accelerated and they had anxious air.
Professor Vallortigara said he did not think that dogs were deliberately communicating with each other through these movements.
Rather, he thinks that dogs know by experience the movements they should or should not worry about.
He added: “If you encounter several other dogs and notice that, most of the time, the movement of their tail to one side is associated with a more friendly attitude and that the right side leads to a less friendly attitude, you will react according to this experience.”
Researchers indicate that the results could allow owners, veterinarians and trainers to better understand the emotions of their animals.
The canine behavior expert John Bradshaw, who was invited to the School of Veterinary Sciences at Bristol University, said that it was not the first study to examine the importance of the left and right in the canine species.
Last year, a team at Lincoln University discovered that dogs were turning their heads to the left when they were looking at an aggressive dog and to the right when it was a happy dog.
And in another scientific study conducted by the University of Victoria in Canada, he said: “The dogs went more easily to a robot dog when its tail turned left rather than right, rather than becoming anxious – the reverse of what is in the Italian study.”
He indicated that the differences could result from the fact that dogs who participated in the various studies did not fully consider the animals of the films or dogs as dogs.
A study on how dogs react to real dogs could be useful, he explained.
"Although many elements, found in different mammals, indicate that both sides of the brain are used for different purposes, many details still need to be specified – and dogs do not make an exception," he said.
However, given the ease with which their behaviors can be recorded, it will certainly not be long before we understand why their tail sometimes moves on one side and on the other.
Arctic Monkeys reports a concert in Glasgow due to Alex Turner's disease
The Arctic Monkeys rock group reported a concert in Glasgow after a laryngitis was diagnosed to its singer.
The Sheffield group was supposed to take place on Friday in The Hydro concert hall in the city center.
However, his laryngitis forced the singer Alex Turner to reprogram the show.
The announcement was made after the group was forced to perform a concert at the Birmingham LG Arena on Thursday.
In a statement on their official site, the Arctic Monkeys stated: "After the decision to postpone the concert to the LG Arena in Birmingham this evening and after requesting medical advice, the Arctic Monkeys must also report the show to the Glasgow Hydro on Friday 1 November."
"Alex Turner suffers from a laryngitis and regrets that it cannot occur in concert."
The show at the LG Arena in Birmingham will take place on 20 November and the show at the Hydro in Glasgow will be held on 21 November.
All tickets remain valid for these concerts.
We would like to apologize to all the ticket holders for any inconvenience they may have caused.

Pope Francis appoints his first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will appoint new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time on February 22nd, the Vatican announced Thursday.
The cardinals are the highest men of the church in the Catholic Church behind the pope, and those who choose it, so François will number his first group of men who will finally choose his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, as soon as a cardinal reaches the age of 80, he can no longer participate in the election of a pope – so it returns to a group of 120 "elector cardinals".
In a statement announcing the news, Father Federico Lombardi, a spokesman for the Vatican, said that a meeting gathering all existing cardinals would take place before the ceremony during which bishops would be raised to cardinal dignity, known as the constitution.
"The Pope François decided to communicate his decision to convene the constitution in February in order to facilitate the planning of other meetings requiring the participation of cardinals from different parts of the world," Lombardi said.
Jack Valero des Voix catholiques said that by February, the number of cardinal electors will probably have decreased.
He stated that a pope generally appointed both cardinals and cardinals to reach 120 and as many cardinals over 80 years of age as he wanted.
The constitution of next year will be important because it will be the first since the election of Pope François in March of this year, Valero said.
For the time being, there is a tendency to favour Europe and, in particular, Italy.
"It will be interesting to see if the new Pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance," he added.
40% of Roman Catholics live in South America, but a small number of cardinals represent them.
The cardinals will also be the first to be chosen since François formed the council of cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world responsible for examining ways to reform the church.
In the past, the pope decided on his own.
"Now, François chose these eight cardinals to help him," explained Valero.
He added that it was "everything possible" that François asked for advice to the cardinals.
But we have never experienced such a situation – it is completely new.
Valero indicated that the popes generally raised bishops from large communities to cardinal rank, but that François was “full of surprises – so we don’t know who he will number”.
GM recalls some of its new pickups in the United States to repair the headquarters file
General Motors Co recalls nearly 19,000 of its new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra 2014 pickups to resolve a problem with manually adjustable files, according to a statement by the American vehicle safety regulator on Friday.
On some pickups, the previous seats could present a defect at the level of the tilt mechanism.
Consequently, the records do not comply with the federal safety standards of vehicles with respect to head restraints.
"If the vehicle is hit by the rear, it may be that the head restraint does not properly protect passengers, thus increasing the risk of injuries", according to the statement on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).
The models were built between 1 August and 10 September.
The deployment of GM pickups began in June and represents the most important vehicle launch for the first American car manufacturer since its bankruptcy and restructuring in 2009.
GM informed the owners of default pickups during the first 15th of October.
NHTSA was unable to review the owner's information letter due to the 16-day end of government activities, which slowed the growth of vehicle sales in October.
Silverado and Sierra pickup sales, which were redesigned for the 2014 model, increased by about 20% in the first 10 months of the year, said GM on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado pickups and 16,503 Sierra pickups.
The GM's stock rate rose by 1.4 per cent to $37,47 at the New York Stock Exchange on Friday afternoon.
A dead worker trained under concrete blocks
A construction worker died under dozens of concrete blocks, Thursday before noon, in Montreal.
The drama took place about 11 a.m. on Marquette Street, near the intersection of Beaubien Street, in the Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie district.
It is likely that work on the foundations has been taking place in this area for some time.
A mythical foundation wall has just been erected in the last few days.
The accident occurred when the victim just arrived on the site to recover his tools.
I was driving, and I saw the wall crash with a big smoke cloud, said Sylvain Jean, who lives near the yard.
I landed and went to remove the big bricks that would cover it.
We only saw a part of her back, it's so unfortunate.
According to the authorities, the victim was an old man in the 50s who worked for a coffee business.
Respiratory procedures were tested by emergency services, but failed.
Man didn't survive his serious injuries.
An inspector of the Committee on Health and Safety at Work was sent to the places to investigate the circumstances surrounding this drama.
The cry of despair of a Obama electorate
I voted twice for President Obama, believing in the possibility of a change
He says Obama has made commendable efforts played by the Republican Party's obstructionism
Obstructionism does not excuse the difficulties of the Obamacare site, nor the attacks of drones
Obama's 2008 campaign memory is a sad reminder of what could have happened
Nathaniel P. Morris is a 2nd year medical student at Harvard Medical School.
I'm reading a sadly sad book these days.
It's a book that, I thought, would encourage me during my 2nd year of medicine and give me hope.
It's called "The Audacity to Win" and it's the memoirs of Barack Obama's presidential campaign in 2008.
When I finished the medical records of my patients in the evening and that I was sleeping, this book reminds me of the time when politics inspired millions of people and the speeches could cut your breath.
The election ended with a devastating victory and the news reporters took time to reflect on the historical nature of the moment.
My friends cried for joy and my parents kept all the papers they found.
A young visionary team advanced to the White House and the nation was ready for change.
During the transitional period of Obama prior to its entry into force in 2008, it had 82% of the views.
And then I close the book.
Returning to the present is a difficult wake, it's like getting out of a dream.
It is difficult to recall these days full of optimism, they are like distant memories, a sad reminder of past opportunities.
The change really happened in the years that followed the first time I voted.
That had nothing to do with what I had imagined.
I place upon Obama's credit great achievements, from the passage of the Affordable Care Act (Affordable Care Act) to the departure of Iraq from our army, passing through the end of the "neither seen nor known" and the murder of Oussama ben Laden.
In addition, I believe that partial obstructionism has destroyed too many efforts to advance our nation in the area of immigration reforms, public health care and the closure of Guantanamo, among other things.
But after many times defending Obama's administration against my peers and colleagues, I can no longer provide explanations.
I'm on the brink of political despair.
Republican obstruction cannot explain the hearing of foreign leaders, nor the attacks of foreign children innocent by drones.
It cannot explain that the National Security Agency collects data on the private lives of Americans, or the prosecution of prosecutors who reveal the government's faults.
It cannot justify the assassination of Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, without trial, or the avoidance of public funding and the overexpenditure of authorized spending during presidential campaigns.
It cannot justify the conclusions of a report that says that the efforts of the White House to reduce the media in silence are "more aggressive... since Nixon's administration".
And, more recently, it cannot excuse the inability to design a simple website for more than three years after the Affordable Care Act has been ratified.
I don't know if that's what I was expecting.
If, at 18 years of age, I was supposed to understand that governance could contradict the previous political campaigns.
Of course, the electoral function is not predictable, because the opposition political party and the events that happen by chance, like Newton's massacre, influence our public conversation.
However, all the examples I have mentioned above seem to be largely the choice of the administration.
That's what bothers me most.
I again voted for Obama in 2012, but not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney was a confused and slightly refined alternative that did not seem to allow his policies or positions to be determined.
I felt that Obama, elected for a second term by being released from the pressure of future elections, would keep the promises that we had been meant to speak for so long.
However, while the favourable opinion index dropped by 45% this week, it is even more difficult to get back to 2008 through this book.
He makes me wish for the many promises that have been made.
This week, I read the part of the book that describes how Obama suffered enormous losses in the benefit of Clinton to the Principals of Pennsylvania.
At a post- campaign meeting, he told his team that they needed to return on the right path and remain faithful to their cause.
"I want us to focus on our talent," he said.
We must remember who we are.
We are here five years later, Mr President, and I no longer agree with you.
The views expressed in this comment are only those of Nathaniel Morris.
Friday, around 3 p.m., a violent collision between a motorcycle and a car took place on Retinne Street in Fléron.
The motorcycle, Jonathan, 26 years old, of Fleuron, did not wear helmets.
Despite the rapid intervention of relief, it is lost in this frontal collision.
Clive Palmer claims that MP Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest about the parental leave system.
The billionaire Clive Palmer suggests that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest about the parental leave system because his daughters could be pregnant and benefit from this system.
The magnitude of the mining extraction, which corresponds to the payment of a carbon tax of $6 million, has proved this argument to try to avoid issues related to a possible conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which could be crucial when deciding whether carbon and mineral taxes should be removed.
But Mr. Palmer claimed that only ministers could have a conflict of interest and indicated that Mr. Abbott's daughters were ready to benefit from these policies.
"It will have an important conflict of interest when it comes to paying parental leave, because if one of his daughters is pregnant, he will have a direct interest in getting leave," said Palmer.
Two months after his election, the electoral commission officially declared that Mr. Palmer had won the seat of Sunshine Coast of Fairfax by 53 votes, after counting.
Mr. Palmer advanced the idea of a replacement of the discharge system to speed up the process.
Tony Abbott's daughters, Frances and Bridget.
Should this election be decided two months after the vote is completed?
"We need a better system," he said.
Why can't we have a system in which you can enter, enter your coordinates in a computer, vote immediately and have the result at 6:30 p.m. next morning?
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of paper skulls to mark the ballots.
Is it to be able to delete the result if someone disagrees?
From our day on, having a paper skull seems amazing.
The Electoral Commission has examined possible options for the electronic vote and recently published a joint reflection document with New Zealand.
Mr. Palmer, 59, said that his political project included an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he would take his new functions "very seriously".
The exercise of public service is a matter of public service.
"We do not seek reward, except for the reward of history, because we must serve the community at a critical time," he added.
A team of biologists led by the Wildlife Conservation Society of New York identified a new species of boxing dolphin along the northern coasts of Australia.
Thibaut Bouverouux, responsible for scientific mission to the Observatory for Conservation and Study of Animals and Environment Marines (OCEAMM) returns to L'Express on this discovery and explains the long process of identification of new species.
Does the discovery of this new species of boxing dolphin surprise you?
It's good news, but I'm not surprised.
If in the past, species have been described and identified on a morphological, anatomical and geographic basis, today, the development of new tools such as genetics will enable us to improve our knowledge of species classification sciences.
Furthermore, it is not possible for these advances in genetics and molecular biology to result in the classification or belonging of a species to a kind, a family, or even an order.
In the early 19th century, morphologists classified animals based on morphological differences between species.
Today, some of these classifications are challenged because of genetic progress.
In the same way, two very close morphologically distinct species have been identified by genetics.
This is the case of the new species that has just been identified.
Ten years ago, the scientific community recognized two species belonging to this subfamily: the Pacific forest dolphins and the Atlantic forest whales.
Recent analyses made it possible to distinguish four species.
Why is this a discovery of importance as stated by the Wildlife Conservation Society?
From a conservation point of view, it is essential to know these genetic differences in order to protect the species and therefore its genetic variability.
If this population had been known for a long time by researchers, they did not know that it was part of a new species, only present in this place.
Therefore, if a problem of massive mortality caused by a viral epidemic or accidental capture occurs in the region, we could have dealt with the extinction of a species, rather than the local disappearance of a population of a wider species on Earth.
This loss of genetic heritage would be much more problematic.
A species is considered to be threatened or by extinction, depending on the number of individuals on Earth, that is, stock, and the possibility to recover from neighbouring stocks.
As for the species Sousa chinensis, whose population of the new discovered species has come out, its stock has automatically become weaker, thus making it more vulnerable.
Why is it rare to discover new species of marine mammals?
The marine mammals are located at the top of the food chain.
They live in homogenous, open habitats, where there are many genetic exchanges between populations and individuals.
This bridging of genes limits the creation of new species.
On the contrary, closer ecosystems favour genetic isolation, which can eventually lead to the creation of new species.
It must be known that the marine environment is the least well-known environment.
We prefer to send robots on Mars to know what lives in the Mariannes Bay, only 11 kilometres from the surface of the sea.
More money is spent in life research on other planets than in marine research, and it's a long time to change.
RBS suspends two traders on the market for change
The Royal Bank of Scotland suspended two traders from its market division of changes according to two sources close to the file, which shows once again that the global survey of regulators on the suspicions of market manipulation of currencies begins to bear its fruit.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they would cooperate with regulators in the most important financial market investigations in the world, where $5.3 billion is changing by hand every day.
The two traders are the first RBS employees to be suspended in the context of the extension of the investigation, which has led to the scandal of manipulations of the Libor interbank rate.
The bank, which refused to comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it had received requests for information from regulators.
"The current investigation on this case continues and we cooperate fully with the FCA and other regulators," said a bank representative two weeks ago.
Last month, sources close to the file reported that RBS had transmitted instant emails and messages sent to and by an old trader, to the British regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This trader, Richard Usher, left the RBS in 2010 and would have been suspended from his position as European trading officer to the accountant for the currencies at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, European Trade Manager at Citi, was released this week, while Matt Gardiner, senior currency dealer at Barclays and UBS, was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders were charged.
Mr. Usher's file included instant messages sent to and by bankers working at Barclays and Citigroup, added sources close to the file.
UBS explained this week that it had attempted an action against some of its employees after the Swiss regulator Finma said he was investigating suspicions of market manipulations of change in a number of Swiss banks.
In the world, at least six authorities – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss Competition Authority Weko, the FCA, the US Department of Justice and the Monetary Authority of Hong Kong – are examining allegations made regarding bankers that would be heard to manipulate the rates on the market for change.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Crédit Switzerland also launched internal investigations or received requests for information from regulators, indicating sources close to the file.
The banks have been using instant messages and emails sent over the years to find cases of reprehensible events.
The news of these investigations has derailed traders in a sector that has been one of the largest growth engines of investment banks trading units in recent years, but has been challenged this year because of the low volatility of currencies that limit the opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to minimize the case by saying that it is almost impossible to manipulate the vast market of highly liquid changes, but senior traders explain that this is not necessarily true.
A senior trader stated that despite the high volume of daily exchange transactions, the fragmentation of liquidity between exchange management platforms and the increasingly frequent use by banks of their own internal platforms "explains that it is possible to start having an impact on the low-cost market".
The news came the very day that the Swiss Credit announced that it had sent a trader working in his office of funds negotiated at the London Stock Exchange this week after he lost $6 million at the end of last year.
The bank quickly informed the competent authorities and cooperated with the regulators.
"We are convinced that the trader acted alone and that the case was controlled," said a representative of the Swiss Credit.
The investigation of Major Rob Ford has been broken, supporting a lawyer
After the police confirmed that they had put their hands on a copy of the video that would show Rob Ford smoking crack, Me Clayton Ruby said that he never saw an investigation "so bad".
Ruby told me to believe in the Canadian press that the police had "ignored or minimized" evidence against the mayor.
This Thursday, the police arrested Rob Ford's friend and occasional driver Alexander Lisi, 35-year-old, and accused him of exorcising him about the video.
Alexander Lisi, formerly accused of drug trafficking, was in frequent contact with the mayor.
The police said that they also observed this man who was delivering packages to Rob Ford, who reported new court documents.
Me Ruby qualified as "inexplicable" the fact that the police had never searched Rob Ford's vehicle or his home, or listened to his phone, claiming that the chief of police, Bill Blair, had deliberately chosen not to act against the mayor.
Under the law, the police, having witnessed suspicious transactions in their own hands, would have been very well able to intercept Rob Ford's vehicle, arrest the mayor, and carry out a search - even without a warrant.
It could also have applied for an immediate search warrant, if deemed necessary.
The chief of police didn't comment, but his spokesperson Mark Pugash qualified Me Ruby's words of "evident and desperate intent" to complain to the media in a case that does not concern him at all.
At a press conference on Thursday, Mr Blair said that there was nothing in this video that could constitute "reasonable reasons" that could lead to the filing of a criminal charge against the mayor.
European scholarships at mid-session, except for London
With the exception of London, the main European Stock Exchanges are coming down on Friday at mid-session, culminating in some news from debasing companies, while Wall-Street is expected to rise.
In addition, investors remain cautious, as they believe that the US Federal Reserve could undermine its quantitative adjustment policy earlier than planned.
On the contrary, following the announcement of an inflation rate of 0.7% for the euro area as a whole, the idea is spread among market players that the European Central Bank (ECB) could simplify its monetary policy.
The future of Wall Street is expected to open up American actions in the wake of two consecutive response sessions.
In the values, Renault (-4.63%) records the strongest CAC 40 response, as a result of the warning of his partner Nissan Motor Friday.
The Royal Bank of Scotland (-6.26%) marks the worst performance of the EuroFirst300, after also publishing low results this morning and announces the creation within a "bad bank" structure, bringing together 38 billion books of the most risky assets.
On the other hand, Vodafone (+2.45%) is in the head of EuroFirst300 in response to a press release that wants AT&T to study a possible OPA.
On the market for change, speculation on the evolution of the ECB's monetary policy is going well, as evidenced by John Hardy, a strategy at Saxo Bank.
The ECB's single mandate has always focused on inflation, so Mario Draghi and his team have more reason to act at the next week's meeting.
We anticipate a strong potential for a drop in the euro.
In this context, the euro continues its rebate against the US currency and has reached a lower meeting of two weeks at $1,3517.
These same designs support the euro area's mandatory market in the opposite direction.
The Supreme Court validates Obama's Health Reform Act
Great victory for Obama's administration: the U.S. Supreme Court today stated that Obama's health system reform law was constitutional.
By 5 votes to 4, the judges validated the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – which requires citizens to subscribe to health insurance by 2014, with no penalty to pay a fine – and stated that it was constitutional under the government's taxation authority.
The President of the Supreme Court, John Roberts, joined the four most liberal members of the Court, while judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy expressed their disagreement.
The Court also validated the other sections of the Law of 2,700 pages and, moreover, considered that the provision of the Health Reform Act, which stipulates that the eligibility threshold for Medicaid should be lowered without losing all the federal funding of the programme, was coercive in accordance with the constitution.
The procedure for blocking the law was initiated by 26 States and the National Federation of Independent Business.
All the major Republican candidates for the high-ranking presidential election during the early 2012, including the nominated candidate Mitt Romney, were fiercely opposed to the law.
Vibrant tribute paid to former combatants in Menton
In the heart of the Trabuquet Summit, civil, religious and military authorities, as well as many patriotic associations, paid tribute to the soldiers and the deaths of all wars on Friday afternoon.
Gerbs were deposited in two of the three military quarters of the cemetery by M. Jean-Claude Guibal and various personalities.
Accruing between Palestinians and Israelis at the Gaza border
Four Hamas fighters were killed and five Israeli soldiers injured Thursday, October 31, 2013 at night at a violent siege at the border between Gaza and Israel, the most serious incident in the Palestinian territory for a year.
The only power plant in the Gaza Strip ceased to operate on Friday, November 1st, after the exhausting of its fuel stocks, the Palestinian enclave's Energy Authority announced.
A local commander of the Brigades Ezzedine Al-Qassam, Khaled Abu Bakr, and another frame of the army branch of Hamas, Rabieh Bariceh, were killed by a car accident at an Israeli army invasion in eastern Khan Younes, south of the Gaza Strip, according to local medical sources.
Two other local leaders of the Al-Qassam Brigades, Mohammed al-Qassas and Mohammed Daoud, found death when an Israeli helicopter opened fire in the same region.
Their bodies were discovered later.
According to Palestinian security sources, the four combatants carried out a surveillance operation in the border area between the Palestinian enclave and Israel.
An attack on a tunnel crossed by the Palestinians
According to the same sources and witnesses, an Israeli car and a armored bulldozer made an incursion of a hundred metres inside the territory before leaving.
The confrontation lasted half an hour, according to witnesses.
In a communiqué, a spokesperson of Hamas, Sami Abu Zouhri, paid tribute to the four "heros" and claimed that Israeli soldiers had found death during the confrontation.
Hamas congratulates Al-Qassam's heroes who fell into defense of the territory during an invasion of the Zionist occupyor in Khan Younès.
Several enemies were killed and injured during the operation.
"Hamas ensures that Gaza will be a hell for the occupant," threatened the spokesperson.
On the other hand, the Israeli army indicated that the target of its operation was at the outset a section of a large tunnel that has been grown in Israeli territory since the Palestinian enclave, discovered on 7 October and destined, according to the military, to "terrorist activities".
Hamas claimed the use of tunnels to fight Israel, stating that the purpose was to remove Israeli soldiers to exchange them against Palestinian prisoners.
The operation aimed at preventing future terrorist attacks using this tunnel, explained an Israeli military communiqué.
During the operation, Hamas launched an explosive device aimed at the forces of Tsahal (Israeli army) and wounded 5 soldiers.
Israeli attack in northern Syria
"This mission was imperative because of the risk of the use of the terrorist tunnel for attacks on Israeli civilians," said Army spokesman Peter Lerner.
In addition, Israel struck a military base in north-west Syria, aimed at cargoing missiles for the Lebanese Shiite movement Hezbollah, the Al-Arabiya satellite channel reported on Thursday, October 31.
A U.S. official confirmed an "Israeli trap" but did not give details about the target.
"In the past, targets have been transferred to Hezbollah," he was pleased to add.
The Israeli Government officials refused to confirm any information about such an attack.
Quoting the "exclusive sources" that it has not named, the Saudi capital chain indicated that "the bombing aimed at a cargo of ground-based missiles destined for Hezbollah in Lebanon", referring to the powerful Lebanese Shiite movement that combats rebels alongside Syrian forces.
Earlier, a Syrian NGO, the Syrian Human Rights Observatory, had reported several explosions heard on Wednesday at dawn in an air defence base in Sonar Jablé, near Latakié, on the Syrian coast.
This organization, based on a network of militants and medical sources, had not been able to identify the origin of the explosions.
Back in black and white for Marie Chouinard, who presents her two new group choreographies in Dance: the first inspired incre and poems by Henri Michaux, the second inflated by the famous piano solos Gymnopedies of Satie.
A evening that allows you to see all the prism of Chouinard, art to the ticks and black ink to the white.
A white screen serves as a background wall.
On the carpet, as white, in the immense space that is the Maisonneuve Theatre, advance, profile, end like a line and black dress, a body.
On the screen, an ink of Henri Michaux is designed.
The body, simply treats, takes its form.
And this form will be the whole piece: a bunch of physical imitations of drawings.
The dancers, fully dressed in black, only the hands and the face discovered, wait on each side of the game area, hurry when the next graph appears, the incarnation, emerges running.
This black and white game by Henri Michaux is made in relation to the ground, in group to the unison (a mass that makes the ground), in large group of twelve soils where each executes its sign.
It is thought of "Glorire du morning", where, in solo, Chouinard performed a series of choreographic tasks written on posters, placed online at the front stage.
That's the same principle, giant PowerPoint version.
Here, music is strong, beatings and electric guitars.
Energy is high, speed is always fast.
There will be a crash when Carol Prior will take refuge under the carpet of dance, to deliver, micro by hand, without sovereignty or held, a part of the poem by Michaux, monocord and monotone in the cry, and will continue dancing.
And the music to deal, and the sequence to resume.
This sound and energy discharge, long, if this can be done, ends by swallowing and swallowing.
As does the regularity of visual rhythm.
There are some beautiful flashes - the creation of images has always been a force in Chouinard - like these hairs that explode or these black fabrics that stretch the lines.
But the choreographic approach lacks composition.
It is felt that the choreographer, instead of going to the work of Michael, was forced, with his ticks.
Result: the bodies look flat in front of the drawings.
Michaux's Increments, like Gestalt's shapes, open a wider and gibbou-like imagination than dance, more porous.
Only the end, negatively, with its dancers huddled with stroboscopic light and the white signs in a sudden black theater, touch the magic.
The audience loved it, the reception was warm.
The Gymnopedies, after the contract, are richer.
The scene is partly made of grey, dancers and piano are covered with fabric, like furniture in a abandoned house.
On the piano, dancers relax to play the partitions.
Their music illness, touching, gives real weakness.
On stage, couples pass, in loving dues, very sensitive, even erotic.
Groupwork, small transition floors, sets that move, colors, writing is less binary.
Buffons appear, also familiar with Chouinard, with red nose, in very polarized male-female loving parades.
Loves are carnage, fugitives or players.
The gesture, laughter, and small crises are beautifully conveying the archaic, grace and ridicule of the bodies in coyote, of the beings that are found.
But the room takes its real envelope after the rescue.
A clown comes back on stage when the audience leaves.
There, everything is allowed: the fourth wall falls, the explored universes are superimposed, the cabotin dancers descend among the spectators, gloss, smoke, short-circuit, play code of applause, spread the sauce into a highly calculated disorder that remains sensitive.
Joy and madness are insinuating, and it is the art of Chouinard, here, to contaminate the public.
Google, Samsung and Huawei are prosecuted for Nortel patents
The group that owns thousands of old Nortel patents has launched an avalanche of legal proceedings in respect of Thursday patents against portable telephone manufacturers, including Google, the company that he took to the pot at the sale of patent auctions that took place after the failure of Nortel.
Rockstar, the consortium that acquired Northel patents for $4.5 Md, filed a complaint against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringement before the United States Court of Justice in Texas.
Rockstar is held jointly by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
The patents contain technologies that make it possible to display advertising in relation to search terms on the Internet, they have indicated the conclusions of the trial, which is Google's business heart.
It was not possible to connect the representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC make phones that work under Google's Android operating system, which provides fierce competition for Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011, Google made an initial offer of $900 million for Nortel patents.
Google has increased its offer several times, to finally propose $4.4 MD.
After losing Nortel patents in Rockstar, Google has acquired Motorola Mobility suite for $12.5 billion, a partial market based on the Motorola patent library.
"Although it failed in its attempt to acquire the patents in question during the auctions, Google has violated and continues to violate those patents," the trial concluded.
Rockstar claims the most important damage and interests against Google, as he claims that Google patent violation is obstetrical, according to the complainant.
Explosion of a house in Gesves: A Defective Water Heat at the Origin of the Explosion
The grandmother would have lit a cigarette during a gas leak.
The explosion of a residence in Gesves, which caused two serious injuries on Friday morning, a 52-year-old grandmother and her 5-year-old grandson, resulted in a leak from a defective water heater, indicated on Friday night the replacement of the King's prosecutor.
The expert on the spot by the parquet ensures that the origin of the explosion is purely accidental.
The grandmother lit a cigarette while there was a leak and a gas accumulation.
The vital forecast of the two victims is always committed.
The grandmother was designed by the explosion and is severely burned.
The little boy, who was staying at his grandfather's house and company, was on his side and was burned more slightly.
"The two victims were intubated and long-termly conditioned on site before being taken to the CHU of Lije, she in helicopter, in ambulance," said Mayor José Paulet, who came down to the places.
Traumatized, the grandfather was on the floor at the time of the explosion.
In addition, he was able to join the ground floor by the stairs remained intact while the back wall of the house was completely destroyed.
The grandfather and the tenant of the neighboring house, weakened by the explosion, were relogated by the president of the CPAS.
The firefighters of Andenne and Namur and the Arches police were involved.
Crisnée's civil protection has stabilized both buildings.
Egypt requests the first freely elected President to lend an oath
Mohamed Morsi has lent the investment oath, but it is unlikely that his triumph day marks the end of political conflicts in Egypt.
Islamist Mohamed Morsi promised the emergence of a "new Egypt" when he lent the investment oath to the presidency, thus becoming the first freely elected president and succeeding in Hosni Moubarak, who was defeated 16 months earlier.
During his investment in the High Constitutional Court, Mr. Morsi has also become the first freely elected Islamic President of the Arab world and the fifth head of state of Egypt since the overthrow of the monarchy 60 years ago.
He made an oath before the 18 black judges of the Court whose building on the edge of the Nile was built to resemble an Egyptian temple.
"We hope for better days, a new Egypt and a second republic," said President Morsi during the solo ceremony broadcast live on public television.
"Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundations of a new life – absolute freedom, real democracy and stability," explained Mr. Morsi, a 60-year-old engineer in the United States, from the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group considered for more than 84 years since his training as an illegal and severely oppressed organization by successive governments.
Hundreds of soldiers and police kept the building when Mr. Morsi arrived shortly after 11 a.m., local time, followed by a small convoy.
Only a few hundred supporters were gathered before the Court to accrue the new President and, noting from the presidential screen of the years of Moubarak, the movement was only briefly interrupted to allow the passage of his convoy in the very frequent streets connecting the city centre to the southern plains.
Considered as the little charismatic "wheel of relief" of the Muslim Brothers, his personal prestige has been considerably strengthened since his victory and his Friday speech during which he tried to present himself not only as the candidate of the Islamics but all those who wanted to finish the work started in 2011 against President Moubarak's author.
"Egypt is today a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," said Mohamed Morsi, in a blue and red tie suit, addressed to the judges present in the drunk room where he made his oath.
Later, Mr. Morsi went to the University of Cairo where he delivered his investment speech.
He was officially welcomed by a military fan who played the national Hymne while taking care of himself.
Maréchael Hussein Tantaoui attended the ceremony.
At his arrival, he was welcomed by the song "The People and the Army, Hand in Hand..." enchanted by thousands of people gathered in the university's great amphitheater.
Founded in 1908 and the former foundation of secular education, the University of Cairo later became a fan of Islamic student groups in the 1970s.
Mr. Morsi made a symbolic oath on Friday at Tahrir Square, from which the uprising that ended the authoritarian regime of Moubarak last year, and swore to recover the presidential powers of the military council, which replaced the former outgoing president, had deposited it.
But by accepting to give an official oath before the Court, rather than before Parliament as it is used, he is inclined to the will of the army by showing that the struggle for power is not over.
Mr. Morsi's talk on Tahrir was accompanied by spectacular populist gestures.
The shutdown in the United States slowed the car market increase
The 16-day closure of most federal administrations focused on the growth of car sales in the United States in October, showing the figures published by the builders on Friday, five of the six main performances below expectations.
The three major construction companies in Detroit show a two-digit growth compared to October 2012 but only General Motors did better than expected.
Analysts averaged 15.4 million annual sales and adjusted seasonal changes, but the market was set at 15.3 million according to Adam Jonas, an analyst for Morgan Stanley.
In a note to the bank's customers, he believes that this slight break of brake is primarily explained by "the 'shutdown' government and its impact on consumer feelings during the first 15 months".
However, GM reported a progression of nearly 16% of its sales last month to 226,402 vehicles, compared to 211,563 expected by consensus.
The group's four brands saw their commercial performance improve compared to October 2012.
Ford, who continues to benefit from, among other things, the success of his pick-up, saw his sales progress from 14% over a year to 191,985 vehicles, while the consensus expected 194,301.
On his side, Chrysler, controlled by Fiat, announced an increase of 11% of its sales to 140 083 vehicles, compared to 143 536 expected.
Toyota and Nissan also show lower sales than consensus, despite increases over a year of 8.8% and 14.2% respectively.
At the New York Stock Exchange, GM took 1.4% to 16.35 GMT while Ford gave 1.1%.
Renault plummeted in Borse by Nissan's warning
Renault charges Friday with the strongest decline in the SBF 120 index in Paris after his partner Nissan Motor announced a reduction of nearly 20% of its annual net profit forecast, reports traders.
Nissan, who had to make such a revision, also announced a change in his direction.
Several traders reported that Renault's action was affected this morning by "warning".
"It's clearly Nissan's profit warning," says a Parisian broker's trading manager.
As part of the Renault-Nissan alliance, Renault holds 43.4% of the capital of Nissan and the Japanese manufacturer 15% of the French, according to the data from the Nissan website.
Greece: two deaths in a shooting near a site of the neo-Nazi party
Two people were killed and another was brutally injured on Friday night by fire shots fired by two people who were on a motorcycle passing by a place of the Neonazi Aube party golden in the west bank of Athens, we learned from a police source.
The police were unable to immediately provide information on the identity of the victims and their possible political affiliation.
Some Greek media reported that Aubé doré members had supported victims being guards of their place.
The injured person was immediately hospitalized, according to the same source.
Police officers of the anti-terrorist service moved on the central avenue of the Neo Iraklio bay, where the incident took place and the neighborhood was closed.
The incident took place a few weeks after the indictment of six golden Aubé MPs, including the party's head and founder, for participation in "a criminal organization" in an offensive against this party that was launched after the death of an anti-fascist musician by one of its members.
Scott Brown's call was rejected
Scott Brown, the captain of Celtic Glasgow, has seen his appeal rejected and will be well suspended for the next two league matches of his club champions against Ajax and AC Milan.
Disfellowshipping against Barça for a blow to Neymar, the Scottish environment saw its suspension extended to three meetings by UEFA.
In a communiqué, his club was called "very disappointed", believing that his appeal was fully justified.
Nearly 50,000 households are deprived of electricity throughout the province, shortly after Friday, due to violent winds affecting many regions along the St. Lawrence River.
The most affected sectors are the Laurentides with 15 042 subscribers swimming in the black, Monterégie with 13 464 and the Outauais with 8642.
The great region of Montreal also knows its lot of breads with nearly 7,000 private homes running in the metropolis and Laval.
Do you think travel agencies belonged to the past because of the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to reverse the trend.
The company has reviewed its net increase in profits and hopes for record results through vacations in Australia and the United Kingdom.
The travel agency is now expected to achieve a substantial benefit over the entire fiscal period between $325 and $340 million, compared with a previous estimate of $305 to $315 million.
If current forecasts are met, this will represent 12 to 17 per cent of growth compared to the record profit of $290.4 million achieved in 2011/12.
The Director General, Graham Turner, said that Flight Centre had achieved 8 per cent of the first half and that the second half had entered into force, in particular with regard to travel other than business travel in Australia and the United Kingdom.
"Since the beginning of the year, the 10 countries in which we are present are profitable, and many of them are in a good position to achieve record results on the whole year before the interest and tax deduction," he said.
This concerns Australia and the United Kingdom, which are generally the most profitable countries.
In Australia, the leisure sector has rebundled during the second half, which has made it possible to compensate a domestic market for low-cost business travel.
Similarly in the United Kingdom, the Flight Centre leisure sector has recorded good results while business customers have spent less.
His subsidiary in the United States recovered its losses during the first half of the year in which the seasonal demand was lower and was expected to benefit the whole year for the third time.
Flight Centre shares increased by 3 cents to $38.20 yesterday.
Unknown to be found in a hotel near the pyramids of Cairo
Incognitos have opened the fire this Friday on a hotel near the pyramids of Cairo in Egypt without making victims, resulting in an apparent querell with licensed employees.
The kidnappers took the flight, specified the spokesperson of the Ministry of the Interior, Chief of Police Abdel Latif.
This attack occurs when Egypt no longer receives almost any tourists since the army replaced Islamic President Mohamed Morsi in early July and represses the protests of its supporters in blood.
Schools are encouraged to focus more on mathematics, orthographics and grammar
As part of English literature courses, students will have to study at least one piece of Shakespeare, a 19th - century novel, a romantic poem and contemporary British fiction work from 1914 to our day.
The review will also present "new texts" to encourage a more diversified reading.
A combined course of English literature and language will be deleted.
As of 2015, students will have to pass an independent language GCSE, and will be strongly encouraged to choose a separate qualification in English literature.
The Ministry of Education must publish its new English and math programs tomorrow – the first materials to undergo a radical revision.
It will make changes in other basic materials next year.
In addition, Offqual, the Board of Tests will launch a replacement of the GCSE structure, with a new rating system and fewer courses.
Speaking in the summer, Michael Gove, Minister of Education, stated that there was a "wide consensus on the need to reform our system of reviews to restore public confidence", insisting that GCSEs would be "more stimulating, more ambitious and more rigorous".
Studies show that English schools spend less time on maths (116 hours per year, 3 hours per week during the school year) than most other countries.
In comparison, Australian schools offer an average of 143 hours a year, and Singapore students make about 138 hours.
Although there is no formal obligation to devote more hours of time to maths, sources close to the coalition government have indicated that the GCSE of deep maths – as well as the greater importance given to the materials contained in international classifications – would probably encourage schools to provide more time for courses.
The programme will focus more on "the problems of the real world", including financial mathematics.
This judgment means that a law adopted in July in that State and that the right to abortion is largely challenged will enter into force.
An octogenary welcomes children with a gun at the Muy for Halloween
The 9 and 13-year-old minors were at the door to claim bonus at Halloween night.
One of the banks of the Muy neighborhood visited by the children opened the door holding his hunting rifle.
The old man, 86 years of age, explained to the gendarmes that he was afraid.
His weapon was seized.
The former chief of the Gestapo buried in a Jewish cemetery
Müller, who disappeared at the end of World War II without ever finding his mark, was actually buried in a common pit of a Jewish cemetery in Berlin, says the head of the German Resistance Memorial, Professor Johannes Tuchel, in Bild.
Müller didn't survive the end of the war.
"His body was buried in a common grave of the Jewish cemetery of Berlin-Mitte in 1945," he assured the daily large-scale shooting, based on archive documents.
This revelation, 68 years after the end of the Nazi regime of Adolf Hitler, would respond to one of the great Enigmes of the Postwar.
The German secret services, the BND, as well as during the summer of 1949, Müller was in Karlovy Vary, then in Czechoslovakia, according to a document obtained by Bild.
The secret services were completely mistaken.
"Since August 1945, Müller's body was found in a temporary grave near the former Ministry of the Reich's Aviation by a commando," said Mr. Tuchel.
He wore "a general uniform".
"In the left pocket were his service states with a photo," he continues.
Bild also publishes a document from the district headquarters of Mitte in Berlin indicating that it was buried in the district's Jewish cemetery.
The president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, Dieter Graumann, was shocked by this revelation.
One of the most brutal Nazi sages is buried in a Jewish cemetery, it is an enormous amount of bad taste.
"A large crowd of the victim's memory of the foot," he was raised in the newspaper.
Heinrich Müller is part of the important personalities of the Third Reich that have never been captured.
He attended the Wansee conference in January 1942, which decided on the "final solution" and under his orders, Adolf Eichmann, responsible for the "logistic" of the extermination of the Jews, sentenced to death and executed in Israel in 1962.

Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free health care in the villages of Cameroon
Dr. Bwelle and his team spend almost all their weekends seeing hundreds of patients
There are not many doctors in this West African country, only 1 per 5,000 inhabitants.
Vote here or via your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the 10 Heros CNNs in 2013.
You can vote for him, or one of the 10 other heroes, for the election of "Heros CNN of the Year".
This person will receive $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years Georges Bwelle looked at his sick father to alter the periods of consciousness and ignorance and to go to hospitals that were not equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
At first, he had only one broken arm, but he contracted an infection that spread to his brain, creating a hematoma that he was going to carry the rest of his life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," said Georges Bwelle.
We'd have taken her abroad if we had enough money.
Instead, Dr. Bwelle spent years accompanying his father in hospitals and hospitals, so that he could get any treatment he could get.
"It's not easy," adds Mr. Bwelle.
You can leave the house at 5:00, go to the hospital to be the first, and you're not the first.
There are a lot of patients.
People can die because they've waited too long.
The situation has not changed much since Dr. Bwelle's father died in 2002.
In Cameroon, there are only 1 doctor for 5,000 people, according to the World Health Organization.
As a comparison, the United States ratio is 1 doctor for 413 people.
And even if they could see a doctor, many Cameroonians could not pay for the consultation.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and nearly three quarters of the country's health expenditures are carried out in the private sector.
"The only problem they have is poverty," explained Dr. Bwelle.
And because of poverty, they cannot enjoy life.
After seeing his father and so much of his compatriots suffering, Dr. Bwelle was determined to try to change the course of things.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers have performed over 700 surgeries free of charge during the last year.
He became a doctor himself, working as a vascular surgeon at the central hospital of Yaoundé.
And he created a non-profit humanitarian association, ASCOVIME, which takes place in rural areas during the weekend to provide free health care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost all Fridays, with about 30 people, they settle in vans after laying the medical equipment on the roof and cross difficult terrain to get to the villages that need the most help.
It's not always the chance to follow them.
They often had to push vehicles to cross rivers or boulevards.
But when they arrive, they are received as heroes: the community organizes a party, song and dance and offers them the best accommodations available.
In these villages, free health care is a good reason to celebrate, and Dr. Bwelle – with his big smile and energy devolving – is more than happy to join the festivals.
The next morning, the team starts receiving hundreds of patients.
"We receive 500 people every visit," said Mr. Bwelle.
Sometimes they live 60 km from the village, and they come on foot.
In this traveling hospital, various health care is provided.
Many people receive treatment against malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, sexually transmitted parasites and diseases.
Others can receive bees, a pair of collectibles or a free birth certificate – a document needed to go to school, but many poor families simply cannot afford to buy it.
In the evening, the practical team of simple surgical acts under local anesthesia.
The operations are usually carried out in a school, matrimonial or household; after intervention, the patient wakes up and goes to the wake-up room to leave his place to the next person.
Thanks to the lighting of the electrical group, the operating room and the sterilization of the equipment, Dr. Bwelle and his volunteers are working until the first hours of Sunday morning.
This is an exciting rhythm, but the musicians of the villages generally help the team to remain motivated.
"They hit drums all night to keep us awake so that we can keep working," explained Mr. Bwelle.
On Sunday, the team returns to town, tired but proud of the work it has done.
The group, composed of Cameroonian doctors and medical students, has performed 700 surgical acts free of charge during the last year, and he knows that their presence can make the difference for those to whom they come for help.
One man explained that the free operation he had undergone to care for a hernie would allow him to work again.
"This will change my future and my family," said the man.
In addition to living this traveling hospital and working as a surgeon at the hospital, Dr. Bwelle also works in private medical offices around Yaoundé at night.
This is the second job, he explains, which accounts for 60% of his association; the rest is covered by private donations.
"I don't know when he's asleep," said Katie O'Malley, a medical student in the second year of Dr. Drexel University in Philadelphia and volunteer in Dr. Bwelle's group.
He's always at the hospital or trying to find money for his association in order to be able to run these campaigns.
For medical students and nursing students such as Katie O'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe to join Mr. Bwelle in his missions, this is an opportunity for learning on the ground they do not have at home.
"We have been able to participate in operations to help shed blood or to pass the instruments to Dr. Bwelle," Ms. O'Malley explained.
This is not something you have an opportunity to do in America when you're studying medicine in the second year.
Voluntary students generally pay for their trip to Cameroon, and often arrive with the medical equipment collected.
But once in Yaoundé, their pensions, transportation and education are taken over by Dr. Bwelle.
"It's a hero, there's no doubt," said Katie O'Malley.
He gives his life for this association, and his desire to help the Cameroonian people is not near to extend.
For Dr. Bwelle, the relatively constant workload is not a difficulty.
Helping others to live happily by keeping his promise to his father is something that brings him great joy.
"I'm so happy when I do this job," said Mr. Bwelle.
And I think about my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
To make people laugh and relieve pain is the reason why I do that.

The two Frances of Pierre Nora
Perplexes, university students have long struggled to define and place Pierre Nora.
Professor in amphitheatres and classrooms?
Without a doubt, but highlighting her weakness for the crossroads, Science-Po, the High Studies.
Arbitrary of other works in his Gaston-Gallimard Street office?
Indeed, but by ignoring the hidden work and underground writing of the publisher.
Heater of the faucet that employs Fontenelle at the French Academy?
Of course, but knowing that such a sacred one could not replace the true holy oil, the one of the thesis, which happened.
They have voluntarily recognized in him a great wake-up, an encouragement and a federate of their work, but noting that he was not inclined to produce it himself.
In this image the monument of the "Memory Places", to which he attached his name, also contributed.
The evil languages were able to see a giant market in the holes, presented by an intelligent commenter, with a vibrating eyebrow and a lobe of healing, but inexorably delicious.
The two works published by Nora soon two years have already established that the one who was not writing had much and well written.
The book here should make it absolutely fair.
However, once again, there is the temptation of obesity, intellectual vagabondization, the retirement set to jump as joint feet of one subject to the other.
But it is quickly understood that the missing objects gathered in this book so beautifully bring the brochure to a single and even passion: the one to discover the constituent node of the French identity.
Why these dramatic calls to national unity?
Identity: it is a concern of time.
Little by little, we were collectively invited to give a definition of this.
But in the perennial spirit of our leaders, French identity was a temporal essence.
It was only necessary to deploy the accidents, and the case, compulsory jacobinism, was entrusted to the prefects and sub-prefects, authorized interpreters.
The one who tracks Pierre Nora is everything else.
He does not inherit eternal freedom, he refuses to define himself.
Concerned analyst of a family stranger, he is wrong in a forest of symbols, arrested every step by an object in the form of a rebuff, tormented by annoying questions.
This is because of the company itself: why, in a country so long-lastingly located in its borders, so old-fashioned and solidly machined, do we hear these dramatic calls to unity?
They are not so urgent, says Pierre Nora, but to conjure up the trouble of the French history.
Francs and Gaulois, Armagnacs and Bourgugnons, Catholics and Protestants: the forces of division here are very old.
And the most emblematic is, of course, the one that makes the national history in two.
From the Seismus of the Revolution, the French have two stories and they have two nations, one monarchy, the other revolutionary.
The second wanted the death of the first, but did not reach the kidney; he looked forward to finding the sacredness of it, and to the greater envy of unity and indivisibility that it had cut the head of the one who was the obvious and powerful incarnation.
And from there, an invincible binary nation, divided between left and right, laity and Catholicism, worship and hatred of the revolution.
To feel this singularity of French identity, nothing is worth the four steps outside of Hexagon, so that the American escape from Pierre Nora could well be the heart of his book.
Because America and France both have a revolution, a statement of rights, and I want to set up a new society.
But the U.S. Cousin makes it better to highlight what is our own.
Down there, men who had left their Ancient Regime in England and no longer cared about it.
Here, men covered by an ancient indigenous regime, and even more radical.
There's a consensual revolution when she planted the drama and confiscate it here.
There are always respected founding fathers, and here there are revolutionary ancestors whose models are hard to make, and who are still intertwined.
There is an institutional continuance, and here there is a cascade of constitutions, as well as mistakes to be made and attempts to resume.
The French who goes, the French who comes
There was, however, a time when the French thought they could cut off the clothes that had been torn off of their history, and overcome the curse of the number two.
At this IIIth Republic, central and creative time, Pierre Nora showed great interest and even tenderness: welcoming those who then used to repair the revolutionary fracture, teaching schoolchildren everything that in ancient France had obscurely prepared modern France and offering them a unified version of their history.
But this peaceful identity has only been for a while.
This is again in debate, driven by the immigration of a new type, threatened by the rise of Claimant Minorities, absorbed in the European area.
The book therefore offers both the fascinating portrait of France that goes on and the scenic outline of France that comes.
With, first of all, the portrait of the story, which should reserve some surprises.
We found out that the fireplace was a couple.
The man of multiple curiosity, slightly obsessive, revolved around the same idea.
The steering wheel was at the center of the centre.
And the one who had filed, this is more than a half century, a subject on the idea of the nation, but it was a distraction to the initial exercise of the thesis, trusts us, like grano salis, that he will end up doing it.
Certain in a less rigid, more fragile and subtle form.
But we don't cheat on it, it's also binding.
Because more than the figure imposed on the university course, this thesis says the inner necessity of a life.
A former hostage in Lebanon: "The return is quite complex to manage"
Removed from Beirut on 8 March 1986 with three members of his team "Antenne 2" came to film a Hezbollah event, journalist Jean-Louis Normandin was released almost 21 months later, November 27, 1987.
Retired since 2008, he has been involved in the establishment of the Association for the Defence of Otages of the World, which he has been chairing for several years.
Its main objective is to obtain the opportunity for hostages to bring complaints and bring their hostages to the International Criminal Court.
Held more than 1,000 days, the four hostages of Aqmi (Al-Qaida at the Islamic Maghreb) Daniel Larribe, Thierry Dol, Pierre Legrand and Marc Féret were released on Tuesday.
After medical examinations at the Val-de-Gràce military hospital on Wednesday afternoon, they were able, since, to find their families.
And try, at least, to resume their course of life.
"The New Observer" asked Jean-Louis Normandin, 62 years old, former reporter, retired since 2008, president of the Association "Otages of the World".
From the night of your release, you were on the 20th floor of "Antenna 2".
What are your memories of your release today?
On site, for example, in Beirut.
When I'm released, I find myself in the trunk of a car where I meet - without seeing him because he's black - Roger Auque.
He tells me we're released, but I'm not sure, and he tells me we can still be killed.
We are very excited, but very inclined, too.
It is war, and those who lead us are also very inclined.
They put us on the edge of a sidewalk.
There are Syrian soldiers.
We then arrive on the site of the hotel Summerland where the press is present.
Frenchmen take us to the Embassy of France.
It's time for the first time in a row to parents, family, friends, the press...
I remember having a bath for an hour.
And I've had a T-shirt at the embassy in France.
I also remember a short night to discuss with Roger and Marchiani.
The tension is still there because we have no means to escape to Larnaca Airport in Cyprus.
When we arrived there in a helicopter, we took a private plane that brings us back to France via Corfou and Solenzara, where Easter sails.
How did your arrival on the French soil take place?
We're landing in Orly.
Chirac, Prime Minister, is here.
It's kind of brutal.
There's an incredible compass.
And a lot of the media.
When I left, there were three television channels.
I'm coming back and it's full.
The descent of the plane ladder, the encounters with my son and my parents, my friends, all of this is extremely strong in emotion.
Between the airport and I, many motorcycles follow our car that Roussin is driving.
The motorists take the drill to take pictures and follow me to my house where I have to do some police to stop some of them from going up.
The media pressure is huge.
It doesn't stop, we're well placed to know...
But the state of emotion and fatigue is so difficult to see clearly.
We get out of a hole and we're all suddenly under the media lights.
It's a little complicated, a little violent, quite complex to manage.
But we've done the hardest.
The same night, I'm at 8:00, the next day I'm on TV too.
Then start a kind of life-rehabilitation, very slowly, for one or two months that are a bit like vacations.
How have medical examinations and DGSE debriefing been performed?
I was entitled to a first medical checkup in Corsica.
The rest was done in Val-de-Greece the following days my return: radios, exams in all kinds and encounter a psychiatrist.
It is not a meeting that does everything, but we know that we can count on it, remember it if necessary, that we are not delivered to ourselves.
This is part of the procedure.
I also met the intelligence services.
They asked me questions about hostages.
That was logical.
It didn't bother me.
How do you react today to the release of the four hostages from Niger?
I'm listening to what they say.
The debate on the ransoms, in particular.
Some things make me angry, others less.
I try to share the issues between my past as a hostage and my chairman's helmet of the Association "Otages of the World" which allows me to make a distance, and it seems to me much more interesting to discuss.
For example, I wonder about the definition of resilience.
Especially, I fight, with others, for the recognition of the legal status of the room.
I think there's a problem with semantics.
The taking of "political" hostages - which is most of the time - must be qualified and allow hostages to have access to justice, to bring complaints and to bring their hostages to the International Criminal Court.
Today, once again, everyone is in compassion, in emotion, and rejoices at the release of these hostages.
But who says that these hostages might also have access to justice?
A court in La Haye is done for that.
Why don't we tell the hostages "you've broken the rules of war, like those of all Geneva conventions, we're going to bring you to justice"?
It seems to me, however, to be founded, legitimized, hit with good sense.
This message is heard, but not listened, and it shocks me.
It's my main fight.
Egyptian Islamists in the street to denounce the Morsi trial
The anger rises in the ranks of Egyptian Islamists.
Two days before the trial of dehu President Mohamed Morsi opened, they went down to the streets.
Mobilisation throughout Egypt to demand the restoration of the first democratically elected president of the country.
It is not a trial that highlights this Muslim Brotherhood militant.
Until now, no lawyer has been able to meet him and no volunteer has been able to copy the case documents.
It's not a trial, it's a farce.
President Morsi's trial is a false trial of a pro-Morsi, he is the one who is supposed to judge Sisi, not the other.
Morsi must judge Sisi for the massacres of Rabaa, the massacres of Nahda, and the massacre of the Republican Guard.
Sisi is a liar and a traitor.
Faces broke out in Alexandria, the police used lacrimogen gas, 60 protesters were arrested.
On Monday, 20,000 police officers will be deployed to the Cairo Police Academy, where Mohammed Morsi will be judged.
Hagel accuses 9 American States of violating homosexual rights
Since the federal state recognized the homosexual marriage, "all military partners have the right to an identity card from the Department of Defence and the benefits that come with," the Minister in New York recalled in an address to the Anti-Defamation League against anti-Semitism.
"But some States refuse to issue these cards to their spouses in the same sex in the national guard's facilities" established in their territory, he has denounced them, condemning those States to violate federal law and the principle of equality.
Without these cards, these persons cannot benefit from many social or health services provided in these bases, or access their stores.
The Secretary of Defence has ordered the Chief of the National Guard, General Frank Grass, to ensure the implementation of the federal law.
The front of the nine States began by Texas, which refused to implement these benefits on the implantations of the National Guard of Texas, due to a conflict between the laws of Texas and the federal law on homosexual marriage.
He was joined in his refusal by India, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, Oklahoma, South Carolina and West Virginia, according to a high-level defence officer.
The Pentagon estimates the population concerned by the recognition of homosexual marriage to some 5,600 active persons, 17,000 including the National Guard, Reserve and Retirement.

The public will be able to admire the technical skills of young people who, for some, already attend the competitions at the highest level, like the young heroist Lorenzo Palumbo.
At only 10 years of age, he has already won his place this year for the European Championships in Copenhagen, and he likes nothing but to show up to competitors who are more than three heads.
The Mayor of Toronto chases journalists who came to ask him about a drug case
In Canada, Mayor Toronto is suspected of drug abuse, according to several media.
A video of justice seems to support these suspicions.
The interested person, Rob Ford, has always refused to consume cracks, while recognizing that he has a pen for cannabis.
This Thursday, he chased out a number of journalists who came to question him.
We also think that sometimes the images do not need an explanation or comment.
A case of rabies detected in a chat in the Val-d'Oise
The authorities announced on Thursday 31 October that a case of rabies had been detected in a caton in the Val-d'Oise, manifestly of foreign origin, while France has been free from Aboriginal cases since 2001.
The caton was found in Argentina on 25 October and died on 28 October.
The root diagnosis was confirmed by Pasteur Institute.
"An epidemiological investigation has been undertaken in order to identify and take care of persons who could have entered into contact with this caton between 8 October and 28 October," said the Departments of Health and Agriculture.
"Five people who have been in contact with the caton have already been identified" and received preventive treatment.
"In man, the prevention of human anger, administered after contact with the animal carrier, but before symptoms appear, is very effective," the communiqué said.
The departments now call on the persons who would have been bitten, bitten, shaken, or laid on a mucous membrane or on a skin damaged by this cat or whose animal would have been in contact with that cat between 8 and 28 October to contact on 08.11.00.06.95 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. from 1 November.
"Since France has been indemnified since 2001, this cotton or mother has been imported from another country, not indemnified," he said.
The Ministry of Agriculture states that the last case of "autochtone" of the identified root dates back to December 1998 on a kidney and that "France is officially declared free of this disease in November 2001 by the International Office of Epizootics (OIE)".
A case of rabies on a dog illegally imported from Gambia had been recorded in 2008.
"Range is a fatal disease if it is not treated on time," the departments recall and is transmissible for almost 15 days before the first symptoms of the disease appear.
Obama's going back on his health system reform
Under an avalanche of criticism, President Obama came back yesterday on his promise without doubt and often repeated that “if you are satisfied with your health regime, you can keep it”.
After hundreds of thousands of people received feedback from their providers, the Republicans criticized the President during the last days by accusing him of misleading the American people.
Yesterday, Barack Obama adjusted his original promise.
"The vast majority of people with health insurance can keep it," he said in a speech in Boston.
Speaking of what he calls "a lack of confidence in the present" about the resolutions, President Obama encouraged Americans who received these opinions to seek new market insurance.
Most people will be able to obtain comprehensive and better health schemes at the same price, or even less expensive than planned.
"You're going to win," he said.
The Administration announced that it should not be overlooked whether the 5 per cent of the population that contract their insurance themselves were forced to change their regime because their coverage did not meet the new standards required under the Affordable Care Act.
"Let me address these Americans directly: you deserve better," said Kathleen Sebelius in his testimony to the Energy and Trade Commission in Washington.
Ms. Sebelius, who oversees the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said that the launch of the online market in October had failed “sorryly”.
"I am as frustrated and angry as anyone," she added.
I'm looking forward to regaining your trust.
It is an exasperated Kathleen Sebelius who uttered this phrase, while she believed her micro cut, addressing an assistant sitting behind her at the Assembly's meeting yesterday following an exchange of views with Billy Long, a Republican representative of Missouri, to know whether she should join Obamacare.
For more than three hours, Billy Long has repeatedly asked Ms. Sebelius why "the architect" of the Affordable Care Act had not voluntarily renounced the government's insurance to subscribe to a regime via HealthCare.gov, which she now boasts to millions of Americans.
A special helmet at Abu Dhabi
The happy chosen Jake Vite Prekop combined the colors of the car brand and the German flag, while integrating the concepts of speed and heat at the track level.
German Sebastian Vettel, a four-way champion of Formula 1 world, trained for the free trials of the Grand Prix d'Abou Dhabi on Friday a special helmet whose design was made by a 21-year-old Mexican fan.
Vettel chose from among the 1,500 designs sent from around the world, as part of a competition launched by one of the sponsors, a car brand, of his ecuration.
He was invited to follow Abu Dhabi's GP, with a friend, and can therefore see the German champion on the track and in his stand.
Vettel was supposed to carry this helmet on Friday and Saturday, at the tests.
It is likely that he will have another special helmet on Sunday, for the race, intended to mark his 4th consecutive world title.
A resident of Aubervilliers launches his party of the banlieue
We don't cheat on each other.
In the spirit of Abdel-Malik Djermoune, his founder, the "Parti de la banlieue" is not only addressed to the banlieusards.
I've chosen a map of France as a logo, he's justifying it.
When I speak of banelieu, I address all those who are excluded from the great national family.
It does not prevent its project, presented on Thursday at a press conference in its native municipality of Aubervilliers, is born of the will to better defend multiculturalism, this great milking cultural pot that characterizes all neighborhoods.
My proposal No.1 is to create a Ministry of Multiculturalism, please say.
Abdel-Malik Djermoune, 50 years old, territorially attached, today claims to be "100% apolitic" even though he has not always been neutral.
Military in 2002 alongside Jean-Pierre Chevénement, he then locally supported Dominique de Villepin between 2010 and 2011.
I know that the values of equality that I propose in my program are linked to the left, but if the right-wing people are willing to support me, I will listen to them, too, he will follow.
There are only extremist parties I don't talk about.
In addition to multiculturalism, Abdel-Malik Djermoune has built its programme - consulted on the Internet - from many topics that are intended to speak to the people of banlieu and, in particular, to young people: the right to vote for foreigners, the legalization of cannabis, the civilian majority at 16 years of age, the rehabilitation of the function of the guardian of the building...
It remains to be found candidates to form lists and defend his ideas on the political scene."For the 2014 municipal elections, it is likely to be fair, he recognizes."
It's a problem of time and money.
The Banley Party should still be represented in Aubervilliers through my candidacy and I also hope in other cities.
Abdel-Malik Djermoune ensures that there are already seven lists in metropolitan France and Martinique.
"And the letters of support I have received since yesterday don't all come out of banlieu" he rejoiced.
John Kerry admitted, without precedent, that American espionage "was too far off in an inappropriate way"
John Kerry indicated that the United States' defensive attitude towards its monitoring programmes was being reduced by admitting, without precedent, that, on several occasions, espionage "was too far away in an inappropriate way".
The Secretary of State also admitted that he, like Barack Obama, was in charge of "automatic pilot" when a series of fire-fighting revelations by the complainant Edward Snowden regarding NSA spongiform activities appeared on the day.
The escapes put the U.S. government at the center of a diplomatic storm with its allies.
Speaking at an intergovernmental conference in London by video link, Mr Kerry said: "It is inconceivable that the President, myself and other members of the government have become aware of some things in automatic pilot mode because we had the opportunity, from the Second World War to the difficult years of the Cold War, then of course on 11 September."
He then became the first high-ranking member of the U.S. government to admit that American espionage had exceeded the limits, but insisted that the rights of each were not violated.
He said, "In some cases, it has gone too far in an inappropriate way."
And the President is determined to try to clarify and make clear to the people that he is now conducting a thorough review of these practices so that no one is mistaken.
I assure you that innocent people will not be victims of abuse in this process.
Mr. Kerry, however, insisted that NSA was a force for good and that its monitoring operations had saved many lives.
He added: “We live in a new world where people are willing to jump. ”
There is a radical extremism in the world that is determined to try to kill people, to explode them and attack governments.
What if you could intercept their communications and stop them before they act?
We have carefully and well prevented planes from falling, explosives and people from being killed because we have been able to learn the facts in advance.
Meanwhile, US legislators will move to Europe to respond to concerns about the alleged American espionage case and convince Europeans of the need to continue joint efforts to combat terrorism with the United States, the Senate's subcommittee on European affairs explained on Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy of the Connecticut indicated that he had spoken to the members of the European Parliament and others this week and that he was concerned about the threats they had posed regarding a possible withdrawal from anti-terrorism organizations due to the sense of frustration that results from the National Security Agency's monitoring.
"It is very important for the protection of national security in the United States that Europeans remain on our side in the mutual commitment to combating terrorism," said Murphy, a democrat serving his first mandate, and president of the European Senate's subcommission of affairs, during an interview since Washington.
And I will go to Europe to make them understand that we must continue working together to fight terrorism, despite the anger caused by NSA programs.
The press reports that the NSA has captured millions of communications in Europe, which has damaged relations with some U.S. allies, however, the Agency's director stated this week that it was incorrect and that it was a misunderstanding because it was about NATO allies collecting and sharing with the United States.
Other revelations reported documents published by Snowden that the NSA had intercepted data and communications from the German Chancellor Angela Merkel's mobile phone and from 34 other heads of state.
The director of intelligence services, James Clapper, justified the spying of allies by indicating that it was necessary and that it was a common practice on both sides.
In this stormy atmosphere, Murphy indicated that his office was organizing a trip to Congress, which should take place this year, and that he hoped that the delegation would understand members of both parties and rooms.
The names of the other participating legislators should be disclosed in the coming days.
He indicated that the route remained to be defined.
Murphy stated that the purpose of this trip was to improve relations, but also to prove "closed in affection".
He explained that the leaders of the European State should be honest with their citizens about the type of spying programmes they have been applying themselves for years.
"We can change our surveillance programmes to better protect European rights, but they also need to understand that we are not the only ones in the world to make the spying," Murphy said.
Meanwhile, Mr. Kerry planned to return this weekend to the Middle East and Poland to manage the heart of the American strategies in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as the United States monitoring activities.
The London Stock Exchange closed down on Thursday, culminated in the bad results of Shell and on the following day of an announcement by the Fed of maintenance in the state of its support for the economy, as planned.
An Australian calls for his prison sentence in Thailand
A 21-year-old resident of Sydney, sentenced to 15 days imprisonment in Phuket for allegedly having been assaulted by a taxi driver, appealed to the trial and was released under bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was first found guilty by a Phuket Province Court on 15 June of false statements after telling the Thai police that a local taxi driver, accompanied by two other men who controlled it, attacked him on Sunday 10 June.
However, video surveillance records later revealed that she had returned to her hotel safely after she had separated from her little Australian friend.
Phuket's police interrogated Bamford for two days before she could have invented the story of all the pieces.
She was detained in a local commissioner's cell before the court hearing.
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison sentence in a low-security detention centre in the Phuket area rather than in a prison for women.
This is the daughter of the former Australian Rugby League player Peter Tunks, who called on the Foreign Affairs Department of Canberra to help her daughter.
Tunks told Sydney's Sunday Telegraph that the whole family was "extremely concerned" about her daughter's well-being and wanted her to come back to Australia.
"We have obviously lived a distressing moment, but we hope to bring it home safely as soon as possible," Tunks said.
Bamford appealed for the judgment and was released after the payment of a guarantee of 50,000 bahts.
In Australia, the press stated that while waiting, it was on vacation in the Krabi region, south of Thailand.
Thai judicial sources indicated that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer from Phuket, but they predicted that the appeal could lead to an extension of the sentence that could go up to two years of imprisonment and imprisonment in a prison for adults.
However, after the recent murder in Phuket of Michelle Smith, an Australian travel agent, Thailand could also seek to reduce its damaged image to tourists, which could lead to an execution.
The French police will arrest Anderlecht's supporters other than RSCA's cars.
The French police decided to lay down strict rules regarding the meeting of the Royal Sporting Club d'Anderlecht against the Paris Saint-Germain fixed Tuesday, Marie Verbeke, spokesperson of the Brussels-midi police area on Friday.
The Belgian RSCA supporters who want to go to this meeting of the League of Champions will have to use the RSCA's displacement system.
"The bus convoy will be escorted by the police from a former Rekem border post to the PSG stage," the spokesperson said.
The procedure will be the same for the return.
"If other supporters had any intention to go to Paris by other means, the French police prefecture indicated that measures were taken to allow arrests or guards to be taken," Marie Verbeke said.
Living together in French, the challenge of the Marguerite-Bourgeoys school commission
At the Marguerite-Bourgeoys School Committee, 62% of students have a mother tongue other than French.
That is what motivated, one year ago, a consultation with parents, students, teachers and members of education staff, to reflect on ways to better integrate students who live on horseback between different cultures.
The school commission has just revealed its vision of "Live together in French".
The Vision of Diversity organization has been promoting itself in schools for one year to help students of all origins discover common references that are not limited to the French language.
The discovery of neighborhoods, our architecture, our places are benchmarks.
Great names of writers, artists, whether they're sober or they're from elsewhere.
Who are our builders?
"Then, projects are created so that they can identify themselves to all of this," explains Aida Kamar, President of Vision of Diversity.
Michel Venne, from the Institute of the New World, identified several challenges for the school commission.
"On the transmission, for example, of what is Quebec culture, the feeling of belonging, the support to staff in the transformations that we live in the student clientele," he says.
The Marguerite-Bourgeoys School Committee has set up a research centre that will provide tools to teachers who, at times, also come from elsewhere.
Rachida Azdouz, of the University of Montreal, will be the scientific director.
Preparation to manage a class in a North American context, Quebec.
"Various educational strategies, this is the real need," she said.
Research will cover the inclusion in all its angles: language, school, social and cultural.
