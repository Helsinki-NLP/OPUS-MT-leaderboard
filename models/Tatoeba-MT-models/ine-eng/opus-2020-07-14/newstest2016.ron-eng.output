The chief of the United Nations declares that there are no military solutions in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon claims that his response to Russia's military support for Syria is that "there is no military solution" to the conflict that lasts for almost five years and more weapons would only make the violence and suffering of millions of people.
The UN chief once again asked all parties, including the UN Security Council, to unify and support the negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said Wednesday at a conference that he intends to meet this month with foreign ministers from five permanent countries present in Council - USA, Russia, China, England and France - on the side of the General Assembly ministerial session to discuss Syria.
Ban expressed regret that divisions in the council and between the Syrian people and the regional forces "did this unresolved situation".
The Bank asked the five permanent members to give evidence of solidarity and unity shown when they were able to conclude an agreement on Iran's nuclear weapons, thus addressing the Syrian crisis.
8 survey figures showing Donald Trump has a real chance
Some have tried to label him as a "flip-flop" politician.
Others called him a joke.
And others are waiting for implosion.
However, no matter how some Republicans try to throw Donald Trump from the top of the polls, it didn't work (yet).
Ten of the last 11 national surveys showed that Donald Trump is driving a two-digit percentage, and some voices are starting to wonder seriously what this means for the chances of naming the real estate.
Of course, it's still premature.
None of this says Trump will win the race for nominating the Republicans.
Pundits shows that, in the same period of 2011, Rick Perry's advances were made to Herman Cain in the polls, but none of them won in any state in the process of nomination.
And the reasons why it would be hard to fight general elections are numerous.
But external groups such as Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the economic conservative Club for Growth admit Trump's power and start supporting him with money.
We also present a few recent surveys that suggest that real estate furniture is not just something passing:
The figures that indicate support for Trump have returned to 180 degrees.
Even before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a survey conducted by the University of Monmouth showed that only two of the 10 Republicans had a positive opinion on the real estate movement.
By mid-July, the percentage had risen to 40%.
At the beginning of August, it was 52%.
Today, six of the 10 Republicans have a favourable opinion about Donald Trump.
About three out of 10 says they have a negative opinion.
These figures are maintained.
A survey conducted last week by Quinnipiac in Iowa concluded that 60% of the Republicans in the region have a favourable opinion on Trump.
Two-thirds of the GOP electors would be happy if Trump won the nomination race.
In a survey conducted last week by CNN/ORC, 67% of Republicans said they would be "enthusiast" or "thank you" if Trump won the nomination race.
Only two out of 10 declares it would be "surcharged" if Trump won the nomination race.
Only Ben Carson generates about the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43% declares that it would be "enthusiasm" to 40% who declares the same thing about Trump).
The closest to enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio, only 21%.
On the other hand, 47% of Republican electors claim that they would be "unsatisfied" or "surfed" if the favorite Jeb Bush wins the nomination race.
Most Republicans don't consider Trump's temperament a problem.
Although Donald Trump was strongly criticized for his insults and his bombastic style, 52% of the Republican voters at the national level consider that the real estate movement has the right temperature to be president, according to the ABC News/Washington Post poll conducted months ago.
We have the same figures in Iowa, where 52% of the Republicans think Trump has the right personality to be a driver, according to the survey carried out last week by Quinnipiac.
However, 44% are of the opinion that it does not have the necessary personality to act efficiently and almost six out of 10 independent people say that its temperature does not have what it is looking for at the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters get used to the idea.
When I take the attitude of intellectuals, Republican voters consider Trump to be authentic.
According to a survey conducted last week by CNN/ORC, on the question who has the most chance to win the race for GOP nomination, four out of 10 said Trump.
The situation has changed before the end of July, when four out of 10 would be on Jeb Bush.
Full information: in the past, GOP voters did not read the future very well.
In the same period of the last election, four of the 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry in the process of nomination, compared with only 28% for Mitt Romney.
However, these figures show that most GOP electors consider Trump's campaign plausible.
Even if the Republicans or rebounded to another candidate, the Trump is still in the front of everyone.
Some voices say that the divided situation will probably contribute to Trump's victory, while supporting Trump will split to more than twelve candidates.
However, a survey conducted at the beginning of September at the University of Monmouth shows that, in the hypothetical situation of a cooperation between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump will almost always benefit from majority support.
Trump is located 13 points away from Carly Fiorina, 14 points from Marco Rubio, 15 points from Walker, 19 points from Jeb Bush and finally 33 points away from Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie.
It's almost equal to Ted Cruz.
The only candidate to beat him?
Ben Carson would beat the business man with 19 points in a hypothetical confrontation of one to one.
Most of Donald Trump's supporters say they've decided.
A new survey conducted on Tuesday by CBS/NYT shows that over half of the voters who support Trump declare that they do not change their voting option.
Obviously, a lot can happen in this sense and no one can say that they will never be reconsidered.
46% claims that it leaves the door open to change its option.
However, Trump's most important opponent is currently the neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but it is twice as likely that voters who declare they have decided to vote with Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say I agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico "violators" in the opening speech of his campaign, two months ago, immigration was the central subject of the campaign for 2016.
Some are concerned that Trump's bombastic style will lead to a gap between the important Hispanic voters and the Republican Party and will undermine the rebranding efforts.
However, according to the ABC/Post survey conducted months, six out of 10 Republicans claim to agree with Trump on immigration.
So, it seems as long as the problem of immigration remains in the light of reflectors, it will also remain the Doland Trump.
Frustration against authorities reaches new peaks.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are now supported by almost half of the Republican electors, largely due to their foreign status.
According to a monthly ABC/Post survey, six out of 10 Republicans claim that they prefer a political outsider to someone with experience in government.
People are also upset with the Washington authorities.
A survey conducted two weeks ago in Iowa by Des Moines Register/Bloomberg shows that three of the four Republics in Iowa are frustrated by the performance of the Republics of Cognres, 54% declaring themselves "unsatisfied" and 21% "enraged at the top".
Jeremy Corbyn makes his debut at Prime Minister's Questions
Ever since his election, Mr. Corbyn's debut at PMQs has been long awaited
The new leader of the Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, will start later at Prime Minister's Questions, facing David Cameron for the first time.
Mr. Corbyn will address the first of the six questions he has the right to shortly after lunch; his performance will probably be analysed closely by the media and the Labour MPs.
During the weekly appearances, he asked for "less theatre and more facts".
He also stated that he could give up a few participations and give them to his colleagues.
The conference will be Mr Corbyn's first parliamentary test as leader, coming after he called a "phantom cabinet" and after the speech he gave Tuesday at the annual TUC Congress.
Meanwhile, the decision of the leader of the Labour Party to keep silence on the birth of the national immunisation in a job held on Tuesday at the 75th anniversary of the Battle of England attracted critics from conservative parliamentarians and held the first page of the newspapers.
Mr. Corbyn's decision not to sing the national hymn attracted attention
A speaker of Mr. Corbyn's speech said that he "kept silence in a respectful manner" and acknowledged "the heroism of the British Air Force in Battle of England."
But a member of Mr. Corbyn's ghost cabinet Owen Smith, told the BBC's Two's Newsnight issue that he would be recommended to the Labour leader to sing the "independent" national hymn of his belief that the monarch should be abolished.
Around twelve ministers in the ghost cabinet refused to be part of Mr Corbyn's front team, arguing by differences of opinion related to economy, defence and external, while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party supported him as a leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant states that the political differences in the Labour Party are "complemented" after Mr. Corbyn's name on his position with the European Union and limited benefits.
Mr Corbyn said at the TUC conference that the Labour Party would bring about changes that would eliminate the idea of limitation completely.
A few hours later, Mr Smith, Minister of Labour and Pensions, said the party "is very clear" in the exclusive opposition to the government's plans to reduce the "cap" level from 26,000 pounds to 23,000 pounds.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth Laborist leader David Cameron in the court in the last decade, since he took over the leadership of the Conservative Party.
The laborist leader, who has promised a different approach to politics, says he has ideas "outsourced" for questions addressed to Mr Cameron and has received more than 30,000 suggestions.
Parliament President Islington North said that PMQs involves an too high level of confrontation and that it will refrain from replicating and attacking, engaging in the exchange of serious problems such as poverty, inequality and challenges facing young people.
Mr. Corbyn said that Angela Eagle, the Finance Minister, will take place at PMQs when he cannot participate - for example when Mr. Cameron is moving abroad.
He also expressed the idea that he would allow other colleagues to take the floor, saying he had approached the President of the Chamber of Deputies, John Bercow, to discuss this issue.
In 2005, when he took the lead, Mr Cameron said he wanted to give up the political style "Punch and Judy" often associated with PMQs, but he admitted a few years later that he did not succeed in his march.
Since the first transmission in 1990, PMQs has been considered a key barometer of a leader's reasoning, the way in which it leads the House of Deputies and its position among parliamentary colleagues, although the critics claim to have become a cartoon and that it needs a thorough reform.
"Cadru in Joburg": Teens without shelter benefit from photography courses
It's hard to be a homeless man in Johannesburg.
But a group of people who lived on the streets in childhood found a way to learn a job and earn their lives.
"I was shot in Joburg" is a non-profit studio that teaches young people without shelter to take pictures of the areas in which they live and earn money from it.
BBC News met with one of the first graduates of the project.
Chief JD Sports says the bigger wages could damage the extensions
President JD Sports, Peter Cowgill, states that an increase in the minimum wage in the UK could mean "a greater purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers."
However, it is unlikely that that purchasing power will exceed the higher costs for the labour force within the firm, he says.
Costs could have an impact on JD Sports expansion plans, he added, which could mean fewer new jobs.
Thanasi Kokkinakis supported by President Tennis Australia, Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis would deserve to be praised and not criticized for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was a side-victim in the "furtuna" created around his friend, Nick Kyrgios, and his behavior deserves more praise and no criticism, in the opinion of President Dennis Australia, Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, the younger part of the talented duo often called "Special Ks", was unsatisfied in the light of the reflections by the scandalous crowd Kyrgyz faced by Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters tournament.
In a short-term qualifying match, in Cincinnati, the chair arbitrator had to intervene twice to divide Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison, after Harrison said: "Wawrinka should have put him on the ground Kyrgyos, and I should have put him on the ground."
Although he was last seen doing a dust rocket after he had muscle cramps and missed a possible U.S. Open tournament, angry at Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was firmly defended by Healy.
The teenager is now in Glasgow, where he fights with Sam Groth for the place two to the individual, after Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semifinal against England.
"One thing I feel powerful is that, in my opinion, Thanasi was attracted to a little conflict," Healy said.
The truth is that he broke a rocket when he lost because he accused the crash in the US, but he's not the first player to break a rocket from frustration against himself and I know Thanasi well enough to know that he wouldn't be proud of it.
But to be serious, he's been very well mastered in quite challenging situations in the US with Harrison and so on and I think he deserves a lot of trust.
He's got an extraordinary team, he's got a great family next to him, and I think he was treated unfairly.
He is a 19-year-old very mature, he works hard and has joined the team, has had no conflict with other players, is highly respected in the dress, is trained hard, is in an excellent form, is a very balanced and mature young person and I think he deserves to be judged solely on the basis of his qualities and defects.
Healy also supported the decision not to take Kyrgyz into account for the major game of resignation, which begins on Friday, and described the "common decision" as the most appropriate for all, but supported the return of the player from Canberra in the long term to the team.
"First of all, we want the team to focus on the game completely and not think about the controversy around him [Kyrgios]," Healy said.
And I think Nick came up very quickly, as people like Feder and Murray said, he matured under the public's eyes and made some terrible mistakes and deserved to be criticized, but we're trying to support him, we're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions and I think he needs a time when he's not in the center of attention to be able to reflect, good thing for both the team and for him.
Choices 2016: Hillary Clinton's advantage over Bernie Sanders has been reduced to half in national surveys
The former State Secretary, Hillary Clinton, still has a two-digit advantage in the democratic race for national candidacy, but Senator Bernie Sanders wins the field.
Clinton is now supported by 47% of the democratic electors (down from 58%), while Sanders is on the second floor, with 27% (up to 17%).
Vice-President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he will run for the presidency, is supported by 15% of the democratic electors.
At least five months before the start of the primary elections, most democratic voters say it is too early to say they have decided on the candidate they will support.
However, Clinton's supporters are more firm in their choice than other candidates.
In view of the survey carried out by CBS news last month, Clinton lost his land in a number of demographic groups, while Sanders won a few percent.
Clinton maintains the advantage among women and the moderates, but the advantage has been reduced.
Support among men has decreased considerably and Sanders is only 5 points away.
Clinton's advantage among the democratic electors under the age of 50 has evaporated, now equal to Sanders.
However, Clinton is still in favour of the senior electors.
Last month, Clinton was in front of Sanders, with one percent of the two figures, among the liberals, but Sanders now has an easy advantage of 5 points in this group.
Approximately half of the national democratic electors declare that they would enthusiastically support Clinton if he was chosen to run on behalf of the party.
A sphere would support it somewhat reserved and another 15% would support it only because it represents the party.
Six percent wouldn't support it.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, Clinton's current supporters are more likely to be excited about his choice.
Opinions are more mixed up among those who don't currently support Clinton - only about a quarter would support her with enthusiasm.
While 48% of the democratic electors declare that they would enthusiastically support Clinton, the number of Republican electors declaring the same thing about the first class, Donald Trump (35%) is smaller.
When Clinton's supporters are asked an open question about why she would like to win the race, the majority answer is that she has the right experience (16%), followed by the fact that the time has come for a woman to be president (13%) and that she is the best candidate for this function (10%).
Clinton's supporters also mention their association with Bill Clinton (9%).
The agreement on these aspects and eligibility shall also be mentioned.
In view of the fact that the Vice-Presidents are counting on a possible presidential candidacy, 57% of the democratic electors would like to see him in the race - although a third I think he should not run.
On the question of the second option for the party's representative, the democratic voters call Biden a majority.
Of Clinton's supporters, more than half claim that Biden would be the second option, long before Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run in the Democratic Party, Hillary Clinton's advantage in front of Sanders grows, from 20 points with Biden running at 30 points if it doesn't.
55% of the democratic electors consider Clinton the candidate with the highest chance to win the general election; however, the figures fell from 78% last month.
Biden is located at a distance of two but the percentage according to which the most eligible has grown.
However, when asked what is most important to an elected candidate, democratic voters prefer problems instead of eligibility.
Like last month, no democratic or possible candidate is considered by these voters to be unacceptable as the party's representative in the presidential run.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates are well dealt with in relation to a few key features of their party's primary electors.
Most voters consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden to be integrity and trust and strong leadership.
Biden is seen best among all three in terms of integrity, while Clinton's strong point is leadership.
30% of the democratic electors do not believe that H. Clinton is integrated and confident, twice as much as those who declare this about Sanders (15%), but 27% do not have an opinion about him in this regard.
Democratic electors generally also consider that the three, Clinton, Sanders and Biden, have the same ideology.
Referring to all these aspects, about a quarter of the democratic electors have no opinion about Sanders.
As there are still questions about the use of a personal email address and a server by Hillary Clinton when he was Secretary of State, most democratic voters are grateful for his explanation on the subject and say that he did not affect their general view of the candidate.
But things are different among the American public.
Half of the Americans are unhappy with her explanation now, while only about a third are thankful.
The public opinion was divided in March on this subject, shortly after the issue came to light.
Most Americans say that that email-related controversy has not affected their general opinion about Clinton, although 36% say they have changed their opinion negatively.
Most Republicans, more than six out of 10, say they have changed their opinion about Clinton in a negative way.
Although democratic voters consider Clinton as an integral and trustful one, this issue continues to raise problems among voters at the general level: only 32% consider it as an integral and trustary one, with 8% less than last month and 15% less than in May.
62% of voters do not consider it to be complete and reliable.
At the same time, 55% of voters at the national level do not consider Trump to be an integral and worthy of trust.
However, both Clinton and Trump have been white for leadership.
Among the six rated candidates, Biden, Carson and Bush are first classified in terms of integrity.
The number of people who regard Sanders as integral is greater than those who are not of the same opinion, however, as in Carson's case, many do not have an opinion about him.
The margin of error for the 351 sample of primary democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
Five members of the brother-in-law charged with the murder of a student in the year 1 of the Baruch Faculty
Nearly two years after a college student lost his life during an opening ritual in the Poconi Mountains of Pennsylvania, five people were accused of murder.
The members of the Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood at the Baruch Faculty in New York brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during a ritual of initiation in September 2013 and delayed to take him to the hospital, which contributed to his death, according to police statements.
Official sources say that the victim was linked to the eye, placed behind him a 14 kg backpack full of sand and was crushed repeatedly while trying to go straight to a target, on a frozen ground.
Mr. Deng accused him of headaches after losing his knowledge.
The members of the Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood did not call the emergency number after she left and pretended that she would have waited an hour before taking him to the hospital, the police say.
But they found time to change Deng's clothes, look for his symptoms on Google and contact Andy Meng, the president of the brotherhood at the national level, to ask him for advice, said police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference.
"At this point, members began to hide personal goods and put the welfare of the brotherhood ahead of Michael Deng," Wagner said.
He couldn't be resurrected and died on the second day of the morning.
According to an autopsy report, Deng suffered repeated traumas to the head, trunks and thighs.
"Many families have been devastated by the rituals of the brothers, since 1970 at least one student has lost his life every year because of the rituals," said Douglas Fierberg, Deng's lawyer, in a statement.
The brothers and their members must be held accountable and this measure taken by the authorities is important.
The Grand Jury of the Monroe District recommended that the first five members be charged with a three-degree murder.
The other thirty-two members of the brotherhood, including Mr Meng, will also be charged with ultrasonic and complicity to murder.
"We want to get the answer not only to the people involved but, if there is an organization that has authorized the phrase, official or informal, we will also get the answer," Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch's faculty banned the brotherhood and the national brotherhood withdrew its membership with local representation.
Here's what's going to happen when the Federal Reserve's going to increase the interest rate.
The interest rate will rise and the bull market (the growing market) will fall, the profitability of the bonds will rise and the economy will fall.
That's what we know.
What we don't know is how long it's gonna take and how long.
In the economy, history offers little indication of the time frame..
After the first growth of the interest rate, the recession occurred in only 11 months and lasted 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates is often, although not always, a decisive factor in how the economy and financial assets respond.
As a result, US central bank officials have so strongly stressed that investors should not focus on the moment when interest rates are beginning to rise but on the path of the time needed for normalisation.
Actually, there are multiple variables in the game.
In the end, however, market players could find that all the anxiety associated with the increase in the interest rate was excessive.
"The first increase in the interest rate decided by the Fed after the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some voices as a sign of the era of "left banks," said Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, in a note addressed to customers.
On the contrary, we do not expect the sudden return of U.S. interest rates to normal levels, but it is still small to be the sixth shock that everyone seems to fear.
But it can't be said that there will be no effects.
We continue to show how a few sectors of the economy could react, based on historical trends:
Given the situation that the market has faced in the last few months, the early growth of the interest rate can be volatile for a time.
But at the time of growth, the impact is not so dramatic.
"It seems that there is a tendency that the profitability of the capital should be stagnated for 12-24 months after the first growth, which may reflect the lack of monetary policy again," analysts Deutsche Bank said in a recent study on what will happen after the Fed growth.
More precisely, over the past 35 years, the market has grown rapidly - with about 14 percent - towards growth in interest rates, quite invariable in the 250-day period (average decline of 2.6%) after it returns to normal after 500 days, with an average return in the last six cycles of 14.4%, according to a recent analysis published on Barron by the New Asset Management Chief Strategy.
Deutsche said that the impact on the actions tends to become pronounced later in the growth cycle of the interest rate and the benefits are beginning to fall.
The recession is a reality of economic life, but increasing the interest rate often contributes to it.
In the face, Fed faces conditions that did not exist before and that could accelerate a recession.
More precisely, the gross domestic product will approach its historical minimum to increase the Fed interest rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, of the 118 interest rate growth since 1950, only twice the nominal GDP was less than 4.5%.
Even if in the second quarter of 2015 the value was 3.6%, little is expected to persist, the third quarter reaching only 1.5%, according to Atlanta Fed.
The increase in interest rates in such a fragile economy could be risky and could raise the question "if this time is different," Deutsche said.
Market players have been preparing themselves all year round for a growing decision by the Fed, all eyes being set to meet this week of the Federal Open Market Commission, which ends on Thursday.
Although numerous strategies and economists are of the opinion that FOMC could approve an increase in interest rates on the occasion of this meeting, transactions in the term indicate a mere 25% probability.
"In our study carried out after 1950, all the growth cycles of the interest rate so far have been in a super profit growth cycle, GDP eclipsed the peaks before the recession very quickly after the recovery began," the report said.
On the contrary, it was a strange slow recovery after the most severe recession of the period analyzed.
The current cycle is far from the longest expected by Fed since the end of the last recession; the memory was 35 months, and it reached 74 months and continues.
The fixed income was also volatile given that the market anticipates an increase in interest rates and the type is somewhat similar to that of dividends.
The main difference is that the impact is faster in the case of obligations than in the case of actions when Fed changes policy.
In the case of obligations, the benefits appear to change direction as soon as the first growth/down of the cycle occurs.
At the end of the growth cycle of the interest rate, the profitability of bonds fell immediately," Deutsche said.
Charles Schwab's strategies are of the opinion that these growths in the interest rate will determine the closeness of profitability between short-term bonds and long-term bonds, afflating the curve.
High profitability obligations are better managed in such an environment, although "we are still careful about strengthening profitability," said Kathy Jones, a fast-track analyst in Schwab.
Interestingly, Jones is of the opinion that markets have already adapted to Fed's expectations.
"In addition to the power of the dollar and the downfall of the estimated inflation, there are some signs that the market has adapted to the perspective of a more rigorous monetary policy," Jones wrote.
The short-term interest rates have grown, the profitability curve is more straight, the spread of the average credit interest rate has expanded and the volatility has increased - all market characteristics when Fed advocates politics.
In large lines, companies performing majority activity in the US will have to win as a result of the increase in interest rates and local products will become more attractive.
Multinationals with large debts will suffer as the increase in the dollar will lead to their savings in the global market and their debt will be more expensive.
"History shows that "quality stocks" tend to be more profitable in the three months following an initial increase in the interest rate," said Goldman Sachs in a customer report.
Strong-balance-sheet firms exceeded those with a low-balance after each of the interest rate increases of 1994, 1999 and 2004, with an average of 5 percentage points.
Companies with large capital deposits and low-volatility stocks also exceeded companies similar to a lower quality, with an average of 4 (percentage points), respectively 3 (percentage points).
The debt will become an important issue.
Companies with a large percentage of floating debt have the most to lose, says Goldman.
Consumers will also have won from the increase in the dollar.
Economists could also have won, although experts do not agree on how quickly this will happen.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, MP Andrew Bingham says
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham criticized the radio post because it "prostitutes"
It states that it is more and more similar to the commercial opponent
He also looked at BBC Music Awards, claiming that British awards were being paid
Comrade Damien Collins attacked The Voice, claiming that this issue is not original.
BBC Radio 3 "transforms into" Classic FM, said an important parliamentary, putting pressure on the post to prove that it does something that commercial posts do not do.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told the BBC leaders that the public radio post "prostitutes" and looks more and more like the commercial opponent.
"I feel that Radio 3 "pross" - although I don't like using the word - but I feel that it turns into Classic FM," he said.
He also looked at BBC Music Awards, launched last year in December.
BBC Music Awards, released last year, seems to be British under a different name.
So if you're trying to do something different - these are the two examples that come to my mind that I do nothing but copy what is already on the market," said Mr. Bingham.
The director-general of the BBC has denied the charges, claiming that BBC Radio 3 is very much in front of his commercial opponent with regard to live music and public education.
I'm not going to find out anything about the classical music I get from Radio 3.
And his commitment to live music and production has no rivals.
"In addition, I think it is also important to commit Radio 3 to discover new music and to assign new songs," he said.
In the first part of this year, BBC editor Radio 3, Alan Davey, said he had to make more efforts to attract audiences over the past period because the British have less knowledge of classical music.
But Radio 3 was not the only item under the BBC's seal criticised during the meeting of the Committee on Culture, Mass and Sport because it would follow the tracks of its commercial rivals.
Conservative parliamentary Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the BBC-acquired talent show from the Dutch producer Talpa Media for the amount of about 22 million pounds sterling.
Do you understand why there are often discussions about that issue because it is not original and is not distinguished by anything?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC1 show - having the Paloma Faith and Boy George in jury - be performed "in a specific way to BBC."
He added that he wished that the Corporation "to find a gold-eating gown in its own garden" next time he launched a entertainment show.
However, he refused to ban the future takeover of new seasons in The Voice or spend the money that goes on licenses in other forms of entertainment.
Internet sales recorded the smallest growth in August and the guilty could be Black Friday
In the first three months of 2015, online sales increased by 7%.
In the last month, the slowest growth has been recorded from 2000 to now.
Online sales took up to three years ago, due to the use of the mobile phone to make purchases.
Specialists are of the opinion that the Black Friday in November could determine the resuscitation of expenditure.
For over a decade, online purchases have exploded and turned commercial streets in the UK into ghost cities.
Experts say, however, that there are signs that online sales are decreasing, the latest figures indicating an increase of only 7% in the first three months of 2015.
The total spending in August presented the smallest growth from 2000 to now, with only a 5% increase in the last year.
Experts say there are signs that online sales are decreasing, the latest figures indicating an increase of only 7% in the first three months of 2015.
"If we analyze the level of growth in previous years and come back by 2000, there has always been a tendency to rationalize over time," Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG Sales Index, told the Guardian.
He explained that online sales took a long time ago three years ago, when buyers began using the mobile phone to make purchases.
Thus, it increased the number of people who could make online purchases and could do it under different circumstances, such as on the couch.
But now that it is slowing down a little, you may notice a decline (of growth).
The Black Friday phenomenon, imported from America, is mentioned as one of the reasons for the decline in sales.
In the opinion of the experts, buyers would refrain from making purchases before the event that took place last Friday in November.
Last year, five times the average number of buyers stared in front of computers to put their hands on the offer, leading to the collapse of the site's more details.
Specialists are of the opinion that Black Friday, when buyers beat on chilipires, could determine the retrecience of buyers.
A study published by the British Retail Consortium found that at least £ 1 in every £ 5 is spent online.
In the case of certain products, such as televisions and washing machines, more than one third of the purchases are currently being carried out through online stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people prefer to buy online clothes and shoes than to appeal to fashion shops in commercial areas.
After the Sanctification of the Bin Laden family, the Muslims bury the victims killed after the massacre of the Mecca macara
The bodies of 29 of those who lost their lives were walked on Muslim streets, the first funerals taking place in Mecca.
Saudi Arabia partly won the giant in the construction of Saudi Binladin Group for defeat.
Minister of Health said that a total of 394 people were injured following the collapse of the macara
In the street tour, hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims, killed because of a macara that was smashed into the great mosque in Mecca.
Dressed in white, those who cried their deaths joined the road to express their condolences until the first death reached the end of the final trip to Al-Moaisem cemetery.
The sad memory of the holy place, where only a few days ago a macara of construction broke down through the mosque ceiling, falling on believers.
The bodies were released for funerals after the King of Saudi Arabia sentenced the Bin Laden family construction group for disaster, which also fought with 394 wounded.
In the ceremony on the street, hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims, killed because of a macara that was smashed in the Great Mosque in Mecca.
Among the victims was the father of four children, Qasim Akram, from Bolton, Great Manchester, found in his first pilgrimage when the macara was broken.
Mr. Akram was in the Moschee Sea with his parents before the beginning of the annual haj pilgrimage.
The Saudi authorities have already promised that the hajj pilgrimage to Mecca will continue, thousands of pilgrims still arriving in the city.
Today, King Salman said that the Binladin Group should not have left the raised macara arm when the macara was not in operation.
An Arab version of the decree, published by the Swedish Press Agency, stated that the Binladin Group partially bears the blame for the breach.
The news agency's English service did not present that detail, but said the company's leaders had been banned from leaving the country.
Earlier this week, Salman swore to reveal what caused the macaraca to collapse in the court of Mary Moschei, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims came before the shark pilgrimage that took place later this month.
The Binladin group has not yet made statements about the macara collapse and the Group's representatives could not be contacted for statements.
The Royal Decree blamed the group for not using updated security measures and did not coordinate its activities with the meteorological authorities.
Ten of the macaras surrounding the Mcca Sea, as part of the massive construction effort led by the Binladin Group.
For several decades, the Binladin family has a close relationship with the Royal Family of Saudi Arabia and is delivering major construction projects.
The last leader of Al Qaida, Osama bin Laden, was a "refused" son, demolished by family in the 1990s.
The blast occurred in strong wind and rain conditions, with only a few days before millions of people in the kingdom came to participate in the pilgrimage, essential journeys at least once in the lives of each Muslim physically fit.
The authorities state that 158 people remain in the hospital.
The authorities have decided that the relatives of the victims who have died to receive a million of the Saudi Rials (174,000 lire sterling) and the same amount to pay those with permanent injuries.
Other wounded will receive half of this sum.
Advantages and disadvantages of converting loans into Swiss francs
On the bank market there were already two bids to convert loans into Swiss francs, the main advantages being the exclusion of foreign exchange risk and the reduction of interest rates.
The disadvantages can come over a few years, when the variable threshold can lead to a majority of the rates.
The Bank of Transylvania just completed the process of converting loans to francs granted by Volksbank, and Bankpost announced the offer of conversion for its own customers.
According to data collected by financial portal analysts Finzoom, Bankpost offers a fixed fee of 1.5%, the smallest on the market.
On the other hand, the transfer bid of the Transylvania Bank was accepted by 83% of free credit customers due to the second successive reduction: the balance was reduced by the value of the risk commissions and the administration paid by the client, then an additional reduction of 22.5% was applied to the balance in law.
Both offers reduce the rates of their customers, the girl as monthly equivalent in her before conversion.
Thus, the Transylvania Bank reduces the rate by 42.5% and the Bank Post, by 33% in the first three years and, theoretically, by 18% in the following years.
Benefits
The main advantage of the credit cover in the CHF is to eliminate the foreign exchange risk, the consumer being protected by the future discounts of the franc, and the repayment of the credit will be done in the currency in which the salary is paid.
Another major advantage of both conversion offers is that property is not reassessed, additional guarantees are no longer required and another proof of income.
In practice, there will be no new financial and legal analysis of the credit and no additional costs as in the case of a refinancing.
Both banks also offer a reduction in the monthly rate, the face of which customers pay before conversion, equivalent in law.
Risks
The problem is that the rate in the first years is more than the doband format, and the customer repays very little primarily.
The Bankpost offer with a very small fee in the first three years seems beneficial to customers.
But he didn't know how this will evolve after three years.
The margin offered to customers can be greater than 3.25%, so overall, and the cost reduction is lower.
A possible risk for all the credits in lei with variable doband is that the ROBOR indices grow significantly over the years (more than the Libor - CHF indexes).
For example, ROBOR three months ago is 1.44%, but in 2013 it reached 6%, in 2009, over 15%, and in a few days 2008 it exceeded 40%!
In addition, other costs, not mentioned in the initial offer, may also be incurred.
Time has come for decisions on the interest rate for the US Federal Reserve
The world looks forward to the scheduled meeting in two days, Wednesday and Thursday, when the US Federal Reserve will make a crucial decision whether to increase or not the interest rate for the first time after about a decade.
In a survey conducted by Reuters with the participation of 80 economists, a little over half that last week thought the decision would be taken, I now believe that the situation will continue for a while and that interest rates will be kept in the current range of 0-0.25%.
It's a historic event because it's been seven years since the Federal Reserve brought the rates to zero.
For the first time, we face a situation in which a major central bank could give up the zero rate and start a process of normalising interest rates," said Angel Ubide, a head analyst at Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy has evolved relatively well, bringing back thousands of dollars in balance and generating a low level of inflation.
However, the Federal Reserve must not ignore the global situation less pink.
It warned the markets to prepare for growth, but there are signs that even they think such a movement is unlikely.
The decision will be announced on Tuesday, 20:00 CET.
You see that they lost their drug
The actor (left), along with his son Redmond (right), has gone through stressful situations in recent years.
He fought leukemia in 2001 and lost his life partner, Farrah Fawcett, in front of cancer in 2009.
It is also called that the actor would have faced the problem of drug use and in 2008 he was arrested for possession of drugs.
All of this certainly has a cost.
The player Luke Shaw from Manchester United stands at the bar for a few months due to double fractures.
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture at the right foot in the match played by Manchester United in the League of Champions, ended with a defeat in front of PSV Eindhoven.
After the event that brought tears to the player's eyes and that will keep him at the bar for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains optimistic that Shaw will be able to play again this season.
The accident occurred following an unfavourable intervention by Héctor Moreno in 15 minutes after Shaw, at the age of 20, broke the PSV defense.
She received medical attention for nine minutes on the ground and needed oxygen before she went to the hospital.
Van Gaal said: "He has a double fracture at his feet and is in the hospital."
He'll be transferred tomorrow, or maybe he'll be fine then he'll be operating in Manchester.
It's awful - a boy who came to Manchester United when he was 18, has trouble, then plays fantastic and now something like that happens.
He's got his oxygen mask in his closet.
She was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but in the double fracture the rest is six months and won't play in the group phase.
I hope he can play again this season.
Moreno seems to have been lucky and escaped from the red cardboard and the concession of a punishment strike.
Arbitrary Nicola Rizzoli didn't punish Mexican.
Van Gaal suggested that the Italian official was wrong.
You can judge yourself when I say it's fault and red cardboard.
It was a very ugly intervention, with two legs.
A message on Shaw's Twitter account: "Thank you all for the messages, I have no words to express how weak I am, start the way to recovery, I will become stronger."
Similar information: Manchester United hits Luke Shaw's accident in the face of PSV
The founder of the English team has an additional reason to recover to play at the European Championship in France next June.
Phillip Cocu, coach PSV, said: "It's a very ugly accident."
Everyone is very sad when a player suffers such an accident.
Our players never want to hit an opponent.
Moreno broke his foot playing for Mexico's national against the Dutch-led Van Gaal at the 2014 World Championship.
"It's very hard because he didn't intend to hurt his opponent, and when you hear it's a very serious accident, it's not good," Cocu said.
I didn't see the stage.
I managed to see only the ball, which was heading in a different direction, so it seemed that [Moreno] touched it but I could not see the intervention on Luke.
In the statement for SBS6, Moreno said: “I know what it is, I know how difficult it is to get through this.
I feel stupid, I'm so sorry.
The PSV player, Andrés Guardado, also arrived at the hospital after an intervention by Chris Smalling.
Adam Lyth clearly risked England's mission, but it's still tough.
The victory against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, however, after I have seen the team selected by England for the tournament, I do not take into account a repeat of the 3-0 defeat in the test matches.
I wouldn't eliminate any variant of a win in the move.
Perhaps Alastair Cook's team has less experience than three years ago but has good spin players in the beating line and collective morality is strong; they will not be marked by the 2012 events and will have a positive teenage attitude.
Moeen Ali evolves as a spinner and Adil Rashid, even if it is unknown at the test level, it is an option for attack.
Similar subjects: Adam Lyth left England team for test matches and was replaced by Alex Hales
Obviously, as his principal coach in Yorkshire, I find it difficult to analyze the decision not to select Adam Lyth on the team.
He played the seven test games against two good attackers, under difficult conditions, and the simple but hard reality is that cricket players are judged by results.
There were no questions related to Joe Root, for example, until the announcements were made because - and I said this before - players are their own selectives.
A few fifty years and maybe Lyth would have extended his run but his destiny is in his hands.
I hope if he does more runs for Yorkshire he'll have other opportunities.
The chief coach of the team of England, Trevor Bayliss, praised his attitude even when performance was not in the measure of his capacity and does not surprise me; first of all, he is a teamman.
It's hard to answer the question as long as you notice a batsman in the test matches.
Lyth had seven runs--like Sam Robson before him--while Nick Compton had nine.
Only Compton had good luck at home and moving.
The only disappointment you could have was that England preferred Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean tour - when Lyth was in the highest form - but that missed occasion is the area of the past.
The team comes with Alex Hales, a batsman I'm paying very well.
He's a cricket player who has the "X factor" and I noticed him early in Yorkshire this season when he marked 236 against us at a pitch Trent Bridge.
It should be given at least the same opportunity as those before it, however, will depend of course on the composition of the team in the UAE.
It was launched the idea that Moeen would open at the battle next to Cook, which would lead an extra spinner keeping at the same time four quicks, and I have nothing against it.
I don't see why a thrower couldn't hit there and this left player has already shown that he's fucked.
Perhaps Moeen did not bring success to his district, Worcestershire, but it was No. 3 for them, so the difference is not great.
My old teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 test 38 games as the first drop before entering open in 2001.
He immediately wiped out three centuries and didn't look back.
Zafar Ansari comes into the team on the back-up spinner post and, although I had a limited contact with him, I failed that he was a very impressive young man.
People could judge his fragmented age - with an average of 31 at battle and 35 at the mine - and they might think it's a point, but there's not a bunch of sprinklers and the selections opted for the youth.
He'll learn a lot from this tournament.
England has also made a few changes to the training team.
Mahela Jayawardene's name, Sri Lanka's batsman, as consultant for the test matches could be a master's hit.
It is one of the best players and will bring a lot of experience, given that it has played in any situation and against all types of attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes for the white-ball leg of the tournament and will bring both energy and unremitting ambition.
I always thought she was born to get involved in international cricket, either as a player or as a coach, and just like Mahela, she has intuition.
Sometimes, new voices from the vest, even if they transmit messages that have been transmitted and previously, can bring fresh air into the team.
Colly Durham's coach, Ben Stokes resting for one day's matches, Root got a similar break against Australia and I don't have a problem with this.
Although not all agree, coaches and selections do not do the program.
And you have to keep, the jobs of the players depend on the results they get.
Such decisions are never made easily.
The Brexit Tabura could have a cause if the economy is kept in acalmy until 2017
On the day that goes by, David Cameron's renegotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU is increasingly in the grip, even without the choice of brilliant Jeremy "Yes or no?" Corbyn led by the Labour Party or TUC brings serious criticism to Europe Tuesday.
The strangers have characters like Corbyn and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomat explained days ago that - buried in a crisis similar to that of the EU - not all are provoked internally - some Member States are fueled by the UK's agenda for concessions and amendments to treaties, which most do not want.
In Brighton, on the occasion of the annual meeting, TUC decided that they would not want to do so if social protection were to be eradicated.
We could even call Dave and George's "selfie" agenda.
The Prime Minister and the Registrar participate in bilateral summits or sessions of foreign capital, take a picture of a local monument famous, with or without the local representative, then return home and declare they have won alliances for reform.
It's just about me.
My European friend, who wants a Great Britain with an external perspective under the EU roof - "Don't leave us alone with France," Berlin says, suggests that more ministers and officials from certain capitals have reached the point where they don't care if they stay or leave.
Angela Merkel, the German Chancellor of extreme caution, is an ally who has been in charge for 10 years and wants to leave the position before her situation becomes clear, as happened with Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16), who have been too long.
In 2017, the President of France, François Hollande, will be real or replaced.
And his power is in decline.
Poland could soon have a nationalist government on the right, Spain on the left.
It is hard to believe that they will help the picturesque English, whose energy would be better used to prevent Scotland from leaving Britain - a thing they do not want because most of them have similar separatist tendencies.
Thus, some ministers might even plan to make intentional remarks that do not help in the SNP style in the 2017 UK referendum campaign to speed up the Brexit process, my friend suggests.
"Renegotiation has been fixed" and "Great Britain has gained nothing of the value of renegotiation".
Europeans know on their skin how attractive Fleet Street can be and how skeptical they are barons of the oligaric press that look at the EU with skepticism, because they did not participate in the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn who ratified our 1973 entry into report 2:1.
I may recall a wave from Boris Johnson, the euro-opportunist, who became famous at the beginning of the 1990s when he was the corresponding Brussels.
Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
They included the mix of non-paid tax pockets, foreign people who cheated on the phone and pseudo non-domains who hold most of the important newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair saw him kind of the same but realized that when you're locked in a cage next to a nervous gorilla, you have to give him the bananas to distract him from the thought of eating you at lunch and again at tea.
In fact, Miliband was more blairite than Blair in the opposition to Cameron's referendum, given that Blair made a concession on the principle of the abandoned EU constitution, buried by French and Dutch electors in 2005, which offered him an exit card.
The press didn't forgive him for that either.
But Jeremy Corbyn, who touched me on the back of months at Westminster - I told him not to spend his time with me - seems to be in danger of adopting Neil Kinnock's boycott strategy from the 1980s, a mistake then and now.
It may take a long time, but it must develop a coherent strategy of mass-media cooperation, not with me, but with Andrew Marr, whose position at the BBC has left a Sunday vacation.
Corbyn's official position towards Europe is what I would call involuntarily evolution.
It states that it would like us to remain in a reformed EU.
Most of those who disagree with the "angicism" of conservatives could agree with that.
That's what Hilary said "A Benn, but not a Bennite" Benn on the radio and TV this week, when his researcher fought not to recognize that John McDonnell's name by Corbyn as a minister "in the shadow" on financial problems was a bad idea.
He reminded me of the 1970s, when his father fought on TV to be disloyal to his workmates, without going too far and without losing his job in the cabinet.
Hilary's fight was more attractive.
But the struggle to remain "in any situation" - Benn's expression - does not match what McDonnell said and did not match what JC told colleagues and parliamentarians during the private meeting of the night.
Regardless of the image Corbyn wants to transmit - keep it, he has also made me aware - the discipline of the messages remains important in the age of television and especially in the age of social networks, a fire of paranoia and betrayal.
It is right not to give Cameron a ticket of favor in Europe, allowing him to take good support for the workers in the referendum campaign, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins certainly believes this.
But McDonnell and Corbyin's basic sophistication about the quality of EU member - in line with their anti-capitalist past - is no longer just an esoteric discussion among left-wing dissidents for which the narcissism of small differences is a central dogma.
As with his sophistication about NATO - Tom Watson is reluctant that the JC will not campaign for resignation - foreign diplomats will be forced to try to understand.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - and there are suspicious voters - for concessions to the United Kingdom when everything could be useless?
The US is already quite disappointed about the poor military performance of English in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a conservative government cutting costs, as I recalled the launch of the British Influence Security Forum on Monday.
Experts criticise the decision of the Department of Public Health in England on electronic cigarettes
According to researchers, the claims of a government agency that electronic cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking resulted from a meeting between 12 people, some of them linked to tobacco industry.
Publishing team experts from the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined the launch publication in criticising the evidence used by the Department of Public Health in England (PHE) in its report on electronic cigarettes.
The PE published the "reference" report last month and described it as a "complex analysis of the evidence".
Some researchers, however, questioned the robustness of the data and showed the finger to the links between certain experts and the tobacco industry.
An article published last month in Lancet's medical journal attacked the "extraordinary fragility base" on which PHE founded its main conclusion.
Two other researchers who wrote in the BMJ have put their claims and their foundation "on solid ground or on moving sand".
Martin McKee, a professor of public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, a professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "A fundamental principle of public health is that policies must be based on evidence of effectiveness."
They said it was expected that the PHE claims according to which "current estimates show that electronic cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking" are based on a detailed analysis of the evidence and models.
In fact, a single meeting attended by 12 people led to the development of a multi-criteria decision analysis model (MCDA) that summarised their views on the negative effects associated with various nicotine-containing products; the results of this meeting were presented briefly in a research work.
McKee and Capewell either claimed that one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose executive director was said to have received funding from the British American Tobacco to conduct an independent study.
It also validated VAT accreditation in public health in a sustainability report, it said.
They added that one of the 12 participants at the meeting declared the funding received from an electronic cigarette producer, but not the funding reported that it would have been received from the tobacco and tobacco company Philip Morris International.
The arguments were not provided on the basis of which the panel members were selected, but among them are a few "frequents" known in the production of electronic cigarettes, some of them even declare in the work of financing the industry.
Other participants at the meeting are not known for the expertise in tobacco control.
He also participated in the meeting of the head of the PET tobacco control section.
The research work developed by the group "mustamises convincingly" the lack of "solid evidence of the adverse effect most products have on them according to the majority of criteria", said McKee and Capewell.
However, none of these links or limitations are mentioned in the PET report.
McKee and Capewell said the PHE claims that "to date there is no evidence that electronic cigarettes are a factor that encourages smoking among children or non-smokers" are premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, Director of the Health Department of the PPE, said he responded in the past to the statements of the BMJ.
He said: "Electronic forces are significantly less harmful than smoking"
One of the two people who have smoked all their lives loses his life because of this vice.
All the evidence suggests that the risk posed by electronic health cigarettes is less comparable, but we need to continue to study long-term effects.
The PE has a clear duty to inform the public about information that is being returned and that is not evidenced, taking into account in particular the high level of public confusion regarding the relative dangers of tobacco.
Every year, about 80,000 people lose their lives because of a smoking-related disease and the annual costs of the national health system due to smoking reach 2 billion pounds.
Expressing clearly the current evidence - and that, although the use of electronic cigarettes is not at risk, they present only a fraction of the harmful effect of smoking - we fulfil our national duty.

Claims that ruin the British arms trade
Follow the film made by Amnesty International against the arms trade.
Terrible killer drones!
The iron to break the glaciers!
Dispersion bombs!
And electric rods that cause inflamed pain without leaving a trace!
The cheerful voice and animated images do not doubt that this advertisement for the world's largest arms trade is a close chain made by Amnesty International to underline the British authorities' desire to sell weapons of repression regimes through Defence and Security Equipment International at the ExCeL Centre in London's Docklands.

However, a separate campaign also led to the display of a large number of posts at bus stations and in subways that need a second look.
"An important ad, traveling with DLR between 15 and 18 September?" says one of the ads, using London Metro's fonts and branding, the DLR line transforming itself into a tank image.
In September of this year, a lot of arms dealers will leave on DLR customers are asked to contribute to the cessation of the arms trade.
The 300 posters are made by artists who exhibited the works at the Cruel Designs Museum in Dismaland, Banksy.
A group called Special Patrol Group has contributed to the distribution in London using "Ad Space Hack Packs", a pack of 6-litre Allen keys saying that "it facilitates access to about a third of the advertising space in the bus stations on the planet."
The Kingdom of Transport in London is not amused by this "vandalism" in the form of volleyballs.
One of the parody ads produced by Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator Cruel Designs and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists ask more and more questions and seek to make political works accessible to the public outside the galleries.
Many artists turn to collaboration with activists in protest movements, realizing that they have to go into the real world to have their art impact on society.
Another poster against the arms trade that happens to the shipowners who circle with the subway.
The film by Amnesty had over 100,000 Facebook views in 24 hours and was created by the VCCP advertising agency that worked pro bono, and the graphic designer and the artist who duplicated the voice also worked for free.
VCCP's creation director, Matt Lever, was shocked by the silence around the advertising for the arms trade - with an empty space in the ExCel calendar - and thought, "Let's offer them the campaign that tries to avoid it."
They played with the realization of a more realistic advertisement, but "reriching it with strong animations and colors, it was more exciting".
"They did a great job helping us increase our interest in the sale of illegal torture equipment in the marketplace," said Tom Davies on behalf of Amnesty.
Now, the UK authorities would need to take measures and ensure that torture equipment is not illegally marketed and delivered to the door.
Perhaps the most creative form of art on the subject of the arms trade comes from within ExCeL, where exhibits offer fantastic euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab issued an order received from the US army on "AT4CS RS with shoulder-supported launcher."
This includes “a single-shaped focus that offers dazzling effects behind the armor within the target.
Whatever that means, it won't be nice.
Eight gold rules to live in the house
It's been 11 years since I moved into my house, when I was a 19-year-old, who still believed in britches and moral relativity, but now I just remember the strong smiles of those we were angry with - and the numerous complaints to others.
Most of the things I've learned can be summed up in the form of eight simple rules.
A shift in the house can lead to conditions that vary from nervous to horror.
The fight is tempting: tell the people where you come from, if and where you spent a year of study, what do you think about Corbyn and why "you don't care about Marmite because, in good boys, there's nothing but a HAHAHA Droid extract, you find me in my room."
Breathe deep.
And help others breathe - ask questions and show interest.
These encourage the conversation and help you differentiate the people you like from those you didn't stay talking to even if the people came and they were the only ones who had boats.
Don't suffocate people.
Sleepers often enjoy parties with drinks, film series and socializing meetings, but they are also the place where people dress and try their intimate lingerie.

Introverts have a special treatment at the university.
Your sleeper should be a refuge, but in many homes a nursing culture is built through bedrooms, based on friendship, socialization and friends who last their lives.
All of this can be terrible for someone who's trying to charge his batteries.
Nothing in this culture allows you to say "I like you and I want to stay friends but I want you to go to recover my energy I've consumed by interacting with you."
Try to sit when a colleague is exhausted by socialization - and try sending an SMS instead of knocking on the door.
To knock at the door: do it.
A guy sitting in the same room with me had a policy that said if a door wasn't locked, then he was invited to come in.
He's seen enough.
Make friends cooking.
Since you're starting college in the Bake-Off fever, if you knock at someone's door to get to know and go and a blackboard, it seems a little bit weird, less like the situation in the 1950s, "Welcome to the neighborhood, I've prepared something for you, now smile and I ask personal questions."
The good things prepared in the house are a great way to make you friends.
Your tenants will feel compelled to sit down and may be able to associate your figure with a pleasant surprise.
Obviously, you have to be a smart cook.
The beans, sugars and fats will most likely cause others to pretend to sleep when you knock on the door.
Food is a frequent crime in the student camps.
Obviously, if you wipe someone's chicken is stolen, but if you take a drop of milk to put it in your tea is all stolen?
Ask the owner.
He'll probably tell you to serve yourself even if you're burning on the inside.
If someone steals your things, it's annoying and I understand you - try even to address the problem more mature than my roommate, who dyed his liquid detergent milk to punish those who stole.
Now he's in jail.
Do not make noise that does not allow others to sleep or study.
That's not just because it feels good, it's because you're going to your own shoes.
A girl on the floor with me asked her neighbor to give the music more slowly because it was 3:00 a.m. and she had an exam in the morning.
Their reaction was to make music stronger.
When they stopped the music at one end, at 5 a.m., the girl was kind and let her sleep two hours before giving the maximum to the music, locked the door and went to the exam that lasted three hours.
Wouldn't it be romantic if the future husband/wife would move on the same floor?
On the contrary, wouldn't it be very strange if you were to confuse a fellow pallier with your future husband, have your spouse, have you separated and should you meet each other daily and maybe even see how all common friends end up?
Of course, you can't resist the heart - but if a sexy pallier colleague is certainly not your future husband, try at least to be rational.
At the moment you realize that someone has left his keys in the unresolved room, the line between gossip and intimidation is nicer than it seems.
A successful farce is fun, but it can damage in a few moments.
Provide a fun and valuable security-related lesson by hiding something - but never dirty someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock the door and put the keys in a glass of water that you put in the freezer--but don't lick someone's ceiling more than twice.
Violent David Grimal: In Bach’s time there were no world tournaments.
Beethoven, Brahms, Bartok, Enescu were people who worked, artists and not commercial representatives.
French violinist David Grimal is one of the great artists of our times, known not only as soloist but also as the initiator of a less common project, by the right to "queued", as he himself says, Les Dissonances - an orchestra formed by international soloists and talented musicians, who interprets a symphonic repertoire without having a director, and that makes it at least a curiosity in the classical music landscape.
Les Dissonances was this year at the Enescu Festival with two shows: a performance, Sunday, in which soloist was David Grimal, the founder of the orchestra, and a month, when in the first plan was the violinist Xavier Phillips, the works made by Enescu were undisclosed.
Both performances, depicted on the scene of Athens, showed the audience a different way to interpret classical music.
Les Dissonances appeared on the music scene in 2004, being at that time the only classical musical collection in which there is no director.
The director is the most important musician for musicians.
It is true, on the one hand, that musicians need an education either to become soloists or to become interpreters in an orchestra - speaking of instrumentalists, not composers.
They're trained as "specialists".
They just feel like they need a leader.
On the other side of the scene, for the public, all the music fetishing is in the direction.
And so, the business, the music industry, it makes marketing.
So we're not talking about music anymore.
So if we look at this world, we have some qualified workers, what is stupid, and a public who can't listen, but must look, what is stupid again," said David Grimal.
The violinist tells us that this change in how music is made came after the "musical deceptions" of his soloist career.
I was like a high-level athlete who had to do the same exercise all over the world with different orchestras, to earn a lot of money and to bring money and music industry.
After 10 years, when I was about 30 years old, we found this very depressing, because we did not find human creativity and brotherhood in this system anymore.
So, I've never found any meaning to continue on this road.
So I decided to create Les Dissonances.
This happened in 2004, and at that time no one would do anything without a director: "The music world, extremely conservatives, did not want such projects".
"How do you imagine you're marketing with a collection of musicians where there's no ego?" asked the artist.
David Grimal acknowledged that Les Dissonaces is "a luxury", stating that none of the musicians who are part of the orchestra depends on the success of this project to live.
In 10 years of the existence of the whole, the lack of a director has not proved to be a pedigree in the musical act: "I am curiously singing a more complex repertoire, so simple, because all musicians are required to be present in the opera and not just in the role," said Grimal, adding that at Sunday's show "I was 74 conductors on stage".
In Grimal's opinion, the Enescu Festival is one "very brave", just because it invited Les Dissonances: "A special festival, where there are the largest orchestras in the world singing and 3 times a day, and in the midst of these orchestras you have also invited this strange group".
In a temple of orchestral tradition, such as the Enescu Festival, there is the place and interest for something different, which breaks barriers.
Speaking about the work of Enescu, the violinist acknowledged that he felt Roman music of the famous Roman composer, so he did not need a special approach when he introduced the works of Enescu into his repertoire.
Grimal notes that Enescu's music is very instinctive, but this happens when we talk about George Enescu and Romance music, "because there is a George Enescu who made French music."
Grimal is campaigning for changing the way classical music education is done, considering that "the mass of musicians, as it is organized today, has one of the dead" and that "the future of music represents insatiable music".
We don't need to turn the world around five times a year if it doesn't serve anything.
In Bach's time there were no world tournaments.
Beethoven, Brahms, Bartok, Enescu were people who worked, who were artists and not commercial representatives.
For me, organizing concerts, festivals, tournaments, launching albums, they're all amazing, but as long as they're done in the music service.
If not, we're in a system where creativity suffers, it's no longer free.
To illustrate this phenomenon, David Grimal gave examples of Roma products before and after joining the European Union: "In Romania, before entering the EU, you had vegetables and good meat".
In order to enter the EU, health laws that are not good for vegetables and meat had to be adopted.
Production and agriculture come into the service of supermarkets as well as in France.
The same thing happens with music, it's the same logic.
Les Dissonances makes roses may not be very beautiful, but then when we cut them, they're real roses.
In an ideal world, this music should return to the centre and that the institutions and industries that manage this system understand that music does not need to be sold, but needs to be shared, and this can be done starting with educational policy.
"If I consider - as do Koreans, Chinese, Japanese - that Western music is one of the most beautiful things of humanity, we reintroduce its invasion into school, we reintroduce concerts on television and through this education we would no longer need to sell musical subproduces," Grimal believes.
Surely, there are things in classical music education that are very communist, that's all over it, is something very militarized.
It depends on this discipline if we compare a musician with a soldier, or if we form a musician who will sing an instrument, being first and foremost a musician.
We're talking about a completely different education, if we want to form a soldier (this education - n.red.) must be in a way, if we want to form a musician, it's everything else.
In your opinion, what is more dangerous, a soldier or a musician?", asked the French artist Zambind.
Grimal shows that, for artists, the reward of another way to make music comes from the overcoming of this status of "soldier", the overcoming of what "they think are their limits": "The musicians discover at a certain time that they are not soldiers, and therefore after concert they are zombies."
David Grimal spoke about the project or musical and about his vision of music and the artist in the "Festival of Ideas", a discussion with the public organized at the International George Enescu Festival by the Aspen Romanian Institute.

Cinema City is looking for "Micie Voci Mari"
Cinema City launches the biggest challenge for children: doubleing two characters from the super-production "Creation 3D Zápezii"
Do you have a super talented and spontaneous child who likes movies?
Offer him the chance to get to see.
In September, in the newest campaign for enthusiastic and ambitious children, you want to reach future stars and who are between 8 and 16 years old, Cinema City is looking for "Micie Voci Mari", offering them an extraordinary opportunity to double two characters in a famous animation film.
If the classical drawings focus on the actor's voice of the particular animated character, in the last period, the creation of the story is taken into account and those who will interpret the voices, and they are usually very well known actors.
However, Cinema City Romania wants to discover new voices and that's why we start a unique campaign.
We want to find the right voice and get our parents to register their children at our competition.
They'll have a special experience, because the characters are nice and the replicas are funny.
"The kids will have fun and have a real chance to be part of a team of actors," said Ioana Ionescu, Marketing Manager of Cinema City Romania.
In the first stage of the competition, in the 11 September - 30 September period, Cinema City organizes a selection of 10 children (five girls and five boys) who will have the opportunity to give a test in a recording studio with professionals.
All parents have to do is access the small platform.cinema-city.ro, where to register the child at the contest and prepare it for the voice test.
Next, you have to choose one of the four films available on the platform, download the texts that the child is going to read and then the child will register by interpreting his own version of the duplicate.
Four films about friendship, bass heroes, magic and hope can choose competitors to support the trials: "Galbene Pene 3D", "Mune: The 3D Moon Guardian", "Blinky Bill: Koala the famous 3D" and "Albinuta Maya 3D".
In the end, the most talented two children (a girl and a boy) will see their dream fulfilled and will double what a character from the super-production "The Snow Queen - Christmas 3D" will be the first in Romania in November of this year.
FedEx gains are mixed, due to tax forecasts for 2016
FedEx has declared disappointing results for the last quarter, the supply giant reducing profit estimates for the entire year as a result of low demand for transport services and increased costs for its land transport division.
The company also stated that it intends to employ around 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
In the same period last year, FedEx announced that it would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
The company's shares decreased by about 2.5% in pre-market trading, 45 minutes before the Wednesday opening bell.
FedEx Corp. stated that it is expected to win between $10.40 and $10.90 for the fiscal year ending in May of the following year, with 20 percent less, according to a previous estimate.
Analysts recommended a $10.84 figure, according to a FactSet survey.
The estimated decrease is due to an increase in prices by 4.9% on average, with entry into force on 4 January and higher overtaxes for land transport of large packages or with large weight, which will apply from November.
The company said it is still expected to increase its profits over the previous year as a result of lower costs, higher revenues and the development of online trade.
The president and Director-General Fred Smith said that "the firm is facing a much weaker economic situation than expected, especially with regard to global production and trade."
The employment plans for the holiday period were announced one day after the UPS competitor said he intended to hire 90,000-95,000 additional workers, about the same number of jobs he made last year.
In the quarter that ended on 31 August, FedEx won $692 million, with 6% more than the previous year.
The action winnings were $2.42, under an average estimate of $2.44 per action made by 12 analysts who responded to the survey conducted by Zacks Investment Research.
The profit increased by 5%, up to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts who participated in the Zacks survey estimated the amount of $12.23 billion.
The FedEx company has been hit in recent years by a decline in international priority transport, leading to the stagnation of the revenues recorded by its Express unit.
But the explosion in online purchases saved the results of the FedEx Ground division.
In the last quarter, the incomes of the Ground Division increased by 29%, but operating revenues were practically stagnant due to higher costs for large packages and own insurance.
The express unit recorded an increase in revenues due to higher basic rates, while the revenues recorded by the Freight division decreased due to the increased costs.
At the pre-market transaction, about an hour before the opening sound, the FedEx shares decreased by $3.85 or 2.5%, to $10.15.15.
Tuesday at low closing with 11% at year level and 17% at the maximum record recorded on 11 June.
On the occasion of the most anticipated meeting in recent years, the Federal Reserve policy makers will spend two days this week around a 27-foot month of Mahon Honduran to decide whether the time has come to raise a key interest rate for the first time in almost a decade.
Above them, at the end of the central bank's meeting room, a wall painting of the United States will shake.
The map is meant to recall that Janet L. Yellen, President Fed, and his colleagues must put the economic interests of the nation above anything.
The Central Bank has received a double burden from Congress: to maximize the employment rate in the US and maintain price stability.
But since the great economic crisis, Fed leaders have confirmed that there is a third unwritten task: financial stability.
And this third task could be factor X in a decision too difficult to anticipate, which will be announced on Tuesday, and which will determine whether the US economy is ready to be dissolved by the unprecedented incentive offered by the short-term interest rate almost zero in force from the end of 2008.
Even if most of the data indicate a strong growth economy, the recent anxiety on global financial markets could scare Fed officials already being cautious about adding volatility by increasing the reference rate to federal funds - even with only one percentage point.
"Evident, the labour market and inflation will be the first and main aspects to be followed," said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at Stifel Nicolaus & Co brokerage firm.
"I believe, however, that if they were looking for an excuse not to raise the interest rate, the uncertainty in increasing the world market is sufficient to provide them with arguments to wait for it," he said.
There is no consensus as to the decision that Fed will take, which in itself causes instability on the financial market.
About half of the recent economists in Bloomberg have anticipated an increase in the interest rate this week.
However, financial markets expect Fed to slow down, a key indicator showing that the probability of growth is only 30%.
This would indicate a reduction in the stock exchange if Fed increased the interest rate, except where policymakers slow down the strike by promising that it would go a long way to the next growth.
Tuesday, industrial media Dow Jones went 228,89 points, or 1.4%, up to 16,599,85.
The advantage was triggered by expectations that the Fed decision factors will maintain a stable interest rate this week, said John Lonski, the economist chief at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would be surprising that Fed will increase the interest rate at this time," Lonski said.
If the Fed decision-makers would do this, "they should act in depth in their policies to avoid panic on financial markets".
Other experts have stated that an increase in the interest rate would calm the financial markets because it would remove the uncertainty about the moment Fed will act.
Just a month ago, Fed seemed to be about to increase the rate by 0.25% this month, the first small step towards slowdown of the monetary conditions that would confirm the US recovery force.
Yellen said in spring and early summer that it was expected to increase this year's interest rate despite the high liberal expectations such as more economic progress would be needed.
Although job creation slowed in August, the growth of the labour market was solid this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest percentage in more than seven years and almost the level considered by Fed as total employment.
Salaries have shown signs of growth.
And although inflation has continued to fail to achieve the central bank's annual objective, the Fed decision factors have stated that a key reason was the temporary effect of the oil prices found in the sudden decline.
The economy "can deal with higher rates and needs them, given the pressure on the labour market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, world-wide financial markets began to enter fibrillation at the end of this month, after China had devalued its currency.
The industrial media, Dow Jones, dropped 16% below the record reached in May, as investors were afraid that slowing down the Chinese economy would lead to global growth.
The market has dropped somewhat this month, the Dow indices are now about 10% below the maximum of May.
For the Fed decision factors, market agitation is added to the complex calculation of the rate of increase in interest rates.
"Without what has happened in the financial markets and news about the weakening of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks, it would be more firm at the meeting," said Stephen D. Oliner, an experienced researcher at UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and former Fed official.
Now, he expects them to wait at least a month to better manage the effects.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about what will be the impact on the US economy and almost no data to be based on further events in China," Oliner said.
The welfare of the global economy is not one of the main interests of the Fed, so it should not be taken into account in making decisions in practice.
But in fact, Fed has become a global monetary authority.
In recent years, the influence of the central bank has been enormous.
A simple allusion by the then president, Ben S. Bernanke, in 2013, that Fed could "engrave" its monetary expansion has triggered shocks on world-wide markets.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, it is expected that Fed officials not only monitor progress in other areas, but also consult other central banks and experts to better interpret the world economy.
Its decision-making process is "more art than science," Zachary Karabell, head of the Global Strategy Department of Investnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Va., said this month that "Fed has an oversized reaction story to changes in the financial market that seem to have nothing to do with economic bases."
Lacker, a member with the right to vote of the Federal Open Market Commission, a decision-making body, which supported the increase in the interest rate, offered, for example, the 1998-99 decisions.
A financial crisis that affected Asia caused Fed to reduce the reference rate by 0.75% in three meetings, "in spite of the implications of limited identification for the development of the US," Lacker said.
A year later, Fed officials came back on those losses.
Fed should put the issue of financial stability first only in the event of a major crisis, such as the 2008 market crisis, Adam S. Posen, said he was a member of the Bank of England's interest-setting committee.
The last period of agitation is not rising at that level either, he said.
"We certainly do not want to get into the situation to fear an increase in interest rates because of the anger of the markets," said Posen, President Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still holds a double mandate and does not mention financial stability and, until something is changed in this respect, I do not think that it should take early action.

Seven's Sunrise dominates the polls, despite the attempts of the Nine channel to broadcast to Today Show about changing party leadership
The urgent displacement of Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson to Canberra to report on the consequences of the changes in the leadership of the Liberal Party did not bring a significant increase in the audience for Today.
The morning broadcast of the Nine channel passed from the capital after Tony Abbott was defeated in front of Malcolm Turnbull.
The Sunrise competition, moderated by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was held in London as part of a series of broadcasts conducted over several weeks, including Dubai, New York, Cascade Niagara and Cancun.
This "cruise" of the distance did not seem to count too much for viewers Aussie TV, Sunrise with a hearing of 397.000 viewers in the five capital cities, compared to Today with 339.000.
Today was a slight increase compared to the monthly hearings (317.000) and last March (283,000) but the figures were lower than the last Thursday (343.000).
Today has reduced the difference with Sunrise in the last few months.
In August, Today had an average audience of 318,000 and Sunrise of 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference ranged between 40,000 and 50,000.
Meanwhile, in September, Sunrise has an average audience of 349,000 viewers and Today 314,000.
This is the most interesting thing that's happened all morning.
This morning, not only Parliament is affected by the current change!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you for asking!

The main news was the dazzling start of the 800 Words series by having it as a protagonist on the former Star of Packed to the Rafters, Erik Thomson.
The new drama, being the subject of a late widowed father, who decided to move along with his two children on the coast of New Zealand, had a very impressive average audience of 1,219 million viewers.
Critics wondered if Thomson was able to do a show alone without the Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
The hearing results for last night responded with a 'yes' response.

4 people lost their lives after the police shot rubber bullets in the protestors in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after the police pulled rubber bullets in the majority who demonstrated against the country's new proposed constitution, an official said Wednesday.
The violence occurred Tuesday night in Rupandehi District, approximately 280 km west of Kathmandu capital.
According to Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, the head of the district police, more than 1,000 protesters gathered in front of a police section, and some of them threw stones and molotov cocktails.
Mr. Dhakal said police forces used tear gas after they fired fires in the air before using rubber bullets.
According to him, 20 police officers and five civilians were injured.
It was not clear immediately why rubber bullets, which are known to kill, were usually used as a less lethal alternative, caused so many deaths.
Circumcision was the last event after weeks of violent protests in the southern region of Nepal, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group claimed that the new provinces established under the new constitution would spread political influence.
Protests also existed in the west of Nepal, where the ethnic group Tharus wants its own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 policemen, were killed in the violent riots launched on 10 August,
when four important political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - a major step towards a new constitution but an extremely controversial problem in Nepal, a central-level country for hundreds of years.
The process of drafting a new constitution was delayed in 2008, but the legislators accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands in April.
This week, in Kathmandu, the legislators voted on the terms of the draft constitution and officials said the new charter could be adopted on Sunday.
We won't use wire fences, dogs, cops and guns

Romania is not in agreement and will not apply anti-democratic measures, watchdogs, wireguards or armed policemen.
"It's a shame for Europe dry 21 to apply 30-year-old methods," said Victor Ponta.
"The Prime Minister further said that all data and details of the refugee crisis will be discussed and settled at the CSAT meeting on Thursday." the Prime Minister concluded.

Weight reduction surgery may be useful for mildly obsessive diabetics
Benefits of weight reduction surgery in mild obstetric patients with type 2 diabetes could be maintained for at least five years, according to a new study.
It is still premature to say whether mildly obsessive diabetics live longer after the surgical intervention of weight loss than those following non-surgical treatments.
"It takes a long time to centralize the mortality data," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, a specialist in obesity surgery, as she wrote an article about a new study in JAMA Surgery.
Weight loss operations, named and bariatric surgery, use different methods to minimize the stomach.
They reduce the feeling of hunger and limit the body’s ability to absorb food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has been effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but most studies have been conducted on subjects with morbid obesity, with a body mass index (MIC) 35 or above.
BMI, a weight unit in relation to height, is considered normal at range 18.5-24.9.
The BMI value of at least 25 indicates that a person is overweight and those with more than 30 BMI are considered obese.
You can calculate the IMC by accessing: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers at the General Min-Sheng Hospital in Taiwan used the narrow data after 2007 in a trial comparing two types of bariatric surgery - gastric bypass and gastrectomy in the mansion - in the medical treatment of type 2 diabetes in mildly obsessive individuals.
The mean BMI in subjects who had surgery decreased from 31 to 24.5 until the end of the fifth year in the study.
Meanwhile, BMI remained close to the same level in people who received non-surgical treatments against diabetes, namely 29.
Among those who have had surgery, diabetes has been completely cured to 36% and partially to 28%.
In the group treated by medical methods, by comparison, diabetes has been completely cured to only 1% and partly to only 2% of subjects.
In addition, the control of blood pressure, triglycerides and LDL cholesterol "was generally better in the surgical group", the authors concluded.
Researchers have also monitored the blood level of the A1c haemoglobin, which reflects the level of glycaemic activity in time.
Researchers report that the optimal level of A1c haemoglobin is below 7%.
Following surgery, the mean haemoglobin level of A1c decreased from approximately 9% to approximately 6%.
However, in the group treated by medical methods, approximately 8% were maintained.
However, this improved "glycemic control" - reflected in the improved levels of haemoglobin A1c - did not reduce mortality to five years, according to chief researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results associated with the two types of surgical intervention.
In the fifth year, compared with the gastro-intestinal group, the bypass surgery group lost more in weight (18.7 versus 14.2 kg), recorded significant decreases in BMI (7.4 versus 5.1) and in haemoglobin A1c (3.1% versus 2.1%) and presented a higher probability of complete remission of diabetes (46.9% versus 16.7%).
Although the new study does not indicate a benefit in survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study carried out on people with high weight in Sweden that surgery prolongs life, says Blackstone, from Arizona University, Phoenix Medical School.
In the Swedish study, obese people who suffered bariatric surgery presented a probability of approximately 29% lower death after 15 years, compared to a group who tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study did not indicate a benefit in survival in patients who suffered surgery, Blackstone said it is an optimistic aspect for subjects with BMI below 35 procedural interests.
"This is the point where this work is critical, because it claims that this surgical intervention is safe in the lower BMI group", without increasing the risk of death or kidney disease, it claims.
Blackstone added that their patients and doctors should start taking the weight seriously when the patient's BMI reaches 27-30.
"I think we wait too long until we ask people to take this matter seriously," she said.
I think that once these genetic changes have accumulated, which have cut their bodies short by predicting them to obesity and diabetes, it is extremely difficult to get back to normal.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT news
Europe could not receive all refugees, Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current situation of the refugee crisis is in the Middle East.
Tibetan Buddhist leader sent an appeal to end the violence in the mother countries of refugees.
Dalai Lama spoke about the current problem of the refugee crisis in the speech held at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, dedicated to ethics studies, at the beginning of his 10-day visit to Britain.
He said that, in the current situation, the interests of humanity should prevail in the interests of every nation and even of every continent.
He also stressed that although it is remarkable, the country's response to the refugee crisis in Western Europe is inadequate.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said in his speech.
Although Dalai Lama praised the efforts of Germany and Austria to cope with the crisis, he stressed that it is only a temporary solution.
"It is a great concern for a few thousand refugees, but we must think at the same time of long-term solutions to bring peace and genuine development, especially through education, to the Muslim countries," he stressed.
In the end, we need to think about ways to reduce crime in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of force.
The force never solved these problems," he added.
Referring to the problem of violence, Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions following the terrorist attacks on 11 September, claiming that the violent response from the US generated an uncontrollable chain of events.
After the events of 11 September, I sent condolences to a letter addressed to President Bush and told him to resolve this problem without resorting to violence.
I know that his motives were strong, but he used the force and generated unexpected consequences," Dalai Lama said.
Four-fold increase in the number of children who have been breast-feeding in the last 4 years
According to the Anti-Optimism Centre in Georgia, U.S. Anti-Optimization Centres have reported an increase of approximately 400% since 2010 in children under 12 who have swallowed depleted hands with a high alcohol content.
According to Dr. Gailord Lopez, the director of the anti-violence centre in Georgia, cases of ingestion of the degenerant in children under 12 years of age reported at the anti-vitilisation centres ranged from 3.266 in 2010 to 16.117 in 2014.
"Children have more frequent access to these products and, unfortunately, a percentage of them reach the emergency room," Lopez told CNN.
Lopez said some children drink deliberately and others do it to impress their friends or to respond to challenges on social networks.
YouTube can be followed by movies that present teenagers as drinking detergents to create cheap drinks.
Adolescents seem to have mixed the detergent with alcohol to get a stronger drink.
Small children can be attracted to the attractive smell of the detergent.
"A child doesn't think he's hurting them," says Lopez.
Many of the most attractive types (hand detergent) are the perfumed ones.
Hand detergents with aroma of mushrooms, grapes, oranges are the most attractive for children.
The hand detergent contains approximately 45-95% alcohol.
Especially in small children, only a few swallows can cause alcohol poisoning.
"It's a very concentrated alcohol," said Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the health care center at the University Hospital in Kansas, for the Fox 4 channel in Kansas City.
So we avoid leaving a glass of whiskey on the table, but people leave these hand detergents in accessible places and if the little ones get to them, this is a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijaj Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently immigrated to school the equivalent of four spraying hands-derived caps, arrived in the emergency room to receive treatment.
She had alcohol179, twice as much as the threshold at which an adult is considered by law under the influence of alcohol, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, a doctor in an emergency room who treated her at the Günnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaija's blond and couldn't go when he got to the emergency room.
Doctors monitored her overnight in a separate children's hospital to identify the signs of brain damage, because the girl fell and hit her head because of alcohol, Ritchey said.
"It was scary," Ortoria Scott, Nhaija's mother, told CNN.
He could have been fatal.
Lopez advised parents and teachers to use wet products or servings without alcohol and not to leave the detergent to the children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some detergents have been associated with death.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after swallowing degenerative hands containing an undeclared toxic ingredient.
Health authorities have assumed that the product contains methanol, a lethal substance, and not ethyl alcohol, specified as an active ingredient.
In January, three students from the fourth class of the North of New York agreed to poison their "blood" teacher by "using antibacterial products in class", according to a police report.
The teacher is very allergic to hand detergent and banned him in his class room.
The police considered the plan to be "unintended" and went ahead with the school inspector's disciplinary problem.
Rumour Mill: No misunderstandings at Celtic
Griffiths removes rumors about Celtic's misunderstandings, Deala admits that Hopes are not at the best moment, but they will come back.
Hearts facing the SFA concerning the accusations of Neilson and Warburton are concerned about the acquisitions in January that affected the team's unit
So I grow the difference with Celtic at five points
The punishment of ADAM Rooney in the first review has brought those from Aberdeen a narrow victory in front of those from Hamilton to Pittodrie, Dons getting a difference of five points between them and Celtic.
Griffiths dismantles the sounds of misunderstandings
There were rumors of misunderstandings in Celtic, disassembled by Griffiths, who insisted that he and his team not be subjected to increased pressure given that they were prepared to face the leaders of the Dutch league.
I don't think we feel the pressure, I think the players are just waiting.
The absence of stockpiles in the race for title complicates the Dutch - by Boer
The former middle house of the Rangers and the former Dutch international player Ronald de Boer said the Dutch football supporters lost their interest in Celtic - because they don't fight for the title with Rangers.
De Boer, now Ambassador of the Ajax, said: “In the Netherlands, no longer transmits the summary of the Celtic Games; why?”
Because there's no Rangers there.
Here, it's not just about the return of Rangers.
It's about Old Firm.
It's talking about both Laolalla teams and there's the interest.
The tension is great in the games of Old Firm and not only Scottish people want to see these games.
I'll change the situation, Deala promises.
RONNY Dila agreed that Celtic was fighting from the riots, but the Norwegian chief promised to change the situation.
The defeat with Malmo and the subsequent elimination of the Champions League were followed by the defeat in front of Aberdeen, who played in 10 people, now in the top of the class with a five-point advance.
But Deila said: "Celtic had periods before and they will come back."
We want to get out of this situation as soon as possible.
I know it's very frustrating and many people are extremely angry or sad about what's going on.
We feel the same way - but we have to go further.
We definitely need the support of Celtics because so the players are getting better.
It's extremely important to stay united now.
Warburton's skill in January transfers
Despite the comments just a few weeks ago that suggested that he would have identified a few targets for January transfers, the leader of the Rangers, Mark Warburton is concerned when it comes to transfers, insisting that he does not want to affect the Ibrox unit.
Brentford's former chief said: "The transfer period in January is very different from that in summer."
In the case of players transferred summer, there is a period before the season in which they can be integrated, which you could observe in this season in our group.
The team's doing very well.
Sometimes you do worse if you bring players that aren't necessary.
Celtic is targeting Michu after withdrawal
Swansea's striker, Michu, associated with Celtic during the transfer period, suggested that he could withdraw to the expiry of the contract with Swans.
The 29-year-old player has struggled with the glacier problems for two years and failed to leave the country of Wales in summer.
Hearts facing SFA on Neilson's comments
Hearts drove with 2-1 when Paterson was removed and lost with 3-2, but the red cartridge of the foundation was then cancelled - the third red carton cancelled in eight months.
Neilson maintains his statement, insisting: "I did not question integrity, I did not comment on performance."
Griffiths swear to avoid Tynacastle
The invincible Hibee was taken to the front after admitting he sang a song with offensive verses about the former Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident took place in March 2014, in a pub in the Roseburn region of Edinburgh in front of a derby with Edinburgh at Tynacastle.
"It was derby and it was the enthusiasm of the moment," said the striker, adding: "I don't need to say that I'm not going back to Tynacastle unless I play for Celtic."
Tannadice Council Trusts in the Management of Dundee United - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly insists that those of the Dundee United Council still believe that the management team will change the situation - but it is agreed that the decline on the ground must end.
I think Stephen Thompson trusts us.
We'll bring the boys in shape again," said Donnelly.
McInnes is happy for "the dirty victory" against Hamilton
Derek McInnes admits that Aberdeen's team must deal with the despair of Hamilton Accies to get the seventh consecutive victory in the bond, which brought them five points in front of Celtic due to the beating of the punishment from the first execution by Adam Rooney.
McInnes said: "There is no team to win anything, either in the cup or the bond, and not to win games like that."
Unemployment rate in Scotland remains unchanged as Britain grows
THE SHOULD ratio in Scotland remains unchanged, being 164,000 in the period May-July, while the number of British unemployed has increased by 10,000, reaching 1.82 million in the same period.
The rate of unemployment in Scotland was 5.9% higher than in the United Kingdom, according to the figures presented by the National Statistics Office (ONS).
In the meantime, the employment rate in Scotland fell by 12,000 over three months, the number of employees currently being 2,612,000.
The employment rate in Scotland fell in that quarter to 74.0% - an average of 73.5 in the United Kingdom.
Scottish State Secretary David Mundell, commenting on the latest figures, said: "The plan of the authorities in the long term has laid the foundations for a stronger economy."
It's been almost a year since Scotland made a historic decision to remain a part of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months, we have seen improvements in the labour market in Scotland, the employment rate of the labour force recording growth and the unemployment rate.
Why I am a witness to an execution in Oklahoma
In the course of today's day, with the exception of a late legal intervention, I'll see how a man is sentenced to death.
If it happens, and I hope it doesn't happen, I'll sit in a room for observers in the operating room of the Oklahoma State Prisoner and see how Richard Glossip is executed by the administration of the lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death.
The invitation came first in January, through his best friend, and although I was shocked, I accepted.
As the day draws near, it threatens my idea.
So why would I do that?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way to tell the whole story of capital punishment.
It would offer a unique perspective.
It is true, journalists can be witnesses to executions in America and, because usually the requests exceed the number of places available, there is a macabre lottery to decide who will be chosen.
Oklahoma reduced the number of places reserved for press representatives from 12 to five.
The electors will look at the execution with impartiality.
I can't do that.
I would stay with Richard Glossip's closest friends, and I developed my own relationship with him over the months of telephone conversations and a visit that lasted two and a half hours.
I like the guy.
We laugh a lot when we talk.
The prison authorities say I can't be a witness and a journalist, so I won't be allowed to have a book and a pix to notice what I see.
I'll have to try to remember all the details.
An Oklahoma journalist accused me of having compromised my impartiality on Twitter.
Here's the lesson.
Tells the owner's story as he wants it, he gets access.
I complained about her.
He admitted that "it could have been better," but he still felt that I was wrong.
Richard Glossip didn't agree with some of the things I said and wrote them.
Don't tell me what to write and I wouldn't do it if I asked.
I told him he could take me out of the witness list any time.
But he wants to be present with an international report to write about the subject.
He thinks that if he dies, advertising will help move against capital punishment.
Kim Bellware, reporter at Huffington Post, will be with me.
If you want to find out more about the case, listen to the media file series I did.
I'm not coming back here on all the details.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after Barry Van Treese's murder make him guilty of complicity.
But I think it's very likely he's not guilty of murder.
I'm sure there's not enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
I think his execution is wrong.
And I'll see him die from this perspective.
I can't claim to be totally objective.
For this, you can read the articles written by other reporters.
From me you'll find out what it's like to look at a man who likes to die useless.
Peter Moody claims that the guards tried to spy on him and threaten to withdraw from the race
Peter Moody said that he was racing Victoria or trying to infiltrate a spy at his grades last year and threatened to withdraw immediately from the race.
He launched an attack on the guards and the Racing Victoria's Department of Integrity, claiming that they were carrying out a personal campaign against him, the drop that filled the cup was the removal of Lady Father from the race because of a treatment administered on the day of the race.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he has always tried to do what is best for the course and that he is put in a difficult situation when it comes to the positive result of the Lidari's cobalt test, for which he has no explanation.
For 18 months, he swallowed up his words about spy statements and did not want to be sown with “the wolf that doesn’t reach the grapes”.
"I wasn't going to say anything about that and I've been quiet for a long time, but sometimes you get to a level of frustration so high that it all comes up all of a sudden," said Moody.
They know it went on.
Sometimes you react and you have to bear the consequences, and I will have to live with what I have said.
I'll go home tonight and I'll sleep quietly.
I want to go with my head up and I want the owners I'm working with to see that you're trying to give them everything that's best.
Since they started to think it wasn't like that, I have to quit training.
At that point, I'll have to think about what I'm going to do with my certification.
Previously, Moody threw the bomb into a given interview for racing.com in which he said the Department of Integrity tried to spy on his grades.
"After eighteen months, Terry Bailey, Daily Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart stayed in a room next to a man - whose name I'll tell him if I'm asked - and offered to hire him to my garden to provide information about the activity there," Moody told Racing.com.
Obviously he thinks I'm sad.
If so, then you should give up all because they were incompetent in trying to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former president of RVL, David Moodie, current president of RVL and Bernard Sandry, current CEO of RVL, knew at that time and I know today.
Should I think it's personal?
Is it necessary that RVL starts to have a vertical column and can pull people out of the coaches for what's going on in industry?
Do I have a bad influence on the industry?
Is my influence on the industry so bad?
Maybe that's how I see the others.
Maybe I have to take my license and give it to one side and I have no doubt that the statements I'm making now could lead to thinking about this variant.
But I got to the point where I don't care anymore, and that's what I'm worried about.
I'm very excited.
I'll put pressure on them and I'll decide to make a decision.
My family supports me and I can leave.
The hairdressing of the coach increased once with the extensive investigation into the cobalt test in which Lidari was involved and the removal led him to say that he could "put his license on the table".
Moody, whose name is most often associated with the training of the unwinded Black Caviar champion, labeled the treatment rule on the day of the race as "ridicola" after applying on the feet of the horses a cataplasm with nomell or clay, which violates the rules.
Break the rules of the race.
I have to take full responsibility for this," he says.
One of my employees made a mistake on his feet.
Could have happened last night.
Could have happened yesterday, what happened.
It happened on the day of the race.
Moody could have been downgraded for three months for the day of the course, consisting of the application of the cataplasm, for which the guards opened an investigation.
It's a joke.
People who make these rules don't know anything about horses.
"We all understand that rules are needed, but it has gone too far," said Moody.
The driver who hit and ran from the crash site in Cobram was arrested
The police arrested a man after a collision with a biker produced in Cobram at the end of the week and followed by escape from the scene of the accident.
The biker was transported by helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital, being seriously injured after hit by a car on Murray Valley motorway on Saturday morning.
Police representatives state that the driver of the car did not stop to help the injured biker.
Monday, a 50-year-old man, surrendered to the Shepparton police.
It appears that he will be accused of fleeing from the scene of the accident, the non-offering of the first aid and other road offences.
The biker, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, remains in stable condition.
Coach Melbourne Storm, Craig Bellamy, answers the opponents in the charges of harassment.
Coach Melbourne Storm, Craig Bellamy, referred to the criticisms of the gambling tactics used by his team as "denatured subjects" brought into the discussion of the main two favorites of the NRL.
Coach Sydney Roosters, Trent Robinson, said that the referees allowed Storm players to "get to the beach" the team in Storm's nervous game at the end of the qualification played Friday night at Sydney.
The coach at Brisbane Broncos, Wayne Bennett, made an easy reference to Storm after the victory of his team in the North Queensland Cowboys qualification match, played on Saturday night, when he called the match a "refits" of the Rugby League and said that the two teams in Queensland don't get too much respect at the wrestling.
Bellamy jumped into defense of his team's gambling tactics and said players simply focused on "contact" when they were playing.
Bellamy says he gained confidence after two important coaches criticised his team, which means they were worried that Storm would beat him.
"And things don't stop here - I didn't hear Trent Robinson complain about screaming when they beat us with 24-2," Bellamy said Wednesday.
I can guarantee that I haven't changed anything every year in our defense systems or techniques, so much so that in the last six weeks, I've really put the focus on contact in seats and so I've changed the situation.
Trent is in this function for three years and obviously has a wonderful team so he's probably not used to losing and was a shock to him.
We know how it always happens this time of year.
Bellamy contradicted Bennett's idea of "souling football", reminding his mentor St George-Illawra Dragons of Bennett won the championship in 2010 by playing "plegissant" football.
Wayne's talking about football palpitating.
And he argued by comparing the game on Saturday night with our game on Friday night and talked about how palpitant the game was," Bellamy said.
I remember that in 2010, St. George received a lot of criticism because he was a boring team and Wayne said he didn't care about any black under his fingernails.
But now he's got a team that can play what I consider to be a dancing football, especially because of young rapists.
This kind of game you want to do when you have such players.
He brought this argument in 2010, now wants everyone to adopt his game style - not every team has two mediums like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt to be able to play like that.
It gives me more confidence because they say these things because they're kind of worried about the game with us.
Six weeks ago they probably weren't thinking about us when they were thinking about important games.
Bellamy also highlighted the fact that the game between Storm and Roosters was a stronger competition related to score compared to the match between Broncos and Cowboys.
The match of the Broncos was probably a good match, I haven't seen him yet, what was the score? 16-12?
Our game ended 20-18, in our game there have been two attempts, that means playing the ball?
Or do you mean take a break and don't walk?
For me, there are plans.
If I'm talking about us, it means that at a given time we could meet him.
Storm has released this weekend because they have won the right to play at home either with North Queensland Cowboys, or with Cronulla Sharks, at the end of next Saturday's preliminarys, at AAMI Park, the tickets being put in sale from the next March, in the morning.
Steven Hogg used the girl's phone to send pictures to the pedophiles.
A pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to ask for images of abused children.
Steven Hogg took the girl's phone when she was sleeping and then authenticated in an online mail service where another user sent her a series of images with children as a subject.
The girl later woke up and noticed the missing phone, which she found in Hogg's hand while she was sleeping.
He looked on the phone and found the disturbing messages that he immediately alerted his mother.
Upon arrival, the police saw the five images then analyzed the computers found at that address and found "anxious" searches on the Internet using terms to find images that were inconvenient with children.
Hogg claimed he did it to "draw the pedophiles" on the Internet before "pretend he's a cop to scare them".
Prosecutor Elihid Robertson stated to the Dundee Court: “He has declared it to be an addiction - that it is dependent on fear of people.
He admitted that he did the computer searches, but he said he did it because he wanted to become a cop to scare the pedophiles.
He was asked about conversations with an unknown person who sent his pictures and about asking that person to send more pictures.
He said he did it to suit it.
He said he doesn't think clearly when he drinks and wants to see his images with rapes and murders.
Mr. Robertson added: “When the girl found the messages on the phone, she screamed at her mother and trembling and crying.
The girl saw the inconvenient images on the phone and the accused was confronted.
The girl was interviewed and told that the accused used the computer and Playstation to talk to girls who seemed much younger than him.
Last year, on 14 June, Hogg, at the age of 23, domiciled in Ward Road, Dundee, blamed the allegations that he made or photographed improperly with children, and violated the conditions of release conditioned on 25 January this year and did not appear before the court on 24 March of the current year.
The defense lawyer, Gregor Sim, asked that Hogg not be registered in the register of sexual offenders because it can be said that this offence "did not involve a significant sexual aspect".
Judge Alistair Carmichael delayed the feeling until October, for reasons of social reports.
Hogg was released on bail in this file but remained in custody before viewing for other files.
He's gone to the sex offenders' register before the feeling was given.
Robert Mugabe, President of the Republic of Zimbabwe, gave the wrong speech to Parliament
At the beginning of the year, Mr. Mugabe, the oldest African leader, fell on the steps of a podium.
However, filming the fall has become viral on socialization networks.
The opening of the parliamentary session was also disturbed by the opposition representatives who said they would have received anonymous threats of death, threatening them that they would not be able to hate Mr Mugabe during his speech.
Last month they hated him during his speech in Parliament - a speech he repeated on Tuesday.
The leader of the parliamentary group Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), Innocent Gonese, said that seven opposition politicians received text messages on mobile phones, being warned not to disturb Mr. Mugabe's speech.
"The message was sent by a hidden number, but it is called "death," he told reporters after Mr. Mugabe's speech.
It warns the parliamentarians concerned that immunity applies only to Parliament and once they leave Parliament, parliamentary immunity is no longer valid.
The leader of the parliamentary group said that the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, is "anxious" about the threats transmitted to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard will make 30,000 availabilitys
It is expected that Hewlett-Packard will make available between 25,000 and 30,000 as part of the company's restructuring and cost reduction efforts in the services sector.
This year, HP will be divided into two companies, separating the computer and printer division from the corporate hardware and services operations that are in the leading growth.
The proposed availability will cost approximately 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter, HP said.
"These restructurings will bring new Hewlett Packard Enterprise a more competitive and sustainable structure with regard to costs," said Meg Whitman, president and CEO of HP, who will lead the unit after the break.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more concentrated than HP currently and will hold a wide business portfolio that will contribute to the transition of firms to a new business-based style," Whitman said.
Working as a separate company, we are better positioned than ever to meet the growing demands of our global customers.
According to a company statement, Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have annual revenues of over $50 billion and will "focus on providing integrated solutions without rivals" to companies.
A company founded in 1930 by University University graduates Stanford, Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, is split into an object of activity the production of electrical equipment and the garage in Palo Alto was called the Silicon Valley League.
HP went through a massive reorganisation to adapt to the transition from traditional computers to mobile devices.
The measure taken by HP, the second largest computer manufacturer in the world and one of the largest US technology companies, is the most recent in the field, based on the idea that companies that focus their attention better in a direction have better performance.
FriendsFest: comedy series that taught us important lessons about men's friendship
The absence of similar characters in the series is evident, given the need for men to open up is now more desperate than ever, suicide rates among young men reaching peaks in the last 15 years.
In 2013, suicide represented the main cause of death in men 20-45 years of age in the United Kingdom, and remains three times more frequent in men than in women.
In an attempt to address the problem, Campagn Against Living Miserably (CALM) designated 2015 as the Year of Man, wanting to put under the sign of the cultural question that prevents men from asking for help when they need it.
Friendship is at the centre of the struggle towards the success of this challenge.
A recent study conducted in more than 2000 high school students who had symptoms of depression concluded that if the patient is surrounded by enough friends "with a healthy condition", his chances of recovery are doubled.
In the same way, for those who are not depressed, a circle of healthy friends reduces the likelihood of mental disorders to half.
Of course, in order for friendship to have effect, this must be accessible first.
In this era of communication dominated by social networks, where emphasis is placed on style and not on substance, the immediate nature of the response often has priorities before meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to create the appearance of a strong personality, open to entertainment and success, even if in reality isolation is the one that dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values; money, image, social status, all with the cost of intrinsic values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship - which affects our mental health even deeper.
The billionaire of a video game recently explained that money really doesn't buy happiness.
The beauty of the Friends series was that it focused on this idea.
The characters were not defined by the place of work but by their own personality, which they showed by interacting as friends.
Joey and Chandler's frequent hugs, the moments they look at football in the comfortable photos and Ross' passion for Rachel came from the fact that they know that men can associate with this situation, even though they often seem to explore their feelings completely.
As one social worker explained to me: "My role in listening to people with a tendency to commit suicide and depression has shown how even the smallest interactions with friends can make a difference."
Often, people who call us feel unable to talk to their friends.
The old saying to manage yourself is strong, as is the feeling of being perceived as a weak person if you talk openly about problems.
Friends is one of the series that comes to my mind when I try to offer more psychological adaptation mechanisms in the long term.
The series highlighted little moments of friendship between men.
As much as it helps the objective, external intervention, through the telephone, people who have reached moments of despair, long-term support comes from family and close friends.
So, if you're attending this weekend at FriendsFest organized by Comedy Central, with the full editing of filming plates to celebrate the event, why not invite your friends to a coffee in Central Perk.
Or, and better, if you see someone alone in Starbucks, smile and greet.
You never know what the difference could make your friendship.
Friends is broadcast by Comedy Central from the beginning to the end - all 236 episodes - on the occasion #FriendsFest
From Maria marches and helps PSG to give Malmo away
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after marking against Malmo.
Angel Di Maria scored Tuesday in his first match in the Champions League and helped the PSG to impose himself on the Swedish Malmo team.
We continue to present the game's chronicle and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani did their duty, Paris Saint-Germain, starting a series of matches from the League of Champions groups, with a peaceful victory 2-0 against Malmo in the game played Tuesday on Parc des Princes.
Di Maria scored at least four minutes from the start of her first match in the League of Champions in the PSG team, bringing France's champions to the advantage even though they missed a number of occasions before ensuring their advantage with the goal marked by Caveni in minute 61.
Coming to the Group A along with Real Madrid and Şahtior Donetzk, Paris needed a strong start against the Swedish champions because the goal of the French team is not only to qualify in the best but also to improve the trip to the final districts in each of the last three tournaments.
However, even though the points were taken, Laurent Blanc's students were away from a perfect table, with Zlatan Ibrahimovic who wasted the opportunity of the goal after being replaced by a team from his hometown and the club that started his bright career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win home or moving into the League of Champions, so the 2-0 victory creates problems for our opponents and establishes a comfortable difference with the next class, even if there are other aspects we have to perfect them along the season," Blanc says.
It's a good sign.
We wanted to win and we did it, though I'm sorry that we couldn't give one or two more goals.
Ibrahimovic returned after the accident to one of the three changes to the Paris team, with a 2-2 remission obtained from Bordeaux in League 1 in the weekend, but Di Maria took the light of the reflectors in the fourth minute.
Last month when he was transferred from Manchester United, the Argentine offensive was named the man who will lead the PSG to the next level in Europe and demonstrated this when he landed at Marco Verratti's passport behind Malmo's defense before he was incredibly sued over Johan Wiland, in the long corner of the right gate.
But if someone like PSG expected to get the victory a little bit out of their fingers, they were disappointed.
Malmo, who defeated Celtic in play-off to get to this stage and entered the ground with nine national team titlers, with a defense of five people and two defensive middlemen, was a strong opponent.
But their attack was not impressive, except by making a shot of Nikola Djurdjic who passed by Kevin Trapp's post in minute 34.
Instead, PSG players slowed down a few times, giving a few unnecessary steps and non-finalising the interventions, even Ibrahimovic who missed not less than five attempts just in the first replay and was then replaced by Cavani even after the game was over.
Ibrahimovic, however, proved to be much more understanding in supporting his colleagues, his passport being the one that Di Maria sent in a shot away from Wiland on the port in 52 minutes.
The second goal was recorded in a final after an hour of match, due to Cavani, the Uruguayan who recorded the sixth goal of the season after Ibrahimovic spent the Maxwell center.
This goal eliminates the hope of Malmo's people that they will reassess Wiland's score and only a great stop away from rejecting David Luiz maintained the final score before the new entry of Ezequiel Lavezi cancels an extension goal.
Norwegian coach of the Malmo team, Age Hareide, later said that the PSG was with a class over and that "The last match we played in the League of Champions was in December last year."
Since then, I've only played in the league in Sweden, which doesn't rise to the same level.
Qualifications are not enough.
Out of the hat for the PSG.
They made an excellent game.
Glencore strands $2.5 billion in stock sales
The Swiss mining giant Glencore, affected by the decline in stock prices on the stock market, earned 2.5 billion dollars from the sale of shares as part of a comprehensive debt reduction plan.
Glencore, quoted at the London Stock Exchange, said he sold new shares worth 1.6 billion pounds to buy the debt.
Following the loss of 57% of its market value this year, the company is on the market at prices undercutting on the stock exchange, as China's decline in economic activity has influenced demand and led to market ruin.
The preferential right to subscribe has increased the price of Glencore stock on the London Stock Exchange in Wednesday morning's transactions.
The shares amounted to 2.77% to 131.60 billion in FTSE 100, which opened at a value of 0.69% higher.
Glencore has revealed the sale of $2.5 billion shares as part of the wider plans to cover almost one third of the $30 billion debt.
The company sold the new shares at the price of 125 thousandths per share, with 2.4% less than the closing price of March.
He got 1.3 billion shares out of the company, representing 9.99% of the group.
Concern over the increase in the Chinese economy in prolonged stagnation has led to a substantial increase in prices for iron mining, with approximately half, and coal, copper and other goods have decreased by 20-40%.
Xi insists on the wider expansion of the world economy
Tuesday, President Xi Jinping said a group charged with reforming that the economy must open further to the outside world to feed growth.
"China must commit to attract foreign investment and expertise and improve opening policies," Xi said during the 16th Meeting of the Central Steering Group for the Continuance of General Reforms (Central Leadering Group for Deepening Overall Reform).
Promoting opening up and encouraging reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and will make economic growth possible, Xi said.
The Steering Group adopted a series of guidelines, including a negative list of market access regulations, relaxation of customs control policies, encouraging state-owned enterprises to absorb private capital and reorganise the resident registration system.
According to the statement, a negative list will be drawn up identifying sectors and areas of activity in which investments are not allowed.
The system will be tested step by step and improved by test programs.
According to the statement, the measure is important because it will offer the market a more important role in the allocation of resources, ensuring a regulatory business environment and providing a wider market opening.
State authorities will also weaken control over the powers they delegate to companies, ensuring that these companies decide how to manage their business.
According to the statement, China will also allow border regions to explore new patterns of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.

The government's proposal today has not thanked us, otherwise we have not been able to call the leaders of our federations.
The 10 percent that we promised today represents less for us than we expected.

The Immigrant Crisis: Tragedy in the Aegean Sea
At least 22 immigrants drowned in the territorial waters of Turkey on Tuesday, after the shipyard in which they were shipwrecked.
Among the victims are 11 women and 5 children, reports AFP, according to Yahoo News.
The boat is located in the Aegean Sea and is headed towards the Greek island of Kos.
Turkey's Coast Guard has announced that it has managed to save 249 people who were in the shipwrecked ship, but their nationality has not yet been known.
Last month, two others died while trying to cross the Aegean Sea.
Also on the weekend, 34 immigrants, including 4 babies and 11 children, drowned off the Greek island of Pharmakonisi, located 15 kilometres from the Turkish coast.
The situation was similar: the boat transports more people than its capacity, so it shipwrecked.
The route has recently become a popular one for immigrants who want to escape the war and the hard life of countries such as Syria or Iraq.

The Stewardess gave the company to the court, won and were re-elected, but the company re-issued them in 2009.
"All the efforts to determine their weakness have been made," then explained a spokesman for the company.

For me, it's extremely important to find talented kids, who can play football without having material concerns at training.
They must have one concern: that's how to play football as well.
Technical details don't have to be their concern.
They have to value the talent.
This is what she wants to do at the Football Academy 'Paul Papp'.
"I also expect Prime Minister Costan Morar to be the first choice of children, to show them that they are next to them," said Papp footballer for breakfast.ro.

The whole party wants the government.
The interim president of the PSD Liviu Dragnea said on Tuesday that all the party wants to continue to rule, and, if the Prime Minister wishes, the PSD Congress will formalise this decision.
I understood Mr. Ponta was waiting for this decision from the PSD Congress, everyone wants to rule the whole party.
If we want to formalise it through a Congress's decision, we will do it too.
There won't be any emotion about that.
"There were no elements, voices in the party, opinions in the party that would give someone insecure the governor or give someone the impression that one of the parties does not want the PSD to join the government, in the current government, with the current prime minister," Dragnea said at the end of the PSD's National Permanent Bureau.
PSD announced when it will make conventions - what will be decided then

I will sing, Monday, after the Executive Committee, if the date of the congress is also established.
"I will announce whether I will run for a role in the party," Dragnea said at the end of Tuesday's session of the National Permanent Bureau of the PSD.
Asked if the exaggeration regarding the candidate announcers has anything to do with the file, Dragnea said she didn't have this problem.
I don't have the problem you're going to talk about, but I think it's fair and honest for all my colleagues in the party to tell me or not a candidacy at the moment when the Congress's date is formally established.
"It's the only motivation," Dragnea said.
The vast majority of social-democratic subsidiaries proposed an extraordinary PSD Congress on 11 October, and the exact date of the Congress will be decided on Monday by the Party's Executive Committee.

Then I felt bad, leaving a job behind.
So I thought it was good for me then and I think it was good for me.
What happened to me when I was a picker, it wasn't normal, I wasn't respected, I didn't respect my job.
I worked well with those before the Federation, but when Burleanu came to the Federation he came with a preconceived idea, he didn't know me, he found different opinions from the press about me.
He didn't change me because it was very hard at the time, with the results I had, plus it was the financial situation in the middle.
I kept working, it all worked out very well and it probably changed his ideas too.
But I wanted to go.
If she wanted to fail, I offered them a contract.

Rare disease a man suffers from
American Nick Hess was fed by his family that he was alcoholic, his wife filming him when he was drunk, could barely stand you on his feet and his words were hard to understand.
Although the 35-year-old man said he didn't consume alcohol, he was obviously in a state of drunkenness.
When he first accused me of being drunk, without drinking, I thought she was crazy.
"Insa friends and family thought 'may be drinking alone, he's an alcoholic in secret'," she says, according to Mirror.
When he saw his wife's films with him, the man in Columbus, Ohio, simply didn't admit, "I looked in my eyes and I wasn't there."
'It was awful, I didn't remember anything.'
In addition, his wife, who, although doubted for a while, eventually went with him to numerous doctors, remembered that Nick smelled alcohol.
The moment he put Nick's gangsters the hardest was when, after a minor accident, when he was hit by another car, he discovered that he had a three-fold alcoholism over the legal lime, though one night before he only had one beer.
After years of countless investigations, it was discovered that Nick was suffering from an extremely rare disease, auto-brewery syndrome.
Practically, the body or makes all the carbohydrates consumed fermented, turning into alcohol.
The one who claimed that this could be Nick's illness was actually his wife.
The disease hasn't got a cure yet, but since he quit the carbohydrates, Nick hasn't had such an episode.
He destroyed a Mercedes with a golf cross
A South Korean man destroyed his car, a Mercedes S63, in protest against the services he had on the side of the dealer.
The man "attacked" his car with a golf cross, causing enough damage to get the car out of use, broadcasts BT.
The whole scene was filmed, and the clip came on the Internet, to the fun of those who looked at it.
The man claimed that the car has defects that endanger his life and his family.
His guess was when the dealer who bought the car didn't solve the problem, as agreed.
The government approved, on Wednesday, "National Strategy on Immigration for the period 2015-2018" and "The Action Plan for the Year in progress", documents considered to be "a further step in Romania's efforts to modernise the migration management process in the national territory", according to a press release.
The source shows that the strategy aims to manage effectively the phenomenon of immigration, including general strategic objectives, specific objectives and action directives that reflect European-level policies adapted to national realities.
Given the problems faced by the states of Romania's immediate neighbourhood, measures for unitary management and consistency of the situations identified by the possible emergence of illegal immigrants in the territory of Romania are taken into account, generated by situations of the political, social, economic or military crisis.
"The Roman authorities will contribute to the creation of a flexible system of admission, but at the same time will pay particular attention to citizens from countries with potential migrationist or who can bring national security to the fore," the memory source adds.
The strategy identifies a number of factors that can influence immigration and asylum, including the maintenance of the Syrian conflict, the reactivation of the conflict in Iraq, the maintenance of an unstable situation in the border areas of Romania (Ukraine, Transnistria), the persistence and growth in the intensity of the Israeli-Palestinian armed conflict.
On the other hand, the document sets out and sets a number of general strategic objectives related to immigration, such as: promoting legal migration, strengthening the rule of law of the headquarters of third-country nationals in Romania and the proper application of the removal and restrictive measures, improving the national asylum system.
The national strategy shall include specific and relevant specific objectives for the transposition and implementation of the general strategic objectives.
Among these are: facilitating access to the territory of Romania of third-country nationals who respond to employment needs, promoting access to third-country nationals by higher intimacies in Romania for areas and professions identified as deficits.
Referring to the 2015 Action Plan, the Government appreciates that it is "a medium by which concrete activities are established leading to the creation of a flexible system to stop the migrationist phenomenon found in the cress."

The index refers to expenditure on staff of employees.
Thus, in the period April to June 2015, the total labour force cost increased by 1.9% in the European Union and by 1.6% in the euro area.
Romania, third place in the EU at the increase in labour force cost

In the construction sector, Romania recorded an advance of 5.8% of the hourly labour cost.
TVR driver's activity report, rejected by the Commission: Stelian Tanase risked resignation
Parliament's cultural commissions rejected the report of the Board of Directors of the Romanian Television Society on Wednesday 2014.
In order to reject the report, 17 Members voted, one against the rejection (sensitivity Varujan Vosganian) and one abstention.
The text of the report will be forwarded to the Standing Bureaus.
They'll decide, probably next week.
The next full meeting will be debated.
"I believe that considering this situation will be made relatively quickly," said the President of the Senate's Cultural Commission, Georgica Severin.
He added that "it felt good" as well as the TVR leadership to be present at this meeting, provided that no representative of the TVR leadership was present at the Committee on Culture.
It was a good feeling to be present with TVR's leadership because no one here has been subjected to personal attacks or something like that.
The invitation was made to the CA members again tonight, with about an hour we didn't know any more hours, but today, after the meeting Bureau headquarters, I personally sent a fax to the TVR leadership inviting her.
I think at the time you're summoned, you're being budgeted, paid out of public taxes, and you're invited to a committee meeting even if you don't like living.
"Because it is your duty to serve, you are in an institution under the sovereignty of Parliament," Severin said after the chair of Parliament's Cultural Committees.
He added that the financial aspects of the institution were discussed in the sitting on the basis of the negative opinion of the Committees on Budgets.
The debts we've seen and we've continued, came up with the idea that this year would have been a day, but they haven't been paid out of history.
"I remind you that not because of my fault or someone else in these committees has lost that deal with the banks and the fiscal, there are clear management problems," Severin said.
He added that after the activity report is rejected by the whole meeting, elections will follow for a new Board of Directors, and he will elect the director-general of the institution.
I don't know who will be proposed for this function.
The miracles are not going to happen.
It is important to make political decisions for this institution to function.
I'm not the man to lie, to tell you that there will be a genius who will sit at the tail here and fight.
I hope that those who decide, full of Parliament, by their vote will vote with great enthusiasm on the people who will run the TVR.
There must be people who know what's going on there, have experience and have a lot of correctness and respect for the girl of institution and tradition.
I don't know who's gonna be, if you ask me what quality you should have - I feel good about the wage girl because she's a cheater from the employees, the claimants, the vacationers.
"When it comes to 50, 60, 70, something is dirty and we talk about the financial situation that is a disaster," the President of the Senate's Committee on Culture concluded.
Even though he did not present himself to Parliament, TVR CEO Stelian Tanase sent a letter to the President of the Chamber of Deputies Valeriu Zgonea asking that Parliament have a number of measures that could lead to the saving and political independence of public television, including the numbering and indexing of the TV tax.
In writing, Stelian Tanase requests, in addition to the indexing of the TV tax, the modification and completion of HG 978/2003 on the fee for the public television service, in order to update the provisions on the level of technological change at day-to-day, as well as the regulation of the control procedure in the area of the TV fee and the detection of contraventions and the application of sanctions and penalties.
It also prefers to issue a provision to prevent the extension of the obligation for all electricity suppliers to become SRTv's agents for the collection of the TV tax, by involving ANRE in regulating this activity.
In his opinion, it is necessary to establish a maximum ceiling of 5% of the commission in the cases.
Stelian Tanase calls for a reduction in the VAT rate for the specific activities of the public television station and for a contribution for the NCBs of 15% at the level of 3%, but also for an amendment to the law 41/1994, in order to obtain budgetary/financial allocations for the purchase of major cultural and sporting events licences - the World Football Championship, the Golden Cerbul, Eurovision.
He argues that SRTv will be unable to pay in the following months, considering that labour law obliges the employer to enforce judicial decisions, even if they are not final, and wage rights are honoured with priority over any other obligation.
The TVR administration has made constant efforts to reduce expenditure on staff and the production of TV.
"This reduced travel and other cost-generating activities, renegotiated a number of commercial contracts, and at the end of July the TVR News post was closed," the President of the TVR wrote.
Tanase appreciates that the disastrous financial situation cannot be solved only by its own efforts.
"Without the support of the state institutions - the Government, Parliament, the Presidency - Roman television will be found, sooner or later, in the impossible to carry out its public mission," the letter states.
The leadership of the Chamber of Deputies decided to send the letter to the Committee on Culture.
The genes of Vasile Blaga, sent to the judge
Vasile Blaga's genes, Ionut Andrei Rudeanu, were sent to the trial, Wednesday, by the prosecutors of the Park on the side of the Bucharest Court of Appeal.
It is charged with tax evasion, in a dossier of approximately EUR 600,000, being under judicial control.
Andrei Rudeanu was preventively arrested on 22 May.
It established a security firm Axis Corporate Security SRL, along with his mother in April 2009, one year after he married Vasile Blaga's daughter, Agathe.
The investigation reiterated that, for the purpose of deducting taxes and taxes from the state budget, the representatives of a company specialised in security services would have created a criminal circuit, formed by several commercial companies, which would have revealed the fictional transactions.
"In fact, the company's accounting would have registered the cash purchases of services, which, in fact, were not provided, the state budget being so damaged by around 600,000 euros," the Romanian Police explained in a press release.
They set the fate of Sanmartean
Al-Itihad club's sects have set up the fate of middle Lucian Sanmartean.
Although the Arab press announced that the separation of Sanmartean from Ittihad is imminent, coach Ladislau Boloni, Arcadie Zaporojanu, says this will no longer happen.
Boloni is very grateful for Sanmartean.
Lucian plays match title and does it well.
They realized that he was the best and that it would be wrong if they gave up on him.
It would have been a variant to bring another player, much better, but nothing came out.
"There have been more discussions, such as the one with Mbark Boussoufa, but nothing has been realized," Zaporojanu told Digi Sport.
Lucian Sanmartean arrived at Al-Ittihad at the beginning of this year.
Ilie Sarbu was voted Vice-President at the Court of Auditors
Parliament's plenary voted on Wednesday to appoint Senator Ilie Sarbu, Vice-President Victor Ponta, as Vice-President of the Audit Authority of the Court of Auditors.
According to Mediafax, 290 votes in favour and 108 abstentions were recorded.
The vote was secret, with the ballots.
PNL representatives were the only ones who voted against this proposal, Digi24 reported.
On the other hand, liberals criticised Sarbu's name in this function and announced that they would challenge the CCR, under the conditions in which he has a DNA file, but did not have the necessary preparation and experience.
Ilie Sarbu has 30 days at his disposal, according to the law, to resign from the Senate, because the new function of the Court of Auditors does not allow him to do any more politics.
The PSD Senator will serve as vice-chairman of the Court of Auditors' Audit Authority, branch free after Ioan Anton was revoked, as a result of a decision of the Constitutional Court in September 2014, which found that he was appointed as a non-constitutional.
Surprise from one of the sexiest actors: I grew up in the kitchen
How Bradley Cooper is going to play the role of a cook in the Burnt movie, the actor made a disassemble that his fans didn't expect.
In a recent interview, she said she grew up in the kitchen: "I worked a lot of my life as a cook."
He has been disappointed that he has worked in the kitchen since he was 15 years old, when he worked for a Greek restaurant, so that then, in college, he will continue the same way.
The actor explained that the mother had Italian origins, so the whole copy had finished with the Italian grandmother, related ContactMusic.
Asked what future plans he had in that period, Bradley Cooper said he was never the type of man to make plans for five years, "not even two".
"It's no reason for me to have a map," he said.
"I have dreams, things you've done if I told you," he said, but he said that what he wanted from his co-worker was fulfilled.
Until the age of 40, the actor acknowledged that he was in the near future the director, following the model of Clint Eastwood, who has taken the whole of this age as a king.
Ponta, charged with uncontrolled columns and ironing claims
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijarto condemned hard, Wednesday morning, the statements of Roman Prime Minister Victor Ponta according to Hungarian political decisions are "nothing better than those of Syria, Libya or other countries from which refugees flee".
"Yesterday, Victor Ponta lost his self-control and, by his ironic claims, was all over Hungary," the Hungarian Foreign Minister sent in a communiqué.
Civilised European politicians do not say such uncontrollable slanders.
"His remarks have one explanation: he completely lost his support in Romania's internal policy," the Hungarian diplomat chief added, according to MTI.
In a Tuesday evening post on Facebook, Prime Minister Victor Ponta said he would like to draw attention and sanction the behaviour of Hungarian government officials, who, in his opinion, "are a Russian for European Union culture and values".
I don't want to answer the challenges that come from some of the Hungarian government's representatives.
"This is a shame to the culture and values of the European Union; and in anti-Semitic attitudes, and with regard to the treatment of minorities of all types, and now during the refugee crisis," Ponta said on Facebook.
The Roman Prime Minister added that the adoption of a rational and sustainable solution to the refugee crisis would not solve the problem, appreciating that brutality and aggressive laws will not solve the problem.
Sarma gimpata, aggressive laws, prisons and brutality will certainly not solve the problem - they will only appear to be in Hungary, in the heart of Europe, politicians with nothing better than those in Syria, Libya or other countries from which the refugees fled!
"I believe in solidarity, in rational and sustainable solutions and above all European values - what we see in Hungary in the last few days is in total contradiction with these objectives and values!", the chief of the Roman executive stressed.
Earlier Tuesday, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijarto described the remarks of Roman Prime Minister Victor Ponta on the management of Hungary's refugee crisis, considering that these statements were inappropriate for a leader of the 21st century, according to MTI.
Hungarian diplomat chief also mentioned Tuesday as the "extremist and lying marks" of the first Roman has a crisis in Romania's internal politics and pointed out that Budapest is waiting for excuses from the Roman side.
Szijarto referred to a statement made on Monday by Prime Minister Victor Ponta.
What I've always said and said is that I'm against xenophobic speeches the idea of closing the grenades, that all who come are terrorists, are the fools of the Middle Ages and I totally oppose this approach.
If we can get more, we'll get the problem, it's our logistics to treat those people as some people, not how they treat our neighbors, with the boat and the inseries.
"That I disagree with," said the chief of the Roman executive at a press conference in Targu-Juu.
On Tuesday, Peter Szijarto announced that the Budapest government decided to start preparations on the ground for extending the border with Romania of the guard built on the border with Serbia to face any changes in the route used by migrants.
Later, Prime Minister Victor Ponta said that Hungary's decision to raise a granite guard does not solve anything about the refugee problem and "scoate Hungary in Europe".
What is the connection between Osama bin Laden and the crackdown of the Mecca macara?
The Saudi authorities have announced that the Saudi giant Binladin Group, belonging to the family of Osama bin Laden, is "partial responsible" for breaking up a macara, Friday, on Lake Moschee de la Mecca, an accident followed by 107 people died.
According to an investigation committee, the company did not "respect the safety rules", the Saudi Press Agency (SPA) reported, reports the BBC.
The company's directors have been banned from leaving the country until the investigation was completed in this case.
The signature will also be excluded from new public contracts.
The construction company is owned by the family of the former leader of the Al-Qaida terrorist network, Osama bin Laden.
The company was founded by Osama bin Laden's father after 80 years and is now led by the former terrorist leader's brother, Bakr.
Binladen Group has been working for 4 years at the extension of Mari Moschei, to host more pilgrims.
The accident occurred on Friday night, during a storm, when a macara, probably disequilibrated by strong wave reefs, collapsed on the east side of Maria Moschei's roof at Mecca.
As a result of the accident, 107 people died and nearly 400 were injured.
How Hagi shut the contestants' mouth
Considered by many of the world's largest Roman footballer in history, Gica Hagi was labeled after the withdrawal of activity, as a weak coach, which cannot be able to perform perform and in the new position.
After an unhappy experience with the national team, Steaua or Galatasaray, Hagi took over, after a year, the role of coach at the Future Constanta, the team that sponsors it.
After a year of team takeover, the King has demonstrated that it is able to transform a team that was fighting for rescue from a back-up in a top.
Thus, after a year, the Future recorded, with Hagi coach, 16 wins, 11 remunerated and 11 infringings.
The balance sheet is one of a team of tops, which fights European cups.
Things took a turn and better for the future in this season, trained team got to place two in League 1, with 19 points, one less than leader Astra Giurgiu.
The future also has the best attack in League 1, with 20 golls (equal to Astra), more than double than Steaua.
On the other hand, even if he brought more experienced players to the team, Hagi continued his policy of promoting young people, and in the last period of the start team appeared names such as Ianis Hagi or Hodorogea.
The club's policy in the future has made a team of followers for foreign teams, so Hagi sold 1.5 million euros this summer - Ianis Hagi (Fiorentina - 1 million euros) and Alexandru Mitrita (Bari - 500 thousand euros).
In addition to Steaua, the future is the only profitable team in League 1, according to data from the Trade Register.
In the refugee crisis, Romania has played as a small country so far.
It's a legitimate strategy, but then you can't ask to be treated as the EU's seventh country.
The big dates come with solutions for the EU-wide, says Cristian Ginea, a member of the board of directors of the Centre for European Policy.
In an interview given by Ziare.com, Cristian Ginea showed that Europe cannot be transformed into a strong one, and the purely political means will not work in this crisis: "Maybe we have doubts about the quality of the values that these people come with."
But there are masses that have started and we can't go back in history.
Migration is a reality that we need to adapt to as much as possible and adapt it to us.
In Christian Gynea's opinion, we find ourselves in an extremely emotional moment, where politicians feel the need to show their muscles.
After it passes, Europeans will not be willing to give up their free movement, but the rules in the Schengen area must be changed: "Schengen is now like an animal created at another time and that was not adapted to the situation at the moment".
Where are we in the refugee crisis after this JAI council that actually didn't solve anything?
It is clear that the EC Presidents in agreement with Donald Tusk did not want to strengthen a vote in the Council.
All the predictions said they would have had the necessary votes.
Before the Treaty of Lisbon, the principle of unanimity shall apply in the JAI and any State may block any decision.
That is why things have been very little integrated in the area of justice and internal affairs.
After Lisbon, the normal procedure is applied, in which the EC has the initiative, and the Council adopts a 55% vote among the states, i.e. 16, which represents 65% of the EU's population.
The calculations said the votes existed.
But they didn't want to go before.
Because it's a sensitive issue, there have been reactions to rejection even in Germany against the opening policy of Chancellor Merkel and they did not want in many countries to appear to be a reaction of the type "the EU sends migrants to our heads".
They have soared, but the problem remains because, obviously, this valley creates a huge problem for Governor Schengen and we will probably attend major changes there in the next period.
So the mandatory quotas weren't really eliminated, but the subject was just allowed to slow down?
Yes, on the other hand, there is a greater involvement of Frontex in the management of external borders, which means a change in the individual responsibility of the Schengen external border members to the responsibility of the Community agencies.
Greece's granite with Turkey is and Germany's granite with Turkey, in fact, and this wave of migrants has given the borders of the old Schengen system.
Perhaps he will give up the Dublin principle, according to the way migrants are responsible for the state in which they enter the first hour, because it is not sustainable.
If Greece is in charge, you can't say at all that it's Greece's business.
The problem and the common one.
Just because the problem is common, is it possible to solve without a precise, perhaps even mandatory, mechanism of delivery?
No one knows exactly how the mandatory quotas will work, if it gets to them.
Because there's a problem: what are you doing with a man who doesn't want to come to Romania or Portugal, but in Sweden or Germany?
I don't think the European states will be able to take up migrants: you go to X or Y.
It is likely to reach unique filtering centres, in Greece or Turkey, where asylum applications will be processed.
They're working on solutions like that.
But the problem doesn't have a simple solution.
There are countries that have ten years of experience trying to integrate migrants, there are countries without any experience, such as Romania, where the problem of migrants will increase the current xenofob.
It is true that we are talking about millions of people who are in Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, who are in the preoccupation camps and who have just begun to go to Europe.
An estimate says that only 10% have been able to leave, the winter is hard past the Mediterranean, but we expect next year to a wave even bigger.
What do we do with these people?
My prediction is that we're going to get used to this problem, we're not going to look at it that way from a media point of view.
Talk to countries with smaller or larger experience.
Does it seem to you that there is a place where the integration of large groups from an extra-European culture has really succeeded?
I look at the Maghrebs in France, the Turks in Germany, they're still enclaved.
I wouldn't go to the radical statements.
Of course, their integration is more difficult than in other migration flows, but this does not mean that they are not integrated at all.
It has raised an integral part that creates major social problems in France, Germany, the United Kingdom.
But the average policemen won't work.
To create a strong Europe and illusion.
It must be embedded in integration mechanisms in European societies.
There were some mistakes here.
We have to be more pretentious.
To ask these people to learn the language, to try to take the values, to stop walking in Europe and with one in their country of origin, bringing the rest of the family, including through the couple of conveniences.
But the immediate problem of these people's long-term problems must be separated.
If others have been involved in long-term integration, it does not mean that we should look at them as they fall into the Mediterranean.
Maybe we have doubts about the quality of the values these people come with.
And if there will be an intervention in Syria, which I don't believe, doesn't mean that the country will be refreshed overnight and you can take them back.
Before the solution appears, we see strong in Europe.
They closed granite, raised walls, reintroduced control at the border in the Schengen area.
Is the European project in danger?
The European project as such does not, the Schengen area as it was built, yes.
It was built quite minimal and setting rules so that the pressure was too high on the days when they put their foot for the first time.
I mean, we're running free around there, but everyone's with his problems.
In the face of such a wave, it can't be, because some countries don't make the girl.
When there are such waves of emotion, politicians want to look like they're doing something, but in the long run, there's no big deal going on.
After the attacks in France, we don't have much more draconic anti-terrorist legislation in the EU than we had last year.
It's a wave of public emotion that's installed in both senses.
And it's so unstable from one week to the next you can't make decisions on her basis.
We have a lot of papers, a lot of Belgian statements from politicians who are at home under the pressure of being a source.
And then, you have a dramatic case of the child ingested in Turkey and the public opinion is excited.
After the public emotion passes, we will return to the reasons why we created this space, this freedom of movement which is not only for people but also for goods.
This is the only real European market.
And I don't think Europeans will give up this principle of freedom of movement.
That there will be other rules and something else.
Schengen is now like an animal created in another time and that was not adapted to the situation from now on.
How has Romania played so far in this crisis?
As a small country, which thinks, if she pulls her eyeballs and her ears go away, the theme disappears.
In the face of the reality of the waves of migrants, you can choose to be part of the solution or say that it's not your little country problem.
We have done this, it's a legitimate strategy, but then you can't ask to be treated as the EU's seventh country.
You're not, you're not playing big country.
The major tariffs come with solutions for the EU as a whole, good or bad, we are not discussing their quality now.
Just like Poland did.
On the other hand, the effect of this crisis is that the appetite of the Romans for Schengen will fall very much.
President Johannis says it might be good that I haven't already entered.
So we're going from desperate entry to a more pragmatic position, but the goal remains.
There is, of course, a risk that Romania and Bulgaria will enter Schengen as migrants to see us as the alternative route.
Which doesn't mean it's a reason we don't get into Schengen anymore, but we're more pragmatic.
Romania will be part of Schengen, and Schengen will exist, but transformed in the sense that external borders will become common responsibility, will be the only rules for accepting migrants, the only rules for deportation for those who do not receive asylum, the only rules for the countries considered safe.
Ukrainian president said that after Russia shifted its attention to Syria in Ukraine, no one died.
Is there a connection between the second focus, a Russian game?
Russia has a frustrated power behavior.
She believes that being a great power means inducing Americans and Europeans.
From this point of view, yes, there is a connection.
Without the military and financial effort of the Putin regime, probably the Assad regime would have collapsed a long time ago.
And it was good to dive before the main or opposition to be the Islamic State.
A couple of years have been a struggle between the Assad regime and the secular and moderate Muslim armies, supported by the Gulf and the West.
Then the Islamic state rose and now we don't know if we want the Assad regime to fall down.
Russia could complicate things, but it can't participate in the solution.
It creates a focus of instability and chaos that cannot close them.
But you're great only if you have solutions.
The game off-side is just a strategy to win time.
Putin probably expected to make offers, push him on the buttons to solve the situation.
The offers do not come because the world is not convinced that it can solve in some way or other matter created by it all.
But I don't agree with the theories that these people are being manipulated by an invisible hand.
Let's not see Putin stronger than he is.
What button will appear soon
Millions of Facebook users have used the "Like" button, and now the representatives of the socialization network are preparing the opposite, the "Disclike".
Tuesday, Mark Zuckerberg, co-founder and executive director of the company, announced on the account or that this button will be available soon, reports the New York Times on the blog.
Zuckerberg pointed out that the "Dislike" button will look more like a nuance than a user feels more than a simple option.
However, the announcement or raised the problem that Facebook might become a little more friendly.
Zuckerberg mentioned that he wants to avoid the moments when someone is posted on the account or an important event in life, and someone else will give "Disclice".
Network users, who have reached 1.5 billion active accounts, have long asked to be able to express their negative emotions or empathy with something sad.
Mark Zuckerberg has already said that it is not very comfortable for people to give "Like" current events, such as the refugee crisis, or in the case of a family member's death.
"You may not feel comfortable giving Like those posts," said Facebook representative.
The variant of a new button on Facebook was not well received by everyone.
"There is already enough hatred on Facebook and on socialization networks," said Atiq Haneef from Afghanistan, on the Facebook page of the New York Times, where the article on this subject was posted.
"I'm going to give 'Discly' the 'Discly' button," he said.
Roger Anderson, a microbiologist in Atlanta, has argued that there is nothing wrong with this button, encouraging people to have different opinions on Facebook.
Debra Aho Williamson, media analyst at eMarketer, mentioned that it is hard to imagine that a single button can transmit a complex range of negative emotions.
More than that, she supports it, approaching the election campaign in America, and the "Disclik" button would create a total disaster.
Only 70 refugees entered Hungary in 24 hours
Hungary only accepted on Tuesday 70 migrants, one hand of thousands of revenue at its southern border with Serbia, government adviser Gyorgy Bakondi announced.
Hungary has declared state of urgency during the course of the day in two judges along the border with Serbia due to the flow of refugees, inquiring a main point of crossing the border and announcing that it will build a guard at its border with Romania, DPA recalls.
The measure has delayed a sudden reaction on the part of Serbia.
Just yesterday they said they'd seal the granite for those who want to pass, but not for those who want to cook asylum.
"As you can see, this is totally different," said Serbian refugee minister Alexander Vulin.
Before imposing the new immigration legislation, a 5,809 number of migrants entered Hungary on Sunday, the police announced months.
More than 170,000 immigrants from the Middle East and Africa also patrolled Hungary from Serbia in 2015.
Many avoid being registered and try to reach the West, especially in Germany.
The "New" seat of the Jewish Council stands to drink.
Two builders, insolvent
The massive investments made here in recent years, with a view to changing the institution, are due to the fact that they have been stopped several times.
Two important builders who worked here went into insolvency during the work.
The seat of the Jewish Council on the streets of Vasile Alexander will be able to give himself up.
In one and a half years since the construction consolidation and refurbishment work had to be completed, the work did not reach a half.
A final stage in the epoch of the building was consumed the last day, when the National Dispute Resolution Council (NCSC) rejected a complaint from a company that wanted to take up the technical project contract for the further work to be carried out.
The original project was created by Impex Romcatel SA.
Following the insolvency of the builder and termination of the works, the negotiation procedures were initiated without publication of a notice of participation with Impex Romcatel, the firm intended to update the technical project, and then a new contract for work was organised.
"The negotiations did not end, however, through a contract, the CJ appreciating that the proposed form would be disadvantaged by the institution," Rázvan Timofciuc, a public relations representative of the CJ.
The CJ decision to terminate direct negotiations was under attack by Impex Romcatel.
The Court of First Instance sent a complaint to the CNSC, which rejected it as a delay.
This does not mean, however, that CJ can start looking for another designer.
Impex Romcatel has the possibility to attack CNSC's decision at the Court of Appeal, just after a final sense of it being able to consider finding another designer.
Thus, building consolidation work could be resumed earlier in the coming year.
Our intention is to resume the work as soon as possible.
In principle, the refurbishment of the technical project should not last long, but we must reach the conclusion of a contract.
"We expect to see whether the CNSC decision will be attacked or not," Timofciuc said.
The work of strengthening the former Police Investigation Office began in 2011.
A first contract of work was concluded in April 2012 after works of 4.5 million lei were carried out.
The tender was resumed, the contract being awarded by Moldoconstruct SA.
However, the company entered into insolvency, and this contract was settled after the payment of 1.5 million lei.
The work has been carried out so far in proportion to about 50%.
Initial, consolidation, recompensation and management of the building was assessed at 7.7 million lei.
"Stop, I say it all!" - the statement that could incriminate the former head of the Cadastral
One of the employees involved in the scandal file from the Cadastre Office signed an agreement on recognition of the facts, against late imprisonment.
Most likely, his statements will incriminate the others accused, in front of the former chief, Narciza Nedelcu
A consultant from the Cadastre Office and Real Estate Advertising (OCPI) was accused of DNA in a corruption file and admitted to his fax.
The agreement on the recognition of the facts signed by Dumitru Dascălu was registered yesterday at the Iaşi Tribunal, the judges deciding to give a solution in this case on 29 September.
Dimitra Daniel Dascălu was accused of continuing intellectual fraud and agreed to run two years in chisar with delay, as well as work for the benefit of the community.
With regard to Dascálu's alleged facts, the prosecutors stated that he, as a consultant of the Cadastral Office, together with other colleagues, "concerned several verbal acceptance processes, with the award of services by O.C.P.I. I. Iaşi with the managers of SC Gauss SRL, SC Group Cinci SRL, SC Topo Euro Cad SRL, SC Cad Depot and Topography SRL and PFA Lipşa Stefan, which were falsely certified that the services contracted were fully carried out, under the conditions in which they were not carried out and were not carried out to O.C.P.I.I. Iaşi".
Last day, former Chief of the Office, Narciza Nedelcu, but also other former or current employees of the OCPI were sent to the court in this file, the charges being the decommissioning of services to the companies mentioned, although the works were not carried out.
Prejudice exceeds 300,000 lei.
Adventures in the Stone Age
In the opinion of the president of FRH, Alexandru Dedu, Romania can host a major handball competition only in 2024, and the preparation of the national women's handball for qualifying at the Olympic Games costs a fortune.
The president of the Roman Federation of Handball, Alexandru Dedu, said yesterday, in a press meeting, that it is a great pride that our country has three teams in the League of Champions groups.
With regard to Romania's national women's handball team, "the main goal is to qualify for the Rio Olympics, but for this it has to go through two stages of the Kaunas theft, firstly the World Championship and secondly the pre-qualification tournament," Dedu said.
We really want to qualify for the Olympics.
There are some fantastic requirements of the technical staff led by Thomas Ryde.
Staff to be composed of seven or eight people.
He wants second coach, doctor, two masarios, carrier coach, physical coach, head of delegation.
They asked us to qualify for some things, more precisely material for physical preparation, which we've never heard of.
All this to get to the Olympic Games. And I'll do everything it takes of me to have them.
We're talking about a massive investment, there's a lot, a lot of money.
But this is the way to do performance.
Because we're at the time of the rock preparation.
"The teams we are fighting with have these materials and have them for some time," said Dedu, who mentioned that he is trying to obtain the necessary amounts for the purchase of these products from MTS and COSR.
The president of the FRH also referred to Romania's infrastructure and to the possibility of our country hosting a major handball competition.
We don't have a room in Bucharest.
It is a problem of infrastructure and it is shameful to have a European Gymnastic Championship under the sign of the question.
Let's not forget that in other parts of the world, Olympic neighborhoods have been built all over a period of two years.
Before 1992, in the present Olympic area of Barcelona, it was a waste of garbage, and now it's got a repertoire of beauty.
The same happened in London, where the 2012 Olympics were a success in terms of investment.
"In my view, in 2024 we can host a major competition," Dedu said.
He added that international handball agencies are willing to grant Romania the organisation of a major competition.
For me, it is a priority to bring major handball competitions to Romania.
Mr. Gațu has gone civilized with a project, people have given their agreement in principle, but they have soon come to the conclusion that the hall will never be built.
And I had discussions with the EHF, I told them that we want, that we are able to organize and they said I agree and invite them to the first match in the new room in Bucharest and then we discuss it concretely.
"So we have all the opening, both at the EHF and at the IHF, but we don't have infrastructure," official FRH explained.
The former great handballist has avoided evaluating the chances of female teams CSM Bucharest and HCM Baia Grande to reach Final Four: "I have asked all coaches to be reserved in forecasts, that if they do not comply with their return".
Good way to the World Cup
Romanian Rugbişti begins on 23 September, against France
The captain of the national Rugby team, Mihai Macovei, said on Tuesday at a press conference that all members of the Romanian lot are ready for World Cup matches in England, where he hopes to win two victories: "We are ready".
Both me and my colleagues are with the engines at the top.
We've been trained to make the best of the four games.
Everyone will have great expectations, because our goal is to win in two matches, against Canada and Italy.
All the groups are hard and ours is the same.
Let's take it easy, first time with France and then we'll see.
But, of course, if we win with Canada, the match with Italy will be our final.
I can't describe in words the joy of participating in the World Cup, is the introduction of so many years of work.
I wish I didn't disappoint anyone in the family of the rugby and come with nice results at home.
"We want you to be proud that some players, a small family such as the rubby in Romania, are proud of the tricolor," Macovi said.
The Romanian National Team Selector, Lynn Howels, found in his first experience as a coach at the World Cup, hopes to make Romanian proud of the Rugby's selection: "It's a great honor for us to participate in this World Cup".
I'm sure the players are ready to take part in the tournament.
It's an extraordinary experience for me.
For me, it is very important for every match to make the Romans proud of the national team.
The President of the Romanian Rugby Federation, Haralambie Dumitras, trusts that Romanian players can confirm the progress made in the last years in Rugby.
We have a very difficult group and we want to confirm the progress made on the national team.
I want the athletes to succeed and I'm convinced that we'll be at the top of the event.
"These guys started playing in the Romanian teams at 18-19 years old, so there is cohesion, it's a band of friends, who decided to make a dream," Dumitras said.
At the World Rugby Cup in England, Romania will evolve into Group D, having scheduled the following matches: with France, on 23 September in London; with Ireland, on 27 September in London; with Canada, on 6 October in Leicester; with Italy, on 11 October in Exeter.
The competition starts on Friday, at the Twickenham Stadium in London, with the England - Fiji match in Group A.

14 million lei give to St. Spiriton Hospital in Iaşi at budget correction
What will be bought with this important amount of money?
The hospital "St. Spiriton" was received from the Ministry of Health, following the budgetary correction, about 14 million lei.
The money received by the medical unit to be used by the end of the year will be invested in the modernisation and modification of clinics, but also in the medical equipment and technical equipment for which the hospital has already begun the public procurement procedure.
Thus, the health unit will be equipped with a new tomography computer, with a new radiology device, with six tricks used for surgical interventions, six ATI beds equipped with adequate, ophthalmogenic microscope and other equipment necessary for the performance of the medical act.

The clinic will function in the area where allergy, haematology and endocrinology are located in the outpatient and will have approximately 30 beds.
The fall, made of laughs by RATP controllers and a flange.
Traveling a tourist
A family of tourists from Cluj came to Iaş to visit him, but the trip ended with a bitter promise.
After my experience, neither I nor my wife ever wanted to walk in your city again.
Without wishing, they were struck by the misinformation from the envelope, by the unsub of the RAPT controllers and, bonus, by an amendment "that's what the law says."
The husbands arrived in Iasi a few days ago, settled in a hotel in the Centre and asked for tourist supplies.
They also received a pen containing the RATP tracks.
"Damn" with these maps, husbands have visited the Iaş.
But, two days ago, you were in Copou, they wanted to get to the Mall Palace.
Because she was not loaded with tickets at the station next to the Copou Park, they were based on information printed on the envelope: that I can take the ticket via SMS.
No one told them this service doesn't exist anymore.
Incidents in the fold, they entered a bus and tried to send text messages after instructions from the fold.
Unfortunately for them, he made his appearance a team of RATP controllers.
They said there's no service for 2 years and that it was announced in the press that it was cancelled.
EU OF A THING TO KNOW what's written in the local press, I'm coming with a night before I visit the city?
I talked to the controllers, I explained the situation, they said they don't care, it's not their business.
The attitude was very challenging.
They said everything I can do is give us one amendment instead of two (my and my wife).
"I paid, I didn't want to spend my visiting stand day on January and give the statements there!" says Ovidiu.
In conclusion, the family was amended because of misinformation from the fold and the controllers who "applyed the law to blood".
It's not right, and I made a session at RATP Iasi to recover my money.
It's not about money, I'm not over-exposed, but the idea is that I felt bad.
Ghinion for Violators in Vaslu.
They had an accident and remained in preventive arrest
The process of the seven Violators from Vaslui moved yesterday to the Court of Appeal.
The judges tried the first term of trial in an unpublic sitting where the seven young people accused of beating an 18-year-old asked to be released.
Before the trial, one of the judges who had been assigned the file, Viorel Munteanu, made a request for detention, which was accepted by his colleagues from the court.
The judge activated until the summer of this year at the Vaslui Court, where he was president of the Section on the ground, being the one who, on 9 April, admitted a challenge made by four of the accused, having their arrest at home.
Today, the file is judged by a complete of which are part of the Magistrates Maricica Mititelu and Geta Sandu.
Previously, in the file, a detainee and Judge Dan An ton, because his daughter is in a concubination relationship with one of the rapists' lawyers.
The two judges decided that Vaslu's offenders would continue to remain in preventive arrest.
Those blacks will remain in prison for at least 30 days, when Jews who will spare their opportunity to set free.
The next term of office will be held at the Court of Appeal on 6 October.
Before reaching the Court of Appeal Iaşi, the doubt with which Violators from Vaslui were transported was involved in an accident produced in the city of Păcurari, the car entering Iaşi in the center.
The Iveco driver who was transported by the seven rapists hit a Volks car that came out of Canta Street, and the driver tried to turn left.
The duba runs through the end of the holidays.
The car went into Iaşi here because the employees of the Prison Administration preferred the route from Vaslui to Iaşi to Graduri, then to the city hall.
They cut off the road like this a few kilometers away.
Immediately after the impact, the escort of the detainees called for another transport, to take over custody.
In a short time, a car was sent from the Penitentiary of Maximum Security Iaşi, who took over the seven detainees and transferred them to the Court of Appeal.
As a result of the accident, none of the arrests were injured.
To transfer them to the other dube, the guards surrounded the back of the niels, and the arrests came out in a hurry, two or two.
"The incident has not been reported to the police, because the drivers of the cars have understood themselves to be friendly about the damage to be paid," said Chief Mädalin Čăranu, in IPJ.
Great Migrations
Romania is not and will not be prepared for what will follow.
What about Europe?
I say it from the outset, clearly and clearly: the 7000 refugees that Romania should and must naturally represent, in itself, a significant but huge number compared to the ability of the Romanian state to manage such a project.
For Romania, even the voluntary quota proposed by Bucharest, in the amount of about 1500 souls, we are far superior to the good intentions of solidarity with the European Union expressed in the last few months.
Surely, if those migrants will even agree to settle in our localities, the chances of quickly integrating them into Romanian society are extremely small.
I'm sure they'll be the first to lose their patience.
Parasite of interlocutors and paralysed by a venous political class, the Romanian state is proved impotent in all areas.
The inability to integrate the gypsum is just a banal example.
In addition, governments of every color were not able to absorb European funds, make roads, gardens or modern schools, provide decent medical care, narrow the misery on the street, create decent paid jobs or keep their own young generation home.
Why would refugees be established in another country where they're fleeing?
But what makes a lot of wonder is, in particular, the hypocrisy with which such a crisis is dealt with.
First of all, we are struck by the Bolicosian ferocity of the EU's strong states, which give evidence of maximum generosity when it comes to sharing problems with smaller countries.
Then comes the fearless hypocrisy of the Romans who, although they have millions of rubles scattered around the world, do not yet accept the other - another language, another religion, another blood.
He's probably afraid not to steal from any of his national beings.
Finally, there is also a hypocrisy of many migrants, who, although only invoke war horrors as a reason for their departure, do not accept a destination of exodus other than Germany or the Nordic countries.
But not all refugees are Syrians, and there is no war in Pakistan.
Also, the simplest way in which the crisis is analysed can only be taken away.
The causes must be eliminated, supported by some and, strictly moving on to the book of political justice, peace and investment for the countries of origin of migrants.
But in Romania there is peace and even more coming in, from time to time, some foreign capital in the national economy - but this does not prevent tens of thousands of Romanians from leaving their country every year.
Why is he leaving?
In this crisis, the European Union has proved to be an anchored, distorted and over-exposed building.
I was complaining that Romania is not capable of inventing a country project, but that the EU does not have a plan for the future.
And improvisation and threats don't help anything.
Then, what is more useful for the EU if the only advantage the Romanians enjoyed - the right to freedom of movement - could be discussed because of the wave of refugees crossing the borders as through cheese?
At some point, the war in Syria will end.
Not the crisis of migrants, though.
Over the next decades, overpopulation, poverty, climate change, resource exhaustion, etc. will push millions of desperate migrants from Asia and above all from Africa to a better life.
Such politicians, Romania is not and will never be prepared for what will follow.
7,000 euros a year to rent the Pogor Club.
Destination, in practice, imposed
The tendering procedure shall cover a period of 10 years.
After 7 years of detention, the club in the Romanian Literature Museum is offered by the Jewish Council for 10 years to be granted.
The construction has a useful area of 134 sqm, on two rough levels.
CJ accepts as a building's data destination only those of literary cafes, libraries or other cultural activities.
The building was assessed at EUR 68,300, the start value of the tender being EUR 6,830 per year, with a bid of EUR 25.
The concessionaire will have to continuously exploit the building and cover the entire cost of rehabilitation of the property, in accordance with the technical project to be completed.
"The Club Pogor building is in an advanced state of degradation due to the fact that, during the period in which the public food unit was operating in these spaces and after its evacuation, no ongoing repairs and maintenance work has been carried out as is currently required during the operation of a building", the documentation on the auction procedure is mentioned.
Deals for the club are expected until 18 September.

They're stable, as the doctors say.
EXCLUSIVE: A meeting that breaks your heart.
20 years old has received a brave gift: biological parents
Lost in a hospital in the '90s, when he had only two months of life, small, sick and helpless, and then adopted by a family established in Italy, in the same year when the adoption was a regulated wave, a young ejacian, now a blonde and beautiful girl, met each other in Iasai with biological parents from a village of the Jews, after almost two decades in which no one knew anything about others.
Crina will complete these 20 years, and her adoptive parents from Palermo thought of offering their beloved daughter a enchanting and courageous gift: a visit to Romania, Iasi, to get to know her uncertain past.
"The newspaper of Iaşi", which witnessed the efforts to search the family of origin after a few extremely vague indications, was witness to these meetings that practically break your heart.
The reporting of reporters, the emotions of the moments, the statements of those involved, their reactions are of a moving and compulsive right.
Crine's story starts 20 years ago in Ruginosa's outtown, when she was only two months old.
Then, due to a health problem, the girl had to be hospitalized in the city.
Home there began to be misunderstandings between parents, and Mother was forced to leave home.
He decided to keep the girl and send me home.
She stopped the girl, and since then I've known nothing.
"When I found out she was in the hospital, it was too late," recalls enduring Alina, the girl's biological mother.
Crina was hospitalized with her grandmother at the municipal hospital in Pascani, and still the girl's father, Costa Rica Balkan, went to work in Alexandria, Judge Teleorman.
Their lives were to be definitively divided.
They haven't found Crina at the hospital yet.
After the hospital, Crine's father went to work elsewhere, and returned six months later.
Meanwhile, the girl was transferred to the hospital in Iaşi, and the father, when he came back, never found her again.
I think it's been almost nine months since the girl was in the hospital.
"You'd think she'd been abandoned," she tells a cousin of the family.
Because of financial problems, Grandma couldn't come with Crina to Iaşi, and the girl remained in the care of the doctors.
Because no one was interested in the child's fate all the time, she was taken over by the General Directorate of Social Assistance and the Protection of the Child Iaşi, who then gave it to care for the Plasement Centre in Bucium.
It was years when abandonment and adoption were less regulated than today in Romania.
At the Bucium Centre was found by the Salvadoran Italian and his wife, a couple from Palermo who wanted to have their child but did not succeed.
They fell in love with the Crina blond, and after some time it had to move definitively with them in Italy.
The small has already been in place for almost two years, while the adoption formalities have lasted.
When I saw Crina, I felt she was our girl.
"As if my wife had given her life," says smile Salvadore, the adoptive father, while he catches the girl's bright hand in his palm.
In the country, the parents of Crine, Alina and Costa, continued separate searches, each where they could.
The father asked the authorities in Ruginosa, but he received no answer where his child could be.
The police then told him it's possible to be dead, but the parents found out what really happened to their daughter.
When I was looking for her here, they told me she was gone to Italy, to Palermo.
And conditions to look for her have never been there.
We prayed to God to be okay.
I've been thinking about her for all the years that have passed, but there's no way we can walk, find her.
"It's hard," she tells us with tears in the eyes of the organic mother of Chile.
But even though years have passed, Ruginosa's parents have not been forgotten.
In Italy, Salvador and her wife explained to the girls where she came from and that her past was a link to Romania.
I was little when I found out.
I think I was five or six years old.
I reacted like a child, I was curious.
"I wanted to meet my parents in Romania," Crina confesses with joy.
And her dream was going to come true.
In March of this year, Commissioner Ichim, Director of the Regional Centre for Prevention, Evaluation and Council of Anti-Drug Iaşi, was contacted by a knowledge from Italy, which explained Salvador's desire to find the biological family of Chile.
And the search only started with a name.
After the request we had from our partners in Italy, we started the first demos.
We're just getting a name, the Costa Rican Balkans, then the locality, Ruginosa.
In a short time, I had an activity with the primacy there, and I could ask if there was a locality named.
Then they gave me some clues, just that the person found wasn't the one they were looking for.
"It took about a month to find the girl's biological father," explains chief Romania Ichim.
In total, better than three months they took the authorities to find Costa Rica and Alina, especially that each one had the home in another location.
We started demersals somewhere in March, and in June-July we ended the identification of biological parents and discussions.
"Then we decided that a first meeting would take place in September," Romance Ichim added.
During the weekend, Alina and Costa saw for the first time the girl lost on the halls of the hospital in Iaşi, 20 years ago.
Father, excitedly, could hardly have mastered his tears, and his hands were trembling constantly.
He's barely changing a few words with the people around him.
A week before the meeting, she couldn't sleep much anymore.
He was still excited, trembling.
"To see your child after so many years, it's something," a nephew tells us, and she comes with Costica from Ruginosa.
Meeting of the Crine with Mother and the Biological Brother
In the discussions with his daughter, who is going to study at a well-listed university in Italy, Costa Rica Balkan told her, among other things, that if she ever wanted to return to him, in the village, she would come quietly: she could give him something, sheep, goats, to find a boy in the village and build a house.
Mom is also excited, she cries, and she hardly believes that something like that can happen to her.
I'm very excited.
I didn't think that could happen.
I've seen such cases on TV, I've been thinking about these years, I've hoped, but I didn't think I could be like that.
They're very big emotions.
If he could forgive me.
I hope we visit in the future.
"I hope we can keep a bond," she tells us with great tears on the faces of Alina, the mother of Crine, while holding a servet in her hand.
He's hiding his tears again, happily, because in a short time he'll see her face after so much time.
On the other hand, Crina, who will only spend a few days, this month, 20 years, tries to calm down like an emotional child.
She doesn't know what to expect, but she had a vague idea about her biological parents.
He thinks they're young, but now before the meeting he's trying to get his thoughts together, because he's got a lot to say, but nothing to say.
My parents are two mothers and two fathers.
But my parents are finally the ones who grew me up.
It'll be a nice meeting, a wonderful experience.
"I hope I have a nice memory with them, because now there are so many things to say," Crina confesses.
First family meeting in Iaşi
In the Union Square, under the sky of the beginning of the fall, the family of Ruginosa reunites its destiny with their daughter of Palermo.
Crina is 20 years old now, finishing high school, according to the Italian school model, but she can start a new chapter with Alina and Costa, her biological parents.
They don't divide borders or countries, but only a barrier: the language.
Although, with the help of a translator, an Italian local owner in the center of the Iaş, they have passed easily.
Those who have managed to make this meeting possible say it is the first event of this kind, and that, in the future, if the opportunity comes up, they will do it again.
It's the first event of this sort of organized, such an emotional charge, and I'm glad to be a success.
We, at the Centre, have different activities, and most of the time we are associated as an institution that deals only with consumers, drug-dependent people.
But we're trying to get the companies to do something good back.
"If I am still asked for such an event, I will do it very kindly," says Romica Ichim, director of the Regional Centre for Prevention, Evaluation and Drug Advisor Iași.
Behind him, the Balkan family, with Crina in the middle, withdraws the historian.
They understand: they have many to tell each other.
Armistice at the foot, yesterday, at the PSD.
Everybody shoots his soul
The plates from the PSD's exit branch have completed a weapon armistice at the foot.
After successive rounds of discussions, held from Friday to Sunday, the first being and the most tense, the PSD leaders agreed to suspend the hostilities temporarily.
Take the party's executive president Liviu Dragnea to present a united position, the outgoing social-democrats will send her an entire list of potential candidates to the party's functions.
Apart from being closed, the internal war in the party seems to have taken just a break to allow fighters to shoot their souls.
The dragon didn't give an ultimatum.
He released a very simple and very current message under the conditions of now: try to find a solution not to endanger the party.
On October 3, we have a party election.
All functions will be made available to those who want them.
"By then, we remain in the existing structure," said interim mayor Mihai Chirica.
The two days of the weekend talks have only led to the conclusion that nothing is certain.
In the October elections, there is an acute competition for the office of President of the Jewish subsidiary of the PSD.
On the short list of possibilities candidates for the main function of the party's Icelandic branch, the State Secretary Maricel Popa, Senator Florin Constantinescu, Senator Sorin Lazzar, the Jewish councillor Vasile Câtea and the interim president of the Jewish Council, Victorel Lupu.
These could also be added to the mayor of the municipality of Schitu Duca, Mihai Mihalache.
A variant taken in the calculation is also the candidacy of the leader of the Jewish councillors of the PSD, Cristian Stanciu, where Lupu will no longer be in the race, sources from the party claiming that it is not interested in function.
The only name that has not been mentioned by any of the participants in the negotiations in the last few days is the former branch leader, Mayor Gheorghe Niita.
The list of candidates is open.
In accordance with the statute, even on the day of the elections, candidates may be filed, and they would not look at anyone if that happened.
"The important thing is that we remain united, and we will remain also after 3 October, when we have a new Executive Office, a new Permanent Jewish Office and all new management structures," Câtea specified.
Until internal elections are held, the leadership of the Jewish PSD branch will be ensured by Victorel Lupu, a close to Niita and Stanciu.
Lupu, however, is in the process until 29 September, preparing the elections, in practice, to be provided by the executive secretary of the branch, Jewish adviser Mihail Popescu, located in new relations with the Nisita camp.
Phone contact, Christian Stanciu has appreciated the discussions of the last days as leading to "partial consent".
There is a wide availability to maintain balance and unity in the party.
A partial consensus was reached in order to support a unitary team to deal with the matter.
"There are, on the other hand, several variants on the nomination intentions of the PSD Presidency Iaşi, the list remaining open," said Stanciu.
An emissary judge rejected the case of the Violators in Vaslu on the grounds of concubinaj
The seven young people in Vaslui's trial convicted of rape are arriving today at the Court of Appeal.
The Vasluans sentenced to five years and eight months and eight months and four months will present their arguments on their release today, after the founding court, Vaslui, established their imprisonment immediately after the sentence was pronounced.
The file was registered at the Court of Appeal at the end of last week, Judge Dan Anton making a request for detention, accepted by his colleagues.
Anton appealed that one of the prosecutors, lawyer Bogdan Luca, is his daughter's concubine, lawyer Dana Anton.
Luca defends Silviu Ovidiu Burada, the one who received the greatest punishment in this file.
How Judges Motivated the Sense
At the end of last week, the judge of Vaslui's trial, who sentenced the seven young men, motivated the feeling.
The judge rightly speaks of the challenging reaction of the accused, but also of those who supported them, stating that such attitudes create a strong sense of indignation in the public opinion.
"The Court finds that after the imposition of preventive control, a restrictive measure of freedom but not a private measure of freedom, under the influence of the attitudes of the accused, their families and their local supporters, was felt at the local and national level a strong feeling of indignation at the fact that persons accused of serious acts are judged under a less restrictive measure," the Vaslu Judge explained in his explanation.
The magistrates also removed the main defense of the seven indictees who during the trial called out that the girl they raped would not be "the door of the church".
"The Court underlines that the moral quality of the injured person is not relevant, the aspect in which the accused wanted to highlight it through the defences they formulated, since the physical and sexual freedom of a person cannot be violated under any pretext," it further stated.
Corbyn, Brexit and the future of Europe
For economic and demographic reasons, the prosperity enjoyed in the last ten years cannot continue the same in the next few years.
Until Saturday probably a little world in Romania knew who Jeremy Corbyn was.
Even today, after he has become the new leader of the British Labour Party, many wonder how much he can affect our choice of a politician who, in turn, is not in a position of decision.
Jeremy Corbyn is the most radical left-wing leader of post-war laborers.
Marxist stated, anti-Monarchist (at a time given to Tony Blair, then Prime Minister, to expel the royal family from Buckingam Palace), a ferocious anti-American and a fellow of Vladimir Putin (it was otherwise regularly invited to comment political events by the television channel "Russia Today"), and the terrorist movements Hizbollah and Hamas, he wants Britain to abandon nuclear weapons and leave NATO and the EU.
For Corbyn, who at that time considered the killing of Osama bin Laden as a real tragedy, ISIS is almost preferable to the United States.
After the model of all the populist demos, Corbyn has, of course, miraculous anti-austerity solutions.
Things about the kind of people he was saying and promising them and Tsipras in Greece until he got to the heart of the real world and economic laws.
The economic programme of the new Labour Leader provides for, inter alia, massive renationalisation and money-type as a solution to the financing of development projects and to cover very generous social benefits.
Of course, some might wonder why the money-type solution is not unanimously adopted on a global scale, then we have a global prosperity! but who else can prevent such details.
Of course, we can pay blood to the bankers, become kind of left-handed enemies, but from what has been seen so many times in the past, not only in the former communist states or in Ecuador or Venezuela, but also in France, at the beginning of the Mitterand and Holland mandates.
The additional amounts are quickly swallowed by generous promises, without covering, made by populist demagogies.
As Margaret Thatcher drew attention, "the problem of socialism is that at a given time the other money ends."
Little chance Jeremy Corbyn ever gets the prime minister.
At the beginning of the 1980s another radical left leader, Michael Foot, who was not as extreme in conviction as the party's fresh leader, failed to vote.
And then there is still a working class in Britain, in the classical sense of the word, relatively consistent and structured.
And the unions were more influential than they are now.
Under the conditions of the new industrial landscape, where services are dominant in the labour force as a whole, and extensive automations have made the industry need for massive high-skilled labour, Corbyn's rhetoric has a limited appeal.
However, even in opposition, he can influence important developments that can directly affect us.
In its last number, the Financial Times considers Corbyn's choice to increase Brexit's chances, namely the release of the United Kingdom from the EU.
The new Labourist leader was a consistent opponent of the country's membership in the Union.
In the eyes of the radical left, Brussels is the agent of international capitalism and a promoter of globalisation that has led to the austerity of the poor.
When you combine this kind of ideas with those expressed by the radical right, with anti-immigration rhetoric, and you look at the crisis of EU-based refugees getting into an explosive mix.
And not just for the Great Britain.
However, if the British decide as a result of the referendum, which would take place by 2017, to leave the Union the loss of symbolic capital for the whole European project and the deep flaws created within this Euro crisis and now the refugees, between the North and the South, between the East and the West, leave room for the most worrying scenarios.
As much as for a whole series of Member States, London was a counterweight to the Franco-German axis (in which, however, Berlin becomes increasingly the dominant actor).
True, the British business environment, the City, is strong lawyers of the remaining countries in the EU.
But Europe today is no longer the one in the past.
There are many resentments, which grow in intensity even in these weeks.
The problem is that Brussels, I have just recently had a sample in Jean Claude Junker's speech, is increasingly tending to make major decisions over the heads of the vast majority of Member States by consulting only a few European powers, mainly with Germany.
And this happens under conditions where electoral support for anti-system formations, anti-immigration that are at the same time and Eurosceptic increases spectacularly across the continent.
In other words, the emotional climate with negative loads has reached higher rates than ever before.
From where and the conclusion that the Financial Times draws when assessing Brexit's chances.
The pro-EU option is based on a cold calculation that goes from national interest.
If voters make the brain decision, then Britain will remain in the EU.
But Corbyn's victory reminds us of the strength of emotion in the current policy.
However, Eastern Europe can be significantly affected by such major developments.
Especially if, as is expected, we will attend a more pronounced integration of the euro area, which will push most of the countries in the region and the peripherality of interest and that of the decision-making process in Europe.
Corbyn, Tsipras and Syriza in Greece, Podemos in Spain, even Bernie Sanders in the United States feed on popular rhetoric from the frustrations accumulated in Western societies.
For economic and demographic reasons, the prosperity enjoyed in the last ten years, generous social benefits, cannot continue the same in the next few years.
Under the explosive pressure of the dual crisis, the Euro-immigrant zone, both of which have been driven by decisions that have only been taken into account by integrationist political ambitions, not by the ability and availability of peoples and governments in Europe to respond to such challenges, disturbances on the continent, internal tensions in the EU will increase in intensity and may have a greater impact on Romania's situation.
And it's hard to exclude something from the point of view of possible scenarios.
The question is whether our main political leaders are able to deal with such complicated situations.
Constantine Brancousi, the country god.
Rockefeller: "How can I help you?"
Brancushi: "Take and mutilate the workshop!"
The great sculptor had a great dream: to be someone, to be famous, to hear about him all over the world.
But behind his reputation there is something almost forgotten today, when millions of successful stories have been delivered to us, written for success in life.
That thing has a name.
It's called "tru."
What about Constantine Brancusi?
What's it all about, actually?
His figure appeared on the banknote.
And recently, a famous bank in Romania hired an actor to play it in an advertising moment.
Brancushi has been producing and delivering money for almost 60 years since he's not among us anymore.
In Romania, there are hundreds of streets and boulevards that bear his name.
Otherwise, even the author of this text lives on one of these streets.
And when she comes out with her grown-up, she hears the following instructions: "We're going to the park, to Brancusi."
The country is devoured by its statutes.
There are few Romanian personalities whose works are known by so many, from children, to the elderly.
Brancuşi's infiltration capacity is a huge one.
Not even the communists managed to remove it from Romania's memory and culture.
His stories are starting the Internet today, getting hundreds of thousands of likes and shares.
And then, again, what else to say, to write about this man?
Looking at the multitude of books and articles that are trying to restore their destiny, Brancuşi's life seems almost fantastic, totally unlikely.
You know, it's those people who tell you that if you didn't have the chance to be born in a big city and in a family as well as established, your chances of success in life are almost zero.
The life of Brancuşi is the perfect example.
And maybe there would be a key here.
Maybe the next text should start from here.
With a sense, no matter how disgusting they are.
Look at the success stories critina, which are delivered daily to you in newspapers and on TV.
Look carefully at this man's figure.
Do you want to know how to manage life, how, today, of him heard an entire map world?
It's simple.
He's worked his whole life to be someone.
That's what he did.
Constantin Brancuși was born on 19 February 1876 in Hobita, a small village in the municipality of Peșșani, Judţ Gorj, on the banks of Carpathians.
It is Mary's fifth child and Radu Nicolae Brancuși.
Although he came from a family of established countrymen, Brancusi led a modest life, but one of them had to collect his repertoires that would guide his later artistic vision.
Remembering the childhood and the places he grew up, the artist had to witness, in a meeting with Petre Têtzia, from Paris, from 1933: "By then life was beautiful and harmonious."
For the millenniums, people have been leading, happy, a patriarchal life.
Everything went quiet from one time to another.
And you know why things changed?
The civilization of the great city has reached us.
Brancuşi's childhood was, however, far from an idea.
One of the moments spent in these early years of life is extremely suggestive of the combination of purity and violence that characterized the future sculptor of the years spent in the natural place.
The moment is reproduced in the work "Brancuși. A biography," written by Alexandru Buican.
In 1879, Constantine Brancusi was 3 years old.
In the fall of that year, when the bull was made "the cassant", following those who tasted the liquid to see if the process was being carried out properly, Brancusi took a moment of general negligence.
It fills the box of palm trees with corn and drinks on unsweetened leaves.
He falls asleep almost instantly.
The first people just observe in a few minutes.
Mom panics, then she's married, thinking her son is dead.
By night, when the father, Radu, returns from life accompanied by sailors, he sees from afar the desperate signs of those who await him with his soul at his mouth.
The party's turning into ice.
Dad's already thinking about burying.
However, someone finds that it's good to call Baba Branduşa, dothoroiae and servants of the Brancuşi.
The fire checks the child's breathing, then puts the horse's nose under the nose, gathered around.
The strong-strengthened child.
The world applauds.
While the boy is allowed to sleep further on the bet, for joy, the party with continuous cheerleaders and more strength.
The second day, the father and son meet through the meadow.
Radu Brancuşi puts Constantin to collect some nuts and bring them.
The father sat his child with his head down and, with the clouds brought by the boy, beat him to keep him in mind.
And, while feeling tired of hitting, little Brancuşi has the revelation that the world can be viewed from a different perspective and that things around it can appear distorted.
Especially the position of the sun, unlike the well-known one, makes him wonder, as if he had to admit to old age, if the star itself participates in his disorder.
May the sun be as troubled as his father as what happened to him?
At the current time, the city does not work
A parliamentary appeals to politicians to remind himself of those who voted.
The independent MP Viorel Blăjuț called on the PSD and PNL to stop the internal struggles and reorient the agenda to the electorate.
What we see now on our political scene is a great disunity and so on.
I haven't seen anything from the USL projects since 2012 to continue.
No highway, no Regional Emergency Hospital, you see only how politicians deal with possible locations according to real estate interests.
Let's leave the politics a little further, get together and talk.
At the current time, the city doesn't work.
"If you are busy with the internal war, you no longer have time for those who chose you," Blajut said.
He appreciated that the current political class had derailed the outgoing electorate, the consequence of being a very low presence in the future local elections, around 30%, representing practically the faithful electorate of the parties.
He also believes that the voters will always be directed towards traditional parties, expressing their reservations to new political initiatives, such as the "Pentru Iasi" party that will be launched today.
Local parties have very little chances and will only break from the right electorate, not from the PSD.
Such parties are based on civilian assets, which are usually on the right.
"It is also more right-handed, which is not good for anyone, nor for PSD," Blajut said.
He pointed out that it is not interested in a candidate for future local elections, reducing the voices about his intention to register for Primarie.
I've said I don't want to run for a local function.
I wonder if you will continue to be a Member in the future.
I tried to appeal to the unit for Iaşi and in the talks on the halls, with other parliamentarians, and I was accused of wanting to make an image of myself.
I don't want to, but we can't go on like that anymore.
"If people voted for us, it doesn't mean they're stupid to vote for us if they don't see anything," Blăjut said, who appreciated that the main reason why the electorate is no longer interested in politics is the hypocrisy of the choices.
A colleague from Tatarasi said I can't get his money and he has to go by the bus.
Let's not be hypocrites.
There's no money.
Sometimes I'm ashamed to raise the cash from the casino.
At the end of the term, I will make a report on all that I have spent, except for the salaries and maintenance of the employees of the cabinet.
It happened to rise in a month and 30,000 lei, with all transport, accommodation and other accounts.
"Let's say a parliamentman doesn't get his money is pure hypocrisy," Blajut concluded.
