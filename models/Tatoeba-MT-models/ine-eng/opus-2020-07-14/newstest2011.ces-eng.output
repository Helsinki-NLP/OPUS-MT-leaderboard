What's he doing? ČSSD in Prague doesn't know Voldemort or sugar
The new ČSSD city council will have to overcome a certain language barrier, according to everything, so that they can understand their senior ODS colleagues in the Prague Council and representation.
Dénik Aktuální.cz members of the new council of the ČSSD "explored", as they know notorically introduced slang, which occurred on the council during the last years when Prague was ruling the current coalition partners.
The coded dictionary, which was introduced by the Persian political messiah during the previous era by Prime Minister Paul Bema, describes some of the most well - known figures, situations, and causes in the metropolis.
Surprisingly, it turned out that new, well - known concepts do not understand too much.
At least they say so.
"Who's Voldemort?"
"I really don't know."
"I'm in Prague's policy rather new," responded to the "Kmotrovski's dictionary test for the culture of Lukas Kauský.
And as far as the political vet was concerned, he reacted similarly to the advice of Karel Brézin.
It's like a golf jacket.
"It's the only expression of what you're introducing to me that I sometimes use."
"I don't know any snakes in general."
From the dictionary, whose phrases the journal Currently.cz published this year in June before the ODS election congress, she selected the editors of six examples, mostly those that are notoriously associated with the Prague magistrate.
The Socialists should explain the concepts of "Voldemort", "the biggest golf jacket in Prague", "to go to the sugarcane", "bitch jokes", "the betrayal of the capital" and "beautiful".
Three of the councillors agreed, the fourth - Antonín Weinert, who is going to be head of Prague's school in the future - promised first the interview, but later he didn't take the phone.
The fifth councillor Petr Dolinek rejected the flat test.
"I don't even handle this thing and I'm not going to evaluate the way the citizens of democracy are doing."
"I am now deciding how we will understand our programmes," he responded.
As it has already been said, Councilman Lukas Kauský would not find out in the title that it is about an influential businessman and a friend of the spokesman Bém Roman Janouškova.
Voldemort doesn't say anything to him, and the only term he's had in the test is "the biggest golf jacket in Prague".
"It's Blanka's tunnel," says Kaucky, and he's just saying, "But I know it from the news."
"I'll have to pay for some language course," he jokes.
The golf course then as a tunnel Blanka's management deciphers not only Matador Karel Březin, but also works for the environment Lukas Plachý.
Both social democrats then know who is really Voldemort, and Lucas Plachém is aware of where to find this figure - the clear meaning of the expression "to go to sugar."
"That I think means going to a Prague business," is a flat-screen resolution that is about Janušk's company's seat.
In line with Brézin, he reminds us that knowledge has been replaced by news rather than by such a dictionary.
In social democracy, according to the frequency of the test, there is no similar dictionary of slang expressions.
"I was also with my colleagues, but it looks like we really don't have anything like that."
"We call ourselves names, sometimes using short names and combo names," says the President of Prague ČSSD Petr Hulinski, whose parties are renamed Hulda.
"At school they called me Bréza, but I don't know if my colleagues call me that," she admits to her own nickname, Karel Brézin.
The journal Current.cz has tried and worked out the name.
The work of Weinert is for the parties to the Grandfather or less friendly Grandfather, the representative of Miroslav Poche, who has warned himself before the elections of fraud in sponsoring the party, has in some colleagues the nickname "Game".
The nicknames are also the only thing social democrats allow in a national speech.
Hullinsky Prüd does not like to hear, but the journal Aktualno.cz also noted the other name of this Prague president.
"Doctor of the shoe law" reminds us that Petr Hulinski won his title JUDr. at the Bratislava Police Academy.
The government wants to limit the torture of "magics", issued a brochure
Women declared in Burkina Faso have several common signs.
They belong to an older generation, they cannot engage in work for example for health reasons, they are free and have no children.
The one who becomes a witch "stands" is sent to isolation to keep the rest of the village safe.
"The man of this sentence is only very rare."
"No young healthy women are sentenced because they are helping with their jobs and giving birth to children," describes a regular sister, who is aged in a special home in Burkina Faso, in the capital of West Africa, about a hundred women who have been expelled from their families.
The local government has now decided to step up against the unusual "social measures".
She published an information brochure that should help her to limit the magic spell.
He's got a hook.
"More than 70 percent of adults in Burkina Faso can't read," said Die Standard newspaper.
Blame for witchcraft is common in other African countries.
In Ghana, which is a neighbor of Burkina Faso, Amy Hemmah died two decades ago last week after three women and two men tortured her, poured oil and burned her.
The BBC server reported the case.
Pachatels claim that it was an unfortunate coincidence of circumstances.
According to their version, the woman was raised with oil used for ritual anointing.
He went back to sleep after the group wanted to get out of the woman's "extend the evil spirit".
The isolation of "magics" supports people regardless of the level of education achieved.
Dinik Der Standard quoted a twenty-four-year-old businessman from Burkina Faso: "The food of human souls has always been dangerous," he said.
While in Burkina Faso, she is trying to keep the government low, in Gambia, he was attended by the president himself last year.
"The Gambian President Jammi, after his aunt's death, spread an extensive hon to a witch who allegedly had to share in her death and try to kill the president himself by means of black magic."
"He called for help by shamans from nearby Guinea who, along with policemen, soldiers and the President's personal protections, violently drove selected men and women from the Gambian villages to the president's farm in Kanila," said Amnesty International in his report.
On the farm, people had to drink the medicine from the herbs with hallucinogenic effects, which also caused stomach and kidney problems.
Two prisoners didn't survive on the farm.
After international pressure, almost a thousand prisoners were finally released for freedom.
Bacal's tenant: Burns in stones, higher rent signed
The older subordinate man walked out of the door of the client centre of RPG Apartments "hlobarona" Zdeňka Bakaly, the largest private owner of properties in the Czech Republic.
He took care of a file and in it he carried a new lease to three apartments: his daughter and his son, who is in execution of the sentence.
All three of them just got a discount.
Instead of 3500 a month, the son will pay for apartment 2+1 second category 4100 crowns from next year.
"And it is not hot water there and it has to melt with a petram (stone on a thick fuel, late red)," shows a man's finger in his new contract, whose signature has full power.
"But I signed it," explains half angry and half disfigured.
BytyOKD.cz, which marked the new lease terms as "incorrigible and uneven", advises tenants not to sign a new contract and wait until December 7th, when the public instructions on how to deal with it.
But a man has a hand over it.
"One says it, the other says it," he goes dark.
The island is becoming a major deregulation laboratory.
After New Year, a large majority of apartments in the Czech Republic are waiting for non-market rent.
Currently.cz has therefore decided to visit the "laboratory" personally.
The Haviřovska waiter RPG is one of four in Ostrava and is already full on Tuesday morning.
The security guard and the alarm system shall be immediately at the door.
"Lost 2011", lights a special button on his touch screen.
One shot and a piece of paper out of the machine with a number.
You don't even read "157" and your number is already on the big screen under the roof of the waiting room.
In half a second, you're in line.
After a while, an older couple comes to ask, but new rents are obviously not involved in the waiter.
Most people have come to solve common problems such as other problems - recovery requests, insurance events, and so on.
Letters with new rental contracts are available in Ostrava in postal boxes to most tenants with a total of 44 thousand RPG portfolio apartments almost from mid-November.
The RPG Apartments in their letters suggest an increase of between 15 and 38 per cent.
Special transfer to new rentals was opened at the customer centre on 18 November.
"It's going through the week, so it's just in the race," the workers respond to the shift after the moment of movement when the client presents himself as a journalist.
Deregulation and Bakal's former mountain apartments are local exciting themes.
Before the elections, he was quite elated by the vice-president of parliament and the island's cousin Lubomír Zaorálek from the ČSSD, and now the local newspapers are full of him.
"Twenty years after them, I want a new floor."
"No post...and the board in the toilet didn't change," the man mentioned at the outset said.
For the most part, according to the employees, the graduates come to see if they can get a discount from the rent if they sign in time how RPG promises them in a special offer.
A half-way discount for the February rent will also be received by other tenants who will sign the new contract by December 15.
Haver's "deregulation" switch, but the questions are definitely not paid.
"Out of the 360 customers last night for the 2011 rent, only about forty to fifty people were there," said the workshop behind the checkout.
At the same time, RPG on the web and its walls proposes an individual meeting of contracts where it will be needed.
However, if both parties disagree on rent, it will have to be determined by an independent court.
"It is not a threat, but information about the only possible and entirely legitimate legal procedure," the RPG points out on its pages.
"No one will be judged here," one of RPG Byty's employees thinks, and a man on the street in front of the client center gives her part of the truth.
"I've got $13,000 and I have five thousand left for food, I don't have to judge," they say.
But the employee's going to be ruined.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaoralek tells them in the media not to sign, so people may be waiting," he says.
The rental regulation ends in most of the Czech Republic with the New Year 2011 and according to RPG Byty, it is an economic necessity to increase it.
"The current rent is still not enough for the simple maintenance of the housing fund," recalls Pavel Klimesh, director of the RPG Byty residence portfolio, that the very angered tenant of the housing fund is, according to homeowners, the main reason for the increase in rent.
During the five years between 2005 and 2010, RPGs could invest in flats of four billion, in four years from 2011 to 2014, this is to be 5.2 billion.
A large screen that hangs at the ceiling opposite the pulsated slabs of the HVC has so far repeated a number of redly highlighted information.
"The increase in rent in 2011 is 15% and less for 31 200 flats, which is more than 90% of RPG flats."
"And it'll always be more than 7.50 CZ in a square and a month," appears on the screen.
Only 400 flats from the RPG portfolio will be rented by 38 percent.
"In these cases, it is an increase of an extremely low amount of 19,66 CZK per square metre," RPG points out.
In 2,600 apartments, the same rent will remain next year.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation will not pay off the rent in shock, but will be spread to four to eight years.
In addition, it adds another commitment: all the money from the increase in rent (see graph) gives the company back to the apartments, mainly to the heat savings - new windows and heating.
First, they're supposed to get people who sign an agreement to increase their rents.
There's a school in the office, they understand the architects.
The administrative building Avriopoint in Brno is the new residence of Arch.Design.
No one would expect him to also hide a mini-girl with everything that belongs to it - with colorful walls, ideal furniture, to buy toys and even a mini-game on the outdoor terrace.
Since October last year, children of Arch.Design employees have been able to visit her.
Arch.Design, from which workshops took up a number of significant brunni buildings, calculated with space for its company miniskirt since the first drawings of the building of Avriopoint.
It employs almost 90 people mostly at the age of babyboom and is concerned that women designers and architects can return to work quickly.
Together with the possibilities of short-term contributions, Arch.Design offers its employees benefits under the social programme.
Buildings and architects thus have the opportunity to lock up a demanding job with child care.
The Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, with the support of their leadership, has been able to obtain assistance from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The firm is financed by the European Social Fund through the Operational Programme for Human Resources and Employment and the State budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to grant funding (a grant of CZK 2.8 million), they were able to buy equipment and equipment and provide qualified staff and operations for two years.
After spending the financial contribution (2 years) Arch.Design has an obligation to operate a mini-girl for 3 years at its own expense.
The preparation of the project lasted one year, and with a request for a grant, Economy Rating helped significantly.
In addition to providing qualified staff, a nurse and a teacher of MSS care about children all day long, children can go to school without age limits, although most of them are older than 3 years old.
Because it's about a mini-school, there can be only 5 children at the time, but it's getting more out of them during the day.
School management is flexible according to the needs of parents and the children of all employees have the same right to use the school regardless of the hierarchy of their position in the company.
Although it is about individual education and care, the programme content in the mini-school is comparable to the framework programme for pre-school education.
Children are not only playing here, but they are also provided with quality education - from basic knowledge until after preparation for school courses, English is also taught.
The class is equipped not only with toys, exciting games, but also a computer that children can use.
The presence of young children directly in the company creates a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can control their child at any time, and the stress situation with the delay of raising children from schools away from their parents ’ workplace.
Parents use their working time more productively.
It is no wonder that a loyal relationship between an employee and an employee is created here.
Arch.Design thus classified itself to Czech companies that offer significant benefits when recruiting new employees, are friendly to the family and through this program has strengthened personal marketing.
The house from the bone also fascinates after 100 years. Look at the interiors from Gaudí
The roof looks like a backyard of the ancient estuary, the cemetery reminds five dinosaurs and the balconies are open fish mouth.
This is the house of Casa Batlló in Barcelona from Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí.
From the locals, thanks to his organic shapes, he earned a name for the House from the bones.
Organic shapes, wild colours, unusual use of stone, pieces of tiles and mosaics, a facade of memorial pillars and all-like soft curves, all typical for Antoni Gaudí's secession.
The surroundings of the house play dream lines, gentle colors and textures that remind nature and animals.
In detail, it is possible to see geometry, rhythm, and the exact order of thought.
In the night, the whole facade of the house sounds even more dramatic, it is illuminated so that the touch of white colors is even strengthened.
The guilt and cracking of shapes appears in the same measure in interiors.
The wood in the waves is copied by any frame, a locker, similar elements of the door, a hammer, and leaves.
The house of Batlló, located in the Eixample district on the Russian shopping street Passeig de Gràcia nr. 43, was built a house from 1877 by architect Emilio Sala Cortese.
The reconstruction took two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, wealthy industrialist Josep Batlló, originally insisted on demolishing the old building and building a whole new one, but soon he adopted Gaudí’s idea of unusual and cheaper reconstruction.
The kitchen house of Casa Batlló, but Antoni Gaudí didn't propose it on his own.
The architect Josep Maria Jujol cooperated with him.
Just on its design plot, decorations were created for the property owner's representative apartment and the use of mosaics on the facade.
A number of other designers and artists were working on the façade.
The joint work on the proposals at Casa Batlló's house began a successful cooperation with Jujola Gaudí.
Jujol participated in the building of Gaudi's house Casa Mila and park Güell, where there are other Gaudi's works.
From the locals, after finishing, he earned his organic form a name called "The House of Bones".
Others called him "a living house" because of the specific mechanism of opening windows.
It is also said that at the top of the building there is a match of St. Jir's sword, patron of Catalan.
Hidden religious motifs also contain other sympathetic elements of the building.
Gaudí has designed a unique central heating system with industrial channels and typical fireplaces for his own time.
The Bizarni can look like their forty-five degrees.
At the time of Gaudí’s creation, he absolutely did not respect the building regulations and did not allow them to be bound.
At the beginning of the building, however, the construction permits were obtained from the city, but the data on the planned reconstruction were so important that two years later the city council was threatened and asked for repairs.
For example, the advice was that the building also had pillars in place in the public hall.
There has never been a repair, on the contrary: only fifteen days after the city's call, Joseph Batlló requested (and successfully obtained) permission to rent two of the tallest buildings.
The owner himself moved to the lower floors.
In the gallery on the second floor there was a social living room and on the third floor of the bedroom and private part of the apartment.
The property was rented to the mining industry.
The whole six-storey house is an open space that can be reached on the very roof terrace.
The essential elements of the reconstruction were the abolition of all right angles and direct lines and their replacement by curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with the modern concept of space communication.
The social part can be connected to the opening of the hall doors and the larger company can communicate comfortably together without at the same time maintaining the privacy necessary for more intimate conversations.
The house with Gaudí’s reconstruction also received a two-storey non-radical shake-up in addition to the new facades.
The Gaudí's game also works with light, blue and white musicd puzzles, which are covered in the inner courtyard, and lights.
The game of two colors adds maximum light in all patterns of the house.
It was easy to put on the principle that the white reflects the light more than the dark that the sun's paprika instead absorbs.
The House of Casa Batlló, which was included in the UNESCO World Heritage Fund in 2005, can be visited by anyone.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and most affordable apartment available to the public.
In 2002, the owners decided to celebrate a hundredth anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
The survey was conducted because they found it to be a very beneficial business and, in addition, they expanded the survey into common and basement spaces, including roof terraces.
The entry into the memory is definitely not negligible, making 16.50 euros and students, graduates, groups and tourist guides have a 20% discount.
The sum is significantly higher than the price of entry into other Gaudi buildings in the city.
If you want to taste the right atmosphere of the house with dragon wigs, you need to quickly compare with one of the inhabitants of the kitchen and visit it directly at home.
How to Choose Matrices and Growth: Women Have Needs Other Than Men
Never a horrific bed frame, but the quality of the bed area, that is, the mattresses and the growth, give the basis for a really good bed.
However, they must be harmoniously supplemented in order to qualify for a specific user.
In the selection, he decides a lot of things, from weight, height, age, health status and gender of the owner.
Also important is the type of interior to which mattresses and growth are arranged.
A typical example?
Maybe the weekend champs, where they don't regularly melt, are not suitable latex mattresses, because they're slowly "heating".
In addition, they have significantly higher weight than standard polyurethane mattresses.
It is necessary, then, to turn regularly.
If they don't have a lot of ventilating channels in the core, and they're still lying on a solid desktop, they're keeping moisture: they could also be exposed to dust.
It also decides on habits when choosing.
Those who have spent a longer time abroad, often using a very high mattress with a softening layer, will find it difficult to feel good on a low and hard surface.
"Maybe all the hockeyers who came back from the NHL complained that they didn't sleep here."
"On their determined shoulders, legs and sides, they needed mattresses that would soften the layer of linen. "
"These are also recommended for people with diabetes who have a disorder of the nervous system, so they misbehave "information" from the hips and the skin," explains Sylva Hadamskiková, who specializes in the sophisticated furniture.
A lot of hockey players, but also other customers, so, years ago, she had a high-five-line matration.
"Today it's all right, a suitable mattress like Tempur, Italian Magniflex, but also Czech Tropico."
You don't have to be a NHL fighter to assess the penis line.
This "wonder" works easily.
Optimizes your fat and shape according to absorbed heat or adapts to your warm body.
Nothing's gonna make you feel better, you're not gonna turn back in the night like you're having a hard fight.
You just get better sleep.
The line of foam also serves as a protection against spills.
When choosing the size of the mattress to your height, add a length of feet, which is about 21 to 34 cm.
Men and women with a height of 180 cm need a bed of 210 to 220 cm.
The minimum width for one should be 90 cm in double, then 180 cm in total.
In single beds, for example in single beds, at least 120 to 140 cm is recommended.
For a comfortable and possible visit.
"In any case, it is a rule for the spread of the bed simple: when lying on the back you should have your hands gently pushed in the back," says Ing. Helena Prokopová, a specialist at Cechu of craftsmen and decorators, who has been devoted to the problem of healthy sleep and the ergonomics of the furniture for a number of years and is teaching it at professional schools.
In a double bed, you need each of your own vegetables and mattresses, but here's attention when shopping to sweeten the heights of the mattresses.
Otherwise nothing else will be more than mounting the growth to different heights, but you must not be able to do it at every frame of bed.
The foam mattresses should have a height of at least 14 cm, types with a spring rib of at least 15, of which at least three centimeters should be calculated on the design and heating level.
"If you touch your hand or reach the mattress, you certainly don't have the opportunity to feel," warns Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a certain type of barbecue.
The whole bed, when the mattresses and the floor are like grown Siamese twins, don't have anything to do in the bedrooms.
The mattresses are in a bad mood, they can't clean up their tracks, which is already common today.
And because at night we usually go 0.2 to 0.75 l of pot, it is clear that after five to seven years of matration, one large (and taped) network begins to be remembered.
This is why experts reject advertising slogans on life of up to 25 years or even life assurances.
But everything has its own.
Therefore, the advice from the practice of the sellers: do not give up a removable spring in the case of mattresses with a width of 120 or 140 cm of hygiene and work, but rather add a mattress protector, which you can easily take and wash.
Even though today the mattresses are usually produced throughout the district, so after the opening we get two parts (for washing and the size of the washing machine very important!), however, manipulation in larger types (and in one person) could be a reminder of the struggle of light weight in the ring with difficulty.
Do you have a solid board in your bed instead of a rose?
Never!
Maximum on the bed for one night's visits.
However, measure the plate (if no longer available) with the vents and use the mattresses with the spring rib and height at least 15 cm with the forks in the bags (with it.Taschenfederkern) and the boiling layer.
Polyurethane mattresses don't belong to such a base.
On non-alloyed blades, 14 to 18 blades will be suitable latex or sandwich mattresses (needs a combination of latex and coconut), but you will always be paid the vegetable with a larger number of blades, 28 and more, where the blades are in the area of ber divided and it is possible to regulate their density.
There are no matrices with a spring rib, because they do not respond to the landing.
In addition to the setting of the house, the so-called shoulder dome can be reached.
It's a special capture of the blades that allow you to push, or even bend the blade so that the shoulder will burn well "forget".
For men who have "a shoulder across the back", it's definitely important.
It is even remembered by the matrices producers who in the "Spanish" began to use the softening zone just in the shoulder area.
Women are also reminded of - they are again welcoming the soft surface in the hives.
For the most demanding customers, it is intended to grow wingsel or fibrous plants with so-called multitorous pears.
The pressure breaks down to more points and reduces tension.
However, as soon as you use the right mattress and grow the wrong pillow (large and "enriched"), most "plus" disappears.
The basic rule is simple: the pillow is to support the head and the tip only to the shoulders so that the shoulder muscles can be released.
A suitable size is recommended 50 x 60 cm, which they prefer in Scandinavia, for example.
When lying on the side, the pillow should equal the height of the shoulder (with a shoulder joint or a curved area in the mattress).
Modern mattresses have only something in common with original strawberries filled with grass.
Their producers are increasingly using natural materials or at least a mixture.
The trend was just at the prom.
Raw oils from which polyurethane foams are produced are replaced by natural oils, such as poppy and soybean.
They're just using the soybeans as well as all known manufacturers.
"Many of the mattresses mean that the core is made of material of pure natural origin," explains Petr Vasiček from Tropico Plus.
Natural substances are also used in the manufacture of mattresses, one of the first was aloe vera.
But you can also enjoy the microcaps to relax your fresh scent of wood or ivory.
There's also a division for men and women.
While a man "lucks" a plant extract from the belly to absorb the mattress's moisture and cool the body, women instead of the "top".
The red pepper extract increases blood circulation, so the lower sex is warmer.
Today's favorites?
Matrix made from cold foam (has larger pores with damaged cell structure, is so much more flexible than ordinary polyurethane and offers better elasticity.
The combination of various thick, cold, and "lying" feathers creates multi-zonal mattresses that know exactly where to be head, beads and ducks.
You'll pay for quality mattresses from seven thousand crowns and higher.
Those who fulfil the health parameters have a lower VAT rate, are taken as health aid.
As the first to reach this advantage of Gumotex in the Czech Republic.
It's not easy to walk on mattresses and barbecues.
Sometimes the action of producers or sellers who offer two mattresses at one price can be used.
The Magniflex brand offers Duofreze mattresses with all memory money memory in the drive for 11,990 crowns.
The other one can be arranged free of charge.
The Eru line or viscoeltic foam with an open cell structure and high density started with the "cosmic" tempur material pace.
He was originally raised as a material for NASA, because at the beginning the astronauts were exposed to a huge overload.
The temperature in the heat softens, the cold gets stronger.
The warm human body is thus perfectly adapted and distributed optimally.
This is why it is ideal against the emergence of parachutes, but also to increase the comfort of sleeping.
Viscolastic foams are used not only for mattresses, but also for health products, such as special pillows under the feet that stretch the legs and the liver system.
For example, domestic producers use Eucatherm C or Twinsaver pen and so on.
People's tracking devices want more parents, so they want their children to be cared for.
Fear of your own child leads more and more people to the idea of watching over GPS.
The system originally designed to search for cars can also monitor the movement of people, thus helping in cases such as the disappearance of the nine - year - old Anička Janatkové.
The device is now about as big as a box of cheese, soon but it can only be large as hours.
A number of people scared the missing Anichka case and began asking for ways to protect their children better.
And for the price of breaking their privacy.
"We're trying to tell everyone that it's not about any spying, but about another means of reducing the likelihood that some tragedy will happen," says Petr Pilin of Macro Weil, who is one of the suppliers of monitoring equipment in the Czech market.
"I admit that in a certain case, the abuse of such devices may occur, perhaps when someone who does not know about it is admitted to the bag, but we have not met with such a case."
"Most people actually buy it for security reasons," Pilin added.
According to him, the child should always know the purpose of the "box" and how it is used in case of need.
The child psychologist Dana Bočkova points out that if a child doesn't want to wear anything like that, he's just gonna get rid of it.
"And very young children show great creativity in how some things are allowed to lose if they don't want to be under control."
"A lot of expectations have been raised earlier in mobile parents, but they can turn off the same thing as this monitoring device," Bočová says.
It also argues that in the event of an attack such a device would really help.
"When it comes to a ready-to-be kidnapping, the perpetrator will practically always ensure that the child has no electronics to produce his position."
"Now it's the phone."
"When the tracking devices start to expand, they will also be looking for them, because their sale will certainly be supported by massive advertising."
"In such a case, criminals will always step forward before the police," says the psychologist.
However, it is acceptable that a similar device may help in the event of an undetected pedophile attack.
According to Robert Czech of RC Monitoring, which offers monitoring services for both cars and persons, and in the event of an attack on the immediate destruction of the tracking device, its presence may help.
"The device may be set to the regular dispatch of the position after a certain period of time."
"If the damage occurs, at least the last position of the person concerned will be available."
"Dearer devices have built and cloned meters, so even if a man just slammed and remained in a state of emergency, the device will be issued immediately warning with the appearance of the position," the Czech said.
According to him, a similar service can also take smart mobile phones with navigation, where it is enough to record special software.
The problem of current monitoring units is that it is either a device similar to the size of a box of cheese or smaller mobile phones.
They're always so in danger of losing them.
According to Pilina of Macro Weil, therefore, the device is now being tested as a regular digital clock.
"It will have the greatest advantage that a possible aggressor does not have to know the tracking device at all."
"Or she's known after a while and she can give the police more time," she adds.
Whether the monitoring equipment is developed in the arms or trailers, they will continue to use the same technology used to monitor vehicles.
It is a combination of GPS location (using normal autonavigation) and mobile phone function, which reports the current position of the vehicle.
The army has a fire-fighting snout to wrap the Czech Republic. But it will last only two years.
The Czech army has purchased 445 kilometers of snow that fire the trucks.
Last year, however, the Ministry of Defence added 224 kilometres of snow to the funds.
The army's got 225-year-old resources.
The problem is that the length of the snow is two, up to four years.
The army has bought fires from the STV Group, a.s. for 40 million crowns.
The general staff for reasons of purchasing such a huge amount of MF DNEs fires said that soldiers in training consume 60 kilometres of fires per year.
However, it appears from the military pyrotechnics' proposals, which MF DNES spoke of, that then, with a very intensive pyrotechnic training, all generals, officers of the army, secretaries or cleaners would have to go through each year.
Minister of Defence Alexandra Vondra and Army Commander Vlastil Picka is not exempt.
That's the only reason why the army's annual consumption would be 60 kilometers away.
This length corresponds to 25 thousand explosions.
And even if that were true, the army's resources would last for more than ten years.
If, on the contrary, it would be paid that the basic training of each new professional is only about two metres of fire-fighting sensors, as experts say, the army has provided fresh purchases - both with increased consumption of female or special units - resources for the above 225 years.
The troops of the rapid deployment brigade have recently personally complained to Minister Vondro that they do not have nearly any weapons at hand, so shootings for the need for money are also limited.
Don't talk about lack of underwear.
"It doesn't take my head to buy from us so much fires again."
"But it's their decision and they certainly know what they're going to do."
"The army is a good customer for us, whose businessmen we are trying to deliver," says the business manager STV Group Jan Děcký.
The Jan Pejšek Defence Ministry of Defence argues that hundreds of kilometres of purchased snorkels and that the army will have the resources of this "munique" for at least ten years.
Jan Děcký from STV Group, however, speaks only about the four-year life of the camp and police or military pyrotechnics for only two years.
"To perfect storage, it can be the four," says one of them, who, as a soldier, does not want to publish the name because of the criticism of the army.
After life has passed, each ammunition must be carefully tested to see if it is still reliable and does not threaten the soldiers to live.
However, these tests are not free and there is another money.
Another argument of the Ministry is a multi-stakeholder discount of 445 kilometers of fires.
"We were made by sixty percent less than the last delivery of two hundred forty-four kilometers," says Pejšek spokesperson of the Ministry of Defence Procurement.
For comparison only: the annual consumption of firefighting squads of police pyrotechnics, which liquidate ammunition from World War II or after the Soviet army, does not exceed a few years of 1,500 metres.
And the police are always ordering only so much that they can use this ammo before they die.
It has been certified for the safety of pyrotechnics, and can also obtain more modern and therefore more reliable types of pine.
The Ministry of Defence already faces significant difficulties with the liquidation of the tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the time of the Warsaw Treaty, when the two-setsets Czechoslovak army was preparing to move to Rýn.
According to the Czech pyrotechnics that MF DNES spoke of, it is waiting for a few years for the tennis problem: it will eliminate hundreds of kilometers of old fires that today "canino" buys.
So far, I'm running out of contacts that I've got through the competition.
The winner's place in the race The year's winner helped Lucas Pytloun sell his hotel's French.
The winner of last year's competition The Year's winner became the eighteen-year-old businessman Lukas Pytloun of Liberce.
His story of success is like a movie.
Lucas Pytloun loved traveling.
And abroad, he realized that Liberca lacks quality accommodation at a reasonable price.
He bought a five-bed house with a bank loan from a foreign brigade.
Because he was still a third-year-old high school student at the time, it was a great encouragement.
"The closer the relationship between quality and the price of accommodation with us, I didn't want to try to do anything about it," says Lukas Pytloun.
The first reconstructed apartment started renting to foreign workers.
All the profits invested back into the house, which gradually turned into a pension with 54 beds.
Since then, he has been able to open four guesthouses, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with total capacity over 300 beds in all categories of accommodation.
The most comfortable of them was the recently four-star Pytloun design hotel.
But this year, he's got another, same quality.
"We just have a signed agreement with a hotel in Ostrovo in Tís, where we sold our French concept and other interested parties about Pytloun hotels are reporting," says a last-minute nurse number one.
"And for this sale, the license to operate the hotel was very much divided by the victory in the Year's Animal Competition," Pytloun admits.
The victory brought him greater knowledge and popularity in Liberia and the surrounding area.
"People knew me on the streets, often even more gratifying, and I have to say that it was nice," he recalls.
Participation in the competition is definitely recommended for all who are trying to do something.
It's not even necessary to win. Every sight is good.
He says he's been running out of contacts and know-how to this day, which he might not be able to reach otherwise.
"With some that I met because of the competition, I started to trade regularly."
The glory associated with success, according to him, has reached a little of every employee.
And he's got about seventy of them.
"I see greater loyalty and pride in them to share in something that has gained universal recognition."
"It's not far from my personal success, it's the result of good work for all of us together."
"Only my name is cast forward," said the modest Lukas Pytloun today.
I wish my successor a more peaceful year than we had in the Farm.
The Euphoria of the victory quickly triggered the impact of the crisis.
Thanks to the goal of the winner, however, Farm has worse times than he has.
For the price for the first place in the last year's Vodafone Company came to the owner of Farmet, Karel Ždárský, last year's competition in Slovenia.
At that time, the jury assessed the efforts it had made to build from a small tool shop in the Czech Skalica firm with stamilion facilities.
"I can say that the appreciation has not only stimulated me, but all my colleagues and increased our self-consciousness for the competition struggle," the last winner says today.
At the beginning of the history of Farmet, there was a desire to do something useful.
And so when the state offered the father of Karl Jjárska to rent a small workshop as compensation for the communists' entertainment property, he had a long time lost his career in the company where he worked, and with a couple of friends around his father put the company on plastic baths.
Soon they began specializing in the leaves of the plant oil.
After eighteen years, they became the largest manufacturers of automatic foxes in Central Europe.
The company also gained greater awareness amongst the unsolicited public after success in the competition through the media.
"Not only did our customers start taking the Farm brand significantly better, but foreign partners also began to appreciate that they are cooperating with a company that has achieved greater success in their country," says Karel Jjárský.
Last year, however, he wasn't in the Farm just for the euphoria of victory.
The assessment was based on the company's economic performance until 2008 and only partially since 2009.
And in 2009, it was the hardest year for the sale of machinery goods.
A crisis that has not yet affected citizens, but companies have already halted their investment projects and have begun to limit the purchase of new machinery and technology.
"Of course, this situation didn't escape us."
"The markets fell by 40%, we had to limit production and there was also a release," explains Karel Jjárský.
A viable company must sometimes also take such non-popular measures.
But things got better, and they kept the company in profit, even if I was less than before the crisis.
However, what they have not seen in the Farm is investment in research and development.
"We built research and training centres with grants, strengthened presentations at international fairs, won major awards at home exhibitions," says Jjárský.
They all point out that the crisis is behind them.
Markets are growing again and with them the number of new employees.
"I wish the new winner a pleasant feeling of victory, but in a calmer atmosphere," says Karel Jjárský.
A questionnaire that removes foolish rules
The Absurdit survey of the year is a large part of the corporate curse.
Some unwise rules have already failed.
The unprovoked winner of the next year's Absurdita year survey has become an obligation to wear to the office documents which are also available to officials online.
It has decided more than a third of the four thousand votes in favour.
For example, the management of social security required a paper release from the trade register, even if the official could obtain it by two mouse clicks.
Thanks to the questionnaire, it's gonna change.
"The Czech Social Security Administration will no longer require the release from the trade register in checks on the insurer's payers," ČSSZ spokesperson Jana Buranová said.
To focus on all the regulations and regulations that companies and entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic have to comply with, and you foolishly cancel them with the meaning of the Absurdit competition of the year.
This is already a large part of the corporate curse organised by the Economic News, and among the public there is an ever-increasing pattern.
If the vote was held by about three thousand voters, four thousand of them were silent this year.
And there's no wonder, there's a lot of legal obligations that serve just to keep the business going.
"It is possible that we are at the world's leading tax base in the number of posters," notes Karel Havlíček of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Feeders of the Czech Republic.
Simplification of business has become the goal of all governments in recent years.
In comparison with the world, however, the situation in the Czech Republic is not improving in any way.
According to the World Bank, from the point of view of the conditions of business, the Czech Republic was 74th, that is about eight places worse than last year.
The Absurdita year competition was first announced in 2006 and takes place annually according to the same scenario.
Any person may apply administrative and bureaucratic misconceptions from April to the end of September each year at the end of the competition.
The website of www.firmroku.cz Then the competition editor selects seven candidates for the "antique" and will allow the public to vote on it during October on the websites www.firmroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
The absurdity that gets the most votes of the winner.
More than a hundred, more than 105 regulations and regulations have been applied to the survey this year.
The guys sent businessmen, but also professional ties and journalists.
Among the "finalists" competitions are thus between the nominated seats, for example, a requirement for vehicles to maintain roads and fast roads to pay bribes, or for businessmen with twenty employees, two offices and two toilets to be painted every two years.
The list of seven proposals this year is published on the competition pages.
The declaration of competition, which is always held at the beginning of November at the Václav Square in Prague, is part of a campaign that regularly participates in political and social life.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodová, director of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic or Petr Kužel, president of the Chamber of Commerce of the Czech Republic, assisted this competition.
"The economic prosperity can't work where the state throws businesses under foot, so it's my goal to cancel every year at least three dozens of paragraphs that are only too complicated today," said the Minister of Industry and Commerce Martin Kocourek.
The attempt to break an unwise regulation is not an empty one.
In 2007, most people managed to report to the operator three days in advance of the Agency in a place where the permanent operating site is located, the intention is to go with the exhibition station or tower.
This obligation was removed by a new legislation on nutrition.
The second most voting obligation in 2007, which was declared by the Labour Office for its foreign staff of up to 30 days, was removed by the Green Card Act.
And to a third of everything good.
The 2009 absurdity of the physiotherapists has become a major mirror, ice cream and two inflatable weights.
This was reduced by the Ministry of Health this year - the obligation to have a refrigerator.
The new category assesses the social responsibility companies
Assessment of ecological, humanitarian, educational or sports projects.
This year’s fifth year of competition for Economic News is a category called the Responsible Company in 2010.
I am sending this competition to support a reasonable and fair business.
"This is how we want to support companies that take into account the environmental impact of their business and support social responsible activities," says Patrick Bartholdy, regional manager of the mobile operator, Vodafone, who is the declarer and guarantor of the competition as well as in the case of a year's rebellion competition.
This special subcategory of Vodafone’s main competition was registered to this year’s first year in 2010 by companies for which there is no success in undertaking the only long-term objective.
The story of each of them is very inspiring and would be published in a separate article.
Although one of the other diametrically different activities is the subject of its activities, the support and consideration of the common denominators of their efforts can be considered.
In one case, for example, people with disabilities and other needs of personal problems or the health of their own employees are concerned.
For example, among the fourteen finalists of the whole Republic, the Czech software company Et Netera, which supports the creation of informal sports teams among employees, who then participate in a number of tournaments in various sports.
Another example of a responsible company in the Pardubic region is the company Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main contributor of the donation fund to the handicapped child for seventeen years.
About his health-related employee, the old paper from Poděbrad, which has more than 70 per cent of them, has therefore been awarded the title of the Central Bank and in the Vodafone Company competition this year has been placed in the country as a third.
In Olomouk, Miryz Soft, an accountant, who has established a flexible working time, also reduced to an average of 35 hours a week, but without a reasonably reduced salary.
Its title was also granted by the Court for its prior purchase from Czech producers, for public activities in the vicinity and for the environment.
"We are trying to recycle as much as possible so that our businesses and our administration have the least impact on the environment," explains Dr. Milosz Ryznarová.
The responsible IT Enlogit company in Ústeký Ústeký re-thinks the health of its employees and has arranged ergonomic chairs and keyboards for each notebook, supports their work from home and uses the catering services provided by locally protected workers in their business activities.
"In addition, we support the donation of a man in distress, who helps specifically the local Roma community," says the representative of Ondřij Suhý.
In the last row, there is also a reference to the activity of the Clean and Cleanup company in the Karlovar region, which contributes to their employees' pension insurance in the form of a standard bonus.
"We also make contributions to food, transport, qualification and recreation," says Josef Strapáč from the bruntal construction company Czasch, the winner of Moravskoslez region.
The responsible company of the year was automatically registered by all the national finalists of the Vodafone company of the year who answered the questions of the questionnaire attached to the application and sent it by 15 August at the latest.
The incorrect or incomplete answers in the questionnaire were then excluded from the evaluation.
"If the representatives of the competing companies did not answer the questions, the competitions were unable to participate The responsible company for the year, but were not disqualified from the "main" competition of the Vodafone company for the year."
"It is not possible to register in this competition as it is a subcategory of the main competition Company year," explains Karel Goldman of the Bison & Rose editorial agency.
At the Land Fund in Plzni police arrested in public competition
In the building of the Land Fund in Plz, anti-corruption police were arrested in the last days.
The railway detectives assaulted the local businessman in the media and the businessmen with the realities of Luboši G.
He allegedly tried to manipulate the current public competition to settle the refund claims in such a way that the ground offered in the competition would be of particular interest.
That's what Luboshi G. was supposed to pay half a million crowns for.
"I can only confirm that the police are bringing one person to the scene in public procurement and in public competition," said Plenary State Secretary Antonie Zelena, saying that further details with regard to the ongoing investigation cannot be provided.
Forty-four-year-old police officers were released after 24 hours.
The way in which public competition could have affected can only be speculated on the basis of the minimum official information.
The spokesperson of the Land Fund Lubomír Montenegro stated on the question of the Law that at a separate workplace in Plšni the police were actually arrested, and that during the public competition.
"It was a client, not our employee," she explained.
The public competition is entitled "The call for the transfer of land claims under the Land Act" and takes place where more eligible applicants are interested in the land offered.
"These persons in the context of the challenge offer a higher value of their refund claims to be settled by transfer than the declared value of the land."
"According to the orders offered, the order of the buyers and the Land Fund will then transfer the land to the person who offered the highest claims," the speaker explained to the fund.
Orboš G. apparently had information about the person who submitted to the challenge, and because he was also a legitimate person, because he had collected a number of refund orders, he offered the interested party the ground that the competition was not involved.
That's why he's incarcerated the distance.
That would explain that he had so much money to keep.
Luboš G. had over-standard PF contacts in Plz in the past.
He was in charge of former Chief PF Václav Sankot, who was criminally charged with issuing in the replacement refund of the land on which a decision to place the building had already been issued.
At that time, Luboš G. obtained land from the fund, for example, for the construction of public communications, specifically in the place where the arrival magistrates were to be built into the industrial zone of the Borská field.
Later, he changed it very well with the magistrate behind the house in the historical centre of the city, which had much higher value.
Then she had to join the council because otherwise, by blocking the land, the building would be in danger.
Households to be paid a hundred per month
Households will have to be paid not only for all kinds of energy, but also for water and livestock, hot supplies and some kind of growth and rent.
The families will have to draw from the cash to hundreds of crowns a month more than now.
Electricity saves up to 4.6 percent, gas will be about 2 percent higher, while in some cities, you will have to pay for water supplies, and many times the supply of central heat.
The heating of the electricity should be carried out annually by households in the apartments of the steel wire than now.
The price of the power plants was reduced by all the main suppliers, so there is a significant increase in energy production support from renewable sources, in particular photovoltaics.
The floods, however, are a bit of a waste of time when people are the most burned and have the highest consumption.
Each year, then, it also has to be counted with hundreds of crowns.
While electricity and gas are rising throughout the Republic, changes in central heating prices vary from place to place.
The increase in prices is mainly planned by the larger municipalities.
For example, the House in Pardubice or Hradci Krālová will pay from January for the central heating of about 50 crowns per month, more than 1000 crowns per year will pay the family in Liberca.
The people of Prague are again threatened to lose more than 9 per cent of their water and livestock, in case the city increases the rent from the infrastructure.
If the rental does not change, the Forest will pay 6.8 percent.
However, the price in Prague will continue to be lower in the whole of the Republic.
In the north of Czech, where prices are now among the highest, the water and livestock are to be searched by 7.4 percent.
They can, for example, increase rent prices in 450 thousand rental apartments, where the regulation ends from January.
For example, CPI Apartments, which in Ústí nad Labem owns about 2,500 apartments, intend to increase rent from January to a hundred percent.
Those who will not agree to a new higher rent plan will give a company to the court.
The regulated rentals paid by people in about 300 thousand flats could grow up to 10 percent next year.
Czech children drink Fernet and rum. Beer is out of fashion, it works slowly
Fernet, rum, vodka, exceptional and better brand of whiskey stolen by parents.
These are the drinks that most often end up in the care of doctors who haven't even been 15 years.
An exception are not children who are treated with monkeys in the hospital repeatedly.
This results from the experience of doctors who encounter similar cases at the income of the child hospital departments.
"Natural beer or wine is completely unsweetened, because it takes a long time to drink them."
"The trend is certainly hard alcohol," said the Law chief of the children's department Nemocnice Ořovice in the Central Czech Republic, Ludzek Pelikán.
"If they can pull a bottle out of the closet, it's about whisky, but it's about fernet and vodka."
"The water has the advantage of being poured into the juice and it's not that much to feel," the prime minister explained.
And the truth is, he's also giving him a speech by the Faculty Hospital Motol Eva Jurin.
"The most common thing is fernet or rum."
"It's modern alcohol today, especially at primary schools."
"In some cases it was a flood they brought from home," Jurinová said.
According to the principal Pelikana, thirteen or fourteen drinks on hospital income are relatively common.
He worked for ten years in a pediatrician in Motola, where the nurses tied to trained schoolchildren from a wide area.
"A girl was lying with us about four times."
"Career started in twelve years when she was brought to us with 3.5 minutes of alcohol in the blood plus in combination with ecstasy," the doctor described a particularly serious case.
"She was at the exhibition in Holešovići on some dance party."
"It's interesting that her mother didn't even come strange that she didn't know about her daughter for 48 hours," the prime minister said.
I am not interested in parents or even their considerable tolerance to drinking their own offspring is considered to be the main cause of growing child alcoholism.
However, according to experts, it is not possible to talk about the dependence of the right word on children.
"In the sense of alcoholics, several chronic dependence on alcohol is understood by all the phenomena that belong to it, and it's not for children."
"In those who consume alcohol over and over again, there is a more significant unrecognised family-social background," said Prime Minister Pelikán.
According to Jurin’s speech this year at a pediatric clinic in Motole, about four drunk children were hospitalized by mid - November.
However, only those with heavy poisoning that had to stay in the hospital will get to the statistics.
Child drunks who take their parents away after an outpatient treatment, if they're at home transporting the police, don't count at all.
In addition to cases where children just sit around the school and drink a cup of chicken, there are, according to Pelikana, three seasonal exercises that can be relied on: witches, Silvester and the end of the school year.
"It's either they're sorry for the wrong statement, or they're celebrating the beginning of the holidays."
"However, at the witch's, I lived at the reception of seven children's drinkers all of a sudden," Pelikán said.
The monkey who spends the night detoxing under the supervision of doctors is paradoxically in favour of the one who suffers from unpleasant woodland at home the second day.
Early headaches caused by dehydration and lack of glucose are due to initiating glucose and vitamins that are missing from the body.
"They're actually better at it because they have a beautiful evening experience and a good awakening and nothing bad."
"They're only confused from where they are," Pelikán admitted, sometimes giving patients a pleasant mood at least the cost they requested.
Transport with sanitation and hospitalization on the acute bed is also going to be worth tens of thousands of crowns.
"Sometimes I applied it as an educational tool, when I then calculated to these children on a visit how much their maturity has become and that they could also spend the whole summer in the brigade to make their own dinner," Pelikán added.
However, according to him, health insurance is not available for regressive treatment, where the parents would incur the costs of treatment in cases of child abuse.
Two L-159 flights are the first in the foreign hand in Spain
Two L-159 flights from the total of five pieces, for which the Czech Ministry of Defence exchanged the Casa C-295M transport aircraft, flew to the Spanish Seville on Tuesday, where the manufacturer of Casa - EADS is based.
It's the first thing that machines of this kind have discovered in the possession of someone other than the Czech army.
They've been abroad for years of practice or performance.
It is a dual version of L-159T1, which has so far been operated by the Czech army and which have been volatile.
The remaining three machines are the same L-159.
They are currently served in the Aeru Vodochod and the broker of the trade - the company Omnipol - has taken over them last week.
When the planes are physically driven out of Vodochod, according to Jan Pejška from the press defence committee is not yet known.
"The single L-159 airports for the change have been deducted from the duration of the flights, without any other deposits and investments from the Ministry's resort."
"Two L-159T1 were changed in the current state and form," said the Law of Pejšek.
He added that the army will not be left without two-season aeroplanes, because in May 2009, the Ministry signed a contract with Air Waterford, worth 200 million crowns for the reconstruction of four unnecessary L-159 machines on two-season machines.
One new plane took over the army in July, the other we will take to the end of this year.
According to Pejška, EADS has committed itself to bringing the aircraft into the arms of some of the Alliance countries.
"The contract clearly states that the L-159 aircraft receiver is EADS and will serve to train pilots from NATO."
"It is therefore the things the receiver will do," Pejšek said.
In the past, economic reports have shown that, for example, the Spanish L-159 army is not interested.
The exchange of five L-159 for one airport Casa and the purchase of another three flights for 3.5 billion kroner approved by Mirka Topolánka last year.
The Ministry of Defence did not sign up for the selection procedure and spoke directly to EADS.
The Turkish defence leadership argued that it would support future exports of L-159 abroad.
The Czech army bought 72 machines from Aera and uses only 24, the rest of it would like to sell.
The purchase of Casa's aircraft is likely to have a courtroom.
The European Commission, on the other hand, has complained to the Czech Ministry of Defence in the European Court of Justice that it should have selected aircraft on the basis of a whole European trend rather than a single producer.
The army has already taken over three of Casa's flights, the last one should fly to Kbely's Prague airport for fourteen days.
Longer indicator than ring means lower risk of cancer
Men who have an indicator longer than a ring are exposed to a lower risk of cancer of prostate cancer.
This is a surprising conclusion to a study published in the British cancer magazine on Wednesday.
It can be related to the level of male hormone testosterone.
"Our results show that the relative length of the finger can serve as a simple test of the risk of prostate cancer, especially for men up to 60 years," co-author of the Ros Eeles study, professor of cancer research at the University of Warwick.
The finger could thus help to identify which men should undergo a prostate cancer test, especially in combination with genetic risk or other dangerous factors such as the family health burden, Eeles added.
In the period 1994-2009, more than 1500 patients with prostate cancer and at the same time more than three thousand healthy men were followed by colleagues in Britain.
More than half of the participants in the study had an indicator on their right hand shorter than a ring.
She paid for them the same probability of prostate cancer as 19 percent of those whose fingers were as long.
In the case of those who had a pointer longer than a ring, however, this risk decreased by 33 per cent, and for men up to 60, it reduced even 87 per cent.
The ratio of the two fingers mentioned - created in the prenatal period - is likely to reflect the different levels of the sex hormones that the child is exposed to in the diaphragm.
Less testosterone corresponds to a longer indicator.
Previous studies have shown that testosterone is just supporting the growth in prostate cancer.
The former Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences Professor Václav Pačes for ČTK said that he usually knows about this study, but he does not seem to believe that the relationship between the length of his fingers and cancer would be "fully proven".
Czech Republic is under snow, D1 and D5 are closed
Czech Republic, like most of Europe, is covered by snow on Thursday morning.
On the roads and on the roads, most of the snowy, roadmen in many places had been driving all night.
The D5 road between 89 and 93 km in the direction of Razvadov is closed in the morning because of several car accidents and personal accidents, and D1 is also at Brno in the direction of Prague.
Newspaper said it was the dispatcher of the Central Car Club (UAMK).
There was a truck crashing at 91 kilometers, two trucks crashing at 93 kilometers, an accident causing an injury.
There's also a couple of personal cars in the basement.
Problems are also on the D1 road to 185 kilometers towards Prague.
Two trucks met there.
Drivers should ride right behind Brno for 190 kilometers or go over Brno and then ride 182 kilometers to Kývalce.
There are several kilometers of columns there.
Also on the D11 is an accident, and it's on the way to Prague right away.
In Prague lies a few centimeters of snow, temperatures show a minus seven degrees Celsius.
For example, the cars are created on Prosek, which is also embedded in Szěrboholska.
The safest means of transport is the metro.
Tramvaje is delayed, for example, on the track between Karl's Place and Peace Place.
At eight o'clock in the morning, the Prague crisis team will be back.
The problems are also faced by railways and airports.
The Czech routes had already had to cancel seven fast connections because of snow.
Problems, for example, have been traced from Prague to Kralup or from Prague to Beroun.
Passengers should control the current situation.
Ruzyna Airport was closed from mid-11 hours in the night to five in the morning.
Most of the roads in South Moravia are already transitory, but only with increased caution.
In Viškovska there are three nearby roads, in Brno there are snow-like places and in Blanensk some communications are necessary in the amount of snow-nets.
The most affected places were Vyskovsko.
So far, there are closed roads: Roussínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and also Sharatice - Milosovice.
They're gonna have to put the frescos in their search.
When they're crossed, it can't be estimated.
There is a need for caution in the White Carpathian region.
In the roads that are kept only inert under the protection of nature, it lies to the 50 centimeters of snow, the CHK stated.
In the Czech Republic, between two and ten centimeters of snow fell, most of which fell in the northern Czech Republic, many to 18 centimeters.
In Moravskosleslez, about 15 centimeters [15 cm] of snow was attacked.
Snowing in the Czech Republic is rising gradually.
American soldiers have a new "wise weapon"
The U.S. Army has planted a new "wise" weapon in Afghanistan, known so far only under the code code XM-25.
The generals hope that the new automatic rifle will affect the deep conflict with the Taliban and the "change of the game" in their favour.
The new weapon is something like a little super-precious work.
Its projectiles indicate a laser with accuracy of several meters.
Special gears 25 mm, designed for this rifle and containing a highly explosive market, actually work as small grenades.
The fights can be programmed so that they explode not only when they hit the target, but at any point in their ballistic tracks.
Therefore, it can be used against an enemy who is hiding behind a barrier, a wall, or a funeral.
Shora is usually not protected, and when a deadly rain of steel strikes it, it can be removed from the battle.
According to Richard Audetta, who was involved in the development of XM-25, the new gun is the first weapon to be used by the "smart" technology.
"The soldier in principle acts in such a way that he finds a target, sends a laser beam to him, which determines the distance, then receives a clear point of intent, according to which he adjusts the measure and pushes the elbows."
"Let's say you measured 543 meters."
"When you press the trigger, the weapon will be loaded and fired at 543 meters away plus minus one, two or three meters," Audette said.
Moves 400 jobs
The Fujits Group is moving its side from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
400 employees move their place of work in July next year from the current administrative building to the Marienbader-nympost in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
The Japanese group Fujits is moving its side from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As on Wednesday, a giant in the field that specializes in computers and their maintenance, moved 400 men and women from their work place from the modern administrative building to Marienbader-nympost in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, which is a large administrative complex in Lyon Street, in Frankfurt called Niederrad.
According to Fujista, there should be another 100 jobs in the group, which are currently divided into the region, in due course.
The offer for rent was that of a very attractive and large-scale office in Astro Park, that more employees could work.
Also in Bad Homburg, Fujits was just renting.
"In Frankfurt-Niederrad we found a central building with excellent infrastructure."
Excellent connection to the airport is just for a global company like Fujitsu very important.
The recent movement of an important business within the region brought joy to the winners and disappointments of the defeated.
The leading economic rapporteur in Frankfurt Markus Frank (CDU) said that this has managed to get a "global player".
It's a fantastic expression of trust in this place.
Fujitsu is now moving to the city, the settlement is an important boost for Niederrad.
The mayor of Bad Homburg, Michael Korwisi (Green), regretted Fuji's decision.
The city was informed by the company’s management of its intention.
"Of course, we offered our help to the companies," Corvisi said.
Friendly contacts, however, could not change the difficulties of the computer manufacturer with the renter of the property at the Marienbader-Nympost.
As a result, there were decisive economic reasons.
Now it's about preventing a long absence in such a prominent place.
"I hope the owner and tenant of the building will be cooperative."
The house at the Rathaus-Nammet, which has been used by Fujits, and the neighboring "Kleine Verticale" belonged ten years ago with other buildings at the Marienbader-Nammet to the most debated construction intentions of the city of Lazeň.
Between the station and the workshop, there was a joint project of the city and a private designer called the city entrance, which was criticised for the massive construction of areas that had previously served as a parking lot and at the same time for the height of the buildings.
In 2001 the investment consultancy and rating company Feri, a software manufacturer for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, as well as a Fujitsu computer manufacturer, who was once again connected to Siemens.
The buildings used by Fujitsu were acquired in 2006 together with Frankfurter Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Group and Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund and were sold by the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
Fujitsu-concern from Tokyo is the third largest IT provider in the world.
For example, it offers computers and servers available and also takes care of the necessary service.
The branch in the Rhyna and Mohana area is one of the largest in Germany, but most of Fujits employees are in Munich.
From Bad Homburg is moved to Frankfurt-Niederrad, a subsidiary of Fujitsu Technology Solutions, other subsidiaries in this site will be Fujitsu Services and a company named TDS.
In the administrative building, Astro Park was rented for this purpose 7000 square meters.
In the complex - its name points to the star landscape, which is twenty years old, it also sits in addition to the central bond of the electrical and electronic industry.
Amazon Server Kills - Threats to Assangem
Wikileaks gets into tights.
The Amazon Internet service turned off the platform for detection on its servers.
It is possible that this has happened to political pressure after the release of secret diplomatic depés statistics.
The founder of Wikileaks Assange is allegedly held in the United Kingdom.
Wikileaks, a platform for detection, is getting under increasing pressure in the United States.
Internet activists have lost access to their present home server in America and are now looking for Internet homes in Europe.
Meanwhile, prominent US senator Joe Lieberman called for other countries and businesses to boycott Wikileaks.
And the founder of Wikileaks Julian Assange, who is led on the list sought by Interpol, is to be held according to a newspaper contribution in the United Kingdom.
"Wikileaks is no longer on the Amazon server."
"Free speech in the country of freedom", activists announced the short news service on Wednesday (local time).
The Amazon Internet company recently downloaded Wikileaks documents from its servers.
Internet activists used to publish the Amazon Web Service (AWS) secret diplomatic stores in order to manage a high number of access to documents.
Twitter services have explained Wikileaks to this step: "Good - our dollars now we are losing by hiring people in Europe."
If Amazon has such problems with freedom of speech, "then they should stop selling books."
Amazon stopped using its servers for Wikileaks after Senator Joe Lieberman's collaborators conducted the search, published CNN TV stations based on the information of Lieberman's office.
The president of the Senate Committee for Home Protection threatened the Amazon boycott, informed the British "Guardian".
"I wish the Amazon would take this step sooner, given the earlier publication of classified information on Wikileaks," said the senator.
Lieberman, among other things, called for the prevention of the platform in the use of servers in other countries.
"Weikileaks is one of the illegal, indiscriminate and indiscriminately and thus our national security is exposed to danger and threatens this life all over the planet," said a statement by the non-page senator.
"No responsible company - whether American or foreign - should be able to help Wikileaks in their efforts to expand stolen material."
Founder Wikileaks Assange, who is sought by the Swedish authorities for suspected rape, is on the list sought by Interpol.
Based on a report in the London newspaper "The Independent", the 39-year-old Australian in the United Kingdom, Scotland Yard knows the exact place.
Internet activist has always marked an investigation in Sweden for the intrigue of his opponents.
Speaking Wikileaks Kristinn Hraftsson in London said there were threats.
"There were even challenges to the murder of Julian Assange."
That's why Assange's right to fear for his safety, Hraftsson said.
That's why the founder of Wikileaks will continue to hide.
Hrafnsson was obviously responding to the rulings from North America.
In America, the former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckbee, requested that the person responsible for publishing on Wikileaks be charged and corrected for treason.
In Canada, a leading government adviser Stephen Harper said on television - ironically, Assange should be "killed" and Obama could use "target plane".
Meanwhile, the white house and Assange were torn apart.
US President Barack Obama, Robert Gibbs, called it "the ridiculous and absurd" that Assange asked the foreign minister's resignation of Hillary Clinton if he was responsible for the recently published Spanish diplomatic challenges.
"I'm not quite sure why we're interested in the opinion of a person with websites," Gibbs said.
"Our foreign policy and interests in this country are much more important than its website."
The U.S. government is now examining the security of its databases.
The Special Representative was appointed as the representative of the Centre for Anti-Terrorism Action, Russell Travers, informed the White House.
Travelers became responsible for the development of "needy reforms in the structure", which are necessary after publishing messages from the broadcast to Wikileaks.
The White House also wants to examine ways in which the entire government is exchanging and protecting information.
The U.S. government has also announced that it wants to take care of the safety of dissidents and activists if they should be in danger of publishing on Wikileaks.
"We raised everything we could get in touch with them," said foreign ministry spokesman Philip Crowley.
"We are prepared to protect them, if only it would be necessary."
Ice cream university
At "Gelato University" in Bologna, frozen sugars are being prepared for a better annual period.
The basic course for future freezers, which lasts three days, is of great interest and visitors come from all over the world.
Where's that ice cream actually going?
From Gelatier and from Gelataio.
Gelatier, Czech a little old ice cream maker, manufactures cream according to all the rules of Italian ice cream.
Gelatio puts the ice cream out of the refrigerator, puts it in charge and sells it.
To find out, you don't have to drive to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But whoever wants to find out more about the ice cream, he won't get away with the "Gelato-University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
In 2003, the ice cream machine manufacturer established a frozen university to match the high Italian ideals of ice cream from its machines everywhere.
The basic course for future Gelatieri, which lasts three days, is a huge interest and visitors come from all over the world.
However, it also offers several special courses on chocolate ice cream and practice in its own refrigerator.
Someone wants in their Midlife-Criss after a new career, others dare to take on the thin ice of their unexplained complaints.
This time it is 40 participants from 19 countries of all light components - from Brazil across Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, an art teacher from California, loves the Slow-Food movement and would like to offer a quality European product in the country of industrial Ice-Cream in the future.
Anke from Berlin is a business consultant and would like to start something of her own after years of stressful work.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening an iceberg in Cairo.
One man from Malta and one from Brazil want to improve the quality of ice cream in their bars - and a Canadian woman in Julia's home came because her children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro-Geltiere Luciano Ferrari will first explain the perfect ice cream properties to participants.
The decision-makers are not only good tastes, they are also competitive and good consistency.
Luciano will not forget during his training in the South and the Dormitory of the cake: "Italian Gelato is simply the best - and then it is still a useful dose of romance."
The first step of production seems to be quite simple.
Luciano inserts the basic ingredients of milk, skimmed milk, milk powder, sugar and stabilisers into a large mix, which warms everything with an electronic program to 85 degrees and then immediately cools to four degrees.
Then it rotates on the machine with a cotton and extracts a pasteurised white basic cream, the basis of all types of milk frozen.
The teacher is immediately asleep with questions: Is it possible to produce ice cream only from natural substances without a stabiliser?
How can a person experience himself?
Luciano's warning to let the spirit of time go to the unknown.
Who's talking about ice cream "only from natural ingredients", apparently used stabilizers - most of the natural product, such as guar sauce from guar nuts.
Of course, it is possible to produce ice cream without stabilisers, but it must be sold within one day, otherwise it will hit and the customer will have the ice cream itself.
Certain variations of basic weight are permitted.
It'll be more intense with aromatic essences.
Maestro Luciano distinguishes in the taste of ice cream according to the ingredients that are bought in the supermarket either in the fruit department or in the sugar department.
Besides, there are pills and creams.
"The suppliers will try to use a lot of aromatized ingredients."
"But you should simply experiment."
Be with fruit sorbits with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or they will freeze from the white basic mass, which turns eggs into yellow cream and cocoa on the basis of a mixed chocolate taste.
Now he's taking a part in the ice cream machine course.
Luciano is always made of four different types of vanilla, chocolate, coffee and lysco-sacrific ice cream - either with eggs or without them in the basic mass, with more or less vanilla flavours or other natural ingredients.
The same experiment will also be carried out with fruit types of ice cream.
More aromatic substances, more fruit pears - given taste it is not always better.
Liscoorice ice should not taste more oscillating when it contains more lysco nuts.
The most popular ice cream is produced by a group that uses more fruit, less water and a little less stabiliser.
Only when the balanced mixture lifts the right taste of Gelato, says Luciano.
The production of ice cream is a purely computational task: If broccoli is used with a lot of sugar, the share of sugar in the basic recipe must be reduced.
In lemon ice cream, extra sugar cans are needed.
Luciano is issuing a device that determines the content of sugar in fruit (wine measures the must of grapes).
Fortunately, the tables make numbers easier.
The production of ice cream does not require as much body weight as before.
It does not only assist the machine in the automatic production of basic mass.
There is also a device that simultaneously blends in the cream and cools at a lower temperature.
And despite all the automation, we don't get away with a little accident.
Brazilan Gustavo is pushing himself and his colleagues to the bottom of the fruit pear when he gets out of control of the giant mixer.
"In every course," Maestro Luciano says, "it's just a matter of time when something like this happens."
2nd-light auditors
The European Food Authority is bound by an industry experimenting with genetic plants.
This charge has now been expressed by a group of experts from Test Biotech, which is considered an independent biotechnological institution.
"It sounds like a glass theory, but we've documented it well," said the head of Testbiotech Christoph Then on Wednesday.
The leading groups of Efs experts for genetically modified plants, Harry Kuiper, and other Efs experts have been in agreement with the Ilsi lobbyists for several years.
This one is funded by a group like Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper has participated in the decision-making way of the EFSA control rules for genetic plants and is thus in a clear focus of interest, criticizing Then.
The rules of the EFTA States shall be in full compliance with the documents of the Ilsi and shall bear such a manual of the industry as should be controlled by the Italian Parliament.
It's been a while since Testbiotech pointed out to show interest.
Recently, a high manager from Eksa passed without any extras or a transitional time to the Swiss Agrarian Syngenta Group - and this changed the parties.
The announcement for Central Germany (MDR) also revealed a recent personal link between the EU Industrial Lobby Control Agency, which sparked the interest of both the Ministry of the Environment and EU Members.
In the meantime, Essa can't recognize the interest.
It works with all the serious data, so also those from industry, if they are highly professional, is mentioned in one statement.
The experts who work for Efs are not required to have contacts with industry.
But they have to be delivered.
Kuiper admits his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the United States.
It is only designated as the neutral forum of experts from science, industry and politics - except for the risk assessment of biotechnology without the Lobbist contracts.
Independent experts such as Then criticise that currently genetically modified plants are permitted in animals without any feeding attempts, and that genetic plants do not respond to the environmental impact.
"We want to know what will do, for example, genetically modified corn on the field," says Then.
The current practice is to test only isolated proteins, not all genetic plants, which do not produce reliable results.
"If they're not looking for a risk, how would it be possible to find it?" Then asks.
That agrees with Angelika Hilbeck.
The scientific workshop has examined genetic engineering since 1994 and is currently working at the Technical University of Curych.
In this area, industry is trying to influence or discredit critical scientists in Europe as well as in the United States.
That's why there's almost no scientists who wouldn't be associated with the group anymore.
Most studies are not published that are critical to companies.
"The industry controls security research," Hilbeck thinks.
Stone level
Ollie Gsell also ordered some, about 400 kilograms.
On Monday night, he stood in front of the station in Stuttgart, a tube on his back.
It was a demonstration.
It's snowing.
The story is known: In September the barricades arrived and began to shake a large part of the north wing.
The world in Stuttgart was no longer the same: thousands of demonstrations against the S21, a billion reduction in the station.
When the building was stopped, most of the wings were lying in the trunks.
Broken to 6,000, 7,000 pieces.
A shield from Crailsheim, a soft, rough stone that was used in the years 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a shoemaker in Ostfieldern, 43 years old.
He secured a few of those pieces.
"These stones are relics."
"He can't disappear."
It says, "A cheap and poor stone, simple and original."
When one of them cut, he smelled like a cigarette.
What he's gonna do with those pieces, he doesn't know yet.
Stones have time.
Ollie Gsell, too.
The stock of stones from Stuttgart leads to the forest at Tübingen in the former municipality of the French army, where Manuel Rongen built his stone empire.
A 44-year-old man deals with old stones.
He bought all the things that came up during the fight in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if they were to wake up on the roof or disappear on the deposit," he says in his office, a wooden building that was a former housekeeper.
They tell him that they gave him and threatened him when in September all the newspapers said he bought the remains of the northern wing from a company that is carrying out the demon.
But he's been talking to the S-21 opponents all day.
And he explained to them that he can't do anything for the demons.
And when this happens, it's the smartest thing to do when the stones continue to be used.
Then it took about 200 S-21 opponents each about 80 kilograms of hard block, price per piece 6,50 to 14 euros.
As a reminder, some also hope that he will return to the refurbishment.
Rongen bought 500 tons, 25 large trucks.
I guess half of it's still in the woods, the rest of it's been sold long ago.
Gardeners, landscape gardeners, housekeepers.
They came from all the corners and pulled what came into the trunk and into the trailer.
The stones of the dispute from Stuttgart have long been transformed into "walls" or as the edge of the halls with the gardens.
"This stone is actually nothing special," says Rongen.
"If it wasn't for the political allotment."
He's in his field car and he's going for a ride after his 20-hectare kingdom.
He studied the law before, interrupted the study, later biology, then became a computer and eventually became a stone dealer.
And a stone lover.
It has 40,000 tons of stones stored.
He's considering his savings from all over Germany.
He says he's the biggest dealer with old stones in the Republic.
It's fast.
In the snow, there's an artist-made poet.
"One of them belonged to the Marine Bridge in the Djords," he says.
The poet from the lab, yellow, warm, he's excited.
"My favorite stone."
We're going up the road through the woods.
It shows on the crowd: a red poet, first part of the station in Karlsruhe.
Come on.
"A nice travertine."
One of those quads belonged to the Neckarstadion Court in Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow lies stones and stories, Cannstatt-travertin from the police office in Stuttgart, a red granite from the temple of Sankt Blasien, a tuf from the hospital in Heilbronn.
What a work, what a struggle, what a journey.
When Rongen thinks about how the stones had been broken down and carried over by simple earthworms and bullfights, he becomes quite respectful.
"It'd be a shame if something like that would shake."
He didn't become rich, he was very rich, he didn't.
But today, a stone merchant employs 14 people, and in addition, the stonesmiths, one shoemaker, one blanket, one glass, and one gardener sat up in the woods.
"We work hard, but it's satisfying," says the one who evaluates the remains.
He has to go to Colin in due time.
The stones will be saved there, too.
Fighting High-Position Talents
There's a lot of people in purgatory.
16 students are pressed with salmon bread, tomato juice and sugar.
Technical University of Braunschweig and car manufacturer Volkswagen invited students to the workshop and design.
Together with VW developers here are to talk about the car of the future - and only to know Volkswagen by the way.
Many companies are trying to compete for the smartest heads, as well as VW, to succeed and rely on cooperation with universities.
Their mission is: As soon as they can recruit the most trusted graduates in their audiences, before they get to the labour market and they will be interested in them.
Since universities do not publish any lists of the success of their students, companies are trying to discover exceptional talents in practical projects and get them.
At TU Braunschweig, the car group is trying to get talent the second day.
One young lady from the private department distributes pens, rubber bears and boards with VW logo.
He tells the hopeful young talents about practical programs, student jobs and tells them to go to the group.
Nico Selle from TU Braunschweig is working on a project together with VW.
They see the benefits for both sides: "Students will get in touch with industry and experience."
"The VW can meet students at the same time, get closer to the interesting candidates and think about who would fit as a co-worker."
Such cooperation, according to Selle, is not uncommon.
But the news is he's so openly fighting about students.
"In any case, it was a major professional project," says Selle.
The fight for fresh graduates will probably be even harder.
In many sectors, companies can no longer choose their employees from long-term representatives.
On the contrary, they must strive and try to impose particularly highly qualified workforces.
In particular, graduates of the engineering sector have an excellent negotiating position.
According to data from the German engineering team, the VDI remained in October unencumbered 40,000 engineering positions.
And according to the VDI forecast, the lack of engineers will still increase.
For the audit and consultancy firm KPMG, Roman Dikta is on the hunt for talent.
It organizes demanding Recruiting-Events, such as KPMG-Race, a kind of modern treasure race where participants must find their way according to GPS coordinates.
The company plans to send eight promised students to the United States next year.
At the same time, participants can look at KPMG's sides and get to know the company.
It will first be decided in two rounds of selection, who will participate.
Only Crème de la Crème from many interested people will fly to the United States.
In the struggle for High Potentials at universities they will be paid under the Dictate even harder laws.
"We want to distinguish ourselves with our race from the others."
"The simple trip to the gym was too little for us."
It seems that the hunter of the talents of Dikta is lucky.
"We stayed in touch with all participants like last year."
"Some will soon finish the study and plan to keep a job with us," he says.
In addition to direct talks at campus, small and medium-sized enterprises are presented classicly on the labour markets.
"We're trying to contact the graduates at the professional show."
"As in Intersolar, for example," says Sita Stübe, head of the Solarworld Solar Technology Department.
The company from Bonn employs around 1500 employees in Germany.
Stübe knows the problem with young workers.
Currently 35 posts are written on the company's website.
"At the present time, it's just complicated to set free places."
"There's plenty of time and money," he says.
Another option is contact with professors at universities.
Solarworld works with various high schools, such as the University of Freiberg.
"Professors inform us that we can do practice or write a diploma."
The solar specialist doesn't arrange any expensive advertising.
Instead, the company is trying to attract other benefits: personal atmosphere, low hierarchy and light communication.
"Many groups often can't offer it," says the Chief Personal Department of the Stübe.
Looking for work doesn't play a major role anymore.
The flexibility of working hours, childcare or good treatment options are other decisive factors.
Solarworld spent 55th place among 100 top employees in Germany in one study of the Institute's Great Place to Work.
The Institute shall draw up an annual list of the best German employers.
In addition, employees are asked how satisfied they are with their work and working environment and are monitoring the conditions of employees.
The head of the staff section of the Stübe hopes that her placement will bring points to the workers.
"I assume that stakeholders are particularly informed about the external evaluations of a potential employer," he says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler from the German Employer Branding Academy advises companies who want to build a long-term strategy of good reputation as an employer.
He advises his customers to be more authentic.
And according to Mr. Kriegler, that means, above all, internal measures.
"The best way to see yourself as an attractive employer leads through his own staff," he says.
It is called the Internal Employer Branding, which is the employer's invitation to the market within the framework of his own employees.
"The satisfaction of employees is the best of envoys."
When the company takes good care of its people and they identify themselves with the company, they will make their employer an advertisement between friends and acquaintances.
"It's like a connection game," says Kriegler.
Obama stops new oil gardens
During the following years, a new oil garden will not emerge on the coast of Florida, U.S.A., in the Gulf of Mexico.
The government in Washington issued a corresponding ban - and thereby abolished the previous plan with the final validity of the plan.
New gardens are now banned, too, outside the Atlantic coast.
Interior Minister Ken Salazar told us on Wednesday.
The reason for the strict prohibition that should be paid for at least the following five years is an explosion on the garden tower "Deepwater Horizon" in April.
Prior to this accident, which left eleven employees alive and led to the biggest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama signaled the pressure of opposition and industry to his will to allow new gardens in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
The hostages are trying to reduce US dependence on supplies of oil from abroad.
To this day, it is not clearly explained who is responsible for destroying the oil spill in the Gulf.
In the middle of the criticism, the British energy group BP is confronted with billions of requests.
The investigation commission, which Obama has entrusted, should present the results during December.
In October, Interior Minister Ken Salazar cancelled the return ban, which he paid from the explosion.
Subsequently, various oil groups applied for new garden purposes.
Obama and Salazar want to prevent similar disasters by more stringent controls and strict safety regulations.
At the present time, the control authority is essentially reforming, which has warned itself of many corrupt charges.
At the same time, Obama announced that it would cancel out the luctarious option of tax losses for oil and gas companies.
The industry now clearly warns that more stringent regulation will substantially reduce the volume of heavy oil in the Gulf.
"The government plans are the biggest slowdown in the growth of the gas and oil industry", sounds the result of the current research in the area of the BDO consultancy - even before the ban on turning into Wednesday.
The American Energy Alliance is still complaining about the uncertainty in the field: "No one knows exactly what the regulation is going to change."
Investments in new incentive projects are being shifted to a decline in growth.
The Ogoni area is burning
The water in the rivers is a waste of oil, it smells like a pump: billions of litres of unique oils destroyed nature in the area of Ogoni in Nigeria.
People live by stealing, corruption, and illegal oil cooking.
Celestine Akpobari thinks so well.
"Nontrapte se", the journalist says to the environmental activist: "Today you'll get enough oil for the object."
37-year-old Nigerian was trying to take a picture of a boy who is sailing around the chest of water that surrounds the foams: the scene works in the water latte with spiritual colors almost to the beauty.
It's not visible that under the surface of the blue nests of the oil spills.
She used to collect enough shrimp in here, telling Esther Badom on the river Bodo-Jetti.
In the meantime, the effluent water became completely dead.
Five years ago, a huge wave of oil flowed into the vast area from broken management.
The fishermen from the nearby town of Bodo must dive for at least six hours to get into the waters where the fish are: the area of Ogoni, which is located in the heart of the Niger delta, belongs to one of the worst frozen areas in the world.
The road along the river with the mangrove bays with a lot of side effects is only a known whole range.
The engine on the boat cooks instead of the light water, and whoever puts his hand in the water, pulls out oil fingers.
The roots of the mangroves range from the earth as the black dots of the doctor, rarely the existing palm leaves are left unhappily hanging.
We are looking for a bunch of birds that are usually found in the wetlands: Once the engine is quiet on the boat, it will spread in the former paradise, where it smells like pumping, scary silence.
"What's going on here is the ecological management of the war," laments Celestine Akpobari: "We live in constant fear of health."
Comparison with war is legitimate.
The Ogoni settlement area is a battlefield where it has been fighting for decades: more than 60 years ago, the first inhabitants of Europe were involved, here in the 1980s, the first cut-off with the late-corrected writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, here the Shell Group had to stop its production in 1993 because it was extremely dangerous for employees.
To date, the company must not return to the area of Ogoni: while every day it spends the whole area of the delta of three sizes of Switzerland with more than 5000 desirable gardens and 7000 kilometres of management of more than two million black bars, the oil field in Ogoni lake lies in the area of Ogoni, this situation is very unstable for the group.
Each hundred meters are covered by steel construction water as a bizarous juice: "Natural trees", so they are very gently called the heads of gardens.
They're 50 years old, most of them up to the morgue.
Every moment, such a head of the garden opens, reports Akpobari, and then flows a constant stream of oil into the water.
Experts estimate that more than two billion litres of oil in the delta in 50 years: Every year, the amount of oil that came out of the sea in Alaska at the "Exxon Valdez" supertanker disaster 21 years ago - one of the greatest environmental disasters in human history.
There are disputes about who is still responsible for the ongoing environmental disaster.
While the Shell Group designates sabotage and organised theft of oil by more than 90 percent of pollution, environmental protection says about the heads of wild gardens and rough guides as the main cause.
Shell requires much less safety regulations in Nigeria than is customary in the world, led by U.S. scientist Richard Steiner in 2008: Only the number of injuries on the guides is "sometimes higher than elsewhere".
In a place that looks far away as abandoned, oil-sprayed shop under the wide sky, it comes from the mangroves of the building: they are completely naked and up to the neck of the oil.
Under one of many of the courts, which are partly linked by management, partly deliberately scattered across the country, fires fire: illegal small refinery.
The hole in the court over the fire heats for a few hours, explains Michael, the leader of the group.
Go ahead from the lead to the ingestion of gasoline, later the cape at the end of the kerosene and at the end of the oil.
In this way, Michael and his four collaborators produce up to four judges per 300 litres: "We'll see 34,000 Naira" - about $22.
The population of the delta is suffering from a chronic shortage of fuel in the largest oil country in black Africa.
Niger owns only one refinery.
A ridiculously low price of EUR 40 cents per litre of oil can still be passed by illegal producers: because they have raw materials for free.
It comes from the "bunkers", which are connected to the management of all over Ogoni: according to experts, the Niger River delta thus loses at least 16 million litres of oil daily.
But only a relatively small part of the provisionally stored raw material will be illegally exhausted: Most of the organized criminal network, to which they must also belong, and the high position of the army's representatives, in tankers, and sell it on the world market.
The debate, whether or not they caused the disaster of the inhabitants and their efforts or the lax method of production, considers Akpobari to be purely academic.
"If oil companies were not considered to be firefighters and had not completely destroyed the vitality of fishermen, then there would be no sabotage, no theft and illegal refinery."
In the meantime, however, Ogoni's relationship with Shell is so distorted that it only seems to go to the group: "Maybe other nations like China will show themselves as better."
Michael's going to be unhappy.
"The longest time to disappear," says the slender manufacturer.
"Every moment, soldiers can come."
If a special military unit found them, they would not be in danger of imprisonment, but a painful payment.
Also, soldiers who come mostly from the north of the country - like all Nigerians - want to profit from the raw materials.
"Then the damn thing got our land in all respects to the bottom," Akpobari says.
The investigators found a dangerous construction error in engines A380
A380 clearly has a high safety condition.
The investigators discovered a mishap that could lead to a "catastrophe accident of the engine".
Qantas airline wants to appeal to the engine manufacturer.
Qantas's airbus passengers were probably more fortunate at the beginning of November than they were known to be: the Australian Air Safety Agency has discovered a large safety drive on the engines of some A380 machines in its investigations, and now warns against possible construction failures.
It may be difficult to find the consequences: on one oil compound, they could create markets for consumption, this quarter reported in the published statement by the ATSB.
This could lead to a "catastrophic engine failure".
This is the engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce on 20 A380 aircraft.
Among them is the Qantas airbus, which had to arrive in Singapore on November 4th.
The Australian airline has now taken legal steps against the British turbine manufacturer.
She argued with the Australian Social Court in Sydney, which allows for further legal measures against this company.
The leader of Qantas Alan Joyce said his company would claim compensation for the incident at the beginning of November.
During the engine fire, the parts were released and the nose surfaces were damaged.
Rolls-Royce identified the cause of the damage to burning oil.
After this event, up to 40 engines have to be exchanged around the world.
The Australian investigators announced that they will carry out further safety tests with the rounds equipped with the engines concerned.
The safety recommendation is the result of cooperation with Rolls-Royce, spokesperson ATSB Martin Dolan said.
The lack of security was considered to be important enough to inform everyone concerned.
After the emergency arrival of the Qantas, the airline left its fleet A380 for several weeks on the ground.
Singapore Airlines left three of its eleven A380s on the ground.
Lufthansa replaced one A380 engine as a safety measure.

Global snow causes traffic chaos
Germany all white: almost snowed all night long in the country.
On many roads there are chaos, train connections, and airplanes destroyed.
At least three people died in transport accidents.
Winter is freezing in Germany: almost the entire Republic fell on Thursday night at cold snow temperatures - leading to many places of traffic chaos.
It lies in the north and east in some places up to 15 centimeters of snow.
On several roads and many roads there is a very limited transport.
At A7 in Flensburg, the road service was still in operation, but it did not manage the new snow.
There was still a strong blast wind over the Baltic Sea.
The Baltic Sea Coast of Schlesvik-Holštýnska is expected to be a water-driving spring with a water level of 1.2 metres above normal.
The snowflakes in Saskatchewan caused significant problems on the roads and public roads.
According to the bad weather centre Meteomedia was, therefore, in Saskatchewan, a degree of fear of violins - even the highest degree.
From there, a 30 - centimeter - long [30 cm] new snow, strong and fresh wind caused the tides.
There were several freight and personal cars there at night.
In Saska-Anhaltsk too, police authorities reported major road problems.
At A2, the wind and snow caused slow operation and locks.
In Duryn, there were problems with snow on A4 and A9.
According to the German route, there are major difficulties in Saskatchewan, Saskatchewan-Anhaltsk, Durynsk and northern Bavaria.
The main problems are snow on wheels, turned trees on wheels or broken top management and escapes.
In Saska, a remote operation from Lipska to Nuremberg had to be stopped.
In Duryn, Saalfeld had to stop one ICE to Mnich.
165 passengers got on the train from firemen and rescuers rolled blankets, food and drink.
The snow wind came down the road.
On large German airports, snow winds have been lifted for many years.
According to the speakers, information centres for years have already been reported from Munich's cancelled flight.
In Frankfurt, in Mohan, it's been abolished for 40 years, according to Fraport's spokesman.
The maintenance of the roads is in a constant position.
Although there were only a few unconnected passengers at the airport, 400 full beds were prepared for them.
On many roads there were accidents on Wednesday night.
In the evening, one truck driver died in a car crash on a train on a train crossing in eastern Holštýnsk.
The engineer was easily injured.
Because of the snowed road, a similar accident occurred near Norimberk: a freight car was also caught here on a train ride, as the vehicle was stuck.
The driver died.
Four passengers were injured on the train - the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg remained closed until early hours.
And to that end, one 30-year-old woman died after she turned her car into a sloppy road at Aschainburg.
However, meteorologists have good news: the snow will remain in the form of light reading, and therefore the wind will be blown away when the wind breaks.
But the wind will fail.
Only at the Baltic Sea there will be swift winds about the force of the whip.
But it's going to be a big winter - locally up to minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank is looking for buyers for twins
Deutsche Bank wants to say good-bye with its mark: according to one newspaper contribution, the bank is looking for a buyer for two towers with offices in the main headquarters in Frankfurt.
Immortality could amount to up to EUR 500 million.
Deutsche Bank just refurbished its seat of the group: the twins in the Frankfurt banking district were modernised; in the meantime, the bankers were allowed to go back to their old jobs.
Now, however, it is likely that the financial group wants to renovate again - and is looking for buyers for both of them, as he informs "Financial Times Deutschland" with a call to the speaker.
The speaker did not mention the reasons for the planned sale.
"We're still checking whether it's more meaningful properties to own or sell and then rent again," he said.
This is what the largest credit institution in Germany will give back to its corporate headquarters in a short time.
The bank took over the twins only in mid-2007 for 272 million euros from the investors of its own fund and then refurbished them in a cost-effective way.
Energy conversion has been reported to be around EUR 200 million.
The sale would probably bring the bank a lot of money.
Experts in the field estimate, according to the newspaper, the value between the branches named "Greenoverers" at a price of around 500 million euros.
The speaker said it was not decided whether the building was resold in the property of the fund or to an independent investor.
Thousands of poisons for dead miners
More than 10,000 people attended the memory of the sleeping miners in New Zealand, who were declared dead after several explosions down there.
It has not yet been able to release the dead, because the safety situation in the box is still complicated.
Almost two weeks ago, there was a strong explosion in the Pike River Mine near the town of Greymouth.
29 miners between the ages of 17 and 62 were hit in the bottom.
In the accident, the probe was released, but there was no trace of life.
For reasons of high concentration of toxic gases and subsequent explosions, the safety of saving forces could not be achieved.
After the second strong detonation, authorities and experts came from the fact that miners no longer have a chance to survive.
Still couldn't get rid of the dead.
Now they've memorized the memory of dead relatives and friends.
At Greymouth on the southern island of New Zealand, tens of thousands of people gathered in the sunlight.
They've been silent for two minutes.
To honor the memory of the sleeping ovens, 29 tables were built, on them helms, bright and the names of the ovens.
Also the pictures and personal things, such as the clothes and surfing plots, have found their place here.
In the state government buildings, the flags ran half a yard.
New Zealand hoped that the miners would once again leave the "deep country" on the surface, the Prime Minister of New Zealand John Key told the participants of the commemorative event.
"But they never came home."
He can't say goodbye to his son until he saw his dead body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was stabbed down.
A number of foreign diplomats have also participated in the commemorative action, except for the Prime Minister and the relatives.
During the 19th of November, British and South African miners were also attacked.
The rescuers began by burning fire inside the coal valley on the southern island of New Zealand.
As soon as the toxic gas is released, it begins to cool the high temperatures inside, police president Gary Knowles told reporters.
Hell, warrior!
Is it the horror of an art movie?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn is trying to recapture the old border with his "Wallalla Rising" battle epos.
What audience did Danish director Nicolas Winding Rehn think of when he was playing Wallalla Rising?
The captured Viking warrior with one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) is released from his martyrs and in great numbers they kill with the force of their opponents - it sounds ideal for young fans who are looking for blood acts, because our hero helps with cruel killing methods and their enemies even survives inside when he has a bad mood.
On the other hand, as it is actually called, the whole film does not say a word or a word, and the other characters will bring up at least one or two words or let them go to the passionate dying screams.
Otherwise, it is silent and nestled in the awfully beautiful hilly region of Scotland, which offers a world scene of Vikings about a thousand years ago.
The film is ideal for the adult enthusiasm of the movie with an interest in existentialism and very calm camera recordings.
It's good when he has a movie of more target groups, it's only bad when they're out of each other.
Director Winding Refn, after filming his wild and stylish trilogy about the drug dealers "Pusher", is considered a Danish version of director Quentin Tarantina, but he stands out as defending his works by getting closer to either the main stream of humor or the less brutality of the art audience.
Most of the beneficiaries of the art cinema are likely to be treated everywhere with squeezing brains and interiors.
The participants of the action films will be released no later than the moment when the Single One is issued for clear reasons with a group of violent Christian missionaries of the ship to Jerusalem and will remain hanging for all eternity in the wind and snow, before it is likely to add courage to America and remain silent there.
So it's not surprising that in Germany, Wallalla Rising didn't get into a movie and now it's only been released on DVD.
It's mainly damage to beautiful pictures, but also because it's a personal façade, places to shed blood, it's hiding an exciting movie that deserves a little attention.
It's not about dialogue or the exact event in this movie, it's all an atmosphere, a hot dream that became a movie.
And it's not for a fugitive.
His reputation does not stop him from being released and slowly breathes him with his cold shots and a cloudy hypnotic soundtrack, especially the unsubstantiated hate that blows from the heart.
Only a little blonde boy who helps One-Ok, leaves something like innocence, all the others are driven by evil.
Of all the same hero whose motives will never be explained, which will become a time for enemies and transitional alliances as a warrior from hell, perhaps a messenger of the devil.
It's making a loss, maybe, but it's just for the wounded, too.
Wallalla Rising is a mysterious film that is possible to hate and admire, for anger, excitement and admiration.
It's a surprise.
Deceptive Earthwork
The IAEA Nuclear Power Agency has a new notification to the Syrian secret nuclear programme.
The country, however, defends itself - and does not allow control.
About midnight from 5 to 6 September 2007, at least four Israeli warplanes F-15 I will attack a mysterious quarter building in Syria.
It stands on the shore of Euphrat; the nearest city is 30 kilometers away and is called Dair as-Saur.
The documents of the International Agency for Nuclear Energy (IAEA) shall show its name when it comes to a reactor that has allegedly installed Syria with the help of North Korea in this quarter hidden in the valley that recedes from the stream.
Based on the announcement of the CIA foreign secret service by the end of April 2008, a reactor, also known as the nearby village of El-Kibar, would be well placed on plutonium production - from which nuclear weapons can be built.
The 50-year-old technique doesn't apply to anything else.
The CIA introduced video with unsaturated satellite images.
Computer animation has explained where the components of the reactor could have been before destruction should be a reduced copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear centre.
In addition, there were still photographs showing the building near or even inside.
The reactor was just a short time before the launch, but it's still out of fuel.
Today, after more than three years after the bombing, it's not much more than ten times, even the disputes have increased over time.
Former U.S. President George W. Bush recently announced in his memories that the CIA had been very sure that Syria was building an el-Kibar reactor, but basically had no basis for the country's "active nuclear weapons program".
Some reporting secret services in Europe are even more careful and speak only of a "beautiful reactor", even though the CIA's presentation is considered to be "valuable".
They lack clear evidence, as do the IAEA.
On the question of how certain he has a reactor ahead of him, a senior UN diplomat answered in summer, the IAEA has only "a supply of material to ask questions".
Apparently, "unused military buildings" were quickly derailed by the Syrians, and they also properly leveled the ground.
However, it was found in June 2008 by the IAEA team under the leadership of former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen in the ranks of uranium in El Kibar, which was produced by people.
In addition, the IAEA received a satellite photo of commercial sellers from the Member State immediately after the attack, which should be more pronounced than those presented by the CIA.
Unfortunately, these recordings are not on the market because they were bought exclusively by an unknown customer - perhaps Israel.
It is therefore not possible for the IAEA to confirm their ownership.
Syria has always claimed that she never had a secret nuclear program or a non-reactor.
Uranus comes from Israeli weapons, Damaszek said.
However, it failed the IAEA after the particle analysis.
Since then, Damaszek has refused to discuss the matter - as well as satellite recordings.
In addition, he banned the auditors from the second inspection in El Kibar and access to the poorly bombed buildings.
But Israel is also very silent.
"We will never comment on it," confirmed the recent official opinion of Prime Minister Ehud Olmert.
The investigation of this case will be carried out without delay since June 2008 and "remains in a serious problem in the light of the authority's confidentiality", as a senior Western diplomat at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna admitted - it is, however, a serious breach of the agreement on the prohibition of nuclear weapons to which the IAEA monitors.
The IAEA considers the key to progress in the case of three other devices to be "in functional connection" with the given reactor - and they still exist.
The auditors have so far failed to identify any device, any function, or why they are suspected.
According to the news Süddeutsche Zeitung, the IAEA internally designates it as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, taken back to nearby cities.
The Independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) identified these objects and found them on the satellite imaging complex of buildings, which is probably one of the suspicious objects.
It is likely that there is an internal or immediate proximity to the military base - that is why Syria rejects the IAEA's approach to these three places.
In Vienna it was reported that the Syrians are afraid of the so-called fishing expedition - that the IAEA would have been previously sent to the United States to set up military bases.
Nuclear detectives were alerted to the U.S. secret service.
The IAEA has bases and satellite images that transported material here and there between these three places and a quarter of the Euphrat.
In Vienna, a high Western diplomat said that at least one facility should be "in relation to fuel production".
However, there is no "no evidence of sensitive activities", i.e. the enrichment of uranium and new processing; processes necessary for the production of nuclear weapons.
The type of reactor is driven by uranium, which is not enriched.
Where does this uranium come from, and where it should later be removed from the plutonium to the bomb, there are only likely estimates on these central questions.
It is also not known whether the food that could hide important traces is stored in these three places.
As if they had disappeared from the surface of the earth’s hundreds of freight vehicles, no one seemed to have information where the net was found.
Only a few kilometres away from El Kibar and on the other side of the Euphrates, which lies the salt of al-Tibni, which allowed Syria to control in 1998 as an appropriate storage for radioactive waste, considers the IAEA to be unlikely.
Former inspector IEAA Robert Kelley put him in touch with the reactor in one analysis of satellite images for the renowned Jane's Intelligence Review magazine.
However, images from space show that after the IAEA requested access, Syria carried out all suspected groundwork and removed large containers.
It could have been a coincidence, but it didn't help clarify suspicion.
In addition, the diplomatic circles say that the IAEA has spent many months drawing up a plan for auditors that would allow Syria to keep any military secrets - only this effort shows how much the interest of auditors is.
In the meantime, the lady also rejected this proposal.
If Western diplomats in Vienna have calmed down yet a year ago that the reactor is destroyed and therefore the thing is not burning, the US Ambassador Glyn Davies has been talking about so-called special inspections, which is one of the most robust means that the Vienna nuclear authority has to launch controls.
The head of the IAEA Yukiya Amano, who would have to propose the inspection, has already referred to "the possibilities to which I am staying in the future", but it is still valid.
This option poses a major risk: on the one hand, most of the IAEA Governing Council needs to do so and many of the 35 countries represented are definitely not interested in escalating.
On the other hand, as one diplomat points out, "What happens if they don't find anything?"
Love at the time of war
Since Angelina Jolie started working on the still unresolved state of affairs in summer, problems have arisen.
She wrote the script herself, it's about the loving story of a woman from Bosnia and a man from Serbia.
Much more he doesn't know yet - but that's also causing unrest.
They insist that the Muslim woman is in love with the Serbian man who raped her during the war in Yugoslavia.
The Bosnian women's groups immediately protested, so the planned film from Sarajevo to Hungary quickly moved.
In the meantime, the film has been filmed in Hungary and is in post-production, but still protesting in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic from the Organization of Women's War Victims wrote through the UN to help refugees from UNHCR Jolie and requested a meeting with the hero, now reported the Bosnian newspaper - Jolie is also a UN envoy to help refugees.
She's not exactly diplomatic - she offered women weeks ago in Hungary, but they refused.
The meeting must be held in Bosnia, said Hasecic.
In the camps where he was raped, the story of mercy was ignored, and Jolie’s attitude toward the victim reveals enough about the scenario.
Her organization therefore recommended that the UN-organization help refugees to miss Jolie as a embassy, the Guardian informs.
What scene did Jolie write exactly?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which has been able to read her script, has allowed for a smaller drawing in Sarajevo - it is not quite clear why Jolie has not yet arrived.
The young author emphasises that there is no political intention in his film that she has made a great effort to address the conflict in Yugoslavia, that she wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and give space to all the parties involved.
In view of the content, it remains uncertain.
Another version of the film on the Internet that sounds really different: lovers knew themselves before the war began and met again when she was as a Bosnian Muslim trapped in the Serbian camp where he served as a guard.
Which really sounds quite different than "the victim of rape falls in love with his torturer."
The fact that Jolie really starts the movie before the war - it's true.
Jolie claims that she is under pressure, which "is not fair and is based on misinformation".
Now they can release them from Hollywood's hackers: By publishing illegally on the Internet her script, as they have done many times.
Nothing but gone.
This evening it's good for Iry once again.
He's not even walking through grief.
The home team has a lot of control over its guests from Sweden, Finland and the United States.
Fans shout joy for the sound of loud music, with their feet ass.
Bailey-Pub in South Korea is hot because players throw tennis balls three meters away into beer cans - and they tremble.
"Privní pong" is called a bizarre theatre and it is possible to win 500 euros as a winning prize and to that end a flight to Las Vegas to the world championship in the beer pong in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet type; this twisted beer game and withholding computer, it doesn't work very well together.
Still, a 26-year-old man is trying to have fun, to respond to the anxious question that brings the future.
His plan is not a playful passion in Las Vegas, going to New Zealand on January.
"I have such a strange feeling," he says.
"It's so far away and I don't have a job there yet."
However, his girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland - "now she's got her dream job as an Event Manager, maybe it's a good sign," says a young man and smiles.
Because of bad looks at home, they've tried their luck abroad already two of the three relatives of Tanners.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now serves as an IT consultant in London.
Boys leave: Like Tanners, it seems in many families on the island.
100 000 Irish leave the country at an appropriate time, the experts of the scientific institute for the economy and social affairs of the ESRI in Dublin predict.
They count even until 2015 with 200,000 immigrants.
For such small land with only 4.5 million inhabitants, this is a major loss.
If the predictions are confirmed, similar refugee wave suffered by Ireland in the 1980s will occur.
After decades of rebellion, which brought great prosperity to the Irish, discontent is now expanding again.
The economic crisis destroys, above all, the young, educated Iry, who have only experienced a return.
The loss of employment and social decline seemed absurd in these years.
The need was everyone, the money was too much.
In the meantime, there are three out of ten women and men in their 30s without work.
In the Irish Times there are many letters from readers who complain: "All goes from hill to hill in Ireland."
"There should be a rise against politicians and bankers - who can, however, go away and our country loses the whole generation."
"The last one to die, please."
The law student Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish Student Union, sees the future in black, because the government only lies and young people do not offer any prospects for the future.
"They reduce minimum wages, but they have no strategy to create new jobs," says a 20-year-old.
He's watching her associates wander from one unpaid practice to the next.
Her greatest concern is that she'll have to move alone in four years.
"This thought is sad and depressing."
Men like Stephen McLarnnon are trying to see the topic positively.
McLarnnon organizes a "WorkingAbroadExpo", an exhibition that offers a full service on the subject of work abroad.
"For starters on the labour market, work abroad is an excellent opportunity to take the first steps on a career score," says the manager.
On his website are photos of surfers in Australia and skiers on a snowboard in Canada.
The report is clear: Working abroad is not galleys, but freedom and joy.
What it's like to build somewhere else, it's been six and a half years since Sean O'Donovan.
Since the 29-year-old engineer had no work in Ireland, he is now employed with 15 Irish colleagues to build in Germany.
He's just putting in the Gelsenkirchen fashion house.
In January, he goes to Hanover or to Berlin for another project.
In the meantime, O'Donovan will get a loan at home because he works in extra shifts so he can pay home a loan.
"Sometimes the situation is really a little crazy," he says, when the first long time goes beyond the dust of his own house.
"I spend money in Germany at a house in Ireland where I'm basically not."
He laughs in despair and he walks in cold rooms.
The small house is located in a good neighborhood with maintained gardens, a large expensive car park is parked in the driveway.
O'Donovan bought a house together with his sister four years ago for 380,000 euros - 100% financed by the loan.
"It was a crazy time, simple money was without a lot of questions," he says.
I'm afraid it wouldn't have been good with the loan?
O'Donovan thinks for a while, comes down with hot tea, and says, "I don't have the kids I'd have to live with, and I'm young; even if it's all wrong, I can start again."
A construction engineer doesn't like a call that he's hearing so often.
"No one must be hungry - our situation is not even as dramatic as it used to be on this island," he says.
"For a while to work abroad, it's not the worst thing that can happen - maybe then we'll just feel like the Irish."
He laughs and then tells about his father, who left behind the last economic crisis in England.
"After seven years he was back and his life went on in Ireland, quite simply."
Cian Tanner likes this idea.
Keep the open future and just wait for how life will develop elsewhere.
He's been working in London for several years, and why shouldn't it be in New Zealand for him and his girlfriend as well?
But there's one more thing that worries him pretty much in these days: celebrates his 27th birthday in Dublin on Friday.
She's afraid she might turn to a wedding party.
"Mostly no emotion," he says and drinks a good beer.
"Good-bye, that sounds disturbing."
"Let's call it a departure celebration, quite simply, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games."
Common practice of democracy
The support of democracy in Latin America is growing, as is support for private business.
Punctuality raises more fears than unemployment.
And Brazil considers many regions to be more influential than the United States.
These are some of the results of the current Latinobarometer survey, which took place in 18 countries and came out exclusively in The Economist magazine.
Since the survey has been carried out regularly since 1995, it is possible to monitor changes in positions across the entire area.
In this survey, which took place in September and early October, two related things dominate.
The first of them is that Latin America has a rather happy mood.
The second is to increase the stability of positions towards democracy and its key institutions.
The support of democracy in several countries across the Pacific in South America has grown significantly (see Table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth averaged 6% annually since 2002, the support for democracy increased from at least 40% in 2005 to 61% in this year.
She also grew up in Mexico, where the economy grew after a profound decline in production last year.
But only about half of those in Mexico and Brazil, two of the most populous areas, are democratic convictions, reaching the regional average (see chart 2).
About 44% of respondents across the region expressed satisfaction with the way democracy works in practice in their country, it is the same number as in last year, but compared to 2001, when it was 25%, it is a large increase (Graph 3).
The 34% survey found that they believed in snow in their country and 45% believed in the government, and again it was the same numbers as last year, but it was a big difference compared to 2003 (17% and 24%).
Ten years ago, she undermined democracy in Latin America's economic crisis.
Support arose during the global financial crisis probably because many Latin American countries suffered only a short recession and enjoyed a strong recovery.
In addition, the stronger social security network has helped to protect the poor.
(The Economic Commission of the United Nations for Latin America announced this week that the situation of Latin Americans living in poverty had only increased in 2009 and had decreased by 32% again this year.)
However, the tide changes in a wide range from country to country (see Figure 4).
The strong economic performance of Brazil and the popularity of its outgoing President, Luize Inácia Luly da Silvy, is reflected in a widely accepted sense of progress.
This situation is more rare in Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more serious and worsened the status of violent criminal activity.
Just a second time since the research began, more respondents across Latin America see as the most important problem of crime rather than unemployment (see chart 5).
The 31% claim that either they or their close relatives have become victims of criminal activity last year, but this is a decrease compared to 38% of the data last year and is also the lowest number since 1995.
The more massive economic performance is reflected in increasing support for private businesses and market economies: approximately 71% of respondents across the region say that private businesses are necessary for development, this percentage increased from 56% in 2007 (see Figure 6).
About 58% agree that the market economy is the only system that enables their countries to develop, this percentage grew from 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela have the same opinion (and 80% support private business), although their left-wing President Hugo Chávez owns many private companies.
Brazil is a country that has a leading position in the area, as 19% of respondents mentioned (against 18% in last year), followed by the United States (9%, against last year without change) and Venezuela (9%, against 11% in last year)
However, the United States is considered the most influential country of respondents in Mexico and much of Central America, and Venezuela is looking forward to success in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
Critical Options
No one expected the general elections in Haiti to be perfect on 28 November.
But they were far worse than outsiders who were trying to help the affected country to fear.
Elections marked the filling of the ballots and repeated voting, voting cards scattered by channels, broken polling rooms and intimidation.
Election rooms open after hours of delay.
Many Haitians, including many displaced for the reason of the ice earthquake, were wandering around and trying to find out where they could go to vote.
Some of them finally gave it up.
More than ten presidential candidates, including a number of alleged predecessors, shouted that it was a fraud and called after the election was cancelled.
Protests, some of them of a violent nature, spread throughout the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, a highly-established United Nations official in Haiti, said that "in many respects it was a pretty good choice."
Observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community have carefully said that "they do not believe that these inequalities, however serious, did not necessarily have to end the process".
In other words, the show goes on.
The electoral authority whose opposition votes are committed to René Préval, the non-popular outgoing president and his candidate Jude Célestin shall announce the preliminary results on 7 December.
The expected decisive struggle is planned for ice.
All election hopes are not lost.
Two leading opposition candidates Michel Martelly, rapper and Mirlande Manigat, the former first lady, withdrew from their original challenge to declare the vote invalid.
However, the problem may arise if Mr Célestin, who has little or no support between the voters, is marked by the electoral commission for reaching the decisive struggle.
Because of the regular epidemic of cholera and more than 1 million people who still live in the states after the earthquake, fear that the election will be low.
Finally, many Haitians wanted to vote, but for the sake of disorganization, they were prevented.
The 250 thousand IDs required for voting will be left undistributed shortly before the elections.
There's a lot of bets.
Gifts see the choice of legitimate and popular government as a key step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And it's clear, then, that the Haitian rule is on its own.
Add dots to center
In the weeks when she suddenly got here, Cristina Fernández, the Argentine president, was moved by public sympathy when her popularity increased from 20 to more than 50%, the highest level since she was elected in 2007.
However, turning this success into a successful campaign for the second term of office in elections next year can depend on whether the grieving Mrs Fernández gives incompatibility to her late husband, predecessor and political partner, Nestor Kirchner.
And it's all going to be true on these marks.
Mr Kirchner, who continued in economic policy and after his wife successfully became president, was accustomed to drawing up budgets that contributed to tax revenue, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the first couple to lose their next income according to their freedom.
Mrs Fernández's government lost most last year in Congress.
But the opposition split and was further destabilized at the death of Mr. Kirchner on October 27th.
Some members of the ruling political movement of Peronist joined Mrs Fernández.
But after the chaotic sessions (in which the government was indicted and accused of corruption) Congress was unable to approve the 2011 budget.
"I'm not going to come," said the president.
The 2010 budget will now also be paid for the next year, and the President will have more space to lose according to freedom.
The economy is overheating: this year is likely to grow to 9%.
The official inflation rate now reaches 11.1%, but many private estimates and experts are talking about numbers that are approaching 30%.
Mr Kirchner, who joined the office in 2003, when Argentina narrowed the economic collapse, set a priority on growth and poverty reduction rather than on inflation control.
He refused to deal with the IMF, made it difficult for the private sector and cleared the INDIC, a statistical agency that had joined the monitoring of official inflation statistics.
Can President Fernández now calm this policy?
She called for a discussion between private businesses and committee lecturers.
And her officials say they want to limit the growth rate to 18% next year.
Economics has been supported by world prices growth for the export of Argentine agricultural products.
But inflation was disrupted by growth based on a large devalvation in 2002.
That may be why President Fernández is aware that he wants to restore Argentine financial ties to the rest of the world.
At the beginning of this year, the government established an agreement with the debtor who had previously refused to restructure the debt that Argentina had not paid in 2001.
Now, Madam President Fernández's deal with the credible governments, which are grouped in the Paris Club, which owes about 6.7 billion dollars.
Kirchners always insisted on not having this reality under the supervision of the IMF as usual.
But last month Amado Boudou, the Minister of Economy announced that the fund would provide "technical assistance" to propose a new national consumer-price index, which will remind us of the start of cleaning INDIC.
It is not yet clear whether President Fernández will want to remain in politics after the end of the term of office when his husband is no longer on her side.
If you want to stay, you need to get support from the middle class, which is tired of surgery.
At the time of the return of the Argentines from the summer vacation they have in March, the wave of sympathy will fall.
If he wants to win another election, he will have to decide whether it is not necessary to speak quietly to many of the opinions that her husband stood up to in politics.
China's Half-Central Promotions
The Taiwanese voters are closer to a closer connection to the fortress.
What does Taiwan think about its big brother across the sea?
More than 7.5 million voters, 70% of those eligible, elected on 27 November of the city's old age and councils in five urban districts, which can be considered to be a wider assessment by President Ma Ying-jeu.
Mr. President Ma himself is a representative of the feelings that have prevailed and have strong influence in business relations, including agreements on partial free trade, in the greatest alignment of relations with China since 1949.
Mr. President Ma passed a test, but it was close.
Although his party Kuominang (KMT) finished winning three out of five mayors, she was unable to win most votes.
In addition, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which is in favour of greater independence in Taiwan, won almost 50% of all votes against 45% of the KMT party.
If it was a presidential election, President Ma would have trouble.
Since he was elected two years ago, his party's vote rate has decreased by about 8%.
First, the DPP party was together with KMT in the city councils.
The elections were played as a majority of Taiwanese elections, which include loud election trucks and mass gathering with the trainmen with the girls who are less dressed.
Part of it was even a secret attempt to assassinate.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan, honorary president of KMT, was agitated for KMT candidates in the evening of the election.
The man in the van shot young Mr. Lien straight through his face, wounded her and killed the viewer.
It was by no means determined whether the gunman intended to harm Mr. Leena or to settle the dispute with the candidate.
In any case, Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the DPP, claims that the shooting affected the elections, the suspicion falls on the DPP and leads the voters towards KMT.
Probably the only big winner of the campaign was China.
It was remarkable how she remained in the background of the question of the fortress itself.
Instead, the candidates were involved in plans for state housing and job creation.
Taiwan usually enjoys its de facto independence and hatred for China's military threat.
KMT therefore tends to avoid ties to the government in Beijing.
But this time the DPP also left behind the incitement of anti-Chinese attitudes.
It is a response to the facts and is aware that the Chinese trade has a key role to play in Taiwan's economic survival.
Mr. President Ma confirmed that China's policy is acceptable to most of Taiwan.
From the Beijing government, it can be expected that it will continue in commercial payments, together with its strategy to bring Taiwan back to its state.
China did not waste time sending the negotiator to Taipei to arrange a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
Of course, they would also like to see political integration, but in turn.
It will be better to wait after the 2012 presidential elections.
In any case, the DPP has revealed itself.
Two years ago she was at a bad level: her former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was sent to prison on charges of corruption.
The president in 2000-08 was a champion and a leader of clear independence.
But under Mrs. Tsai's leadership, a new generation has developed, which is moderate and the DPP is working hard to attract experts and young people.
Ms. Tsai was called a DPP candidate for the president, such as Su Tseng-change, who was standing under Mr. Chen.
Their sides are now doing everything they can to show that they can also cooperate with Beijing.
Ms. Tsai published plans for research institutes serving as a contact point between DPP and China, provided that their negotiations can take place without prior conditions.
Ms. Tsai tells the Taiwanese public that her party is a "confidential alternative" to Mr. Ma's surprised approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems to be angry with this move.
In his statement of intent, he expressed the view that DPP candidates would be better off if they claimed that Taiwan was a single country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatist, not to give up on the president.
But even without Mr. Chen's intervention, the DPP will fight a choice between potential candidates.
KMT is entitled to search for its own people.
Mr. Ma's assessment was wrong, and it was even through the passing pace of economic growth; KMT candidates did not want to go to the campaign with him.
His unfavorability seems to be based, in particular, on unemployment and deepening the gap between the rich and the poor.
Speaking KMT says he's reorganizing his cabinet, as well as the local side.
Strongly encouraged proposals for Taiwan's support for the binding of friendly contacts are limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese citizens consider economic integration with China as inevitable.
According to Antonia Chiang, a prominent publicist, "a point from which there is no return has already come."
Award for Grammy: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is a surprise in the category of the best new artist
A speech at the request of the President and people must be taken into consideration by law.
Esperanza Spalding, a 26-year-old jazz bassette and singer that President Obama chose to perform at the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony in 2009, is marked as one of Grammy's surprises in this year with a nomination in the category of the best new artist.
Given that Spalding has been celebrated on the jazz scene since 2008, when her album "Esperanza" came out, it came a little late, but it is in accordance with Grammy's rules, when the artist must not issue more than three albums before "the public identity of the given artist is established."
Her 2010 ambitious album "Chamber Music Society" certainly marked a step forward and thanks to her carefree vocal style and hand-held with elements like pop, funk and Latin, we can talk about Spalding as the success that Norah Jones, the closest equivalent for voters in Grammy, who are looking for similar steel works in this category in recent years.
Other jury Grammy rights rated the album Vijay Iyer Trio "History" in the instrumental album category, exciting, refreshing the ride of the album, which was a hot favorite last year.
Iyer will compete against James Moody's experienced saxophoneist "Moody 4B" and John Beasley's "Positootly."
Trombone Shorty, a brave favorite from New Orleans and a frequent guest in the HBO "Treme" series was rated in the current jazz category, which is otherwise suited to Stanley Clark's albums, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lober.
The wild group Darcy James Argue's Secret Society with the knowledge of steampunk gained several worthy recognitions in the category of large files, when in competition the chamber jazz Childs Ensemble and still brave Dave Holland, whose live album with Oct. "Pathways" created a beautiful example of how to have the base free hand as a hat.
Grammy Awards: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey leads to classical music
The nominations for classical music have a wide range of musicians and composers from around the world at the 53rd Grammy annual prices.
The leading position in the nomination is Michael Daugherty and his "Deus Ex Machine" for piano and orchestra, with five points and Steve Mackey with his album "Dreamhouse", eclectic orchestral work, with three points.
Among the nominated prisoners in Southern California were Estonian composer Arvo Pärt and his Symphony No. 4 "Los Angeles", a work ordered through Los Angeles Philharmonic and debuted at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
Founder in L.A. Avner Dorman and his Mandolin Concerto also has a chance to appreciate.
Nominations in classical music are divided into 13 categories that include orchestral, operal, congregational and solo recordings.
The category for classical music producer year has five nominees, including Blancon Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
The classic album was won by Bruckner and his Symphony No. 3 and 4 by the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty and his "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" by Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey and his "Dreamhouse" from the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals project; "Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati" by various artists; and Verdi's "Requiem" by Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
As for the category of operas, nominations are Berg and "Luu" by Orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasse and "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" by Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariaho and "L'Amour de Loin" by Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin and "The Enchanted Wanderer" by Orchestra and Chorus of the Mariinsky Theatre; and Arthur Sullivan and "Ivanhoe" by BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
Among the composers who are nominated to Grammy for contemporary compositions are Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machine," Hans Werner Henze for "Apphassionatto Plus," Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer."
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 had a premiere at Disney Hall in January 2009 at a show that was recorded by L.A. Philharmonic under Esa-Pek Salonen.
About 30 minutes' work is called "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to former oil magnet Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who is imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman and "Mandolin Concerto" were nominated for the instrumental soloist performance with the orchestra.
The writer from L.A. stated that he had written a 15-minute work specifically for the Mandolin interpretation of Avi Avivital, who was performing at a concert with Metropolis Ensemble, based in New York.
"I wrote it with the help of tone from the Middle East and many North African rhythms," Dorman said in a telephone conversation.
Director Pierre Boulez, 85, received nominations in the category for orchestral performance, led by Chicago Symphony in recording the work of Stravinska.
Among the instrumental soloists who received the nominations are pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; varhaník Paul Jacobs; housemaker Julia Fischer; and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
Among the nominated vocal soloists, only women were represented this year, including Anne Sophie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchon, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the class transition category she won the soprano nomination by Jesse Norman for her song "Roots - My Life, My Song."
The planned mix in Temecule is approved by the Planning Commission
The planned mix in Temecule received unanimous support from the local planning commission after more than five hours of extensive public witness.
Critics attacked the project that promotes terrorism and will lead to a stop to trade.
However, the jury decided on Wednesday night that the new religious centre is in accordance with local laws and will be aesthetically effective.
"Many good people have come to support this project - Christians, Jews, whom you will remember," said Hadi Nael, President of the Islamic Centre in Temecula Valley, Thursday morning.
"I am very proud of it as an American citizen."
"It means justice always wins."
"The opposition is minimal" he added.
"Those who are opposed only shout out loud."
"We have really great people in our valley."
The discussion began at six o'clock in the evening and lasted almost midnight, when most of the time they had discussions with people who were for or against the centre. These voices were evenly divided, the press-Enterprise said.
The discussion continued on the website of the news.
"America no longer exists," one comment appeared.
"We're planet monkeys with Socho's freedom stuck in the sand."
"America has fallen."
The planned Islamic Centre also launched protests in other parts of the country, including the vicinity of Ground Zero, the places of tragedy that took place on 11 September 2001, when terrorists were attacked in New York.
In Temecula Valley I have Mahmoud Harmoush's violence condemned.
His religious community of about 135 families was located in Riverside County after the summer without an incident, but he wanted more and more space than the storage space that he rented together with the manufacturer of filtering systems.
The new mix of dimensions 24 943 square feet in the Mediterranean style of architecture will also have two minerals and grow to height 43 feet.
It should take a place of 4.32 acres on Nicolas Road, about three kilometers east of the Chaparal High School.
The opponents can still appeal to the City Council regarding the project.
Microbes resistant to arsenic increase the possibility of new types of life on earth or elsewhere
The discovery of a strange bacteria that can use arsenic as one of its nutrients expands the space to look for new forms of life on Earth and perhaps even further.
Researchers have discovered unusual bacteria here on Earth and claim that it is a sign that life has options that are beyond the main elements that have been considered and fundamental to date.
"This organism has a dual capacity."
"It can grow either through phosphorus or arsenic."
"This fact is very special, but it is not evidence that it is a form of truly 'foreign' life," commented Paul C. W. Davies of Arizona State University, co-author of the report, which appeared on Thursday in the online issue of Science magazine.
It has long been considered necessary for the life of six main elements - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and cheese.
However, scientists have found that bacteria found in Mono Lake, California, are able to continue growing once phosphorus is replaced by arsenic.
"It will start to impress you as much as possible," said Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University, co-author of the report.
This finding is important for finding life outside the Earth, because researchers must be able to recognize life and know how life might look, said Anbar.
The study focuses on the microbes found on Earth.
However, a report on this newspaper was published to discuss it, which did not reveal the details of the findings, called for widespread Internet speculation that the report reveals the discovery of foreign life.
It's not like that.
The discovery "shows that other planetary organisms can be able to use other elements that run biochemistry and that now the elements we consider to be 'standard' must not be so necessary for life," explained Charles Cockell, professor of Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, Open University, Milton Keynes, United Kingdom.
Cockell wasn't part of the research team.
"This work is unusual because it shows the replacement of one element with other elements in the basic biochemistry and biochemical structure," Cockell added.
It wasn't an accident.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of the Astrobiological Institute at NASA, who conducted the study, focused on Mono Lake because it shows high levels of arsenic cold.
Arsenic and phosphorus are very similar chemical elements, so she thought that the microb that is exposed to both elements could be able to replace one another.
"Arzen is poisoned mainly because his chemical behavior is very similar to phosphorus."
"The result is that organisms can very difficultly separate these elements from themselves."
"The arsenic is so different that it doesn't work the same way as phosphorus. When it gets into the body, it starts working in biochemical processes," Anbar explained.
Scientists collect bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and present them with an increasing concentration of arsenic that are able to adapt and grow.
Microbes grow better in phosphoration, but given that they can also survive with a refund of arsenic, the possibility that the form of life that uses arsenic can be found naturally, either elsewhere on Earth or on another planet or in months where arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, an expert microbiology assistant at the University of Florida, said that the idea of arsenic, which could be replaced by phosphorus, was not new, but there was never an example to prove this.
Arzen was more common in the early days of the earth, she said, and so the scientists speculated that it could be used in earlier forms of life.
"This suggests that there could be other ways to create life, not only the way he was created in the early era of the Earth," said Foster, who was not part of the Wolfe-Simon research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Institute of Health
The remaining thefts of dogs were found in Compton
The remaining two of the four exhibition dogs that someone stole from the Bellflower motel were found.
Four exhibition dogs - two ears and the chief pembroke corgis - disappeared on Tuesday when someone stole Chevrolet Express van 2006, in which they spent the night at the Belflower 6 motel.
Two dogs were found in the middle of the afternoon and two dogs were left in the middle of the evening, Steve Whitmore, a spokesperson for the Los Angeles police department.
"The good news is that dogs are okay," said Whitmore.
"They're in good condition."
"They were handed over to their rightful owners."
Whitmore refused to say exactly where the dogs were found, at which location, but did not share detailed information regarding their findings.
"The investigation is still ongoing."
"We don't want to talk about it," Whitmore said.
"We follow the rules."
Dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were not arrested to speak for the case.
They were very happy to find their two hearings in a shelter in Downey in the middle of the afternoon.
The sheriffs found a van and two dogs separated in Compton.
Action Trace, three-year-old Trace dog and 10-month-old Didi, were unharmed, told the authorities.
But Bunny and Peter, the tribe of Welsh Corgi Pembroke Rickard and Peek, who had planned to participate in this week's regional competition on behalf of their Japanese owners, remained unfounded until their appearance late Wednesday.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, are this weekend in the city to attend AKC/Eukauba National Championship on Long Beach, where they planned to show Trace.
The other dogs were supposed to compete in other competitions planned in the days before the AKC/Eukanuba show, said the Beijing Journal The Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is just one stop on almost a month's trip to the dog shows.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard registered to the motel.
They often sleep in motels and park their car in front of the room window.
They also took three dogs - a dog boxer, Parson Russell terrier and a British oven - who stayed with them in the motel room.
Akity and Pembroke Welsh corgis left in the car where they were supposed to be colder.
They've opened the windows a little bit, so dogs in the car have enough fresh air.
Peek and Rickard announced car theft at 6 a.m. on Tuesday.
Peek said he'd offer a reward to anyone who's taken to missing dogs. Dogs have implanted microchips to identify them.
It wasn't clear on Thursday that prices would be paid.
Lev is again ready to scream now that the restructuring of MGM is obtained from the final approval court
After 18 months of shock and uncertainty, MGM finally got green to start over.
On Thursday, the Federal Insolvent Judge of New York officially blessed the creditors' plan to balance about $5 billion in debt and clean up the way for 86 years of old entertainment company, which focuses on the production and production of films and television shows.
Fourthly, that the plan meets the requirements of the US competition order does not leave MGM any legal impediments to restart the founders Spyglass Entertainment Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the main managers of the completed study.
The number of employees will decrease by approximately 320 from the originals by more than 400.
MGM does not come out of Chapter 11, until JPMorgan Chase agrees on planned financial resources that allow a loan of $500 million to finance new operations and production of MGM.
It is now about connecting to an investment bank, which itself needs $75 million and funding is expected around half December.
The restructuring process began in May 2009, when the investment bank Moelis & Co. was hired to advise management on how to resolve its finances, as management was fighting to allow interest payments of $300 million a year.
In August, President Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, former Director-General of Enron and an expert at the company known for his work for Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelise and Cooper tried to solve the financial difficulties of MGM and 140 study believers long before expected.
After a few months of discussion, the parties agreed that by the end of 2009 they would sell the company.
Although auctions attracted a number of stakeholders, none of them were willing to pay $2 billion plus the funds that the creditors demanded.
In the spring of this year, everything was back on the drawing board and the MGM team began working on a restructuring plan. After months of discussion and internal disagreements, the plan was finally approved by the faithful at the end of October.
When MGM officially resigns from the competition in the following weeks, Moelise and Cooper will receive a multi-hamilion dollar bonus for their work.
Moelis & Co., who has already received $1.2 million, will receive $9.5 million.
The cooperative companies that are indicting for their services that run the company's business, $375 000 a month, will receive a reward for their success, i.e. "success fair" $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum are planning to renew production in MGM, which only released one film this year and to put together a proposal for seven or eight films that will be released in early 2012.
They also plan to contribute to the financing of two films, which will be presented in the "Hobit" book, along with Warner Bros.
The studio needs a special loan between $265 million and $275 million to finance its share of these two films that Peter Jackson will direct.
Investor Carl Icahn, who owns approximately 18% of MGM's debts, was looking for the possibility of joining Lions Gate Entertainment, which is the largest shareholder.
However, the recent negotiations between the two companies did not reach an agreement.
Technology toys that will keep your budget on the balance of gifts
This year's leading candidate is the most amazing iPad player that follows the video game system. In both cases, it is a significant contribution to the budget for gifts.
Consider that at the price of one iPad you can buy five rounds of BMX for $99 and one game Kinect stands the same as 10 coral pliers or about 48 kilns Play-Doh.
But there's a way to keep your budget for gifts in balance.
I recently visited three national players - Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and BJ's Wolesale Club - and watched what electronic toys I can buy for less than $80.
It was immediately clear that Moore's law is working; this year's technological players have far more energy, at the same prices, if not less, compared to the past years.
While relatively less new games have emerged with associated websites, two of the most famous players of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, offer more.
The number of toys with button batteries is increasing, as is the number of toys with battery chargers.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices indicated are from Toys "R" Us, except for cases otherwise specified.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, 13$, 3 years old) are lyrical animals that sing when you press them.
At one click, the animal emits a tone and the second press begins to create a song.
If you buy more than one, they'll sing together and harmoniously.
Warning: Once you start playing, you can't stop.
The best choice in singing and dancing is Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, $60, 2 years)
Last year, I borrowed 14 thumbs from Elmo Live technology, which can play Simon Says game and can also take a month's walk thanks to its innovative fixed leg with blocking the wheel.
Children test Mickey's dance instructor's toy, even though their parents complain about lack of voice control.
If you are an 80-year-old child, you may remember Alphie, one of the first computer educational games.
He's back, (Hasbro/Playskool, $40, for children 3 years old), with a bag full of quiz cards that are designed so that the car turns into a fun with work with a self-corrected, funny work bag.
If you send a smartphone for your child, here are three independent alternatives.
VTech's MobiGo (60$, for children from 3 to 8 years) is the cheapest option with simple use, with qwerty keyboards, although the games do not have as effective an education as Leapster Explorer (70$, for children from 3 to 12 years), the first major change in the Leapster series from Leapfrog, with a newer and clearer display.
No version is compatible with older units.
iXL from Fisher-Price (90$, for children from 3 to 7 years) uses iTunes-like to introduce games and e-books and has an SD card slot that allows you to display family photos.
And finally, Scrabble Flash (30$, Hasbro, for children 8 years of age) is a five-bit file that is not larger than a box from the back, each of them has an LED display.
The goal is to create words by placing the bones in a row before the time expires; it is great for competition in improvised word creation.
More and more toys have at least some kind of online connection.
At the highest level, two Webbins and Club Penguins were represented in toys.
If you want your child to buy an online game from Club Penguin, you can choose for example Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, $5, for children from 6 to 12 years old), which contains coins with hidden code.
When you activate the online code, your child will get enough credit in Club Penguin store on any two items.
This could include a collegiate brush or a puffle animal.
About something slightly bigger than your toothbrush is Hexbug Nano (10$, for children 5 years old), the latest in a number of microbots on a button battery.
Brouk moves fast on 12 vibrating silicone legs in a random direction.
It's fun when you're making a mess out of the bone and you're watching if he can find a way out.
He's also very strong.
Our guy was able to fall off the kitchen table and even spend some time in the depths of our dog.
Introducing closer police controls in China
As the city's military instructor, Tang Shenbin went to the square, scrutinized his orders and issued orders with the military authority.
He wanted women members - Chinese state-run fans of the city order, frightened and turned back for their hard moves and violence - to convey a certain sense of humor on the surrounding noise.
"Stand straight!"
"Hurry up!"
Show them, squeezing quietly, "How beautiful girls look!"
Four very young girls in white gloves and the same oil caps and pants stood out.
Four pairs of black boots are sorted as straight.
Four head coverings perfectly sit on the hair that are perfectly bound by blue and white stems.
"I personally think they look average," said Mr. Tang.
"Models are nice."
More than one government tried to revive the image of the city’s overseers in China.
One city ordered new branches to have higher education.
The province of Guangdong has changed gray-green uniforms into a seemingly more attractive blue.
Wuhan in Central China replaced the view of the armed forces: in a report in 2009 it was stated that 50 officers surrounded an uninterrupted vehicle with candles and looked up to the owner when the domestic salesman packed and departed for half an hour.
Xindu, the period of 680,000 people in Chengdu, have chosen the operation as the main image.
Since 2003, he has supplemented his city police with 13 women, who have been selected specifically from their perspective, proportionality and youth.
The aim is to show a brighter, female side, besides the rough side of the police.
Unfortunately, Scarlett Johansson himself would have had trouble getting to the secret Chinese city groups.
They'd argue the critics for good reason.
Unlike the police, these police officers are allowed only to promote the city's statement, to hold fines and other administrative positions.
But Chinese media usually capture a different reality.
In January 2008 police inspectors from the province of Hubei turned an unparticipated viewer to death after he used his cell phone to film as they began in the case of a protest against the plot.
Last year, police training was carried out in Beijing, a manual for this training was stolen and placed on the Internet. The manual was, among other things, a description of how to effectively beat the perpetrators without a blood mark.
This year, an underground dealer with melons in Shanghai got into a fight with five policemen and suffered a left-handed brain injury.
One video game full of violence that can be downloaded online shows Chinese policemen how they attack street salesmen.
"Chengguuan scared the government," China Daily, a national edition, called last year after another discussion on tactics.
There was "a really thorough cleaning" on the paper.
Skeptics say that such an approach is not enough.
After a period of interest in eight new women's police officers in October, the Introductory The Beijing Evening News asked whether women had real responsibilities or were just disillusioned.
The answer seems to be from both sides.
The course required women from 18 to 22 years of age with a good attitude and "five faces in the right proportion."
Adepts should be higher than the average - above 1.6 meters.
The 26th-century service is compulsory.
Officials claim that work is psychologically too demanding for women over 25 years of age.
"Their image is an important thing," said one unnamed policeman at Rednet.com, as if on government websites.
"The candidates must first demonstrate the external qualities, which then determine others, are among them the height, weight, face, etc."
Then it comes to a number of nature and "internal quality".
Women are like flowers, he said, "In addition to being married, they will also have other responsibilities."
Zheng Lihua, the deputy director of the city's management, disagrees very much with this description.
But he insisted that the requirements for height are also common in China for other jobs, both sexes.
Just like a request for a symmetrical face.
Which means that the question of a good look is between China's subject of discussion.
A medical condition or freezing will certainly not apply.
"He can't allow a chrome or a rough man to serve us," said Mr. Zheng.
"His image wouldn't be good."
Liu Yi, who keeps watch at Baoguang Square near the monastery, is 22 years old, face like an apple and a well-formed mouth.
She doesn't know that the focus on her view could have an existential root, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asked with an ironic look.
Her collaborator with the streets, 21-year-old Xu Yang says, "Our task is to represent the image of the city."
They have no objection to their limited performance, they said, because their career ambitions are more than just launching traders into a street where they can perform their activities.
Every morning, a group stands against more than ten thugs running on foot or on wheels and is trying to sell as many noodles and tofu missions as possible before they are expelled.
"Mr. Wang, you have to leave."
"We've told you so many times!" said Ms. Xu, when he started running away, and for a time he left his bike with a nude car.
The police describe their responsibilities as more monotonous than ours.
"Every day is basically the same," said Huang Jing, 20, who studies in his free marketing.
"Great routine."
One reason is that women policemen have no power as their male opponents to entertain the goods.
They can only threaten to report the facts to their male leader.
The trend is then to protect them from sudden public manifestations of hostility against the official apparatus that are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, woke up after false news about police killing the sellers.
More than ten police officers or police officers were injured in the night hours; 14 government vehicles were turned or burned.
Xinda's escaped this kind of violence.
But peace can be guaranteed only by the burden.
Only two blocks from the quiet town of Baoguang, where police officers were watching that morning, more than 50 people gathered at the corner of the street.
The police had fun with a motorcycle that was repaired on the sidewalk in the interior of the store, as required by the rules.
The car owner could have cried as he wanted.
15 minutes away from the police station, facing the train, with the vehicles and quickly off with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, the coordinator of the male group, remained behind, his white mark turned around to hide his name.
Like women policemen, the coordinators are men over 40 years of age who already have only a helpful role.
Unlike them, they are not educated in maintenance and image storage.
"Sometimes we fight verbally."
"Sometimes we fight physically," said Mr. Li in effect.
"Most of the time, it's the public that starts with it."
Prosecutors will not accuse Senator Ensign
The prosecutors of the Ministry of Justice cleared Senator John Ensign of the criminal charge regarding his affair with his former campaign advisor and his efforts to secure lobbying, announced to the senator on Wednesday.
The decision ends the most serious legal threat that Mr. Ensign, the Nevadian Republican, faced and was, until the time of the scandal, considered to be a possible Republican candidate for the president for 2012. His affair got to the national headlines and damaged his career.
Mr Ensigna's office said it was a decision that followed almost after the annual investigation, "very pleased".
The Senator could still face disciplinary action on the Senate's ethical committee.
Mr. Ensign's lawyers said that the Ministry of Justice "has informed us that Senator Ensign will no longer be the object of the investigation and that he is not planning to bring further accusations against him on this matter."
The Ministry of Justice refused to comment on the case.
The decision was a surprise to many ethical lawyers outside the Ministry of Justice who claimed that there was serious evidence that Mr. Ensign had prepared a violation of the federal lobbying ban.
The interviews, e-mails and other documents that were published in October 2009 in the New York Times indicated that Mr. Ensign helped Douglas Hampton, one of his assistants, to secure a lucrative lobby that would lead to the silence of Mr. Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, about the senator's relationship with her.
Mrs. Hampton used to work as a treasurer in Ensigna.
Mr Ensign contacted a number of political supporters to find work for Mr. Hampton and support their views after Mr. Hampton was employed to lobby them, so much documents and talks are being presented.
Since Hampton was recently assistant to Mr Ensigna, he was expelled from the law from lobbying his former employer or Senate for a year.
The ethics experts claim that the unusual arrangement of Mr. Ensign and Mr. Hampton, who were friends before the affair, proved to be contrary to the lobbying ban.
From the evidence that was published "it has been shown that it is a clear case of the preparation of a violation of the law," said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in protecting clients who are investigating the government.
While the officials of the Ministry of Justice refused to explain the reasons for the decision in the matter of Senator Ensigna, Mr Brand and other ethics lawyers said that the ministry was careful with regard to political complaints, according to a large number of incidents, including the decision last year to postpone the complaint against former Senator Ted Stevens in the face of the suspicion of State representation.
Federal prosecutors "clearly hid weapons," said Melanie Sloan, executive director of the organization Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington), a group that filed several complaints against Mr. Ensignov in this matter.
"It shows that the laws do not apply to highly-established government officials," she added.
Paul Coggins, the chief lawyer of Mr Ensigna, announced in the interview that on Monday he was called by the State Representative of the Ministry of Justice and then on the second day, and told him that the ministry had not sought any charges against his client.
Mr Ensigna's defence team cooperates with the complainant in trying to convince him that the senator, as his office repeated in the mid-term statement, "has agreed in accordance with the law."
Mr Coggins refused to clarify the legal arguments he submitted to the representatives.
"I am not pleased to count the details of my discussions with the Ministry of Justice, except that we think they made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Electoral Commission decided to suspend the investigation of the individual complaint, in which the ethical group alleged that the payment of Ensigna Hamptons' parents in the amount of $96,000 violated the federal electoral law.
The Electoral Commission stated that it did not have enough evidence to prove that the money meant nothing but a gift.
One company for which Mr. Ensign helped Mr. Hampton find a lobbyist job was NV Energy, a leading NGO company that has supported the senator for a long time.
One e-mail from December 2008 showed that after Mr. Hampton started acting as a lobbyist in the company, Mr. Ensigna - John Lopez's employees - he communicated with Mr. Hampton and told him that he "was" to the Ministry inside about the subject under discussion.
Mr. Ensign also participated in lunch with Mr. Hampton and other non-resident customers, Allegiant Air, and called on the Minister of Transport to arrange a meeting on behalf of the airline after I hired Mr. Hampton at the lobby.
When Mr. Ensign first came up with a report on the affair last year, he apologized to his wishes and resigned to his office as a fourth Republican leader in the Senate.
After a months of stagnation, Mr. Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he was planning to participate in the third election period in the Senate.
In the report that Mr Ensign is no longer the aim of investigating the criminal act of his spokesman Jennifer Cooper, the senator hoped that the ethical commission would follow the Ministry of Justice quickly and complete the entire investigation.
"Sentor Ensign is looking forward to continuing in his hard work on behalf of the Nevado people," she said.
Challenge of the village of Cheshire on Twitter
In a number of court cases, half of them were written.
A minute or so, they sent news about a terrible witness on Twitter.
Finally, the defense says that more than 140,000 Twitter reports were involved in raping and bringing children to bed in a house that was burned down.
On Thursday, Steven J. Hayes was sentenced to death by three Cheshire, Connecticut, family, and was sentenced to an official death sentence for which the jury voted.
But Mr Hayes' lawyers have already appealed to the court with applications and arguments that the court would probably employ for years.
One of the most provocative is that the intensive reporting of the process - including the expanded use of Twitter's main reporters - created a "circuit atmosphere" and this expanded, without immediate disclosure of information with absorbing details, then introduced the jury in decision-making in the sense of public opinion.
This claim might cause the judge to question whether new technologies also require new rules in the court.
"As I have experienced this transformation, I think there is a real danger that the inclusion of new technologies in the courtroom affects the right of a fair trial for individuals," said Thomas J. Ullmann, chief defender of Mr. Hayes.
The judge of the proceedings of Jon C. Blue of the Supreme Court of the State has expressly rejected the claim regarding the outcome of the week and that the means of communication were "very controlled" and that there is no evidence to suggest that the jury was acting under the influence of the public.
But it's probably not about the last word in this case.
After decades of trial, it was recognised that notorious reports of known cases could raise questions about the fairness of the trial.
In the 1966 U.S. Supreme Court of Justice, Dr. Sam Sheppard was sentenced to death for his wife's murder, when he said in his decision that in the case of Sheppard versus Maxwell, he was "a carnival atmosphere" during the reporting process.
Some people are convinced that this criminal act was an inspirational television show and a movie called "Spring."
Some lawmakers said that the appeals brought by Hayes' judgment about half a century later could be surprised by the argument that new rules might be necessary to determine how to communicate in a judicial direction, which in the case of Dr. Sheppard was unsubstantiated.
"There is a general reason for concerns about the impact of new media," said John J. Donohue III, professor of law Stanford Law School, who studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report that said it was done voluntarily.
Professor Donohue stated that some judges may be concerned with the idea that a limit on direct communication from the courts may make the trial more just.
The Twitter case is only one of many of Mr Hayese's lawmakers who would be able to argue for years to hold a verdict.
The defendants also claim, for example, that in Mr Hayese's case, it may be assumed that when Judge Blue refused to allow him to test the reaction of potential jury members by showing them criminal photographs of the threat at the time of the jury's election.
Some of the jury stated that they were frightened by the photos of the victim that Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughter Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11.
The defendants claim that they also reject the sentence of death and claim that the judge wrongly dismissed the jury, which was critical to the state representatives, and that by his decision he wrongly imposed a greater pressure on the verdict and directed the jury to think about the weekend.
The jury wasn't separated.
But their arguments about the extent of the process can attract the greatest interest.
They stated in the opposition to the verdict made last month that the case was dominated by reports in Connecticut and was discussed during the election campaign against the governor and Senate of the United States.
They argued that the means of communication were constantly inhaling the flames of emotion in this case.
"Today's media, camera and reporters before the court," the lawyer wrote, "there was something that has not yet been seen here in New Haven, and it may also be about national rarity."
Their focus on Twitter is controversial.
In the discussions, some reporters claimed that the immediate reporting was more encouraging than the reports later mentioned, and in their view the judicial police should control the scope of other proceedings.
However, some lawyers have demanded court appeal with often used arguments that social and technological changes require the adaptation of courts.
Mr Hayes' lawyers are working on this right.
In their archives they referred to the decision of the Supreme Court of 1966 in the matter of Dr. Sheppard's judgment, because of the wider functioning of the process and wanted to clarify the requirement that the new media require new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "is the case of Sheppard versus Maxwell in the 21st century."
Can the court be overrun by a disaster?
After a campaign that was remarkable for its aggressiveness and negativeism, a small number of courtrooms appeared this week in Washington.
Is it the first owner of real cooperation between the two political parties or just an illusion moment before a quick return to the side fighting in the capital?
The internal negotiations of President Obama and the parliamentary leaders did not bring any key findings on the key issues to be discussed during the meeting.
However, in each case, the debate was debated on the differences of opinion between the two parties, as well as defining their common responsibilities, rather than the next empty episode of the side-up.
The Central Public Meeting of the President's Deficit Commission was also civilised, despite the political differences that remain between the members.
It seems clear that close association has been building mutual respect for several months, which exceeds the ideological gap that members continue to divide.
And it's pretty hard to say she started a new era of cooperation.
Both sides are now in the trial period - each of which examines the signs of collegiality and compromise, and is trying to assess the limits of public opinion and the volition of tolerance towards the renewed foreign war.
Therefore, Tuesday's proceedings and its subsequent evaluation of the participant were also conducted with minimum requirements or charges.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republic are too broad and too deep to propose a rapid change in the conditions that have been in place for the last two years.
Whether it's a question of taxes, expenses, health care or rights, both sides are miles away.
However, November's elections prepared Washington at least quickly.
"There is no question that regulatory issues have changed," said Pete Wehner, Bush's administrator, now at the Ethics and Public Policy Center.
"They're inevitable after the election.
The election exploded the emotions of the parties and then you calmed down.
It's good."
In a number of questions, especially those to be discussed at the meeting, Republicans and democratics have a small chance of finding solutions.
Bus' tax reduction at the end of the year has been exhausted and no one considers it to be favourable.
Both sides want to find a way to protect some or all of them, and it's either permanent or temporary.
Like a possible compromise on unemployment rates, only because Republicans cannot look at how they support the reduction of taxes on the property while the unemployed refuse unemployment support.
After Tuesday's discussion in the White House, it is already more optimistic about the possible agreements on these issues, together with the ratification of the new opening agreements.
But William Galston of the Brookings Institution points out that successful cooperation on key issues will not necessarily lead to the relationship between the two political parties when the 112th Congress calls for ice.
It's more likely a period of disagreement, or even inevitable, he said.
"After doing the things that have to be done, psychology will soon return to one of the confrontations," he said.
Wehner also expressed skepticism - which is to a considerable extent expanded - that the division will lead them to genuine cooperation.
"I look at all events between today and 2012 as a shadow box, when the main events will take place in 2012," he said.
The reasons are largely related to the construction of a new republican majority in the White House and the electorate of tea parties that helped create it.
The Republican leaders are now facing the threat of recovery, they know that they must comply with their promises, and they must reduce government expenditure and abolish the new health care law.
These lines are clear in the initial response to the recommendation on the deficit, which includes reform of the tax legislation and an increase in some taxes, an increase in the age of retirement and a reduction in expenditure.
The joint presidents Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken on the task of one of the most difficult tasks in Washington and, in their opinion, have to develop the pressure on the deficit issues to the public program of ways that cannot be ignored.
However, they need 14 votes in the 18th member committee in order to present their plan as an official recommendation and thus fight to get as close as possible to that number.
The biggest resistance is among the elected officers in the jury who propose that we have, at least today, a small foundation or a will for compromise in the case of financial matters.
Galston predicts two phases in the battles between the White House and the parliamentary republics.
The first year will begin in the form of the parties' conflicts, when the Republics will call on Obama to resolve the budget, the data and health care, when the period of greater party cooperation will follow.
What's going on with the motion?
Public opinion.
There is a lot of evidence that, despite the fact that the last election is on the sidelines, most Americans still want to see two sides working together.
If it could be addressed to the pat, as it was in 1995, then both parties will be very careful to follow the public’s response.
Anyone will be threatened by a reduction of votes, will likely change the course and seek a compromise.
That could be an optimistic look at the thing.
Page and orientation are greater today than it was in the mid-1990s, and it is shown that there has been a greater ideological gap between Obama and the parliamentary republics than it was in the case of Republicans and Bill Clinton.
At the same time, activists on both sides see 2010 as a prerequisite for more important elections in 2012.
On the basis of this reality, the court that appeared this week would welcome many Americans.
But it will take a lot of effort on both sides to find common foundations on issues that still divide them.
The U.S. document likes Moscow as a shelter for corruption
The city's operation is in the hands of "kleptocracy" and it continues part of the payments and protection payments that come on the way to Kremlin, the US Embassy in Russia met in February's records.
The police and the Federal Security Service have largely held protective wings that help explain the high cost of living in Moscow.
They choose money not only from legal transactions but also from organised criminal groups.
Every level of bureaucracy - which Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called "vertician authority" - will take his money when the money starts to shift from the top to the top.
The video that was sent to Washington on behalf of Ambassador John Beyle was published on Wednesday through WikiLeaks on their website.
The record is based on the sources whose name has been written.
The record was written at the time when he was still an elder Yuri Luzhkov and accused her of much corruption.
He was summoned by President Dmitry Medvedev in October, but since then we can only watch minimal changes in the clean.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelen Baturin, who owns a prominent construction company, have repeatedly denied the charges of corruption after many years, and has won several complaints for guilty charges for such an action.
In September, he said to the Russian TV station when he was questioned about proven evidence of corruption: "It's crazy, it's dirty, it's bullshit."
The Russians with absolute conviction believe that if their company is corrupt, it will show itself to vote.
It is, however, unusual to meet such details in such a manner, and it is also in the ambassadorial report, and it is also unheard of to do so by diplomats from foreign countries.
"The government of Moscow and its connection to criminal lives have led some to call it 'disfunctioning,' and confirm that the government works more as a cliptocracy than a government," the report says.
"Criminal elements are enjoyed by the so-called 'krysha' (a term from the world of crime and mafia, which literally means 'treasure' or protection) provided by the police, the Federal Security Service, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of the Interior and the Office of the State Representative, as everywhere in Moscow's government bureaucracy.
"Analytics have also identified a three-way structure in Moscow's criminal world."
"Luzhkov is on his own top."
"The Federal Security Service, the Ministry of the Interior and the militia are at second level."
"And finally, at the lowest level, they are ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors."
"It is an ineffective system in which criminal groups fill empty spaces in some areas, because the city does not provide certain services."
The report says the FSB is taking money from the largest companies and the police are focusing on smaller businesses.
One source said, "Business owners in Moscow realize that it is better to get protection from the FSB or the Ministry inside (more than organised criminal groups) because they do not only have more weapons, resources and forces than criminal groups, but are also protected by law."
"For this reason, protection from criminal gangs is no longer in the course."
The record says that while the choice of money is complex, protection itself can already have problems; even those who pay can sometimes be arrested.
Those who don't pay fast enough are closing their shops under different locks.
The bear several times talked about fighting corruption, but he admitted that he only made little progress.
The embassy report speaks of men taking suitcases, probably heated cash, into the Kremlin itself.
"In its fight against corruption, Medvedev must rely on bureaucrats," said George Satarov, director of the Moscow Research Team India.
"But it's part of this office."
"There is no part of the political class, because there are no political classes in Russia anymore."
Without politicians, without opposition, without division of power, corruption is inevitable, he said.
Indem estimates that corruption in Russia worldwide is worth more than $300 billion a year.
The country is ranked 154th place in a recent survey on the global perception of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International (the country is sorted from at least to the most corrupt).
The discovery of the US Embassy's report, which appeared in Moscow until late evening hours, certainly did not bring excitement to the Russian government, although only to the extent that the Moscow deficit can be blamed for Luzhkov, it may be a possibility for Kremlin to argue on the issue of solving the problem.
During a CNN interview with Larry King, Putin reported that the documents that WikiLeaks published could have been pedigreed and responded in anger to the statement that American diplomats call him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth about the whole issue is that it is about our mutual solidarity, which is an important factor in domestic policy in this country," he said.
"But to be honest, we didn't think it would be done with such arrogance, with such pressure, you understand, so ethical."
The Red Khmer veterans are forced to settle with the past
In the lighted concrete school, the head of the Anlong Veng High School, who built it, recalled the man who was the leader of the Rudh Khmer Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves the Mok."
"He was a good leader and took care of his people," said Serng Kor Ma, 42.
Known as the "stork" for its harshness during the Rudh Khmer government, the commander of this remote country of the Rudh Khmer in northwest Cambodia remains popular, where he has built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure and where thousands of former soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after Rudi Khmer gave up the government, there is a long-lasting loyalty also in Anlong Veng.
In April, a victim of truth and reconciliation was made publicly available to confront people who were part of the regime.
In June, the government provided students who first explain to their children the history of the Red Khmer and their former soldiers.
And in July together the United Nations and the Cambodian Court will bring the first sentence of the former member of the Red Khmer, a verdict of a leader, a notorical known violent association Tuol Slang, Kaing Khek Iev, known as the Spirit, to 35 years in prison.
With all such progress, the riot between the Red Khmer veterans in Anlong Veng has grown, which complicates efforts to calm down and their attempts to reintegrate into Cambodian society.
"Ex-Rudy Khmer is a mystery and fear, but they are powerless to do anything," said Chhang Youk, director of the Cambodian Documentation Centre, an independent organization that examines the regime.
"The life of the Red Khmer was beautiful for them, but the regime became a symbol of evil."
"It gives birth to families."
During the Rudh Khmer government in Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, according to estimates, 1.7 million people were killed in hunger, disease, or reprocessing.
When the Vietnamese attacked and defeated the government of Paul Pot in 1979, the rest of the regime and its soldiers fled to the Cambodian border with Thailand.
There they started the uprisings that lasted until the last move in December 1998.
Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led partial wars from their foundations in mountains and jungles in western Cambodia, while Ta Mok cultivated stupendence in Anlong Veng.
But in the middle of the 1990s, after a peaceful agreement, sponsored by the United Nations, the country was led to the first democratic elections in 1993. A large group of Red Khmer fighters began to move to the government, which was the capital of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Paul Pot died of natural death in 1998 and Ta Mok, who survived, was arrested by government forces in 1999 in the nearby mountains of Dangrek.
He died in Phnom Penh prison in 2006 while waiting for trial.
Their mercenaries were no longer concerned with them, most of the former Khmer fighters fell into the ordinary Cambodian rural life and many of them nostalgicly remembered the time of movement.
Although several elite Red Khmers held their local government position in exchange for their weapons, their position remains weak as unqualified farmers.
"These people had only minimal benefit from the capitulation," said Sok Leang from the Centre for Justice and Reconciliation, which leads a public forum throughout Cambodia, including Anlong Vengu.
"They are surrounded by utopian agrarian ideology of the regime."
"They were raising without any idea of the realisation of the trade."
Sir Lim, 55, who joined Rudj Khmer as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlong Veng before sitting as a poor farmer in 1998.
"Life under the Red Khmer was good," he said.
"The Mok enjoyed all."
"But now life is hard, because we all have to make sure of ourselves."
The Running Court of the Red Khmer has also raised concerns.
At the beginning of next year, the court will investigate Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sarah and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Minister of the Khmers.
The court has a mandate to challenge the commanders and the people responsible for the crimes, but it has not been said that it will continue in the four cases.
It was just a bit to calm the fears in Anlong Veng.
Recent media speculations focused on Im Chaema, 64, who was the regional leader in the province of Banteay Meanchey during the Rudh Khmer government at the end of the 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers from the Documentation Centre in Cambodia that she was looking at the construction of Trapeang Thma, a project that probably killed thousands of forced workers.
Recently, Im Chaem returned from field work to his wooden house on a dirty road outside Anlong Veng.
As the sun began to rise and the shadows appeared over the dry grass, Im Chaem refused to talk about his past among the Red Khmers.
If the court had called her, she would have refused to leave.
"In Cambodia there is peace and stability," she said.
"If there's another criminal offence, there's gonna be a war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who passed away from the Rudh Khmer in 1978, also repeatedly warned that there would be instability if the court was to seek out other suspects, although experts and historians disagree.
"Cambodia must dig a deep hole and bury in it the past," he said.
But confrontation with the past is just what Cambodia has to do to move forward, Chhang Youk from the documentation center said.
"Smoothing in the Khmer Way means the blinding of broken pieces," he said.
"It's our duty to put these broken pieces together so that we can understand."
The Centre issued the first students approved by the Government of Rudh Khmer, has 75 pages and the name "History of Democratic Cambodia."
It was distributed in Anlong Veng in June as an addendum to the history of the Ministry of Education, which contains less than four parties on the Rudh Khmer.
Like many people in Cambodia, young people in Anlong Veng knew only a few details about the Red Khmer, even through the connection of the city with the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, high school student in Anlong Veng said that the new textbook helps students understand the important parts of their history.
But his parents were skeptical when he took home a book to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the classroom and courts," he said.
"They're suspicious because they're not sure how many people will be sued."
Such resistance makes the reconciliation process more complex and more difficult," said Sok Leang.
But the public forum, the students and the court are beginning to have an influence, they're going to communicate.
The Red Khmers here still have a strong spell.
Up in the mountains Dangrek Mountains is a long road with a muddy puddle and a puddle-shaped plastic bag that leads to a black bag covered with a secure back cover.
The body of Paul Pota was burned here on a pile of tires after his death in 1998.
Noum Sothea, 31, a mobile salesman on the side of the road said he didn't know much about the man who was in that place.
"But there is a strong spirit, many local people come here and pray to him," she said.
Noum Sothea was born and was planning to visit the place of Pol Pota's rest, where she would bring a string of mature bananas in hopes of bringing her luck.
Belarus agrees that its equipment seems to be on the basis of uranium
In a surprise victory in President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear material worldwide, the Belarusian government announced on Wednesday that they are giving up their supplies of highly enriched uranium, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The agreement was published in a joint declaration issued after the Security Summit of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs by Hillary Rodham Clinton and the Belarusian Minister by Serge Martynov.
After years, the U.S. government tried to convince Belarus to give up a highly enriched uranium and it seemed that the last spring had been hit by a rock of interest.
But the U.S. officials said The Washington Post that in the last two months there have been a few hidden operations with Belarus to remove 187 pounds of weapons based on uranium from the Belarusian research facility.
This prepared the ground for the middle agreement to remove the residue of the material - about 500 pounds, according to the official who spoke under the terms of anonymity because it is a sensitive matter.
The agreement proved to be one of the most important results of Obama's 47th National Nuclear Safety Summit in April, on which Belarus was expelled.
And it was probably a good move to ensure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the next summit in 2012.
"I was really fascinated by the fact that they want a place at the 2012 Nuclear Safety Summit."
"This proves that the process is working," said Ken Luongo, president of the Partnership for Global Security, a group supporting nuclear security.
Clinton called the agreement "a very important, important step" from Belarus.
Obama promised in Prague in April 2009 that he would provide all sensitive nuclear materials worldwide for up to four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries rid themselves of all their resources of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be seven.
That's how a dozen countries did it for George W. Bush's administration.
At the time of Obama's nuclear safety summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko announced that his nation would never surrender its uranium.
"We have a highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilograms of what is basically the basis for weapons and less enriched uranium," Lukashenko said.
"It's our comet... we don't intend to make dirty bombs and we also don't intend to sell it to anyone."
"We only use it for research purposes, that's all."
Belarus, however, joined the United States several months ago and expressed interest in reaching the agreement.
The first obligation to remove the Belarusian uranium in October was particularly complicated because the material was easily sealed, the officials announced.
He was loaded on a special train that traveled more than 1,300 miles to the Russian storage and disposal facility, the officials said.
The second operation was closed on Monday and the aircraft was carried out, the officials said.
The US government has spent $13 million on the programme, most of which is less enriched uranium for the supply of nuclear weapons to the Belarusian research institution.
"Everything has been coordinated very carefully and managed on the basis of trust," said Andrew Bieniawski, the official of the Ministry of Energy working for Global Threat Reduction.
James Martin Center for the study on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons this year estimated that Belarus has at least 88 pounds of uranium used for the production of weapons.
Belarus will, according to the joint declaration, endeavour to remove its resources by 2012.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained throughout the year, especially because of the harsh repression of human rights in Lukashenko.
But the medium-term declaration indicates the possibility of a gradual decline.
"We welcome the progress in these global security issues, the United States and Belarus have recognised that the further respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains the basis for improving the relationship and it is necessary for the country and its inhabitants to move forward," he said.
The Spanish government didn't do the CIA jewels
The Spanish government did not do anything about the CIA's flights of captured Taliban and Al-Qaida members to Guantanam across the Spanish territory, as the United States envoy in Madrid said in his telegram.
It follows from the documents provided by the server of the Wikileaks newspaper El País, where it is also written that the former Prime Minister María Teresa Fernández de la Vegová requested that the Spanish executive be informed and "can thus demonstrate that he has appropriate oversight over foreign aircraft flying Spanish airspace".
in June 2006, following a communication from the Council of Europe, which accused dozens of States, including Spain, of their participation in human rights violations, a meeting was held between the US Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vegovo.
The Prime Minister said that the Council of Europe's message "exempted Zapater's government from the game" and insisted that Spain has nothing to hide in this matter.
De La Veg stressed that Spain has no problem with the years of secret services across its territory.
"They just want to be informed," said Aguirre in one of the documents.
The then Minister of Foreign Affairs Miguel Ángel Moratinos pointed out to the American ambassador that the Spanish government "wanted to give this matter as low as possible, but because it was in the hands of judges, the cabinet had limited influence".
In February 2007, prosecutor Vicente González informed Velvyslanectv that, as far as he is concerned, he did not intend to block the judge's initiative to request the removal of documents from the National Secret Service Centre (CNI) and the Ministry of Defence concerning CIA flights.
"This information does not contain any incriminating material or any sensitive information," Velvyslanitvie explained after a hearing with the prosecutor.
However, the U.S. expressed concern rather about "the clear coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors" than about the disclosure of information by the CNI or the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between independent know-how will complicate our efforts to resolve this case discreetly between governments," Aguirre says.
In March 2007, on the occasion of the ceremony of the United States Embassy and the Minister of Interior Alfred Pérez Rubalcaby, the ambassador said that "although the Spanish judges are very jealous of their independence and do what they will consider appropriate", he already instructed his colleagues, "to avoid varied comments with a view to reducing tensions".
The Ambassador also expresses his concern about the political party Party Popular (PP; Czech People's Party - see page) on this matter.
"In spite of its general pro-American orientation, our experience tells us that the Party Popular will not consider using any hints that Zapater's government has tolerated or deliberately ignored the US negotiations that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even if this disclosure could have negative consequences for the United States government," he notes.
Admitting a murderer's mother, she complained on the network at the mother's "old age"
A young woman was talking about a child when she was already dead, and she had her blog, "Teror after Galicia"
Monica Juanatey Fernández says "Muki" on the Internet.
with this nickname she used recently, she communicated with her sister and at least one friend; both are from the village of Noia in the area of La Corunja, where a young woman comes from.
The reports have been published since 2008.
In order to understand them, it is necessary to know the women's life of civilization, which the ABC diary reconstructs with the testimony of her family members.
A three-year-old woman from Galicia entered the 1998 relationship with industrialist Ivan Tunez.
They've been together for a year.
Soon after they broke up, she found out she was pregnant.
A man wanted to know if he was his newborn child, but his ex-girlfriend never let him do DNA tests.
You suddenly found a new acquaintance.
Her chosen was Alberto, a young man from the nearby town of Lousam.
Their compositions lasted a long time.
Little César lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to look for work, the boy stayed with her partner, who even invited her to visit Palmy for a week.
However, from the contents of her communication, it is clear that the relationship has broken down.
In March 2008, he's alone at Menorce, and he says, "Alberto's kind of angry that I went to work."
"When I told him, it seemed good to him, but now he realizes he has to be with a little girl all day, and he can't do what he wants."
Then she's talking about a text message she just got: "I want you to come back this month or give me the address where I'm supposed to send you a child."
He complains, "If he doesn't like me leaving a little girl with my mother, I'll take him when I get back," he says.
In May, he talks about his return to his home, "This week I'm going to go there, but I'm going to stay until 19 because I have to go for work so I don't come to this place."
He explains that if everything goes well, he'll take his son to himself.
"He'll be with who he's supposed to be with, so he's with me, and he'll never be alive again, that I'd leave him with someone other than my mother," a dubious intention in view of her bad relationship.
There's another contribution here in July.
When this message is out, it is assumed that the child who arrived on the island of the first day of this month and was probably murdered 10 is already dead.
"César is satisfied on one side, but on the other side he is not."
"He's on one side with me and he likes it here, but on the other side he goes to school almost every day."
He's talking about moving to Mallorca.
"There will be a son to go to summer school, and then I'll save some money for the cave."
Seventeenth regards and complaints.
"A big mouth from César who asks me when you're coming."
"Alberto says I don't know what video to email you, look how he wants to, he's meeting me, sex is necessary."
The third report: "The kid is doing well, he goes to summer school to learn Catalan."
There's also one report about Victor, the current partner, "Gives me money."
On the Internet, Monica's contributions are on the blogs dedicated to anime and less.
She even had her own at MySpace, now revised, where she let herself say "Muki ex-Benister."
"Teror by Galician (motto)."
The last man with whom she lived, the guard, expresses his regret and feels guilty.
He doesn't want to believe that everything would happen because she didn't tell him she was a free mother.
Monica entered the provincial courthouse in Palma yesterday, where she came from the Menorce station.
The defendant, Carlos Maceda, stated that the accused did not remember how everything happened and "that she had no intention of harming the little one."
Before, however, she admitted that César drowned in the bath and placed his body in the trunk.
The defense and the prosecutor are requesting a psychiatric examination.
People would get 4 chairs and PSC in Snowfall (Socialist Party of Catalonia - late Friday) to lose 9 mandates
with results from 28 November, the PP party could have the main word at the councils in Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After a significant increase in the votes received and the number of Members experienced during the recent autonomous elections, the Catalan PP (Lidová de Catalánska - p. a.k.a.) already has an idea of the general elections, whether or not they are raised, its prospects are more than positive, as the number of votes in the international elections is usually once the same as the Catalan elections.
In 2008, the Catalan people received 610.473 votes in general, while in the 2006 autonomous elections, this number was only 316.222.
Last Sunday she received a PPC (Lidova Catalánska party) 384,091 votes.
If this trend of navigation, which was supported by the transfer of votes by the PSC and the loyalty of the PP voters, the analysts of this party calculated that if general elections were to take place, the PPC could obtain 12 MPs in the Shadow against the current 8th side of CiU (Convergence and the Union, Czech Shoda and the Union - no later than that) to obtain 4 mandates (not having 10) and PSC would lose at least 9 chairs (not having 25).
These calculations would confirm that Catalonia has a key role to play for PP and PSOE (Spain's Socialist Workers' Party).
According to this analysis of the people, the ERC party (Levic Republican Party of Catalonia - p.o.b.) would lose one MP - now has 3 - while the ICV (The Greens for Catalonia - p.d. initiative) would continue to have one mandate, perhaps another one would have received.
However, according to the election calendar, the nearest delivery will take place in May 2011 on the occasion of the general elections, where people could also have a decisive influence on the end of the Socialists' rule in the four main provincial cities, as well as on changes in the Barcelona Council (Diputación de Barcelona), which is one of the largest proposed budget administration - EUR 661 million for 2011.
Like nationalists, people agree with the possibility that PSC could lose its workers in Barcelona, Tarragon, Lérida and Gorona, where the socialists did not receive most and could not turn to their traditional allies, the parties of the ERC and the ICV.
In view of the Republican debate, it would not be possible for this party to lose its representation in the Barcelona representation - as it is necessary to obtain at least 5% of the votes.
The PP site has increased the number of votes received in four major cities and could have a decisive influence in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
Nationalists are convinced that they could play a major role in the operation of Tarragona, where they ruled together with the PP in front of the present old age, Josepe Félix Ballesteros.
in Lérida, the PP received only 500 votes more than PSC, whose mayor Angel Ross has a very good relationship with Marian Rajoy - during the last campaign they met on several occasions.
The people also won on other important councils such as Badalona, Castelldeels or Reus.
At the present time, the PP is represented at 34 workshops in Catalan and would like to create candidates in as many municipalities as possible.
Catalan cell provided Al-Qaida organization thousands of bands
In addition to the seven detainees in Barcelona, three others were detained in Thailand
Seven Pakistanis and one Nigerian, who were detained by the General Information Commission agents in Barcelona, formed a Georgian cell controlled by Thailand, which established travel passports to various groups of Al-Qaeda, among which were also "Tygers of the liberation of Tamil Ilam" or "Lashkar-e-Taiba", and the second designated group was the author of the assassinations in Bombay, where 106 people were killed in 2008.
The Ministry of the Interior places great importance on the investigation of this issue, aims to ensure through the "operation Kampai" the weakening of the Al-Qaida parade at international level and "restricting its operational capabilities".
The investigators estimate that during the two years that this cell was active in Catalonia, it was possible to send thousands of travel passports to Thailand, where they were then dropped and then delivered to groups that form the criminal galaxy of Al-Qaida so that their "fighters" could freely travel across borders in Europe and other Western countries.
This fragmented cell was not the only active one that had a network of jihad in Europe, and therefore these investigations were also attended by other European police units in addition to Thai services, and cannot therefore be excluded that in the following days there will not be similar attacks in other European countries, as in Barcelona last Tuesday night.
In connection with this operation (when the Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and Nigeriac Babatounde Agunbiade) further developed in Thailand, where the Pakistani Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and Thai Siringlaya Kyjbumrung were captured.
It was these men who were driving a cell from Bangkok in Spain and elsewhere in other European countries.
The Catalan network, the part of which was eliminated in 2009, in particular stole travel passports from tourists who met Islamic requirements.
This means that the documents had to belong to men between the ages of 25 and 45, had to be valid for several years and without a marked visa.
The investigation documents stress that there is no evidence yet to be known that any of the facts that would link Catalan to the assassination in Bombay, although the author of these attacks, "Lashkar-e-Taiba", should be one of the groups that received passports stolen in Spain and then falsified in Thailand.
However, it should be noted that a few days before this assassination, about a thousand dollars were sent from the Catalan translation agency, which were "inserted" for purchase of tickets to mobile phones, which were later used by members of the "command", who killed 106 people.
The police have already had a lot of evidence.
The People's Party (PP) requires Mass to stop the fiscal agreement
The president of the PPC (Lidow Party of Catalonia) Alicia Sánchezý-Camachová had the opportunity to present his terms to Arthur Mass personally yesterday, for which he was willing to support his introduction to the role of President Generalitat; these terms are in line with those proposed during the campaign and their priority is to revive the economy and to give up the venturers such as the economic agreement that the leader of the nationalists wishes to propose during his mandate.
The president of the Catalan people came to the meeting with Arthur Mass with the certainty of 18 parliamentary seats received in the elections last week, which is more than satisfactory for obtaining the form, so the CU candidate needs to hold at least one of the formations of the opposition to vote on his arrival to the office.
The possible agreement with the PP depends on future alliances that nationalists would like to hold in Snowtown when general elections are held, but so far the talks that lead to Mas with the rest of political leaders are carried in the Catalan spirit.
With regard to President PP, in order to receive its support for the introduction of the function, "it will have to end with all the supreme and independent demonstrations", as well as with the economic agreement - similar to that of the Basque leader - that he even wanted to let CiU vote in the referendum.
Both leaders would like to cut off the obsolete political apparatus of autonomous administration and reduce inheritance and donation taxes.
The details of the negotiations on Masova's introduction to the function will be held within the framework of the PP Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
But he already met with Joaquin Nadal (PSC), who promised a strong opposition, Joan Herrero (ICV) and today he meets Joan Puigcercos (ERC), Albert Riverou (Ciutadans) and Joan Laportou (Solidaritat Catalana).
The director of the geriatric device ensures that death has not occurred as a result of "a lack of action"
The presentation of the center of Olot does not rule out that their caretaker killed more than 11 clients
The management of the Geriatric Centre La Caritat de Olot (Gerona) provided a press conference yesterday to determine what damage was caused by the criminal behavioral institution Joan Vila Dilmé, a caregiver who, while employed here, killed at least eleven seniors who were in care.
The head of this house for seniors Joan Sala has come along with a lawyer, lawyer Joan Canada, and announced that "the desire of the house La Caritat would have been able to bring charges against the culprit" to the responsible for the murder, however "the law and responsibility oblige us to leave this process to the competent authorities".
In addition to the damage to the good name that this institution may suffer because it has not in time discovered the criminal activities of the caregiver, the great threat to the home of La Caritat now poses requirements for substantial compensation already calculated by the legal representatives of the remaining families.
Joan Vila Dilmé admitted that his first crime occurred in August 2009 and that he had not stopped killing since
The judge ordered exhumation of eight clients' bodies for seniors with suspicion that in many cases no doctor had visited the deceased personally, but that, given the age and poor health of the patients, everything had been resolved on the phone.
La Caritat last night, through its director, strongly rejected this rigour and stressed that "the lack of measures could not be in any case the cause of what happened".
The legal representative of La Caritat added that "there is no indication in this case that any third party would be in doubt, except for the defendant himself."
The man now named "Angel of Death" admitted yesterday 11 deaths and made it clear that the first crime was allowed on 29 August 2009 and that he killed the second elder for a month and a half later.
in this case, he caused death by giving too much insulin, unlike the first time he used a mixture of soothing tablets.
The Director of La Caritat stated that it is complicated to control staff access to medications.
Insulin and cocktail sedatives were likely in six cases with nine means that this caregiver used to kill patients in an effort to remove them from suffering.
However, the analysis currently being carried out in the laboratory should show whether Vila was slow and really looking for less cruel death for her first victim or, on the other hand, he killed her by giving the lie, as he already admitted in the case of three women killed between 12 and 17 October.
in La Caritat, they do not believe in the health claim and do not rule out that the number of people killed can be higher than the number he admitted, and justify his conduct in various versions that he gave to Vila court with the knowledge that he had to change his behavior when it turned out that he had killed eight people.
Therefore, they say that they want to be available to the courts to clarify the whole scope of this matter.
European Central Bank of Threats
The investors responded to yesterday's threat by President Trichet's European Central Bank, which pointed out that "markets should not underestimate our ability to react".
The border differentials were closed by force and the European Bank's shares fell by more than 5%.
However, we should also not underestimate the ability of the European Central Bank to be mistaken - the euro has just risen above the critical value.
What happened last night is typical of the non-liquid market, which, even though it is falling down, is falling down - but thanks to a short and very speculative position.
The investor will take some time before he loses concern.
A month ago, the European Central Bank was urging us to restore liquidity today, and tomorrow we will have to withdraw within two years.
The Bundesbank called for the termination of the State debt recovery plan for inefficiency and elimination of all exceptional liquidity levels over a period of one week and for unlimited access to only one week.
After the Irish crisis, we expect the liquidity level to be forecasted "minimumly in March" and to comply with a three-month bid with an unlimited approach to the end of this trimester in order to guarantee liquidity at least until June.
We also hope that they will continue to continue in their bond purchase program and that they will even announce its increase.
If it does not meet the expectations created, it will produce another reaction from yesterday's markets, and even if they are still blind to the level of liquidity, Allah is with us.
The same was at the meeting in May, where they claimed that they did not even consider buying bonds, and there was a market collapse - tomorrow the story could be repeated.
The European Central Bank must be reliable and durable.
In May, she announced that she had bought a lot of them on Monday and Wednesday, calling for further market distortions.
Yesterday's auction for one year in Portugal was very poor.
El Tesoro spent only 500 million with 5.28%, compared to 750 million with 4.81% of the previous auction.
Thus, the rates in Portugal fell by 30 points below, reflecting such a change of mood on the market as Trichet.
In Ireland, the figures represent the loss of Allied and Bank of Ireland.
The estimated amounts represent about 10,000 million on short-term securities and other potential 15,000, until February they have a chance to become private capital, otherwise they will be settled.
Although Ireland has no credibility after the problem has not been identified by stress tests in July, the amounts are acceptable within the framework of the aid plan and will help to reduce uncertainty.
However, on the next Tuesday, the government will need to get Parliament's approval of the new budget and still lacks sufficient support, so there is still a government uncertainty in Ireland.
Angela Merkel has calmed down her speech to release the tension in the face for the next EU summit held on 14 December, which requires a political compromise to show that we are the Union and we are all on one ship.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner, while others would prefer Beethoven Oda to be happy.
In Spain yesterday, the Prime Minister had the opportunity to present a plan of action to be approved by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous areas and financial institutions, reduction of deficit, liberalisation, privatisation, recovery measures - to investors' ears it sounds like four years from Vivaldi.
The double effect of Trichet and Zapatera explains why the Spanish stock exchange grew by 4.5%, i.e. twice as much as the other European stock exchange.
Unlike February, the government's reaction and the Spanish National Banks were quick and convincing - we are looking for a surprising effect.
Today we have a key bid here for three years, which will benefit from the effect of Trichet, so we hope it will be a big demand that will help resolve our doubts about our refinancing ability.
Requesting a rescue plan would be for Spain's sacrifice.
They would give us cash that we do not need - in El Tesoro there are 40,000 million in cash, three times more than in March - high rates and market access would close us son of the day.
However, we still need to use Cesar's wife's strategy - "not to be it, but to look like it."
We can do it.
The president of the Eulen Group will attack the negotiations of Vega Sicilia requested by his children
Boure in the open conflict in the Álvarez family, owners of Eulen and El Enebro, do not believe.
David Alvarez, the founder of the group, will attack after he has taken her as "very insignificant", the legal proceedings of El Enebro planned for 16 this month and five of his seven descendants, to which they should try to exploit their majority and strengthen themselves with the administrative authorities of the Bodegas Vega Sicilia prosecution.
David Álvarez and his sons Jesús David and Maria José rule the legal group for their new chapter of their dispute over the governance of the part of society.
The founder of the largest holding of business services does not appear to be willing to settle in his dispute about membership in the ruling authorities of the El Enebro group.
Its administrative committee met five of its seven descendants, who were appointed to carry out the meetings of shareholders on 18 January this year and whose objection is entered in the Commercial Register.
The El Enebro Group's trial scheduled for this sixteenth month, which was sent to the office of Trade Court No. 2 in Madrid, restored the cemetery in the village of the Álvarez family.
The appeal to the judge is until the dispute is settled by the only legal means to ensure that the Commission is called upon.
The last step of Juana Carlos, Pablo, Emilia, Marty and Elviry Álvarez of the Mezquirizov is considered by David Álvarez as "the desperate means of his five children serving with the help of the judiciary and a clear legal deception to strengthen and improve the process of the 18th of January, which was totally inappropriate".
This argument will serve as a basis for justifying the legal attack of this act as "very insignificant".
The private protagonists who discreetly silenced themselves have already tried unsuccessfully to call the court in June.
in El Enebro, a group of owners of the other activities of Bodegas Vega Sicily, controls the seven descendants of David Álvarz 100% capital.
However, according to family protocols, the founder of the group requires the right of use of 51% of the capital.
This matter is a key issue that the judge will have to decide on when the question of a judicial attack of proceedings is being dealt with. The date of such conversion has not yet been established.
Red Bull triumphs in Formula 1 with secret weapons from Siemens
Software proposes improvements in vehicles in real time.
Since Red Bull entered the Formula 1 series in 2004, its history in this exceptional world of speed is characterized by surprise and success.
At first, no one took the opportunity of this new upcoming team too seriously, and despite the recent upward trend, all of them won the Ferrari Fernanda Alons triumph.
We would not want to reduce the driving skills of the champion, the German Sebastian Vettel, or the possibilities of the Renault engine that drives his car, in Formula 1 world, was born a legend - "the secret weapon", which the multinational Siemens put into the hands of Red Bull to make it a winning team.
In fact, it is an efficient software simulating revenue, which the German company put on the market in 2007 for the purpose of very remote car sport.
The so-called PLM, this powerful software device, was used to design assembly lines in production plants around the world, in energy plants and for high precision devices.
Its purpose is to faithfully reproduce the product or simulate the process before it is actually created, thereby avoiding unnecessary errors and expenses.
The PLM facilitated the development of the Canon camera, the Sukhoi aircraft or Nissan’s most popular commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, director of Siemens's industrial division, explains that the use of this software enabled Red Bull team to make modifications and improvements in almost real time, otherwise detected during race and trial.
Russwurm says that in 1992 they employed an average of 10 technicians who were able to perform a maximum of three or four improvements during one period.
In the Red Bull team today, 180 young highly qualified professionals are equipped with efficient information technology that analyse and propose every type of vehicle modification.
The director of Siemens explained that PLM software is able to analyze and improve all elements of Red Bull racing vehicles with the exception of the engine that Renault fully responds to.
Materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety components are modified.
Changes can be transferred from virtual reality to reality within less than 24 hours thanks to advanced production systems using laser and highly technologically advanced autoclaves.
The only limit of this technical capacity is the amount of 40 million dollars representing the maximum that each Formula 1 team can spend for each period to improve its competitiveness.
Red Bull has set about 50 km from London's peak technology plant serving the design and manufacture of its racing cars.
These are two buildings that are limited to visitors - especially to journalists.
Everything that's going on here is considered a "great secret."
The list of participants in this project includes 580 people including two pilots - champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
The hero Red Bull is in Formula 1 without a doubt a fresh champion Sebastian Vettel.
However, other protagonists, whose help is invaluable, are hidden for the immeasurable use of energy drinks in their participation in the competition circles.
The chief of manufacturing technology Steve Nevey claims that five years ago it was possible to say that progress in the research and development of vehicles contributed to a 50% victory and the rest was the driver's merit.
At present, this situation has changed and technology stands for 85%, while pilots contribute 15%.
Nevey admits that Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by computer technology, as they are "unpredictable gladiators".
HP will set up its own business in two years in cooperation with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP), in collaboration with his trading partner Pont Reyes, opened her first exclusive sale in Barcelona yesterday.
This company will be the first of the 20 retail outlets of 80 to 100 m2 that this transnational company plans to open in Spain in the next two years.
These shops will also be located in 16 existing shops such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn or El Corte English.
The Spanish Vice-President, HP Helena Herrerová, set the example of a newly constructed sale to Barcelona's Gran Via, a Pont Reyes company with which HP has been cooperating for 30 years.
The North American company launched a plan to establish 200 sales outlets in Europe by 2013, which includes 20 Spanish shops.
The first sale was opened last week in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia), so the trade in Barcelona is third.
Herrerová did not want to know where other sales would be opened, but admitted that Madrid could be one of the following places.
Herer, who also runs HP's personal systems, has ensured that the philosophy of opening up businesses will still be the same - using local distributors who have the expertise and knowledge of the sector.
The North American company here advises with the exclusive design of sales equipment (with products that can be interactively tested) that will be identical in Europe.
In addition, HP is also involved in providing personnel for business.
Helena Herrer said it would be franking, and stressed that the exclusive network of sales aims to "improve customer service, services to small and medium-sized enterprises in purchase, service, birth service and even packaging".
Trade in Barcelona is part of the world-wide pilot programme, which aims to address any problems with computer devices in the guarantee.
Online service is offered with a technical centre of accommodation in Maastricht (Netherlands).
"So we'll be able to solve the problems that can last up to two days in 10 minutes."
"This system is designed specifically for small and medium-sized enterprises and for ordinary customers, given that large companies already have a contract service for technical assistance," Helen Herrer said yesterday.
Sabadell agrees that he'll steal over three years to his competitors a million customers
More optimistic than any other boss, a bank member of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, believes 2011 will be a demanding one for the bank, but will reject a new liquidity crisis and predict the end of the passive war.
However, it is calculated by reducing interest rates, but they will try to compensate by raising bank charges and credit prices.
Sabadell expects him to be able to obtain a million private customers within three years.
Sabadell has found a way to use the next three years and can survive under unfavorable economic conditions.
In 2011, the Bank will launch a new strategic plan with validity for three years.
The objective, in addition to survival without the need to turn to public assistance in FROB, is to gain market share by catching up millions of new private customers - 700,000, respectively, if those who leave the bank are removed - as up to now the institution has been moving small and medium-sized entrepreneurs and large businesses than small customers.
This year, 250,000 private customers and 50,000 businesses have already received the bank.
Its market share is 3.5% for private customers, while in corporate customers it is more than 10%.
Another of the basic ideas of the 2011-2013 plan is a commitment to productivity, or it can also be said to be bridging, with a view to reducing the costs that the Bank will face when presenting the results for the period.
At this time, a few banking institutions are reluctant to set their goals and publish them, as the financial crisis has changed all the plans of world banking.
Sabadell this year will close his Optima programme, set four years ago, although originally for three years, but the situation on the market required an extension for another period.
Customers who leave the facility will be their main target group.
At the meeting of organized APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 will be "hard and very important".
In fact, it is believed that the journey from the crisis in Spain will "be prolonged".
In addition, in two or three years it will be "very difficult to create employment", which has added fundamental to the survival of the banking sector.
And although they believe that the passive war - which reduces the margin - is falling, the price of the risks that banks and counterparties pay for their emissions in order to obtain liquidity is already shifting to credit prices, thus compensating for the reduction of the margin.
"The topic of liquidity and financing is structural and will be a pressure factor on credit".
"We haven't closed our shells yet, but the differentials are very high," said Guardiola.
Banesto has already issued its network on Thursday to reduce long-term loans and increased differential prices - see CincoDías of 22 and 27 November.
He also acknowledged that the trend in banking "now is a reduction of commissions", but here is a "competitive framework".
Sabadell's strategic plan is based on organic growth, but as a general rule, the group does not exclude corporate operations.
It is not for free to ensure that in Spain "there will be a greater demand for sizes."
"There will be no stone left next year," he said.
It confirms that capital needs are "very low" and does not rule out that some Spanish institutions enter among the red numbers.
And it shows that FROB may charge the collection of funds on the market before new capital measures are taken.
After ensuring that Sabadell can survive the temporary closure of the markets, it is still a serious problem that some bankers predict as a new liquidity crisis.
It means that it cannot be issued, but unlike what was in June, it is possible to obtain short-term funding through a discount, which reduces the crisis.
CECA excludes another flue spree spree
The Director-General of CECA refused yesterday that another wave of fusion should be triggered and continued at the speed with which the reorganisation of the sector is carried out.
When he was relaunching the process of combining Spanish spores, there were several institutions that ensured that this first phase was not involved and waited for the second round.
However, the Director-General of the Spanish Confederation, José Antonio Olavarreita, ruled yesterday that a new wave of these operations should occur.
"I believe that most mergers have already been implemented, the incorporation of Cajasul into the Banca Cívica group cannot be considered as a second round, what is happening are contracts."
"Most are fully implemented; it is possible that instead of 17 institutions we will go to 13 or 14, but all major processes are already ready and under the protection of the Spanish National Bank, which has worked very well on this issue," the director noted.
In his statements at the meeting of the ADEA (Association of Leaders and Executive Officials of Aragon - c.o.b.) Olavarrieta explained that the concentration process is being carried out "as quickly as possible and we must be very satisfied, as shown in the contributions that have not now appeared in the business plans with the Spanish National Bank," he stressed.
"From 45 participants with an average asset volume of 28,000 million to 17 with 75,500 million is a process that has no comparison in history, reducing the number of institutions by 62% so that these are larger and thus fall in accordance with the Basel Treaty," he said.
Olavarrita admitted that "there are a number of unfortunate views on the slowness of the process", which show "a lack of seriousness and understanding", because "what the Spanish National Bank is doing is reminding us that we must be in time before the end of the year."
CECA Director-General José Antonio Olavarrieta confirmed yesterday that Spain has the most precise financial system throughout Europe and "probably" in the world, and has contributed to "a lack of knowledge" for those who doubt it.
The Director noted that in the current favourable economic situation, "we can "be calm" about financial institutions and the system, which managed the "very important" concentration process and which continues "as fast as possible".
He also recalled that Spanish banking was very good from the stress tests carried out by the European Central Bank in July.
Wheat and red German line
Berlin has decided to maintain the euro, but has laid down conditions for the Union as a whole.
The tension on the markets sparked two government responses.
On the one hand, José Luis Zapatero has proposed new adaptation measures, since the reduction of taxes on small and medium-sized enterprises, through the regulation of private funding agencies or the cancellation of EUR 426 for unemployed people, until after privatisation 49% of AENA (Spain airport and air traffic management - no later).The manager of Barajas and El Prat and 30% of the state lottery.
On the other hand, with the support of former Prime Minister Felipe González, Mr Salgadvá joined critics at the address of Chancellor Angely Merkel for her responsibility for the resolution of the current crisis.
How to interpret this movement?
It is said above that Merkel's opinion is not a mistake in her communication policy.
On the contrary, it is another point in the complex process of redefining the euro.
And here Germany has a radically new vision of what its future is going to be, which reflects the idea of keeping old traditions that are held by a large part of other members.
Faced with European resistance, Germany is beginning to speculate on three possible routes from the crisis.
The first is a strong eurozone, part of which would be Germany, but also for example Austria or the Netherlands, while the southern states would leave the monetary zone.
The second is back to March - although it can now appear as a scifi, this version has wide public support, approaching 50% of the population.
The third option is, according to Germany's proposals, to recast the euro with greater macroeconomic oversight, budgetary rigour, fines for criminal states, possible delays in payments for some of them, and by extending the possible costs of regulation to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been defined for some time, so there is now no space for extractions.
First, in 2009 when the International Monetary Fund and the European Commission caused deficits, the German government had withdrawn its constitutional reform to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first sign of a dispute between what Germany considered to be the right (fiscal commitment and stability of public finances) and what its European partners, including France, practiced.
The second showed this central European country when Merkel painfully reached a decision on the salvation of Greece.
It has already been the subject of sharp criticism, but it is true that the political consensus in Germany and the public opinion, which has also been published, were strongly against the salvation of Greece.
Finally, in the last October days, Merkel has again come up with a clear opinion when she called for the reform of the European Union's treaties in such a way as to enable a Member State to be saved and, at the same time, to be obliged by the private creditors to bear part of the costs.
This opinion was interpreted as anti-European because it accelerated the Irish crisis and all others.
However, its proposal, although somewhat modest, has been approved, and we should follow the Union reform process over the next few months, which should allow for this action from 2013.
Germany ran a red line that it was not going to cross.
And it tells us all that, although it is now necessary to take measures that are likely to be too inconsistent, from this date will be the old functioning of the euro.
The year 2013 will be the birth of a new currency zone in which the violating rules will be strongly penalised and may be forced to declare the deferral of payments, and the private sector will also have to bear part of the costs.
Germany points out that we need to make a strict path to growth by increasing the volume of savings and investment, moderate consumption, improved productivity and competitiveness, and capital reserves.
Another option based on demand and construction, with enormous gaps in the balance of payments, which governments in the years of Spain's boom, simply do not intend to tolerate.
The offer is clear.
And we'd make a mistake if we didn't understand.
It is not just about restoring public deficit to 3% in 2013.
What they want for us is much harder.
And the worst part is that under these conditions, we could be wrong ourselves.
I hope that these current turbulences will bring more peace.
And that we will take advantage of the opportunities they give us by spring 2013.
It seems that Prime Minister Zapatero also understood this and his two statements (reforms promised after meeting with large companies from last Saturday and yesterday's announcement of new measures) suggest that through criticisms to Merkelov's address, the way of thinking is to put things in order.
But the red line that Germany ran out of is here, and it doesn't seem to want to move with it.
And from the possibility that the eurozone can be considered, it cannot be excluded from the full range of serious countries.
Well, Germany will always be able to tell us that it warned us.
Sports and rules
The Finns, led by Alonso and Ramos in the fight with Ajax, show the reason why they never intend to avoid punishment.
The alleged exclusion of two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alons and Sergia Ramose) in the Battle of the Ajax Masters League of 23 November led to the publication of a sea survey on whether or not this is non-sport behavior, and whether UEFA should not punish both footballists.
As it is known, a few minutes before the end of the match (which had their team clearly won) appointed players one after the other deliberately lost time at a time when they had to play the fool to provoke the judge, and that showed them the second yellow card.
In this way, both players will complete the prescribed penalty in the next match against Auxerre - and Real Madrid will end up in his group in the front - and will be able to continue to move on to the next stage.
Finally, the UEFA disciplinary commission sentenced coach José Mourinh to two matches and the provincial players received a cash fine.
Making a yellow card under similar conditions is no new practice, but is more common in football.
It's so extended that it's part of an eto football, so rules that are not written, but they're watching.
Part of the discussion in this case was due to the fact that her participant was a team of Real Madrid (which, in its humidly gloat of praise and honor, had already suffered for similar acts of his players) and, as it seems, also thanks to the dramatization led by Maurinh, which thus adds to his long story of the comedian and the provocator of the next episode.
In any case, the debate focuses on whether this kind of conversation, which is not expressly prohibited, is contrary to the principles of sport, i.e. whether in these circumstances the rights are respected; it is indeed about action that respects the sport rules, which, however, seems to be trying to circumvent.
It is decided what kind of damage such a conversation has to do with a sports spirit.
One aspect of sport behaviour is the physical incompatibility of opponents who have not been violated in these cases, i.e. there has not been a violent game.
Another of these features that characterize the clean game is to avoid the fact that players, due to their transgression, have an opponent's team of benefits - which has not been achieved here either.
So paradoxical about the action of the real Madrid players is that what we normally characterize as a flight or the rule of law did not happen to a hidden violation of the rules in order to avoid sanctions, but this behaviour should be as clear as possible in order to be punished.
They waited and loved to be punished.
The next question, however, is what benefits the guilty from their deliberate transgression will have.
It is necessary to note here that the opponent is not in an unfavourable position and that there is no benefit in the current match, because the obvious result is that the team itself will have fewer players.
And it's not even a useful strategy for another match, because the club won't be able to count with these players.
The advantage obviously lies in the fact that players will start another phase of the League of Masters without cards that could threaten their participation in the future match.
However, it is a benefit from a long-term perspective and with a certain degree of uncertainty, so the team can be eliminated at first sight, and in addition to that, players will be punished, and will go to the second round of carts, where the exclusion is only one card less than in the first round.
So as the car goes on, it won't be very clear if it's an advantage.
In short and well, these negotiations do not oppose the sport spirit, the part of which is to make a strategic decision that allows maximum benefits under the rules.
in the case we are dealing with here, the players should not have the aim of avoiding the award of punishment (which would be a clear case of compliance with the rules), but rather chosen when to do so.
They made strategic decisions without avoiding or running away from the punishment.
Although there is no clear line between the reason and the conduct of the rules, I believe that in this case it was clearly a reason.
It seems to me that Poland arises for two reasons: it was about two exclusions and the way in which the instructions were transmitted to them to trigger them from the leadership.
The damage to sport principles by these actions is not as ethical as aesthetic.
Fighting offers for Christmas parties in Barcelona
This year's dictation of the calendar concentrates on the volume of reserves on 16 and 17 December.
It is fast going to be celebrated by the self-employed who want to spend between €20 and €30.
As well as the Turkish Med or lottery, with the coming of December, pre-Natural parties, which continue to act as an oxygen bomb for restaurants and facilities for leisure in Barcelona, have, however, stopped in the fight to get customers by lowering prices: almost everyone wants to spend 20 to 30 euros in food, agrees with business and associations from this sector.
To complete the complication of the numbers, the calendar this year (when Friday came on Friday) concentrated on the week of 13 December, which created a wave of reservations at the peak (16th and 17th), while last week there was almost no operation.
As has been the case since 2008, when the last few years began, many companies have been destroyed by collective parties for financial reasons.
In order not to give up tradition, many employees pay losses at parties from their own pockets.
Regardless of the situation, many demand prices on the fertility line, the president of the Gremi de Restauração de Barcelona restaurant association, Gaieta Farras.
The representative of the patronage of the restaurant facilities is not obliged at this time to predict what will be celebrated this month.
"People will think well before making a reservation."
"They want to go out, but as far as prices are concerned, they're careful," she adds.
Trades will go well to those "who offer quality and good service at a favourable price", he says and recalls that due to the crisis, customers tend to go down a level and most of the customers now want to spend around 25 euros.
A survey in various facilities shows that the biggest demand for booking is on the evening of 17 December.
The Soteras Group announces a real boom of reservations this Friday, with the most requirements for losses of up to EUR 30, with a boost to the proposed menu whose total prices range from EUR 25 to EUR 30.
in another significant company, which is Andilana, with 16 facilities in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), has brought in more time reservations this year, as from the beginning of November.
"We have made it impossible to keep prices from last year, and our menu, from which everyone should choose, is ranging from €19.95 to €30," they say.
In the AN Group, which includes El Mussol, Attic, QuQ, and a total of 23 companies, there are still optimistic after the second half of the increase in profits and have relatively solid prospects for the Christmas market.
The sources of this company stress that also on 18 December will be a difficult day, as pre-Natural celebrations will take place between friends.
to their six group menus added the Christmas menu, with a budget of EUR 30 or more, as compared to last year, guests tend to spend 10% more in exchange for other items such as cava (Spanish forest wine - no later).
They also noted that companies are already appearing that call their employees again, and it seems that the size of the groups is something bigger.
Fecasarm Vice President (which includes institutions such as Bar Association, Restaurant and Free Time Centre in Barcelona) Enric Goma believes that he is beginning to see the end of the tunnel and claims that the number of bookings is "lived", although the customers are "extending to maximum".
This notion did not come true during the Christmas celebrations, whether paid or paid.
Pakistan's nuclear programme has caused great unrest in the United States
Islamabad produces nuclear weapons "faster speed than any other country".
Wikileaks documents confirm the links between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of correspondence between the United States embassy in Pakistan and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the United States, published by the Wikileaks portal, confirms the extraordinary unrest that provokes Pakistan's nuclear programme in Washington.
In addition to clarifying and significant details that offer in terms of the content of communication and the thinking of North American diplomats in Islamabad, these documents reveal that cooperation between the two states, as far as nuclear security is concerned, instead of increasing, "is at the point of departure", and that this unstable Asian country produces "more nuclear weapons than any other state".
The speciality of the Pakistan nuclear programme - that its weapons are not disarmed, but according to parts to facilitate their destruction in the event of an attack - is one of the main causes of Washington's anxiety.
This is calculated on the basis of a report by Anne W. Patterson in Pakistan prior to the visit of the then James Jones National Security Council: "The proximity of some nuclear facilities to the Territory under the control of the Taliban, the alleged deployment of nuclear materials and the vulnerability of the transport of nuclear materials".
The increased number of people associated with nuclear arsenals and the shooting program is not only seen in the United States, but also in Russia, as a growing and representing reason to be vigilant.
"Pakistan had to hire personnel with a strong religious faith to protect nuclear facilities; given the fall in education and culture, extremist organisations have more opportunities to recruit people who will work in nuclear programmes or shooting programmes," said the expert Jurij Korolev from the Russian Ministry abroad at a meeting with their US counterparts.
The latest documentation published by Julian Assange's server is further lower cooperation between the United States and Pakistan on the expansion of nuclear weapons and the increased pace of Pakistan's production of these weapons.
Depeše issued by the Embassy in May, which qualifies communication with Pakistan as "frustrating", claims: "Transparence often does not exist; aid offers remain unresponsible or are rejected".
in the next report, Peter Lavoy, a national reporting service worker for South Asia, notes that "in spite of the economic disaster, Pakistan is producing nuclear weapons as quickly as any other state in the world".
Velvyslanny Petterson also asks Washington to "explain very well" during the visit of General Ashfjanho's army chief, that "Pakistan's army must end with silent support to terrorist groups".
She's headed Wikileaks.
Obama appoints a highly established employee responsible for combating terrorism to avoid new gaps in information.
Interpol issues a "red challenge" to track and determine where Assange could be.
All about Wikileaks and his founder Julian Assange is a complicated maze where it's hard to be sure of the facts.
Interpol announced yesterday a "extraordinary challenge", i.e. regular notice, to "localisation and monitoring of the movement" of Assange.
However, it is not a classic order for detention.
Besides, this challenge is not new, but it dates to November 20.
And it has nothing to do with the last escape of more than a quarter of a million diplomatic documents, but with the charges of sexual abuse facing Australia in Sweden.
In addition, the legal representative of the manufacturer Wikileaks Mark Stephens ensures that "the police know where and how to contact Mr. Assangem".
It was November 20th, when the international police council, based in French Lyon, issued this order at the request of Sweden, but did not publish it until yesterday, when he received permission from the Swedish authorities.
In this situation, 188 Interpol countries have guidelines for the identification or location of Assange "to establish a temporary link and issue it".
Although Interpol cannot direct the detention of persons who are in the face of a red challenge, many Member States, as the organisation has explained, consider the so-called regular notice to be a possible arrest - this must be ensured by the national police - especially in cases where the States have a bilateral agreement on the issuance of detainees, as in the case of Sweden and England, where Assange should probably be found.
This step led to the deterioration of Assenge's lawyers, who published the letters yesterday, declaring that a nine-year-old founder, Wikileaks, was willing to answer questions from the Swedish authorities through videoconference.
They also recall that Assenge requested and subsequently received permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of his case, which they compared with the legendary Lavranti Paul Berij, the head of Stalin’s security.
"This is a hen and not legal persecution," he says.
While the whole world is looking for her - and her mother is fighting her son's innocence from Australia - Assange is still in an unknown place, of course not silenced.
On Monday, he provided Skype with an interview with Time magazine chief from an unknown location - in this interview, a delegation from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the United States of America called for Hillary Clinton.
"If it turns out that she was responsible for the US diplomats' order to carry out espionage in the United Nations and violate such international conventions that the United States signed, she should resign," he said.
His opinion was rejected yesterday by the White House Pressman Robert Gibbs, who qualified the demise requirement as "mutual and absurd".
"I'm not quite sure why we should be concerned about the views of the individual operating on the website," CNN said.
Obama alone has entrusted a highly established employee responsible for combating terrorism, Rusella Traverse, to prevent other leaks of documents.
President Barack Obama's intention to stop adding Assange's importance contrasts with the views that conservative politicians and commentators proclaim these days.
Peter King, a member of the Congress, who will be chairman of the Committee on National Security in the Lower Chamber since January, asked the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to examine the possibility of including Wikileaks among terrorist organizations "to be able to intervene and fight anyone who would contribute financially to them or otherwise to provide assistance".
Tom Flanagan, Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper's adviser, who announced that Assange should be "killed", which he subsequently had to withdraw.
"Both should write a reward on it or use an unmanned aircraft or something like that."
Whoever didn't apologize was Mike Huckbee, a Baptist priest, former governor of Arkansas, and a possible candidate for the president.
"Whoever will be in the government, the person responsible for the loss of information, let be betrayed and any punishment other than correction would be too modest," said at the Fox station
Puigcercós in ERC is looking for calm "breathing" on the lines of Caroda
The Republican leader will enable the parties to vote in secret about their failure.
Huguet proposes more plural execution and the end of the conference system.
Joan Puigcercos apparently found a recipe to fight a number of internal revolutions already in the ranks of the ERC (Levic Republican side of Catalonia - late).
The president is aware that his gesture regarding demise seems to be insufficient to the supporters of former leader Josep Lluíse Caroda-Rovary, and he also knows that the influence of this sector is already as weak as his own leader, and that he cannot at all take care of other lost flows.
Therefore, the leader of Levia will try to get new criticisms by means of a hug that will help him to turn to the general elections.
First of all, Puigcercos announced yesterday that more than 200 members of the national committee would be able to make a secret statement about his resignation.
I'm using the voting papers, not raising my hands.
If the proponents of Carod wish to pass a criminal vote on to the President, they will be able to do so without fear of legal action.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid the fun and details of his person.
in a few interviews he claimed that he would not consider himself confirmed with half the votes and one more, but added, without clarifying the percentage that he would also not be a good result "by Bulgarian".
The Carods require more than giving their function to the president - which they consider to be a gesture that has no weight, since Puigcercos has the highest authority on the seats.
But since they do not have enough to expel demise, they will try to remind the executive of the plan from now until May.
That is why they are expected to participate in the preparation of a document on strategic reorientation, on which the Governing Council may vote on the 18th day of the month.
Their aim is to support Puigcercous in exchange for the promise of moving the convention already in the autumn of 2011.
The leader of the ERC declared that "majority" is damaging stability, and that his goal is to allow the organization to once and for all be able to wash its dirty laundry behind closed doors.
In this context, it appears that there is a significant article that the current advisor, Josep Huguet, has signed on his blog.
After taking Puigcercos' ideology into account, this innovation consultant took the final point that the leader would be confirmed "for several purposes".
And he named them five, from which two of them go.
The first is the "recomposition" of the execution so as to represent at least 90% of the members, which also means to include new faces that are from the carodo sector.
The second goal could be a big news item.
Huguet proposes that the ERC end up completely with expertise as a functioning mechanism.
And so it fights for the reform of the states so that Congresses can be held through the voting elected delegates.
The end of the model of the conference system, with the exception of the Spanish political party system, is the goal of Puigcercos's team, which has already fought on two last seats in this direction.
However, the 2008 cross-sectional meeting decided that the conference should be considered at a special convention on state reform.
This issue is still unresolved, as the situation within the party has reflected the solution of this matter.
Now, without the emerging critical sectors, it could be a good time to re-engage this issue and try to close it once and for all.
23 killed in November; 390 in 2010
According to MILENIO, Mexico has declined by 4 cases compared to 2010.
During November, 23 persons were killed in Mexico, about four less than in the previous month, according to the MILENIO newspaper.
Between the murders, there are cases of three women and a couple of separate bodies in the Gulf of Mexico.
in the last month of the year, there are a total of 390 murders in Mexico, probably linked to organised crime.
Among the cases is found dead in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitlán, in the Toluca period.
The victim suffered at least three gunshot wounds, followed by a stroke from grace to head and had hands and legs tied with wool.
The next day, a body was found in the trunk, which was stored in the seat of the vehicle on Mixtecas Street, in the Santa Cruz Acatlán colony, in the Naualpan period.
Early in the morning on Thursday 4 November, the compatriots discovered a body with no sign of torture and at least three fatal shots to the chest at the Tenango-Ixtapan de la Sal, in the section of Villa Guerrero.
Next to the body was a report signed by probably a criminal organization of La Familia Michoacana.
The day later in Nezaalcoyotl, a 50-year-old man was shot with eight shots after he left his home and wanted to start collecting waste.
On November 7, two victims were shot in the head at 30 years of age in the San Pedro Xalaxtoc colony, in the Ecatepec period.
in Chalco was found on a remote road in the colony of El Naranjo a man shot in the forehead, and under the body was found a weapon of a 25-caliber weapon.
In Ecatepec, parts of the human body were found in the waste water canal in the Playa Golondrin colony.
The saved files did a thorough search for other parts of it, but they did not find them.
The inhabitants of Tepotzotlan reported the discovery of the body with their hands tied back and wrapped with their head at Pena Colorado.
A man had a gun wound on his back.
In the middle of the month, the murder of two men who were packed in the bedroom and left in the parking space of the vehicle in Villas de la Hacienda during the Atizapán de Zaragoza period was also reported to the victim.
The day later was found in the colony of Valle de los Reyes in the period Los Reyes La Paz carton containing the human head.
in the nearby colony was found the rest of the body wrapped in a black plastic bag, with a report from El Incorrigible.
Seventeen were found in two dead women packed in a bedroom in the Zoquiapan desert during the Ixtapaluca period, and the second morning in Huixquilucan was found a dead man wrapped in a yellow-modern desert, which was previously reported by the killers left at his body identified as Mario Ríos.
In Ixtapaluca there was a woman found in the village of San Francisco Acuautla without a mark of life with two wounds to the trap.
The woman's skin was exposed to the tattoo of the sacred statue of Santa Muerte (saint of "Holy Death" - later on) as well as the necklaces with her likeness.
At the end of the month, a man with at least three gunshot wounds and a message signed by a criminal group was found in the village of Zinacantepec in the car.
Two days later, two men were found with their head wrapped in strips and a report was also found in the village of Puente de Piedra in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
The victim's report was probably written by one of the criminal organizations, which said, "This is going to happen to those who don't fit."
In Ecatepec there were two bodies that bore marks after the torture and had tied ends, inside the abandoned taxi behind the Centre of Justice in the San Agustín colony.
The last day of the month, the remains of two men were found during the periods of Los Reyes La Paz and Nezaalcoyotl.
The first one was found in the colony of Cuchilla Ancón and was packed into black plastic bags, tied to a tape and had a steady message with it; while the second one was locked and found in the plastic packaging in the streets of Colonia Juárez.
Together with him, the agents found a note with the message.
China maintains its objective of reducing greenhouse gas
The representative of this country at the UN Conference on Climate Change COP16 made sure that his country had developed an extraordinary effort to reduce carbon footprints and made it clear that it was on its promise to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45% by 2020.
China will fulfil its promise to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45% in 2020, Su Wei, the representative of this country at the UN Climate Change Conference.
At its first public performance at the 16th Conference of the Contracting Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, Su Wei ensured that his country had developed an unbreakable effort to reduce the carbon footprint and change its industry.
He said that his country had invested $245 million in its efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions over the last four years.
However, he noted that China would not change its objectives and would continue to work with the international community on this issue.
He pointed out that the Chinese strategy on climate change is divided into four items: dialogue, capacity building, institution building and support for pilot programmes.
In all of these points, progress has already been made, including the last approval of the new Energy Act, which includes the proposed greenhouse gas reduction targets.
He further stressed that in China the federal authorities cooperated in coordination with provincial and local authorities to achieve their objectives in terms of energy savings, energy efficiency and emission reductions.
Furthermore, as he said, there are or have already been completed a number of plans that are financed by both the Chinese government and the governments of other States.
For example, one reported on the Energy Efficiency Programme, which has been introduced over the last five years, and which has received investment from the UN, government and private initiatives.
The provincial climate change project is also under way, further the project for the exchange of fires for resistant fires and the project for mitigation and adaptation, has clarified.
At the same table, Martin Krol, the expert adviser of this country for climate change, assured that China's efforts were greater than they generally thought.
For example, in the United States 100 tonnes, greenhouse gas emissions per capita account for 6 tonnes, while in the United States, China is responsible for 9% of the historical share of emissions.
It has also developed unprecedented efforts with regard to energy use - for example, it has increased 20% energy efficiency over the last five years and expects further progress to be made by 2020.
Banned Espina: César Nava
The President of the PAN Party (Partido Action Nacional, Czech National Action Party - no later) stated that the former President of this Party is entitled to apply to the National Ordinance Commission for his rights.
The President of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, has ensured that the expulsion of Manuel Espiny Barrientos has been committed and that the former President of this party is entitled to contact the National Order Commission and to request his rights.
In the debate, which was held before the opposition by the Governor of the State of Gabin Cué Monteagud, he said that the exclusion of Espina is in any case by decisions taken at the local level.
"It is an autonomous decision of the Order Commission in Sonora."
"Mr. Espino has the right to address in his case by way of complaint to the National Council's Board of Appeal in order to act on a decision by the competent authority," he added.
He further explained that there is now no time to think about 2012 and that it has never been at the negotiating table on the presidential candidacy of the alliance.
Nava Vázquez has expressed his conviction that the PAN will come out of the internal elections held on 4 and 5 December, in which his successor will be elected.
"This (an alliance in 2012) is a theme that has never been at the negotiating table, at least not for the time being, it was the intention of the local elections, which was successful and fulfilled its purpose," he said.
The president of the PAN said that his side is 71 years of dialogue, and therefore he added, "We are not affected by internal competition, but rather by it, and we are determined and strengthened," he added.
He said that the committee would be able to elect the best president or president for the next three years of the PAN, without debate, so he would refer the staff to the "who the committee appoints".
"So I'm absolutely calm and relaxed, anyone of those five with the pride I hand over to the president of the party."
He predicted that the accession, which the party noted in the last elections in July, would be reflected in future clans, although "there is no time to think about 2012".
"Now it is necessary to accompany Governor Gabina Cué in this task."
In this context, he stressed that these three governments, having roots in alliances in Oaxaca, Pueble and Sinaloe, will represent the flag and will be the subject of observation throughout the country, as "they have many expectations and complaints, and I am sure that Gabina is in line with this expectation".
When we asked her about the criticisms of President Felipe Calderón by PRI (Partido Revolutionaryi Institutional, Czech Revolutionary Institutional Party, p. 3) because of his four-year-old speeches, César Nava called on the PR members to reflect on the six-year periods of former presidents Ernest Zedilla and Carlos Salinase de Gortari.
"If in PRI they believe that the governments of Zedilla and Salinas were better than the government of Fox and Claderón, then they will begin to defend them from their ulity," he confessed.
He said that the head of the federal executive has the right to express himself in the way he did during the national auditorium because there is no ruby or censorship in this country.
Obama promotes the law on Twitter to support students without documents
"If you assume that the adoption of the Dream Act is correct, let your senators know and have to approve this law," the U.S. President tweeted on a popular social network.
President Barack Obama, with a contribution today to his personal social network account Twitter, added to the national mobilization in support of the Dream Act, which should legalize students without documents.
"If you think that the adoption of the Dream Act is correct, let your senators know and have to approve this law," Obama tweeted.
His brief report draws attention to the Internet link to a more comprehensive document, which calls for the public to contact the senators immediately, as the vote on this law is approaching.
"Because it is expected that the vote will take place soon, now it is time to let your opinion sound," he says.
The report was published after 42 Republican senators threatened to block the approval of any law unless the extension of the Bush era tax reduction and government financing is approved.
Such a blocking notified by a letter signed by 42 Republican senators could affect voting on the Dream Act law and other projects, such as ratification of a new agreement with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons, called START.
When asked about the Republican blocking of the Dream Act and other proposals, the President-in-Office expressed his belief that once a fiscal topic is resolved, a calendar for the rest of the projects could be drawn up.
"I believe there's still time left..."
"We all agree that we must resolve the matter before the end of the year..."
I believe that at some point we will be able to reach agreements on this matter and then we will be able to plan a series of other matters," he said.
The leader of the democratic majority of the Senate, Harry Reid, announced on Tuesday that he would request "a vote on the closure of the debate" concerning the Dream Act, so that the proposal for the legalisation of students without documents could be voted in the Senate since the next quarter, although more likely next week.
The Senate approval of the Dream Act or the law of "American Dream" would legalize about 800 thousand young people who arrived in the United States 16 years before the end of their lives, lived in the country for the last five years and were admitted to the institution of higher education or the army.
However, the step-ups need to approve a proposal of 60 votes, which is why they need the assistance of several Republicans, so the organisation of its proponents carries out intense agitation to ensure the approval of this law.
The Democrats, most of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 mandates.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said he would vote against, and only one Republican, Richard Lugar of India, expressed his support for this law.
Therefore, the supporters of the Dream Act need to obtain a number of Republicans in case other Democrats decide to reject the proposal.
Among the Republican senators, with whom the senators most negotiate, are senators from Maine Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as the outgoing senator from Florida George Lemieux, who has supplemented Senator Mel Martínez's mandate.
Other Republicans who in the past supported the Dream Act are Orrin Hatch from Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchison from Texas, but they told you they would no longer support her.
Another Republican who supported the proposal, John Mccain, has not yet expressed himself.
Although Snow representatives are joining the other version, most analysts believe that the Dream Act will face the greatest obstacles in the Senate.
with the literature insert the finger to the wound ("poner el dedo en la la la la la la laga", translated "insert the finger to the wound" is the period of Czech "big to the head - no later).
The second round of the cycle The pleasure of the language was a change where participants presented the literary gala performance
"I understand this in the language, but... the finger to the morning? What is expected of me?" asked author Luisa Valenzuel, who was invited to start a second cycle of Joy from the language, a cycle that celebrates literature written in Spanish, and whose question was used as a subtitle on this occasion (on another occasion at the cool table devoted to the theme of Sex in the language, explained).
The finger to the dawn "brings us to the narrow", the Argentine writer kindly brought to the audience, composed mostly of young people who met at the International Book Fair in Guadalajara, to hear this debate at the cool table, moderated Marisol Schultz and with the participation of Valenzuel, Sergia Ramírez, Mayry Monter and Luis García Monter.
Luisa Valenzuel read the text that she gave to Gonzal Celori, and which Schultz later pointed out for a great story, in which Luis appeared in the first person as a protagonist, who, when looking for a knowledge of what "the wound" is from a doctor, did not respond to it, although the same story did.
From an infector, he goes on to say, "Persistentness is not my strong side, maybe it's my wound."
Finally, after frustration with a traumatologist who took her breath in the middle of the road, but explained to her that the wound is not a scientific term, it is a psychoanalyst that reveals the secret: "the wound is really distraught and thus symbolic is scar."
The protagonist rose up slowly and concluded that "at the morning she was able to find out only so much that she was really confused and that there is no," but she was convinced that the pleasure and insults in the tongue must go hand in hand together.
The writer of Valenzuel was playing with both.
Nikarageus Sergio Ramírez also performed with a delightful story, which he called the Praise of the Inventory, in which the finger is not named in the morning, but at one point he will appear.
with the elements of magical realism tells of the famous wizard who played the dark, brought back people who went far away, or corrected the frequency that one lady lost, this story that then turned to speak America, a great novel, in which from the beginning his own chroniclers who told it were not missing, and here is quoted as Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who criticises the overcrowding in the execution of the Captains.
"Cervantes, who invented us all, laughed at the finged testimony that was presented in the stories as real, but in another way never managed to tell the story of America with such imaginations that even lost the stad."
However, he stressed, "it is crazy and liars who have greater imagination" and just where the reality and the lie, where they don't know what the story belongs to one group and the other, reaches the fictional literature of their top.
It's actually called the Cervanto tradition.
"Thanks to his link, we have what we have."
Subsequently, Mayra Monterova stressed and praised the diversity of interpretations that enabled the International Book Fair to be invited by its words to the dawn.
The Cuban-Portorian writer showed her finger on the big hit of social violence that passes through her country - and shares it with Latin America - and is the result of trade disputes and drug sales.
"I think that good literature, good poetry and good songs conclude a quiet compromise that is of course not intended," she said after saying that the reality of literature is the communication and dimension of a compromise that is created between the author and readers - and in their "chemical response".
The evening closed by Spanish poet Luis García Montero, whose performance also emphasized the "on this finger to the wound of the writer bound by the writer".
He said that in the world that lives in haste, as well as in intellectual growth and control of the consciousness that surrounds dogmatism, he forgets that "there is little hidden behind every attraction, and there is a little way to deny it."
"To be masters of our thoughts and realities we have to color: and to color means many times to put a finger to the wound and to burden those individuals who are much more comfortable, because they think in cartoons, black, in fixed ideas and without coloring, and also to burden the authorities who prefer this black world," he said to support the meaning of writing.
Romano follows his first title
Rubén Omar Romano reads three defeats in the finals, during his career he lived good and bad, but he has already managed to reach the decision-making series on three occasions.
In the duel Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the finals, there are also two different styles that mark their techniques, teams that have a pattern difference in results.
Rubén Omar Romano is reading three defeats in the finals, during his career he has lived good and bad, but he has managed to reach out already on three occasions for a decision-making series, but until now he has gone off with unaccompanied, and that is why this chance is extraordinary for him.
The Argentineman had to settle for the silver medal, remained a step behind the win, and played with the same team following the finals.
The Sanististic Strategy as a coach reached its first final in the Apertura tournament in 2002, when he had in his hands the difficulty of the club Morelia, with which he had suffered a total of 4-2 against Toluce; then, in the 2003 Klausura tournament, he again turned to the decisive duel and also lost it with a total score of 3-1, which was against the Rayados team.
Already with the Santos Laguna Club in Tournament Tournament Bicentenario 2010, again against the Toluka "rables", Rubén again suffered defeat, although his team played against the "Uzenářům" (the next name of the Club Deportivo Toluca - later on) after 210 minutes of the game indiscriminately 2-2, after a series of criminal shootings he got to the advantage of three for one and had two opportunities to secure the title, but at last his three players passed from 11 steps and so suffered the turn of 4-3.
Rubén has already lost two finals against "Red Devils" from Toluka and one against Monterrey, his future rival, so he would like to avoid the same fate and get rid of the curse, and so he could first celebrate the title, although he says he is the most important institution for him.
"I want to go out as a winner, I don't want to write statistics, this is for the club, for the passion I'm committed, and the title would be of course for me, but the first is the most important," said the coach when he was questioned about the number he talks at the final against him.
in the living memory of his previous finals, in which, as he confirms, he has taught himself many, "We have taught ourselves that until the end of the decision-making process, we cannot celebrate, we must be ready for action, as well as players, because the past with two penalties, we have already been prepared to celebrate, and I think that we have been taught in this, until the game is over, we cannot celebrate".
She is not concerned that this series could be decided in criminal shootings, she believes her players: "You never try to come to a series of criminal heaps, you try to end in normal time, but sometimes there is no other possibility and it is necessary to be prepared for it, in the previous tournament we were prepared, unfortunately, but fate caught us by the bad move, perhaps because of the nerves or discomfort we felt when we were in our hands, but we lost it, it left us in our body and we hope that this time will not happen to anything like this."
Romano has a chance to stop being the second one and to taste the first glory that titles bring.
The United States shall amend the rules for the sharing of visas
People will have to turn to the Visa Request Service Centre before the Consular Division interview; costs will be lower and the waiting time will be reduced.
Since 10 January 2011, the visa negotiations on the United States and consulates have changed.
with a new procedure, most applicants will have to turn to the Visa Applicant Service Centre (short of the ASC) before consultation at the Consular Division.
The ASC staff shall receive the applicant's biometric information and you shall be assessed by the consular department before the interview.
The new procedure will have certain advantages, including the following:
The total cost of drawing up the visa will be lower, no longer required to pay the fee for the agreement of the meeting, the second for processing the application and the other for the delivery of the transport service document.
The applicant pays only one fee covering all three services.
The current rate will not be changed: the amount corresponding to $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for a visa application (including a visa for temporary workers) and $390 for a visa for traders and investors.
People who want to renew their visa will not have to complete the interview with the consular officer, but only turn to the nearest ASC where they will submit their documents and receive fingerprints.
In view of the fact that biometric information will be collected in the ASC, applicants who will request a second meeting with the Consular Division will spend a shorter time here than in the past.
Likewise, those who will apply for a visa on consulates in Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay an extra fee of $26.

NASA announces the discovery of extraterrestrial life
The US Space Agency launched a press conference tomorrow to present a discovery that could cause a breach in the search for extraterrestrial life.
The National Aviation and Space Agency (NASA) of the United States will announce tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery that could confirm the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be presented tomorrow at 13 o'clock expert on astrobiology, a knowledge that deals with the study of origin, evolution, expansion and the future of life in space, at a press conference in NASA headquarters in Washington.
When she called on the reporters, NASA ensured that she was a "discovery that makes a crime in the search for extraterrestrial life", which sparked the speculation of experts from other countries.
The discovery could confirm the theory that there are other creatures besides us and other creatures living under uninhabited conditions that were considered uninhabitable and who could imagine that they would once become intelligent creatures, such as humans, if the conditions in which they live were improved.
It is said to be a microbe that was found at the bottom of Lake Mono in the Yosemistic National Park in California, where it lives in an environment that was considered too poisoned for any form of life, since the lake is rich in arsenic.
The creation of an arse uses its life in some way, and this ability increases the likelihood that a similar life could exist on other planets that do not have the atmosphere on Earth.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it will be proved that "there is another, second form of life, different from what we know."
The Space Agency will announce the real progress of the findings at tomorrow's press conference.
Conference with the participating geobiologist Pamela Conradová, who studies the possibility of life on Mars; biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who examine Titan (the largest month of Saturn) with the prospect that his chemical composition is similar to that on Earth.
PRD, PT, Covergence and Pattern bear the opposition "block"
Reforms of the Constitutional Congress Act lead to the coming of "bipartism", they declare.
The 60th parliamentary period was not yet begun when the opposition bloc, led by the members of the PRD party (Partido de la Revolution Democratica, Czech "Democratic Revolution" - p.o.b.), PT (Partido del Labora, Czech "Stra work" - p.o.b.), Convergencia (Czech "Shoda" p.o.b.) and Jesús Manuel Patron Montalve, who declared himself an independent, and these four discussed one thing: the coming of "bipartism" to November.
Before the opening of the 60th parliamentary period, Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez from Convergence, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza from PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo from PRD and Patron Montalvo "gräm" against the reform of the Constitutional Law, as it cuts them out.
This reform, repeated, starts "bapartism", because it will now be two people from the same number of parties who will rule Congress.
These four MPs, together with Gloria Margarito Santos Aquilar, PRD's coordinator, were the only ones who voted against the Council, led by Salvador López Britm by PAN (Partido Action, Czech "National Action Party" - later on) and Luis Cárdenas Fonsecou as Vice-President.
Corvera Quevedo stated that these reforms are institutionally creating a political marginality from the fall of the PRI party (Partido Revolutionario Institutional, Czech "Revolutional Institutional Party") and PAN.
He explained that during the following days they would speak to representatives of PAN and PRI to modify the scheme on the basis of political will, and if they did not, they would again be detailed by those two parties, ending opposition coalitions.
"When I come here (opposite coalitions), I look at it because we're cut out of any decision, even they don't even want to consider the opinions of others."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez from Convergence stated that they agree with the PRD, PT and the Pattern, and that is why they will form a plurality group.
It is not possible to allow Congress to be "doubled" now after being monopolized.
Aspirating reform of the law is not to be endless bipartisan in Congress.
This group starts with five lawyers and its members are now talking to other colleagues and colleagues to get more votes, as Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez added.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT explained that at the present time Congress became "usual" two - in violation of PAN and PRI.
"She had only one side before, today she's divided by two."
Mr Montalvo asked for respect for the personality of the Members to be given a place at the negotiating table.
"In order that the five Members who are likely to be nine, but right now they see us in five, we do not remain outside, each in a different group, to find a place at the negotiating table, because the problem is that in the reform they have created and approved, we stand outside, and we do not agree with this reform."
The next 200 thousand pesos are issued for "supplier"
Workshops in Mazatlán will pay another check discussed owner of the company supplying electrical equipment.
Another check for something more than 200 thousand pesos was sent to the workers by Loreno Guadalupe Camach Palazuelos.
This amount paid in this second half of the year by the owner of the company supplying the electrical material shall be 1.20,000 pesos.
According to the Council's transparency page, this last check number 9258447 was sent on 16 November of this year, was issued to the 200,144,56 pesos and as its subject was referred to as "comparation of outstanding payments".
The depositary Luis Miguel López Moreno noted that the area would pay this supplier, which was monitored by the Supreme State Audit Office for selling at high prices, another volume.
What was not said is the total amount that the councils still owe her, and how many more checks will be in favour of the Camach Palacelos.
"There was nothing purchased now, only what we owe her, like the other suppliers," he said in a conversation.
Last checks "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: 24 September, two days on 15 October, 19 October, 29 October and this last 16 November.
Although this company has not yet been published in the Government Letter, as the law in the case of companies audited by the Supreme State Audit Office, in order to prevent their services from being used by other administrative authorities, the depositary has ensured that the services of the consultants have not been used again.
in the previous period, after 25 July, the Journal of the Czech Republic published a review of the Czech Republic’s workshops to its suppliers, which revealed that in the period from March 2008 to July 9, 2010, during the three-year period of old George Abel López Sánchez, the city of Camachė Palazuelos has paid more than 10 million pesos by means of 42 checks.
It also carried out a transaction with Jumapam, where it was incasing checks on more than 3 million pesos.
Tourist places necessarily need maintenance
Tourist managers complain in connection with the accident of foreign tourists due to the bad state of Sánchez Taboady text in Mazatlán.
After the fall of a foreign tourist to the depths of Sanchez Taboady, the tourist sector in Mazatlán asks the authorities to pay attention to areas and places that are in bad shape and do not show such a port in good light.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Association of Traders in the Zone of the Council, recalled that they repeatedly asked for the idea of destination, and the wrong things the tourists here find to replace with new activities or routes.
He noted that the bad state of the streets and pedestrians affects tourists who are passing through here and see disorder, which adversely affects close businesses.
"Policies don't know what it's like to close up a business for one day, and they have no idea about the markets they're avoiding, otherwise these matters wouldn't be solved for so long and without proper planning."
Hotelier José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the fall of tourists caused the lack of preventive measures and maintenance by the council.
"The Council will have to take responsibility and prevent this from happening again, it will have to devote preventive maintenance, not just repair existing procedures," he said.
We would like to take advantage of the clean city, because not only because we are a tourist area, we should make maintenance, but also as residents we deserve clean housing, the council should change our city maintenance strategy."
There are other places that appear to be neglected and poor, he noted, such as the Masatlán Emblem and El Venadito (monument, socha jelena - no later).
"Today, in order for tourists to come, it does not only depend on promotion, it is necessary to offer a good product, that is, a city with the purity of its beaches and streets, where the constant maintenance of tourist attractions is carried out," he said.
"There was no need for attention here, and these facts emphasize something that is well known, maintenance is missing.
He was talking about a number of places that should be put in order in cooperation with the consultants, said the priority must be to keep the city clean and in order to be attractive because it has a tourist potential.
Raúl Llera Martínez, a sub-secretary of tourism promotion, said that the preservation of tourist sites in Mazatlán is irrevocable because they are not properly used and do not make a good impression.
Fortunately, Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural goals and space that will need to be put in order first, so that we can attract these places and put them in the list we have to promote this destination."
IP requests for Congress results
Eduardo Dávalos, President of the CCE, would like the Members to take on a great responsibility by setting an example in seeking for better Signals, in the various challenges facing them.
The parliamentary term of office and without agreement between the parties and the State Executive calls for a business sector in Mazatlán, as Sinaloa is getting rid of major problems and problems.
Since yesterday, the 60th parliamentary period, consisting of seven political forces, 19 PRI MPs, 13 of PAN, three of the Party of New Alliance, two of the PRD, one of the PTs, one of the Convergence and the last of the PVEMs, has been launched, which includes a total of 40 national representatives.
The list of expectations for new members of Congress is to enable them to carry out proper leadership, commitments to the company and to the various areas that require responsible legislative work, and that the same side and patronage patterns will not be repeated.
Eduardo Dávalos Zamora, President of the Coordinating Business Council (CCE), proposed that the 40 newly elected members of Congress take on a great responsibility and serve as an example on the road to better Sinaloa in the various challenges facing them.
"We expect Members to actually exercise their right, without agreement between the parties, because they usually take measures to promote their own interests and they become the driving force of the leaders and leaders of the parliamentary groups."
He therefore spoke of the need to confirm the obligation to establish the necessary overlap, which would move the ruling forward by order.
"We want them to do a decent job and to be committed primarily to companies and sectors, because they were the inhabitants of Sinaloy, who gave them their voice in the past elections of trust."
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, president of the Tres Islas hotel association, said that one of the greatest challenges for 40 national representatives would be to collect all the forces in an effort to achieve economic growth in the country, because the current economic situation is very complex.
The most important thing is to encourage economic growth to create incentives for investment and infrastructure, which will support the creation of jobs in a certain way."
As far as travel is concerned, he asked for new legislators to give him greater weight within the state budget and support the Ministry of Tourism.
"I have learned that it is a ministry with the second lowest budget, which is not appropriate given that it is an important economic activity, bringing currencies and investments that are also directly facing agriculture."
In addition to providing funds for start-up tourism projects, Congress should help add the state to security and help with an alcohol law that has failed to resolve in previous parliamentary periods.
Looking for Three Kings
Girls, cars and bicycles are together with other players on the list of wishes for children in the family of the Coronad Valenzuels.
For their parents, the coming celebration of the Three Kings will be difficult to fulfill, since their home is about 12 people and one bereavement.
But Adelaida, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaiah, José Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Kašpar, Melicar and Baltazar will give them toys and clothes that they so long for.
The family lives in a modest settlement in Colonia Salvador Allende in poor conditions, as the father has no constant job.
"Sometimes we're having a hard time, because my husband's not lucky, but we're selling mandarins and potatoes... I'm going out with the "plebes" on the street to sell on the street," said Cayetana Valenzuel Andrade, the mother of children.
Adelaide's four-year-old wants a lady or a bike, while her three-year-old sister Isabel would like a lady Barbie.
As for ten-year-old José Alfred, he'd want a time of "monster" car, and for his eight-month-old brother, Jesus, Cayetana would like to dress in size for one year.
"He told me (José Alfredo) 'I'd like this monster car', but I told him 'we'll see the son' because it was very expensive," recalls Cayettean's grief.
For older kids who were just at school, it would be perfect clothes and shoes.
Maria Guadalupe, which is 11 years old, has a size of 12, 10-year-old Isaiah size 10, where eight-year-old Miguel wears a size 8.
Fourteen-year-old José Juan lacks tennis, so he'd have a lot of money about five and a half or six.
If you want to help fulfill the dreams of the children of the Crown of Valencian, you can participate in the campaign "Looking for the Three Kings", and at the reception of Noroest's diary bring a gift or money in cash.
14 suspected drug dealers who were arrested
Ten surveys were carried out in Estonia, on Wednesday, in the context of the liquidation of the network for the production and sale of the Indian rope.
Fourteen people were arrested and faced with various charges.
The surveys took place in Sherbrooka, Orford and Stoke, mostly in places used to produce drugs.
"Approximately 750 pieces of Indian rope, four kilograms of hashish, money and equipment that served the production was fun," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, a Quebec-speaking police officer.
Seventeen men and three women were arrested, both of whom were considered to be the bosses of the entire network, two men from Sherbrooke.
The detainees had to go to the courthouse in Sherbrooke as a result of their arrest.
They could face charges against the production of an Indian rope, its holding for the purpose of dealing with it, bribery and theft, among others.
These surveys were carried out following a long-term investigation, which lasted almost a year.
"It was the information we received from the public that allowed us to join this arrest," Mr. Ruel said.
This police operation was attended by 70 regional police officers investigating the city of Estrie State Police Quebec, State Police in Sherbrook and the Police Administration of Sherbrook Memphrémagog.
Illicit migration will be able to continue without problems.
The proposal of the law of the Conservatives, which the government considers should regulate the problem of ships loaded by illegal immigrants, will be clearly overcome while all three opposition parties on Wednesday have announced that they cannot support it.
"I strongly support the Charter."
"I am standing on the side of the party that has built a yellow under your feet," said the chief of liberals Michael Ignatieff, a surrounded MP after a weekly meeting of the du caucus.
The Liberals insist that the draft law, as proposed, would allow any person from the ship identified as a ship carrying illegal immigrants to retain the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedom within one year.
The head of the Quebec Block, Gilles Duceppe, also stated that he could not support the bill because he was heading towards the wrong goal.
"We are against and it seems that all the opposition parties are against, so we will see what the government is doing," said M. Duceppe.
NPD's criticism of immigration issues, Olivia Chow, has rejected the criticisms that want her party not to be strong enough as regards illegal immigrants.
"The neo-democratics agree that we should take measures against illegal immigrants' offenders and that is what we consider to be the bare part of another bill, C-35," Mrs Chow said.
"We do not support the proposal of the law of conservatives, because it puts blame on refugees and holds children in prison for at least one year," Mrs Chow explained.
The immigration minister Jason Kenny accused opposition parties.
"The Canadians collectively tell the MPs not to tolerate this kind of illegal migration, these criminal operations that take Canada into a man and deal with her as a pathologist."
They expect Canada to take the follow-up, Minister Kenny responded.
The government did not vote for confidence in its draft law, which could lead the country to the elections leading to its rejection.
One conservative, however, told the QMI Agency that the government would request a vote so that any MP who objected would respond from his position in front of his electors.
New unit does not mean uniformity
Despite the announcement that it is possible to establish a permanent unit for the fight against corruption and corruption, many observers still require the establishment of a public investigation commission for the issue.
Minister of Public Security Robert Dutil, strives to ensure that this idea is not forgotten: Quebec plans to consult the Department of Investigation from New York in January next year.
Metropolis has been a permanent anti-corruption unit since 1870.
That's why the Tuesday announcement of one of us was surprised.
It should be noted that, at the meeting of the Permanent Police Service Council in Quebec on 29 October last year, this measure was not discussed even though Robert Dutil himself was present.
Moreover, there was no need for the public security criticism, by PQ Stéphane Bergeron, to assess this announcement as "a rabbit extracted from the hat" and "a amateur solution crushed on the knee".
Minister Dutil himself replied to those who feared that political power had too much influence on the future of the unit.
"He'll be satisfied with the confirmation: you'll see the result when we announce it."
"We are aware of this problem."
For President CSQ, Rejean Parenta, nothing can replace the establishment of a witness hearing in public redeployment.
"In addition, Mr Charest is determined that he does not want to create this committee of inquiry, and people think, like you and me, that he's hiding something," he explains.
"The only way to achieve the creation of an investigative commission is the demise of Jean Charesta," explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and politics in the Institute for the Education of High Officials.
To be able to get out of this blind street, he proposed to Quebec to grant special powers to the Inspector General to investigate the colloquium and corruption.
"We must be able to expand the mandate of the Inspector General," he decided.
It also considers that Quebec could give the inspector the same authority as the commissioners who allow people to bring them to testify.
The creation of a permanent working group is not the only proposal in the records of Charest's government.
Quebec would also follow Ottawa to change the Criminal Law so that it would be better suited for this type of criminal activity.
This requirement would come from the powers of the Operation Marteau (Kladivo), which informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marca Fournier that jurisdiction in this kind of investigation is not explicit.
Federal Minister for Public Security, Vic Toews, confirmed that his fellow judge, Rob Nicholson, is just dealing with some of the amendments to this list.
During the operation of Jaro 2001, which reached a group of bikers, although the Trial Lawyer was not yet corrected, 131 people were arrested.
Ottawa subsequently made changes to the gangstery Act.
The river under strict surveillance.
A number of water flows have been under strict control due to severe collisions that have fallen since Tuesday in several regions of the province.
On Wednesday afternoon in Shawinigan, Mauritius, there was a drought of land.
Two houses were preventably evacuated.
The evening came for another season in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, Lanaudière.
The road's a mess.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, a number of regions were hit by a severe impact, i.e. 40 to 70 millimeters.
From 20 to 40 millimeters were not expected from today to Thursday evening, according to the regions.
In the north of the river and in the valley of Outauais, the most affected.
It could fall a total of up to 100 millimeters.
If we count these cuts with the snow gathered in some sectors, we can worry about some water currents.
The Quebec rescue service announced on Wednesday night warning against the danger of flooding for the Ouereau and Achigan rivers in Lanaudière.
Rivers in the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the woods of Laurentides, and in Chêne, in Lotbinière, became the subject of water supplies and continuous controls.
In the area of de Lanaudière, strong cuts of some lakes, in Sainte-Julienne, in Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare, as well as in Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, the result of strong rains was a temporary bridge.
Two residences had to be prevented from being evacuated.
In the Outauais, some lakes from the coast caused closures of some roads, especially in the village of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The rescue service has an emergency and is monitoring the situation in this area, said Annik Bouchard, Security Adviser.
The Quebec Water Prediction Centre issued in mid-war warning against strong floods for several rivers, in particular Maskinongé, Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont partially blammed
The Quebec-based broadcaster Stéphane Dupont suffered a partial shock in front of the Canadian Radio and Television Standards Council (RRTV) on the basis of controversial statements concerning social aid and the Haitians and, as well as a rough statement during the broadcast.
The Council for Broadcasting and Television judges that Mr. Dupont and his group from CHOI 98.1 FM were entitled to express their views, but some of the statements contained "inaccurate information about social assistance and inaccurate negative treatment of Haitians of gross expression which does not correspond to broadcasts during the day".
The Council also concluded that the discussion on suicide, including the sending of names to both persons who took their lives, did not violate the rules for the sending of the notice.
The Radio and Television Council received several complaints concerning comments made during the broadcast between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was taken after the complaint from the Joint Front of the beneficiaries of the social support of Quebec.
The group complained that the amounts indicated in the broadcast were inaccurate.
Moderators must provide reliable information, not false.
As for suicide, moderator Stéphane Dupont thought suicide was a gesture of despair.
Most members of the Commission concluded that the report was such that suicide cannot be understood as a solution to the problems of daily life.
"Most of the Commission's views are that the controversial episodes of the broadcast of "Dupont's Southern Reports" have been exposed to a delicate issue in a non-citizenal and appropriate manner."
He didn't get any promotions.
The last dispute concerned a statement following the earthquake in Haiti.
So Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort went into a media shooting that caused a lot of reactions.
The CHOI moderator said he did not send any gifts to help the Haitians, because we can't know for sure that the money they really need will get.
The Commission considers that these comments were not unjustified, but that their cumulative effect creates inaccurately negative image of the Haitians.
"I've already opened my class discount on that thing."
"My list has been intact for one and a half years," the moderator said.
In all decisions, the Commission shall refuse to use a bold statement.
In any event, the CHOI-FM broadcasts cooperated "on the basis of their duties".
For a station which will have to notify, inter alia, this decision once during the main broadcast within three days, the consequences are minimal.
King of Montreal.
The resident of Montreal, from Algeria, Nacereddine Zemmal, has an extremely special time.
The athlete who comes from the "sand" (kung-fu "full contact"), in the kickbox and the Thai box enters the world's tats and rings and is looking for new challenges.
"I started with martial arts such as kung fu and kickbox 12 years ago, in Algeria, explained Earthmal, whose name has been living in the capital since 2008 to be taught by professionals."
"In my case, I'm looking for matches a little everywhere, because for those who don't like a game on the country that appears in the field of combat sports, competitions in North America are rare."
Recently, this person, who works as a protection and as a supporter of UPS, just gave bad news to his competitors when he won two gold medals at the World Championship at the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA), from 23 to 30 October, in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I won the categories of kickbox full contact and Thai box, he introduced."
"I am currently preparing for China at the World Cup in a dream show."
"Friends who finished the first four on the final world championship in every category were invited."
"In Toronto in 2009 I won the bronze."
"In 2005, I finished eight in Vietnam."
"In 2007 in China, I finished my fifth morning tournament, while in Toronto in 2009 I finished my third, added."
"It's interesting that I've made some progress in every competition."
"I'm going to be at this pace the first year or the last one!"
"san show" or "sanda" is a discipline from China, where the punches of the feet and feet, as well as walking on the ground, are allowed.
The matches are traditionally played on the platform and more often in the ring.
The most famous boxer, taken from this form of battle, is the American of the Vietnamese origin of Cung Le, well known in the world of martial arts.
No matter how Nacer Earth has to keep one result in his career, he will be able to confirm his participation in the super tournament "King of Sanda", Super Bowl in kung-fu.
"This competition is the highest and most prestigious in China, explains a nice guy."
"It's such a little equivalent for the City of Lumpinee (the largest stadium in Thailand)."
"It was a great experience."
Landmal won his first match, in the semi-finals of his category (80 kg), before he suffered loss in the finals.
"The one who defeated me was a real pro, analyzed."
"There are four rivals per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"The winning semi-finals compete in the finals of their category."
"Then the winners win every category so that the only champion, King kung fu, can be crowned."
450 million hired without public competition
Hydro-Québec agreed after an agreement of 450 million in contracts with companies providing engineering for the hydroelectric project Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert.
In the heart of this van, more than 100 contracts are just a consortium created by BPR, Dessau, SM and Axor Group, which received the most important contract, a contract to manage the whole project total of $295 million without public competition.
This consortium, on behalf of Energie Gerance, was co-financed in 2004 with the choice of Hydro-Québec to entrust the private sector with its responsibility for managing this significant hydroelectric project worth $5 billion.
At the beginning of 2005, the Energie Gerance Consortium won a lucrative contract without any public competition.
For the Quebec side, the complaint against the consortium of companies in front of us poses a serious ethical issue, which risks exclusion of competition and leads to price increases.
"It's a new way to realize the collapse and eliminate competition."
"This means that people, the side agreements are no longer secret, they are already open today," said PQ Sylvain Simard yesterday at the press conference.
About something earlier, in the morning, Mr. Simard asked this question to the National Assembly because he said it was difficult to carry how public interest could be so sold.
The Ministry of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, in the afternoon, refused to object to the fact that this contract would have been the case.
"I've got my own way," she hopped and claimed that PQ was "unfortunate" and "lost accuracy."
She said "it would be the least" that PQ would apologize.
The recipe for the creation of a consortium is a common practice around the world.
This is usually an alliance, limited in time, which allows two or more companies to pool their mutual expertise in order to respond to the call for proposals for a complex project.
The Eastmain project is very complex with regard to the scope of work.
The construction is already in progress and must be deployed by 2012.
However, the contract was admitted without competition being able to act; it was a trade.
It must also be acknowledged that the consortium formula is no longer an exception in Quebec, nor in relatively simple projects.
As Le Devoir discovered last week, the form of a consortium in the field of engineering advice is the subject of government investigation.
If we fly through the Quebec company's trade register at speed, we can find more than 200 consortia, some of which seem to have been created.
This is how Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors; we call it CIMA+, Genivar, SNC-Lavalin and Roche and Tecsult.
Every combination, and there are dozens of them, leads to one and the same legal person, and that's Dessau.
With regard to the consortium of Energie gérance, Minister Normandeau in particular argued that "the territory of La Baie James is a typical special dynamic of the workforce and that Hydro-Québec has responded to it since the 1970s".
The project's main patron, Eastmain, Réal Laporte, from the Energy Company Baie James (SEBJ), gave us an explanation that makes us feel guilty about the fact that the project management contract was concluded after a mutual agreement.
"If you go to public competition and if there are few competitions offering offers, your offered prices may be higher."
"You have two options to choose: that is to select the people who are in the contract as participants in the competition, and that you say, "Let's make a peace agreement and a good price."
"But the main idea is that important is not the price, but the competence of people," said Mr Laporte.
This contract awarded to the Energie Gerance Consortium is part of the long list of contracts for more than $50,000 received by the Quebec Party.
The contracts were concluded with Hydro-Québec or SEBJ on the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After verification, Le Devoir has calculated 109 contracts for advice in the field of engineering concluded between 2002 and March 2010 with companies or their branches, in particular with laboratories carrying out soil sampling.
SNC-Lavalin acquired 22 contracts, of which Genivar won 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without having a share in "Energie gérance".
All contracts have been closed.
Together they count $449 783 344, including a contract with Energie Gerance for $295 131 564.
Sylvain Simard pointed out that four companies that are part of the consortium (BPR, Dessau, SM and Axor) are "very well known Liberal sides of Quebec".
Minister Normandeau issued a report that the PQ is also linked to the companies that are "funding it" before clarifying that one is more of her managerial staff.
Barometer responsible consumption - "green" label does not boost trust
More green, but openly sceptical.
The Quebec consumer very little trusts the actors of sustainable development, but also "inside" labels and environmental certification, to manage accordingly when selecting products.
The worst part is that even though we are buying in a media space that demands us and offers us a more responsible social consumption, this media space calls for a lack of reliable information, a failure to meet obligations that even qualify as a brake for its commitment, Barometer provides the responsible consumption, the first article of which came out yesterday.
Although the consumption of so-called responsible products increased in 2010, the people of Quebec who are trying to sell them do not believe it too much.
Two thirds of us actually say that they don't believe in the promises of companies with regard to the environment, just because green advertising companies, they find a measuring instrument that has been developed by the Observer for responsible consumption of the University in Sherbrooke.
Other findings: Half of consumers doubt the authenticity of the official certificates attached to so-called fair products, but also the authenticity of the products and labels that are identified as ecologically responsible, the Barometers.
In the same way, the policy debate on this issue is adopted as a serious only 14.6% of Quebec's population.
However, information on responsible consumption appears to be the first step in stimulating this page of consumption which is now being recovered by almost one third of Quebec consumers.
Indeed, the vacuum and the questionable nature of the information would mitigate the enthusiasm of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by Barometer at the higher price of these products.
Finally, a third of the inhabitants of Quebec are incredibly opposed to the data provided by producers or "green" services that we are looking for to let them pass by our hands.
On the other hand, in 2010, almost half of consumers were willing to change their habits and, in particular, to change the brand of one or more products that would respond to their beliefs.
The total of 61% of them made purchases to traders from their quarter and gave preference to the purchase of food grown in their region, says Barometer.
More "green" and responsible - the responsible consumption index reached 64 out of a maximum of 100 for this year - , Homo consumus Québec is pleased to present itself as a king of recycling, who strives for the least environmental impact by taking care of animal protection.
But their social and environmental awareness has obviously remained somewhere outside their vehicle, says Barometer: in 2010, almost 28% of Quebec's population said they were using public transportation or recommending the use of cars for at least two people in order to protect nature.
The course and the cycle also supported 39.1% of participants in this extensive study of behavior that used this cliché.
State loan for the purchase of the kin eXcentris complex
The government of Quebec, which we asked for a financial contribution to the purchase of the cinema complex eXcentris Angus et le Parallelèle, agrees with the participation, but only to the amount of the loan.
The development company "Angus et le Parallèle", which made a donation of $7 million from the Minister of Culture to the purchase of a cinematographic complex at the Shrine of Saint-Laurent and which proved its mission as a film artist, did not receive what she requested.
The government accepts the fact that it will be included in the documentation, but under its own terms.
More than the expected gift is proposed by the Government of Quebec for a loan which would otherwise be lower, there was some initial expectation that could build the basis for viable solutions under favourable conditions and with sources from the state.
The first action plan and demand for 12.8 million were already rejected by Quebec last year in the spring, but applications have already been reviewed for reduction.
The proposal and action plan were sent by the Minister of St-Pierre, President of the Society for Business Development in Culture (SODEC), François Macerola, who runs the eXcentris cinematographic project.
The final report was sent ten days ago.
But the government's opposition came to SOODEC on Tuesday.
Le Parallelèle et Angus has time until December 31st to answer.
However, it seems that the assumption of the gift from the State must be truly rejected.
Recall that the Association of China's Owners and Cinematographic Centres in Quebec was opposed to the state's direct investment in order to be able to support the purchase of eXcentris, denouncing that the Minister of Culture should not finance a property project if he did not do so for other cinemas.
However, a number of participants in the discussion demanded basic economic support.
Daniel Langlois, the owner, got into the space of his films over ten years of film art after he himself financed the complex building, which could have been the reason for the state's financial board's change.
The lack of rooms for independent films is crippling in Montreal, and eXcentris was able to obtain a constant clientele.
Angus et le Parallèle, with Christian Yaccarini in his head, runs a campaign to release funds into the private sector, believing he's spending $700,000 to push out the stock.
Since spring 2009, the only three film companies, Le Parallèle, continue to distribute films for eXcentris.
The goal of future buyers is to reopen all three halls on February 27th next year and celebrate the most beautiful film Xavier Beauvois Man and the gods.
But Christian Yaccarini didn't remember Le Devoir, and so he ignores, he and his group think about the proposals for reductions that were made to him.
A high-end tire on Canada as a whole...
The new American diplomats, known through WikiLeaks, reveal what the United States considers to be a complex minority of Canadians towards Americans, but with the impact of their feeling superior to Canada.
The U.S. diplomats are therefore amazed that every Canadian elector is at the heart of Canadian-American relations when he goes to vote, and he believes that President Obama's visit helped the Conservative government to accept her budget in 2009!
Four new reports from the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, last night on public notice, also provide sensitive details to get each other "under the skin".
The communication with the date of 22 September 2008, i.e. in the middle of the election campaign, details the point in which the United States is not part of the statements discussed by the political leaders.
To the great surprise of the U.S. embassy in Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins is giving this situation a few explanations.
"Canadian minority complex, almost inflexible, may remind political leaders to talk about internal bets instead of realizing that these elections concern the United States (as in the 1988 free trade campaign)," he writes.
"The United States is therefore," he said, "a very promising island in these elections: all-inclusive but potentially too dangerous to talk about them."
The ambassador understands this "declaring silence" as less that both countries maintain intensive political and economic relations.
"It is logical that the ability of the candidate, party or even better the head of the party to manage these important relationships should be a key factor that the voters have in mind when they go to the elections."
Another expression of this feeling of importance can be read in the report sent on 22 January 2009 by Terry Breese, Chargé d'affaires in Ottawa, preparing President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Your journey will help to ensure that the government retains its confidence in the beginning of February, with regard to the federal budget, which Canada publicly recognises its first deficit for more than ten years, for the purpose of a recovery plan of between $30 billion and $40 billion," writes M. Breese.
No mention is made of the fact that the government had to postpone the preliminary parliamentary sitting so that the coalition could not be defeated and that opposition parties recalled their survival as a quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another January 2008 report, signed by Ambassador Wilkins , points to Washington as further a negative picture , which is throwing dramatic series on the United States sent to the CBC .
The Ambassador is concerned about the broadcast of Border, Little Moscow on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which you can see not too suspicious references to Maher Arar, "No-Fly-List" or also to kidnappings for violent investigations by the CIA.
Another report points out that at their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked his French partner Bernard Kouchner whether Europe was ready to accept some prisoners with Guantanam.
Mr. Kouchner answered yes, but on the basis of the principle of "case-by-case".
At the end of the meeting, it says, "He passed some paper on Omara Khadr, a 15-year-old Canadian Muslim, a state secretary."
"The Secrets agreed to review the file."
Finally, let's note that the people who are concerned with WikiLeaks are resting.
Tom Flanagan, former consultant very close to Stephen Harper, said on the CBC waves that a person responsible for this massive loss should be "destroyed".
It came out and heard about it and Mike Huckbee in the United States.
World plan for the restoration of light
Last night, the United Nations proposed a plan to restore domestic lighting, light trade and industrial space in 100 countries in Cancún to achieve a greenhouse effect limit (GES), which corresponds to almost one third of the next limit, which is to be achieved in order to stabilise the climate of the planet from now until 2020.
This ambitious plan is in the stage of major concrete projects that the United Nations wants to launch in Cancún to compensate for the absence of difficult implementation commitments to reduce industrially successful countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, if extinguished lamps that monopolies up to 50 to 70% of the market are replaced by fluo-compact lamps or, even better, with electroluminescent diodes (DEL or "LED" in English), the primary amount of 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) GES emissions on the planet of light would be detonated.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of world emissions.
It's an equivalent of 70% emissions from the car park all over the planet.
In Kodana last year, large countries with a significant share in emissions such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, have engaged in voluntary plans to reduce the GES global emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
But it will have to be removed from this balance sheet yet 5 Gt in order to achieve the stabilisation of climate warming by 2020 at 2 degrees Celsius in order to exclude it from being out of control.
In heated lamps, 95% of the energy is dissolved in the form of heat and residues, i.e. 5%, is the product of light.
With fluorinated lamps, energy consumption is reduced by 75% and with new LEDs, we reduce this consumption twice again.
Fluorescent lamps shall last from 6000 to 10,000 hours on average.
New lamps with DEL, such as those introduced this week to Philips - this company allegedly participated in a study of the United Nations - have the estimated lifetime of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a flashlight, which gives us a picture of possible savings with a refund plan that would apply in 100 countries.
All these new lamps can also work with the rest and sparkle less heat.
And they don't contain any mercury.
Several experts expressed concerns about fluorinated lamps, as they contain mercury and should be classified as hazardous waste, which is still not possible in developing countries, unless manufacturers set up collections.
However, according to the report, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not a fluo-compact lamp, but rather a warm coal power plant that emits many mercurys needed to produce electricity in the extinguished lamps.
In the United States alone, these centres provide about 25,000 tons of mercury per year.
The report also details the profits that each country would have from this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would save billions of dollars a year for the purchase of electricity and eight million tonnes of CO2, equivalent to 3.5 heat plants, whose construction would be 2.5 billion
Coastal elephants eagerly await the results of the election results.
The UN Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, requested immediate publication of the results of the presidential elections in the coast of Slovenia after the deadlines had expired.
"The Secretary-General underlines the need for the independent electoral commission to complete its work and immediately announce the preliminary results, highlighted the UN President's speech."
"All parties in the Coast of Slovenia and the institutions are required to prove their sense of responsibility and refrain from any initiative until provisional results are announced."
Despite the pressure from some foreign governments, the election commission has allowed the worst date - mid-term - , without publishing the results, three days after Sunday's decline.
About forty minutes before the deadline was set, the President of CEI on television confirmed that the Commission "continued to work" in order to deliver the results.
In the middle of the world , the challenge was to finally declare the name of the winner of the second round, between the retreating Laurent Gbagbo and the opposition member Alassan Ouattara.
But the camp of Gbagbo is based on the cancellation of the Constitutional Council for the "underwater" vote in the north, which is adjusted by the former New Army (UN) in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, the director of the presidential election campaign in the coast of the elephants, confirmed that the manoeuvres of intimidation of the voters who practiced the UN (New Army) in the north of the country have disproved President of the elephants from going to vote.
The elections could be cancelled if the Constitutional Council looked at the complaint that Gbagbo filed.
However, President Gbagbo's opposition is that the country's highest court is not neutral because it is run by Paul Yao N'Dré, a very close political associate of President Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man from the north who dematerializes any connection with the former rebellion, condemned the detention in declaring the results as "unacceptable" and asked Gbagba to respect it, but not so far as it would require victory.
His allies confirm that Gbagbo blocks the publication of the results, because he knows that he has suffered loss, and that he submits a complaint to the Constitutional Council after defending the election commission to send the results, it would be illegal.
The second round of the presidential elections on Sunday was considered to co-ordinate the process of reunification and reconciliation of the country, which has been divided into two half years.
The United Nations pointed out at the centre of the Coast Guard political group that it could be held responsible for any violence.
Laurent Gbagbo finished his first round on October 31, as a winner with 38% votes against 32% for Alassana Ouattaru, who received public support from former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
The unemployment rate remains stable in France in the third quarter.
The measure of unemployment in France, in terms of words according to the International Labour Office (BIT), remained stable at 9.3% in metropolitan France (9.7% including maritime areas), as shown by the provisional data on seasonal corrections (CVS) published by INSEE on Thursday.
The number of unemployed stood at 2,631 million in the metropolis.
Data from the second quarter were confirmed to 9.3% of the active population in the metropolis and 9.7% of the marine areas.
In one year, the unemployment rate increases by 0.1.
In the wider picture, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France do not work in the third quarter, but they would like to work, regardless of whether they are available in two weeks to work and whether they are looking or not.
The situation of young people on the labour market has yet to be tackled by a new increase in unemployment of 24.2% in metropolitan France (+ 0.9 points in three months, +0.5 points in one year) and 25% in the maritime areas.
In the third quarter, there were, according to the International Labour Office, 637,000 young people aged 15 to 24.
As far as seniors are concerned, they have recorded in metropolitan France a slight increase in unemployment to 6.4% in metropolitan France (+0.2 points in three months, as well as in one year), which is 482,000 people over 50 years of age and 6.6% of the marine area.
Only the 25-49-year-old population recorded benefits from unemployment stability to 8.3% in metropolitan France (-0.1 point in three months, +0.1 point in one year) and 8.8% in all of France.
Insee no longer publishes the monthly unemployment rate since 2006, and this is the basis for its calculation method.
Eurostat, the European Union statistical agency, on the contrary, continues to produce monthly statistics and announced a 9.8% share for France (including DOM) in October after 9.9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini is accused and imprisoned
Alexandre Guérini, 53 years old, one of the bosses of the waste processing business and the brother of PS, the Bouches-du-Rhône Administrative Board, was accused and imprisoned in the Luynes prison, near Aix-en-Provence, in the course of an investigation into public procurement, allegedly undernourished.
Alexandre Guérini was accused of abuse of the property of the company, misuse of public funds and public property, neglect, payment, acceptance of fees for the purpose of influencing the office and holding the gun, his lawyer states.
"Alexandre Guérini is a warrior and insists on explaining to the judge all the questions he intends to ask him, not some overcrowding."
"It's easy to track her for a lot of criminal reasons, but another thing is to prove her," his lawyer, Florence Rault, told his client.
Mr Guérini informed his lawyers that he had sent a brief statement before his inquiry to explain everything.
One of his close friends, Philippe Rapezi, was also accused and imprisoned on Wednesday night.
According to his lawyer, Lucien Simona, his client never did anything other than to ensure the functioning of the valves he was supposed to manage.
As to the allocation of contracts or the destination of funds associated with their operation, he never knew of anything like that, Mr Simon said.
In this regard, Daniel Pinna, former General Manager of Aubagne's services, was accused of using public funds and plots on Wednesday, and left for freedom, under the supervision of the ban, the protagonists of all matters.
"My client has been able to give an explanation of all the facts that have been made to him."
"The investigating judge will take care of it and leave it free," said his lawyer, Mr. Yann Arnoux.
Another four persons were accused and released at night from Tuesday to Wednesday, by being under judicial supervision for the two of them, appointed representatives of state government Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, deputy director-general with the elegance of Marseille Provence Metropole (MPM), is charged for accepting payments for the purpose of affecting the office and for passive corruption."
Two officials from the Aubagne, Michèle Duval and Christophe Briguier are accused, one for "depression and abuse of the property of the company", the other for "complexity in the abuse of public funds".
Finally, commercial partner Alexandra Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, was accused of "reducing the abuse of the property of the company".
Among those who were confronted with Mr. Guérin is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, who was recently accused in a similar case of fraudulent public contracts concerning Corsica.
The investigators suspect his company that they helped clean up the money from the vast gangstery.
The investigation shall be conducted in the framework of several open trials against X in April 2009 following the adoption of anonymous letters concerning alleged fraud in closing public contracts, in particular in the case of waste.
From the source of the near investigation, the survey focuses in particular on the conditions for the allocation and operation of the plant in La Ciotat, which collects wastes from Aubagne, as well as from some cities in the city of Marseille (MPM).
Case Clotilde Reiss: Elysian Palace overrun the Syrian mediators
During more than ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, Klotildy Reissov, a young research worker arrested in Iran for "spionage", united his views in France, presented diplomacy in the war's haste and stressed the relationship between Paris and Tehran.
All of this has been closely monitored by United States diplomats.
American documents obtained through WikiLeaks and consulted with Le Monde reveal some of the disadvantages of this crisis.
They describe how the Elysian Palace explained its strategy to the Americans, and went so far as to advise them how to handle such cases by hand in Iran (a small group of passengers).
They show how the leading French representatives tried to convince Washington that the release of young French was not compensation for the release of Majida Kakavanda, the Iranian prisoner in France and the US-seeked excuse for sub-trading material in favour of the Iranian nuclear programme.
Finally, they shed light on the way in which the French Presidency tried to manipulate the media to credit the idea that the Syrian President, Bachar Al-Assad, played a central role in the liberation of Clotildy Reiss.
He didn't actually do anything about it.
Diplomatic telegram, written on 12 August 2009 in Paris, has the title: "Iran:French comments on how to resolve the situation in the case of arms".
Counsellor from the Ellysei Palace for Strategic Affairs, François Richier, accompanied by Director Quai d'Orsay for North Africa Middle East, Patrick Paoli, spoke with the representative of the American diplomacy Allegrone.
They explain to him the French method.
They recommend that the Americans do the same for the return of their own nationals by violence detained in Iran.
"Do noise," they say, "always say "in the media "the fundamental right of man", "innocentness", "immediate liberation".
It is necessary to bring an Iranian regime that is sensitive to its image.
"Do it more than they'll ask you to stop it."
Because attempts have been made to negotiate through discreet channels, "the quiet does not solve anything", the Iranians are "masters for avoiding manoeuvres".
Mr. Richier recalls that arresting foreigners is "the Iranian family's tactics: taking arms for the purposes of "political extermination".
It states that the liberation of Clotildy Reissov (which will take place on 16 August, on the day when it is provided by the French Embassy) "will require the payment of a high financial amount to the Iranians" (see EUR 230,000).
And they'll announce that the Elyse Palace is anticipating cases of handicrafts, a phenomenon that "will rise".
The Iranians could "in the future arrest about 1800 French people living in Iran," he said.
28 August 2009.
Klotilda Reissová left prison 12 days ago, but remains blocked in Iran.
Information is disseminated: Iranian Majid Kakavand, about which the United States states declare that it has been issued for illegal trafficking in electronic material sensitive to Iran, is released in Paris on the basis of a judge's decision.
The American embassy, as well as many observers, is asking for this disturbing agreement.
For Washington, which is pursuing an illegal Iranian network to obtain nuclear material, the deployment of Majid Khakavanda is a bad news.
France came to the deal?
Irish release for the liberation of young French?
In another conversation with Kathleen Allegrone, September 4th, François Richier assures that it is not.
The Elysian Palace, as it has been said, was not only "surpassed by this judge's decision", but was looking for a way to deal with it.
"The talks were held between the President's Office and the Minister of Justice" (at that time, Michele Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot change the decision of the court," he notes.
Mr. Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand is under "limited" surveillance of the French intelligence service.
The Council of the Elysian Palace has a telephone number, hangs the phone and then informs the American diplomat that the Iranian is currently in the Paris buildings managed by the Iranian embassy."
At the time of Klotildy Reissov's imprisonment in Iran, the Ellysei Palace of Efforts, negotiates, through communications and organized "uniques" into the media, to convince the Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad to play "significant" and "impact" the role of "mediator".
The Americans observe this activity, not without irony, and find that manipulation is bearing its fruit, as several articles in the press reflect the official French version.
Telegram of 25 August 2009 evokes the media "blest" of French officials."
What such a "thank you" measure is based on, expressed to M. Assad, is asked by the embassy in Paris.
"Even with their declaration, full of praise, French public figures in private acknowledge that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians have actually done."
The document then deals with the reasons that forced the Elyse Palace to pay in this fix.
The intensive communication "directs to the validation of the policy of President Sarkozy's opening to Syria", analyzes.
Policy implemented in 2008 "was observed by many critical voices in France and abroad and marked as premature and undeserved".
By "how to move the Syrian role", Paris strives to "demonstrate Syria what praise it can serve when it plays a constructive role in the field".
The aim is also to "sit down the grain gap between Syria and Iran".
The American Embassy knows this from a very good source.
August 11th, François Richier confided to him, "Of course we don't know if the Syrians have done anything, whatever it is"
"But still we thanked them."
"This should at least introduce confusion and uncertainty between Iran."
Klotilda Reissová is returning to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy accepts her at the Elysian Palace.
In communication, he thanks the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in the benefit of the liberation of our country".
End of online game after midnight for young Koreans
The South Korean government will adopt a law called "Pecival" that will prevent adolescents from playing online games after midnight, by blocking access to them, the responsible government makers have introduced.
The bill will be submitted to Parliament in December in order to ask for companies operating online games to block access to these games after 16 years of age after midnight, the representatives of the Ministry of Culture and the Ministry of Family have introduced.
"Many children play these games all night and then have problems with school learning and are not able to lead normal life during the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary in order to ensure their health and their right to sleep," said AFP Jo Rin, a leading factor in the ministry, who has a draft law on care.
Online games will be available again from 6 o'clock in the morning.
The companies will have one year to prepare for the application of the law, to clarify.
The government also assumes that it requests companies to limit the daily time of access to these games for young people whose parents ask for it to be completed by the responsible employee.
It also provides people who ask for it, free programs, allowing them to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the country's most "suffered" and daily press regularly brings different facts associated with intensive Internet use.
At the same time, the country is an incontestable champion in world competitions in online games.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at World Cyber Games, which faces 58 other nations.
The world championship in 2018-2022: Fifa establishes host countries.
The Fifa Executive Committee, on Thursday of the World Cup host country in 2018 and 2022, establishes a full-fledged political election where the fight for influence and lobbying risks predominating technical criteria.
The thing is certain, the Royal Fifa competition in 2018 will take place in Europe, the traditional centre of this discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, the Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 Championship will be much more exotic, with the International Federation hoping it will be able to acquire new territories (Qatar, Australia) after the 2010 African continent premiere, or continue to enter the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities participating in the delegation (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, Prince of Qatar, leading government actors Belgium and the Netherlands, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) provides an opportunity to create an idea of the scale of the economic and political conditions around the world.
Negotiation in the back of the head is at risk that they will last until the last minute.
It is difficult for the rest to establish a hierarchy according to the candidates.
According to Fifa's assessment report, English, Spanish-Portugal (2018) and American (2022) have the best arguments, as well as their competitors' documentation.
However, these reasons will not be too important for the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the time appointed for voting.
Sunday Times at the beginning of the disclosure, leading to the suspension of two members of the EC/European Commission?/ for corruption (Reynald Temaria et Amos Adamu) may have destroyed the chance of his country, a cobbled mine, which has since hosted the world championship only once a year.
On Monday, the BBC handed over the crown when it sent out a document which "written on a pen" by three influential members of the EC (European Commission?), Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayato.
How to make Fifa unhappy and bring into trouble the English leader with David Cameron first.
The president hopes that he will be able to repeat what happened to his predecessor in the role of Tony Blair, who in 2005 managed to win the London Olympics Organisation in 2012.
Will this intensive activity be sufficient to allow England to add a new light to its name with the EC (European Commission?)?
Nothing is less certain because the two Spanish-Portugals lack the drums of the already prepared stadiums, their well-being (World Championship in 1982 in Spain, the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona, Euro-2004 in Portugal) and their football culture.
But the cloudy economic and financial perspectives of both countries could give these ambitious cold showers.
Any legal measures against the English and doubts about the payment capacity of Spain and Portugal only increase the position of Russia, which was also outsider in its documentation (stations, hotels, transport).
But the Prime Minister, Vladimir Putin, decided that the championship would not be moved to Zurich and publicly declared "no competition in the preparation of the vote", in the verbal attacks only rarely prosecuted to the English press against the members of the EC (European Commission).
"We'll throw them in the mud, try to compromise them," said Mr. Putin.
For 2022 they seem to be a logical favorite of the United States with their significant experience since 1994.
The world's highest economic performance, the home of Fifa's main sponsors, seems to have a great impact on Japan and South Korea, which have developed a beautiful project separately.
But these candidacys seem to be premature for both countries, which together in 2002 produced "tests".
Another threat: the award of the 2026 World Championships in China, which feverishly desires Fifa, made the Asian chance for the year 2022 unpaid.
With Katara, who took out a large eos in the form of futuristic stadiums, and Australia, Fifa would continue in its expansion to new lands, but these two countries represent more risks than security.
Australia, as well as Japan and Korea, would be able to watch for flat-rate TV fees (for the sake of time movement) paid by European countries, which create a hygienic power for Fifa.
Second mandate: visibility (security)
De Gaulle really did.
Mitterrand raised his opinion that he was serious.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not fail at all.
And Nicolas Sarkozy is even less than they are.
The mandate of the Elsei Palace calls for someone else.
The current head of the state will therefore be the candidate in 2012.
But obviously it is not in good faith with a share of the secret associated with the presidential function.
It is therefore necessary to do as if the doubts were persistent.
In one sense or another.
In 2006, rather than believing it, friends of Jacquese Chirac made claims that the third mandate should not be excluded.
On 15 November, with a serious expression of Nicolas Sarkozy, he made sure that "it will sometimes be decided in the autumn of 2011".
As the members of the UMP's parliament recalled in the middle of the night in the Elysian Palace, the perspective of the "two mandates" was a little bitter.
Was it his candidacy's official announcement?
He wasn't far from it.
The President only recalled that the revision of the Constitution in 2008 limited the number of five-year functional periods to two.
It was just his findings, not his announcement.
It's not the first time he remembers the humourous tone of the presidential election at such meetings.
"In the worst case, or in the best case, you've got seven and a half years ahead of you with me," he said in July 2009.
Rebelie in May 2010: "Don't think I don't consider another stage."
His earlier sentences will not make her a candidate more than the previous day; they will not make him a candidate or less.
If they're making comments, it's because of the two truth.
Accelerating the way to the PS candidacy, on the one hand.
But it's not the entrance to Ségolèn Royala's collaborator, who pushes Nicolas Sarkozy to testify.
On the contrary, it is because his 2012 candidacy is evident that many in the PS want to organize the fighting structures rather than intended.
Bad research on the other side.
First, right-wing voters would prefer Françoise Fillon's candidacy against Nicolase Sarkozy's candidacy (46%) against 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have candidates and we don't discuss the matter with the UMP," responded immediately and cautiously to people from the closest environment of the government's president.
"If he believes he can defeat, he won't run," said Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will still believe he can win," corrects Alain Juppa, who is clearly balanced.
Euro: The European Central Bank is forced to continue in its procurement of public securities.
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the Central Year should be an opportunity to clarify the conditions for withdrawal from the crisis or, at least, a notice to halt a large number of unusual monetary policy operations that have to be completed by the end of this year.
The European debt crisis is committed, and the institution for issuing securities will certainly not be able to allow it to be so categorically at the risk of worsening the situation today that it is already so tense on European securities markets.
The political price would be higher in that case.
Yesterday, at the occasion of the press conference, the French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde gave up the active role played by the Central European Bank in the favour of resolving the crisis of the search for European states.
She didn't want to say if she thought the bank could do more, for example by increasing their program of buying overdraft bonds.
"I take my view of my European partners (...)".
The evening before, in Brussels, in his inquiry by the Commission on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament, the President of the European Central Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, did not appear to be more specific in terms of his intentions, and he was satisfied that he stated that the programme for the purchase of State securities on the secondary market "continued" and that we "see how we decide" during the meeting on this Thursday.
The only guarantee is that the European Central Bank will keep its basic fixed interest rate at 1%, its historically lowest level since May 2009.
In fact, the purchase of bonds made by the Central European Bank has doubled by nearly EUR 1.35 billion over the last week.
And because of the lack of understanding on the market, the contractors made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese bonds yesterday.
The Eurosystem's total central banks have purchased EUR 67 billion since May 2010.
There is no doubt that there is a market for anticipating the continuation of the purchase (see page 29).
Nor do economics expect any significant change in the course.
If the loan operations for more than three months have already disappeared from the central bank’s arsenal, this latter appointed bank shall be able to provide unlimited liquidity under the high conditions and for a period of one week to three months.
Economics today expect this mechanism to be extended for several months.
"I can't imagine that she would change her program in a significant way."
"If not, it would mean taking the risk of triggering a short-term new tension," said Michael Schubert, a Commerzbank economist.
"The progressive exit announced during the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely," said Norbert Brams, an economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
To plan its public debt market interventions, "the European Central Bank would have to maintain the volume of purchases of its bonds to revive the soft market," Norbert Brams added.
In view of the exposure of European banks to the euro area debt markets, there is nothing else to choose but to keep their presence on the market.
"It is necessary at any price to replace the shortage of investors on the market and to act in such a way as to prevent the development of the state's payment performances, which are among the most fragile," a significant bond manager testified yesterday.
Because if interest rates flow, the States will take more care to reduce their debt rather than stabilise it.
It's saving the euro for this price.
In Italy, the Berlusconi government is holding back.
At the beginning of the week, the worrying situation for Italy was slightly relieved, with a return rate of ten years.
Return to temporary peace.
At the end of the meeting with the Prime Minister of Economics, they said that they heard Giulia Tremonti, how he qualified the situation as "unsolved" and that he expected an "inescapable" weekend, which he then demented.
In any event, in Tuesday, the deviation from the long German interest rate reached a record of 210 basic points and the price of the anti-bankrupt (CDS) contracts ran up to 263 points, resulting in certain disruptions in Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi noted that in Spain, the share of German interest was higher than 400 basis points.
But his right hand, Gianni Letta, has declared himself "too busy" "by the booming development of the markets" and possible infection from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the third eurozone economy, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that it's like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, an economist at Hudson Institute.
Clearly and unencrypted, its problem is the lack of growth and indiscriminate fiscal inputs, which goes hand in hand and presents a risk that it will not be able to cover its financing needs.
The last forecasts of Brussels were for the government of the cold shower.
Italy's growth is now expected to be 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... while the budget available to the Senate for its analysis is 1.3% and 2%.
Under these conditions, calculated by the European Commission, the public finances deficit will represent another 4.3% of gross domestic product next year (against 3.9% of the government envisaged) and 3.5% in 2012 (notably 2.7%).
From this point of view, a new summary of the additions to the draft state budget, which could be introduced after the celebrations, amounting to €7 billion.
"If necessary, new strict measures will have to be adopted," the evaluation of the Commissioner for Economic Affairs, Olli Rehn.
For the time being, Italy is receiving support from international institutions.
"The basic stones of its economies are fine and its calculations are correct, we have been repeating it for a long time," assures Arrigo Sadun, an Italian member of the Governing Council of the International Monetary Fund under the pressure of Italy on the International Monetary Fund.
"There is no immediate problem, no short-term or long-term, because through its significant debt (119.2% of gross domestic product 2011, NDLR), the effort to stabilise the demands of Italy is less than the efforts required of other countries," notes Pier Carlo Padoan, the leading OECD economy.
There's a question of political instability.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a proposal for a declaration of mistrust by the Ambassador and then they could start to organise the elections that will be held at the end of March.
This would be the beginning of a period which is not appropriate for a decision in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans are thinking about strengthening anti-crisis mechanisms.
Christine Lagarde again stressed this yesterday in the press conference in Paris: "I think that Europeans have demonstrated it on Sundays throughout the day and night, are obviously very solidarityal determinations, commitment to defending their currency and their monetary zone."
Although everything is relative, last night's recorded expansion regarding the European State bond interest, it has brought water to the governments and the Central European Bank.
But we can't talk about the beginning of normalization yet.
The Authority for Standard & Poor's notes announced that it could downgrade the record of Portugal's debt, the goal to which various speculations are most focused.
"Because in May there is a real lack of transparency and clear policy, particularly on banking systems," says Economic Exane BNP Paribas.
The more that "political time runs slower than market time."
The knowledge of this disrupted relationship and the danger that it conceals intensifys the European countries' discussions aimed at strengthening existing crisis mechanisms.
Informal consultations between finance ministers, the most affected by the problem, and, to a wider extent with their G20 counterparts, are developing very well.
This will take account of Eurogroup (Eurogroup) and Ecofin meetings from the beginning of next week.
The meeting of the European Central Bank is taking place today.
The programme contains a decision on non-conventional measures to support the euro area countries with a market focus (see above).
With regard to the European Fund for Finance (FESF), its Executive Director, Klaus Regling, closed on Tuesday in Singapore's trip to Asia with a view to informing investors from the Far East about the development of the crisis in Europe.
If the purpose of this journey is not to raise funds, the donor prepares the land to achieve this goal.
The first issue of the EFSF securities is assumed to be next month.
Yesterday, the US official informed Reuters that the United States would support the possible increase in mobilised funds by additional direct engagement with the IMF.
The countries referred to in the first series, Portugal and Spain, are preparing to adopt structural reforms, in particular with regard to the organisation of the labour market.
Reforms that attach themselves to a strict measure with a rapid effect.
Lisbon and Madrid are different than they used Greece and Ireland.
Both countries want to avoid, at all costs, asking for international aid before applying for their own budgetary corrections and before deciding on structural reforms necessary to regain their confidence.
The capital participants in the European Funds are finally talking about options available to speed up the process of standardisation of markets with overcompensated bonds.
On his way to Paris on November 24th, Axel Weber came up with the idea that the EUR 750 billion mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund would not be enough to re-evaluate the stock of securities.
The economics of Barclays Capital, which is an actor of the very first plan of trade with European sovereign loans, considers that the addendum of about EUR 100 billion would be sufficient, "more" in the form of direct financial liquidity.
The average exists: it is the European Financial Stability Mechanism, which is EUR 60 billion to date.
The Council, which has every chance of being tested in European capitals.
Especially when market conditions worsened.
Snow and rain: 24 countries have orange gear.
The snowflakes are still causing transport difficulties, especially on the roads of the second class in Britain, and there is a risk that they will disrupt some economic activities.
Twenty-four periods have now an orange readiness due to the risk of snow and rain.
L'Eure, l'Eure-et-Loir, les Deux-Sèvres and la Vienne, joined the 20 periods that have already been declared orange emergency, 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, la Dordogne and la Gironde later in the night.
According to Météo France, significant snowfalls affect problems in the north of La Gironde and les Charentes and weak snow on Ile-de-France.
Snow cover from 2 to 5 cm, places from 7 to 10 cm, is expected in the periods concerned and covers from 1 to 3 cm, places up to 5 in the Paris region.
The periods Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, du Poitou and the periods of Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin are affected.
snowflakes are large enough to cause transport problems and disrupt some economic activity, says Météo France.
On the coast of Côtes d'Armor, some periods have prohibited the passage of heavy cargo vehicles - cargo cars over 7.5 tonnes with the Guingamp-Lanion route and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac.
Road traffic in the second class of traffic in Britain is very difficult, and the police recommend that you drive with your vehicle only if it is really necessary and the operation of some trucks has been cancelled for this day.
School connections were banned in Picardia on Thursday.
On Wednesday evening, no special measures are proposed to limit freight transport.
The focus office "calls all drivers of cars to the greatest attention on the roads and to adapt the vehicle character".
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) requested airlines to cancel on Thursday 25% of their flights at the Paris airport of Roissy and 10% at Orly for the expected snowfalls.
DGAC recommends that a passenger using air transport services connect with his company.
In the United Kingdom, Gatwick Airport in southern London and Edinburgh Airport in Scotland are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro Grand Paris: first financial proposals
Since the debate on modernising transport to Ile-de-France in full-flow, it has been worth billions.
At least during the discussion.
We recall in particular 23 billion of Grand Paris Metro, which is to be built by Société du Grand Paris.
In order to allow this building to be released, the State announced the grant of EUR 4 billion.
It is purely theoretically an amount that will then allow SGP to use for the contracts part of the financing from its double source.
We're finally getting to the first additives today.
The 2010 Financial rectification Act, which examines the National Assembly Financial Committee this morning, contains the mechanisms for securing these funds.
There are two: creating special tax from equipment and raising tax from office to Ile-de-France.
First, let's read in the text of the draft law, article 15, it's "for the benefit of the public institution Société du Grand Paris".
It is calculated as follows: "The yield of this interest is 117 million euros a year."
The second is the reconstruction of the rate for office, which already exists, "to be modernised to increase its profits and to increase the impact of Société du Grand Paris".
How much would it take?
Overload.
That's not counted in the text.
We've got up to 4 billion away.
"It is clear that these fiscal resources are connected to 4 billion euros of capital grants that will be mobilised by the State and put into Société du Grand Paris according to the project," we can read in explanation of the reasons.
In SGP we don't seem to be shocked by this system.
"From the moment we created revenue (both taxes, etc.), we can cover the study for three years and then dig up to 4 billion, it's explained here."
"It will be included in the budget and used as necessary."
The SGP considers that 4 billion will be allocated to the 2014 budget by 2013.
This mechanism, in which the promised 4 billion are still inaccessible subscribers, is at risk of calling for a somewhat moving parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will be held on 7 December.
Men's Hackers and Motivators
The WikiLeaks case has a double meaning.
On the one hand, there is a clear scandal, a scandal that seems to be a scandal just face-to-face in the face of confusion that governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it talks about profound changes at international level, and predicts the future of controlled regression.
But let's do it all right.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is to confirm the fact that every document composed of a secret service (any nation) consists exclusively of print scraps.
"Excellent revelation" Americans about the sexual life of Berlusconi are saying what they have been able to read in any newspaper for months (all other than those two Berlusconi own), and the non-blaze caricature profile of Kadáfi has long been the object of a skilful artist.
The rule, according to which secret documents may consist only of reports already known, is essential in the dynamics of secret services, not only in this century.
When you go to a bookstore dedicated to esoteric literature, you will see that each work repeats (about Graal, the mystery of Rennes-le-Château, the Temples or the Zednars) exactly what has already been written in the previous parts.
And this is not only because the author of the occult texts does not like to search for new information (or does not know where to look for news about the non-existent), but because those who devote themselves to occultism believe only what they already know and what it confirms what they have already learned.
This is Dan Brown's mechanism of success.
The same applies to secret documents.
The informant is linear and linear (or limited) chief of secret services (and if he is not, he could be, as I know, editor in the Libération newspaper), who considers only what he admits to be true.
Information with a high secret about Berluscon, which the U.S. embassy sent to the state resort, was the same as Newsweek published a week earlier.
Why, then, did the discovery of these documents become so common?
On the one hand, they say what every cultured person already knows, and even though the embassy, at least since the end of World War II and since the time when the heads of states can call or fly to a common dinner, have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of a few small exercises in the representation, turned into a espionage center.
Any viewer watching films on the investigation very well knows that it is only out of countless numbers that it seems to be ignored.
However, the fact that it is repeated in public, that it is a disgrace of the obligation to cover and that it sheds bad light on American diplomacy.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker can obtain the most accurately hidden information from the world's most powerful country is a hard strike, not a no-good, for the prestige of this state resort.
The scandal affects both victims and their "implementors".
But let's move from here to the deep truth about what happened.
Sometimes, in the days of Orwell, it was possible to perceive all power, like some Big Brother, who controlled every movement of his people.
Orvell's prophecy has been shown since the time when, thanks to the ability to control every movement through the telephone, every transaction performed, the hotel visited, the distance used, and so on, became a citizen of a mere victim of power.
But when we demonstrate how it is now that even the "grapes" with the most classified information of the powerful cannot resist the intervention of a hacker, the control report stops being one-way and becomes a circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least hacker - elected as a citizen's debtor - can know all the secrets of power.
How can one maintain power that no longer has the ability to keep his own secret?
It is true that Georg Simmel has already said that real secrets are infinite secrets (and infinite secrets will never be revealed); it is also true that all information about the character of Berlusconio or Merkel is really a secret infinite, because it is extracted from public life; but to discover, as WikiLeaks did, that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were infinite secrets, means to take away all power.
WikiLeaks made no mistake at Sarkozy or Merkel, but he did something to great Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this wounded power so important?
It is clear that in the future, the States will not be able to send online sensitive information - that would be equal to its publication on the poster on the corner of the street.
But it is also quite obvious that with current technologies, there is an overwhelming hope that you can keep the message on the phone hidden.
It's nothing easier than to find out if and when the head of the state traveled by plane and connected with some of his colleagues.
How can they be kept in the future in private and sensitive news?
I know well that for this moment, my forecast is science fiction, and it's fantastic, but I have to imagine the government's agents who are moving in a discreet manner to formalise on uncontrollable routes and carry only those messages they know of memory or they're rather hiding rare information in the boot.
The information will be kept in unique copies in key-closed cartridges: overall take, the attempt to spy on the watergate had less success than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology is now moving forward, that means back.
One century after the wireless telegraph marked a revolution in communications, the Internet rehabilitated a telegraph based on wires (telephones).
Video tapes (analogues) enabled movie lovers to film a step by step, slide it in front and take it and reveal all the secrets of the installation, while now CD (digits) allow only to jump by the capitals, that means by the macropores.
We will come from Rome to Milan in three hours, while on a flight and transport, which includes three and a half hours.
It is not exceptional, then, that politics and communication techniques will return to cars with horses.
Last note.
Jindy tried to understand what was going on in the mystery of the embassy.
Now it's the embassy that's asking for reliable press information.
Climate: How France hacked its funding promises
The year after the Copenhagen Agreement, it is time to test compliance with the pledges for rapidly delocked financing (as referred to as fast start-up or early start-up) implemented by developed countries.
And the great French hacks were discovered
In the Codhan Agreement, the developed countries committed to providing $30 billion in 2010-2012.
The European Union pledged €7.2 billion for three years and €1.26 billion for France (i.e. €420 million a year).
At the start of COP16, the EU drew up a big echo to convince its partners about the reality of its commitment to fast start funding: a report clarifying the actions of its Member States, the press conference, the grand side event, the distribution of brochures...
The transparent operation is invaluable and valued at its true value: the developed countries and civil society would like all the developed countries and civil society to do the same with the same degree of accuracy.
The EU notes that in 2010 it released €2.2 billion, leading it on the right path to comply with its promise of €7.2 billion in 2012.
But if we focus on detail, we'll find things are much more complicated.
These funds are "new and additional" under the Codanese Agreement to ensure that the increased burden is implemented without prejudice to State aid for development.
Unfortunately, there is no agreement in what it means "new and additional".
While the European Commission has proposed harmonisation, some Member States, between others and France, have blocked the process.
Everyone today picks the reference that suits him best.
For example, the European Commission considered 2009 as a reference: international financing has been maintained and added 150 million to it for three years the title of fixed start funding.
Other countries have chosen similar references to annual payment terms or to public development aid terms.
On the contrary, France believes that funding for "all new projects" in 2010 is "new and additional".
In other words, there is no reference to the expenditure of the previous period or to the global level Public aid for the development of d'Aide public au development.
In particular, the overall amount of France's support to developing countries can remain unchanged (or even be reduced), should comply with its commitment to funding "new and additional"...
Another determining factor is the distribution of gifts and loans.
There isn't a rule yet, and everyone picks their own way of calculating.
Some, like France, consider that 1€ borrowed is equal to 1€ donated.
Obviously it's hard to prove: effort is not even.
If the use of loans can be provided for some investments that are profitable (often related to projects associated with emission reductions in more efficient technologies), it is foolish to present one euro that we receive, as equivalent to one euro we give... , we should not understand it from the title of our commitments, but as the price of the loan for the creditor country (i.e. the equivalent of interest rates).
But France can only give the following reasons: "remains" its commitment of EUR 420 million, which makes 91.5% of the loan (EUR 389.8 million) and 8.5% of the donations (EUR 36.1 million) - see the EU document so that you can verify it yourself.
It is the only country in the Union that is using a loan to such an extent.
Germany has requested 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (among others) comply with their commitments with 100% of their donations.
In other words, when a single majority of the European Union gives 1€ within the framework of its commitment, France only gives 10 cents and considers this effort to be comparable.
A beautiful cupcake!
For a summary, France operates with two households, on the one hand, with the development of shares in time and on the other, with a real financial burden.
Although it only spends 36.1 million euros, it can convince it to spend 420 million euros "new and additional" in relation to its promises.
The Manipulation of the Minister of Finance (because it seems that while it is Bercy who made such a decision) could have a double negative impact, at the same time inside the EU (why would the Member States continue to make donations when only to borrow?) and when negotiating, because the developing countries are not completely naive...
The chapter of pre-financing is only a small issue, relatively short-term, in relation to a series of climate discussions.
But it could also be a grain of sand in a huge machine, such as the UNFCCC.
Let's hope it's not our case.
Whatever the case, it is necessary to draw on the knowledge of this first year of early financing.
First, France should notify the change in its way of managing the accounts for the years 2011 and 2012, in the spirit of compliance with its commitments and of compliance and of fairness with the other countries of the European Union.
But above all, France should prevent the debate on long-term financing deposits (other key chapters currently discussed): we will not be asking "additionality" or how to book loans.
France should change its position to become as progressive in these investments as in others.
Thus, the hopes of all are being put into the new Ministry of the Environment, Mrs Koscisko-Morizet, who will be in Cancún next week.
A surprising announcement about France's fast start and its vision of "additionality" and the use of the loan could lead to an increase in international trust, necessary for further discussion.
An alarm concerning pesticides that children are watching.
Ten-year-old child after one day of 81 different chemicals, according to one study published this Wednesday, from the Association of Future Generations (ex-Education for the Rights and Conservation of Future Generations).
The association, which notes that its results "have no significant statistical value in view of the low number of samples analysed, but are characteristic of the processed problem", bought between July and September food commonly consumed in four foods and one light food as a light candle for one child nearly decades in supermarkets in L'Oise and Paris.
These typical foods, including official recommendations - five pieces of fresh fruit and vegetables, three milk products and 1.5 litres of water per day - as well as sugar, were analysed by research laboratories on chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The balance of the plate is striking: 81 chemical substances, 42 of which are listed among the carcinogenic substances, possible or likely, and five are among the clear carcinogenic substances, as well as 37 substances that could act as musculoskeletal glands with internal mixing (PE), according to a study by several institutions, such as the International Cancer Research Centre.
"Although in almost all cases the legal limits for each chemical accepted are not exceeded individually, in our research we see that the reality in consumer exposure to contaminants, possibly carcinogenic, and/or PE is impressive," the association said.
For breakfast butter and tea with milk, there are about ten residues alone with possible carcinogenic effects and three proven as certain carcinogens, as well as about 20 residues that could disrupt the hormonal system.
Apple, imported from Brazil, studied as a small pig, contains traces of six chemicals, including the banned fungicide in France.
The same applies to green beans from Kenya, which are included in the lunch with which studies have found the rates of strong insecticides prohibited in the EU.
In addition, the milky meat bifts, the tuna in the refrigerator and even the ham and gum were sprayed with pesticides and other chemicals.
In water from the shell of the analysis, the presence of nitrogen and chloroform was detected.
Steak from salmon to dinner was "the richest" with 34 found chemical residues and even an analysis of the plastic plate used to heat the food in the microwave oven was not excluded.
The ultimate risk to consumers of this "cocathel of contaminants" is likely to be underestimated", says the study.
Ecological Europe-Greens (EE-LV) has proposed "to face the urgent situation" to establish a moratorium on the use of pesticides to stop "the growth of civilisation diseases".
In July, the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) study examined the status of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, of which 76 were in cereals.
