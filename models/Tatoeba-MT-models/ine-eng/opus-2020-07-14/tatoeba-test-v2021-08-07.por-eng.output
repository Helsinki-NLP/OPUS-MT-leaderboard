Whites: tower in a1, pea in b6, king in c8. Blacks: pea in a7 and b7 king in a8, bishop in b8. Whites put the opponent in zugzwang playing tower in a6, after which the blacks will only have two options: take the tower in a6 or play their bishop for any other house of the diagonal b8-h2. In the first case, the whites move their pea from b6 to b7 and kill. In the second situation, the white tower takes the black pea near a7, with the same result.
