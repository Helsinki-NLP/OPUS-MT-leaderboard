It seems to me to be a typical rugby club.
In an English university, maybe...
Nothing to see with the Rugby clubs I knew in NZ.
But that doesn't justify anything, does it?
Of course not, but the premier who says it's running in the rugby is the big thing...
Yes, we do not interrupt the prayers of Muslims and we do not break the nose of anyone during the drinking games (in the end, except if it is part of the game), but we have actually painted black for some dejected evenings.
I've never played a drinking game based on the Nazi theme.
Yeaha and Ride the Bus enough.
I left a similar comment on the previous article because the language and feeling expressed in the perspective of the first year's students seemed quite typical.
That says, this new information leaves no doubt in my eyes that they go far beyond myogynous pleasures and jokes under the alcohol that is often associated with university rupby teams.
The incident with Muslim students shows particularly well that they are trying to get the most out of it.
You probably don't know anything about Rugby clubs.
But let's go, why let your injuries and stereotypes prevent the facts?
I imagine that the LSE Rugby team is popular with former students from these schools for which the Rugby competition is a tradition.
In other words, old boys in private.
The results of very different environments than those that play rupby in NZ, very different attitudes.
So are the "misogynous pleasures" acceptable?
I've never seen racist behavior in my university, but the naked races through campus, flight, property damage, and misogynism were all part of the game.
Absolutely not.
I'm sorry I didn't mention it in my last comment.
You can see it differently: say that your own body is partly composed of this ancestral water.
I'm going to win the selenium.
therefore also the interstellar cloud (or, not traditional:))
@lux You did not read the article: a small half of your dish water is over 4.6 billion years old...
Yes, well we can at once consider that the fleet of meals has on average easily more than 2.3 billion years, which is not already so bad.
A sacred foot of nose to the catastrophyists and reheaters of any hair that predicts the end of the oceans and water resources, while this water always exists.
An irrefutable evidence that heating stopped 20 years ago (see the remarkable work of Serge Ferry funded by Total and Areva).
@manon too: What is evidence that heating stopped?
I don't see the link.
I think Manon Troppo's comment is ironic.
Hey, and for the second degree and irony, what do you have as a signal?
So you don't understand much about environmental issues.
It is not a question for the "catastropists" as you say to worry about the disappearance of oceans, but rather about the reduction of human-use water reserves (you know the soft water that represents less than 1% of the total water reserves on our planet).
And then more generally it's not the climate heating that's most threatening for our species, but especially the reduction of scarce or non-renewable resources (gas, oil, rare metals) that support our increasingly gourmet lifestyles.
As for the study you quote and which you make the effort to quote the source, there is no doubt that the truth of the conclusion is true.
With regard to the soft water problems, I assure you the French are far from being concerned xD Then you have to stop viewing ecology as an unbreakable dogma, the ozone layer hole is talking quietly (estimation 100% for 2050 at the current rate).
The ecology is, the ecology is religiously dogmatic and unreasonable, not thank you.
"Then we must stop viewing ecology as a non-violent dogma, the hole in the ozone layer is being referred to quietly" Yes, it is not as if it was a spontaneous movement that would come from nothing.
@martin: I just want to specify that climate heating is a necessity because if we emit too much CO2 our land will look like Venus.
A zero that, by the action of oxygen, captures the heat without releasing it and which in a vicious circle will accelerate the process of closing exponentially.
Has anyone seen direct actions so far?
Or the least sign indicating that 10,000 bonhommes would come to the field to plant trees and do what a green army is supposed to do, what could that be?
I'm not!
In the small brain of Abbott, perhaps sending RAAF to the Middle East is its version of a direct action.
We're moving on, that's for sure.
When are they gonna get rid of this idiot from the village?
The latest revelations that vegetation would consume 16% of CO2 more than any climate model gives priority to replanting.
It's logical no, because CO2 is the food of plants that is the most abundant in nature, and it's necessary to preserve the flower all over the world.
It seems that this scientific fact has never been made available.
Have you seen the army anywhere?
Don't do anything, dear government.
CO2 levels increase from 280 ppm to 400 ppm and the rate is rising, your argument of plant nutrition is only a fallacious distraction.
And before you throw your glass against the Dooms wall, the most abundant ink is not CO2 but nitrogen and sulphur.
The most abundant of the biologically generated materials is perhaps carbon, but this does not mean that it is the most abundant thanks, so the Silverhead argument is falsifying and deserves to be ridiculous.
Direct Action is a farce, because nothing can happen again.
LandCare's budget has been severely reduced and this money is now spent by the Green Army.
The problem is that instead of investing the money where it was the most profitable, it is now investing where it will receive the most publicity to make the liberals available to the marginal electors.
Your contribution, on the other hand, deserves the price of ignorance, good champion.
SilverHead, when there is too much CO2 in the air, plants produce less photosynthesis and contain less nutrients.
This means that animals and people need to eat them in a much larger amount to benefit from their nutritional benefits.
Let this fellow be powerful is obvious.
Until now, he has not presented a certificate of academic rigidity that prevents him from breaking the rules of XVII.
However, punishing him and not Thevenoud, it is incomprehensible for no harm in the world, even though the regulation of the AN is not a tax treaty.
That this woman's doing a whole thing isn't to her honor, it looks mostly like the hysteria.
If Mitterrand had put in the amendment all those who spoke Mitran...
I remember that during the debate on the feminization of names, the "Academie" had been offended: "Let's tell Mrs. the Guardian or the Guardian of the Sceans" (a post that had never been occupied by a woman so far).
All right, all right, all right.
"The political arena" ...!
The sandbag, the back-of-the-back of the Republic fills, the marigot of the operatte guillotes, the table of the illusions, and ...
But the arena assumes gladiators, people who take real risks, good will, bad will.
Qd the Phallocrate Umpist sits on the label and parliamentary regulation by turning to the + elemental civility under the false paraplegia of the good ways, the penalty applies to him "the quality" for his partisan will and his mesmerization of the political arena.
The behaviour of this Member is neither normal nor worthy of his position.
He's making a provocation to talk about him.
Until now he was unknown, now he may be proud to be known as any cancer of a primary class.
The Academy at the back and it's seen that the MPs are sensitive to the pocket...
The UMP will have to try to solve its internal problems and stop causing the shocks and scandals.
The Academy has a good back, especially when you tell her what she doesn't say.
This member behaves as a college in the adolescent crisis, which causes provocation and which partners are going, in delegation, to see the principal to cancel the hours of the strike.
and the defendant on the basis of a text they have not even read!
Women do not even represent 15% of the signatories of this forum of MPP MPs.
Mr. Judge, I call on two expert witnesses to separate a few thousand years.
That's why I like to spend time with animals.
The joy they feel when they play is so obvious and attractive.
Dogs, dauphins, otars, horses, they do all the stupid things for the simple pleasure that it brings them.
On the contrary, it would seem that we spend the majority of our 80 years working, moving and making stores.
What a strange phase we have reached - we are able to multiply by two our lifetime, but we spend most of it in the dark.
How did we get there?
Thanks to the illusion that it is anthropomorphism.
The game is a metacommunication.
Try again.
It's always an illusion.
In addition, the "communication" necessarily involves a shared symbol system.
A difficult concept for you, perhaps?
I imagine that the concept of inter-species communication is not compatible with your beliefs.
That's right.
I can see when a dog wants to play and I can communicate to the dog that I would like to play – basic body language.
After that, there is a variation that indicates whether the game will be a race, an object to go search, etc.
It is not difficult and there is no anthropomorphism – although I agree with the idea that we hear a lot of connotations about animals that are "playing" while they are simply communicating.
Perhaps the game is not only "useful" (it may or may not be), it is just something that exists.
For example, David Graeber is of the opinion that "there is a principle of play based on any physical reality".
"If he had learned at school that a woman is not an object, he might not have raped him" Perhaps, the hope made him live...
Thank you for the hope of giving you the opportunity to live, to be in good health and to be able to respond to an article today when you had to drink the information without being able to respond to it at least 15 years ago.
In general, I am not against ideas, and I would even tend to be quite excited by those who appear to be premier fools first.
But when you see what many have learned from their school education, especially among the most likely audiences to commit aggression against women, my enthusiasm does not find the least start of the attack.
"the public's most likely to commit to attacks on women" We'd like to know a little more.
Or, no, it's good, we got it.
And yes, reality doesn't always feel pink, even though it doesn't necessarily match your thinking schedules.
It is true that Neuilly's golden youth and other beautiful neighborhoods don't listen much in class.
She prefers to play on her iphone6.
Evry's demented youth too!
If the lines were no longer responsive, Twitter would no longer propose to follow Le Pen and Sarko in first choice.
I didn't learn anything from all this at school and I never raped anyone (and that's not in my mind).
Do I have to be lucky?
Unless I had parents to teach me some values...
Family micro-society is the learning of social life.
How to start reading life when you don't know how to read?
And are the young socialists going to the dance schools to teach male-female equality?
It would be more effective than making moralist mountings on Twitter, but you should get out of beautiful neighborhoods...
You're making this campaign big.
They're zero everywhere but to teach moral lessons, that's the best.
Everything has photogenic air, but yet I want to see the bread in a hat.
There's a joke about using his bread.
This week's article doesn't go wrong.
It's not time to make jokes about bread, man!
A little sensitivity!
You have made a double-meaning word game with the word "naan" to refer to a grandmother.
60 books for that?
It wouldn't even fill the stomach of a 90-year-old in a retirement home.
How is it that we pay more, that there's less in the seat?
Because the quality of the experience does not necessarily measure the weight or number of calories, as well as the quality of a film or a piece is not determined by its length.
Yes, I agree with you.
But why should good food be served in portions that would not even satisfy a mill?
It doesn't make any sense, and it's just a deliberate policy to make you buy more dishes.
Of course, he doesn't have to be like that.
The Sportsman in Seasalter is at least a very good restaurant where the portions and prices are both reasonably high.
You pay more because you're still hungry after several mini dishes.
The more you pay the price, the more you have the chance to receive a child portion with art in your seat.
At least they've made an effort to put on noodles.
So when I want to go to a decent restaurant in York, you're telling me I should go to a restaurant in London...
Maybe you should try one of the many other (excellent) restaurants in York before deciding that London is the only place on Earth where you can taste good dishes?
Is that the Manif for all is only a Catholic and Muslim movement.
Yes, that's a sort of homophobic collection.
But it's not just that.
There are also atheists and humanists who do not want modern systems of "the manufacture of children".
A child must not be raised in a battery lift or manufactured by a technological device.
Batterylifting?
You're out of it.
And if you respond to any technical intervention in the "fabrication", you need to demand the ban on the PMA for heterosexual couples, it would deserve coherence.
I am also surprised that the alleged "for all" manif did not yet have this logical claim to his attractive catalogue.
It is true that this is not the only cathos that manifests: the other religions, Jews, Muslims, Protestants.
However, it is still useful to remember that these different churches were opposed to all developments in society: in 1865 (and I join G.
Kauffmann) a bishop, Mr. Dupanloup was violently opposed to the gvt's willingness to admit girls to school in the name of "the defense of the family".
We're still in the same schedule.
And, more recently, the same currents came to the collapse of civilization and the destruction of the family when the school became mixed.
That is the credit that can be given to the positions of these people.
There's no need to be catho indigesting with the marketing of the breasts and children...
All of this is in the right line of the decadence of Western civilization, increasingly challenged by others!
For me, freedom stops from the other: yes, to the recognition of homosexual couples who have the right to love each other.
But it's not a question of tolerating that the child is a furniture object.
And this is also valid for heteros in search of GPA.
I just can't love this guy or recognize his results.
If he had better control of the balloon and knew to avoid moments of stupidity, he could have been a more popular player.
In addition, I am sure that any other attacker, besides Heskey, who plays so many matches for England, will accumulate a respectable number of goals.
Imagine how many goals Peter Crouch would have noticed if he had been given more than 42 selections in the national team...
I cannot disagree, at least not categorically:) Since this article speaks of the goals he has marked, I will not talk about other things he brings, especially in ManUtd (where RvP, Mata, Kagawa neither brought nor did anything), but perhaps it would be another reason why he has been selected much more often than, say, Peter Crouch.
Bothham77 hoddle1 07 October 2014 12h48 Recommended 119 This is the way to criticise Rooney at this time so you can be forgiven to do so too.
This says it is good to take into account that since signing with Manchester City in August 2011, Aguero has marked 56 goals and made 23 final steps in 93 matches.
At the same time, Wayne Rooney scored 59 goals and made 32 final moves in 96 matches.
So a lot of people will have to find another excuse to take it to our Wazza because its state on the ground is excellent.
Furthermore, "Wazza" is a good reason to ridicule him.
I have to ask myself whether you really look at the foot or if you think that Peter Crouch A) would deserve so much of a selection as Rowey and B) would mark so much of a goal if he had so many selections.
I really don't understand where the critics come from as a football player about the capabilities of Rooney.
The hardest thing is to be selected regularly in his country team for 13 years, and to continue...
Are you seriously comparing Wayne Rooney's football qualities (even not attacking) to Peter Crouch's?
Do you do this without bluffing?
There really are people all over the crowd.
Please also note for your government that Rooney has not always been the pre-centre machine for the purposes of England during his career as a team in England.
Instead, he played the previously withdrawn role of Beardsley/Sheringham.
He played behind players such as Michael Owen, Mr. Crouch that we mentioned above, Jermain Defoe, and more recently Daniel Sturridge.
You had to write this by lying.
In a country where the port of arms is tolerated and in a state where 71% of the people have a weapon, I find it completely schizophrenic and paradoxical as a way to do it.
And well, those in this school just don't agree with the U.S. Army Port Authority!
the use of the skull is always suicide.
Stop at the connery: the girl is 5 years old.
How many guys play with actual guns at this age in our home?
Is that actually the killers in power for so long?
Even though the port of arms is in the American constitution and this has a strong influence on the country's culture, I do not believe that the rich game is significantly different from ours.
A bit of good sense and reason stored, etc.
It's a disarming process!
Give it to you, you're clear!
Information on this fact is insufficient to assess whether this little girl actually has, or does not have, any assumptions about the taste of the morbidity.
Could we leave the principle that a serial killer can't already have a weird behavior at the age of 5?
If people need a psy follow-up, it's more mabula in this school than students!
Let the parents get their boyfriend out of here: she's in danger!
I fully agree.
Those who manage this school are obviously completely ill.
Your response is much more relevant.
Alabama is not the most representative state in the United States, but it is part of it.
What an incomprehensible country!
His relative youth?
These dazzling blouses that men wear have nothing to do with an entrepreneur!
What was Alan Sugar or Richard Branson carrying at the start of their career?
In their first photos, Lord Sugar wore a long leather coat and Sir Richard Branson wore a roll-cold bullet.
I can't comment too much because I've never looked at this, but everything seemed so boring and without a soul.
I don't think that's what he meant.
Contrarier, maybe?
But what a depressing air that's!
You're ahead of me.
I'd have thought a little bit of English knowledge would be an asset to business.
I wonder what Mr Bjayou is doing these days.
Maybe by saying "strange," he meant "foreigner".
That would make sense.
No, I thought that's what he might have wanted to say, but it still doesn't make sense.
Unfortunately, if all the candidates were dressed like Carmen Miranda and that Sugar was wearing a grey suit, it could be advanced that their intention was to draw it.
But here, no.
It seems that this has been corrected – strange. Perhaps the whole sentence has been invented!
It's not weird.
Well, who knows what he could say?
I'm sure nothing, but someone was just trying to quote something...
So, yes, the word used in the article was well "astrace", which meant absolutely nothing.
The unemployment rate in the United States has still fallen by about 6%.
Ever since 2001.
The prices of the essence fall in all states.
The American economy, with Obama, is constantly strengthened.
Who says better?
You have a very short view...
Does their economy become "sustainable"?
To live in this moment, I would say that the United States is getting a little closer to the explosion as inequality becomes crazy.
The political system is literally affected by the state of funding for electoral campaigns.
Racial tensions, police violence, mass incarceration have an extent that is not imagined in Europe, but Americans keep an incredible optimism in the future of their country and theirs!
Until when?
That's the main question.
A few days ago, English financial environments said France was lost.
Now, it's America that's at the end of his roll.
Fortunately, there will always be the UK to save the world.
Another one of these articles that simply forgets the essential.
The level of consumption of the American economy is no longer sustainable...
Tickets and tickets will not be able to give the change for a long time...
On the basis of land resources and the growing needs of the rest of the planet.
And necessarily the weakest and poor, a very large majority of the citizens, will "drink" or die.
I can't bluff this Farrage.
Will the Labour Party finally understand that its cynic and deliberate policy of importing foreign-component voters makes it lose even more of its support?
I probably don't think so.
Multiculturalism and diversity must continue to advance at any price.
LOL It was to please our American masters and their constant cold war with Russia.
Shame performance of the Labour, Ed Milliband is in the mouse, this is played by 617 votes.
About Clacton 11% for the Labour – shocking, really shocking.
Everyone is more or less aware that the massive immigration policy of the Blair government was designed "to push the right nose into diversity"
Labour wins the partial election, the Tories lose the partial election in a safe seat against ukip = Crisis Labour Have you talked about your fight against reality with a therapist?
I imagine that it is the same Multiculturalism that has led to this return of maneuvers, the pendulum has spread very far since the end of the war, and I imagine that now it will go the other way.
Have you talked about your fight against reality with a therapist?
Lol - Secure Labour Headquarters, a difference of 617 votes.
It's depressing, Jack, you know, I know, anyone who doesn't know that.
Of course, the Tories have seen much worse, but for the Labour it is a victory in the Pyrrhus.
Look for the word "victoire" in any context, and you will see that when it is used argumentatively against the word "future", it wins the battle!
I agree, Jack, it's a win, but she's gone.
The Labour Party should have won at least a few thousand votes.
If they record performance like that in a safe seat, can you honestly imagine them winning the majority?
Personally, I don't care how much I earn in 2015 as long as Lib Dems are not there.
Of course you don't understand how our parliamentary democracy works, do you?
Yes, I know the ice creams in Canada, Greenland and northern Russia are very hard.
On the other hand, I wonder if the alignment of Venus and March etc. should not be considered as well?
In general, we need to see the Earth more “paste” or malicious than we can imagine.
Is that right?
A few little perplexities.
On the other hand, Wylie tells us of a "a fairly simple mechanism: with the disappearance of the ice that weighs on the ground crust, the pressure on the blanket relaxes, which gives/donates a) a hole in the production of magma b) while facilitating its access to the surface????
In any case, either the "cut-off" or the ease of access to the area (more or less) located.
It is difficult to distinguish the cause of the effect and vice versa As regards climate heating, I find it prudent to focus rather on its effects on our environment, which is already quite complex.
Very friendly, patriced, does this volcanicism have any effect on our environment?
Does it have any effect on our climate heating, future or past?
Is Prudence not to heat up anymore?
When complexity is not resolved by simplification, let us apply this simplicity and observe.
Yeah, but also, when he's at night, we see less good.
Today, the end of the last ice season was also accompanied by a stronger seismic activity, particularly in the "active" mountain ranges where on the heavily-glazed continental parts of Canada, Scandinavia).
Cordial CB
It is too often ignored that the earth’s crust floats on the magma and that the only passage of the moon makes it rise or descends from about 30 to 60 cm, otherwise, following its passage to the zenith, as it does for ocean waters.
This allows the smoothing of tectonic plates, as well as the seams, to be more or less facilitated by this moving box, as polar rocks are allied by the source of the ice, thus causing a change in the balance of the earth to the equator, as the volume of the earth remains constant.
I am fond of this "human" being the Supreme of Nature and its self-proclaimed commander, to be ridiculed for his stupid action on the environment that created it and which has become so separated that it has become harmful, and to himself and to that environment.
And all of this to remain the supreme commander of this nature who exceeds him in the organization of his own viscera, by an invention that is to find all the means possible to dominate his neighbor, each other, laughing at the collaboration, the money.
The earth’s crust is not based on magma, but on the earth’s mantle, which is made up of solid rock.
Personally I find it impossible to look at.
Pretentious and arrogant.
That reminds me of Ascent of Man de Bronowski.
Live the next part.
Beautiful History Wild1
This reminds me of a completely cool 2002 series called "Ape-man".
One of the best documentary series I've ever seen.
Strangely, almost no one remembers it now.
It's a shame you've never passed the first impression.
Your loss...
"The Ice Ages, our distant ancestors" You should look again at this passage.
Or read about evolution.
Super program thank you Brian
I am almost sure that the documentary "History of Humanity" has already been realized several times, they always go to Ethiopia (of course)
Oh there I don't support this guy, Brian "air miles" Cox, who goes to Ethiopia to pretend to have eyebrows in front of a brain in a mouth.
And his story...
It must be hard for you, forced to look at Coxy.
Maybe there's a support group for you, that's what I'm saying.
I agree, everything is presented in a way that I can understand.
I loved the program, wonderfully filmed.
Is Marcel Gauchet a Marxist compass?
Actually, it's the individualist identity that predicts today.
So she needs to be herself, so she doesn't.
Yes, but Descartes is also present at the time of the event of individualism, and his intellectual question expresses this insight.
But at that time it is just the assumptions that appear, today individualism structures the whole society, educated or not, cultivated or not, rich or poor...
We are well in the individualism of "mass" !!
Without making an inexhaustible horizon, there is nothing related to the Cartesian approach to examining what we receive to believe, what we believe in ourselves.
More than rebellion, the doubt is fecund.
Facing Foucault a revolutionary is absurd.
Many xxx-liberaries refer to it and claim it.
His work on psychiatry has produced a counter-reform!
In the face of the problem at the level of his paranoid number, he blocked all progress and thought about the reality of madness.
And brought the most reducing and reactionary vision that follows: behaviorism.
Gauchet is absolutely right about this and being anti-conformist, it is to fight this development.
We blame Marcel Gauchet for being a defender of the order.
Excellent idea!
You're beautiful and rebellious, we ask some...
Black and red, to the others.
Beaufs and robots, they include the most followers of those who see themselves rebellious in their mirror.
Thank you, in any case, for his controversial controversy about putting Marcel Gauchet under the light of the present day, this humanist patient and persistent, and so educationally illustrating.
David Cameron supports the increase of the tax threshold on inheritance
How many other budget cuts will be needed to pay the social benefits of this rich person?
Dave the robot will greatly increase its net value once it is no longer in power.
Business advice, speeches, consultation costs, a series of best sellers written by a nigger on the "serious policy" – it will be worth £100 once he has passed the gun to the left.
Of course, he doesn't want taxes on inheritance.
Wouldn't it be the same lie as the last election?
And the richest are those who will pay very much less taxes on inheritance due to super-paid accountants and tax-exempt programs.
This has all the signs of an empire in decline where the heritage kills innovation.
he will be worth £100 once he has passed the gun to the left.
Anything.
He'll probably promise to increase the threshold to £1 million, which is well below what you say is worth.
What was your position when the Labor doubled the threshold to 650,000 for couples?
Do you think Brown thought only of his own heirs, or are you just a brainless Tribalist?
We haven't picked it the last time, we've had a coalition in place.
You could not afford to accuse him of lying unless we had actually elected him to power.
Like the rest of us, "Dave" won't die "normally".
Climate change and collapse will bring it to an end, he and the others of his end.
His “richness ” will be as useless as that of others and will not save him or his children.
Untaxable income is a social advantage, especially in a country where government debt exceeded £1,000,000.
We all have to be forced to pay the essential services and repay the debt.
I agree with you Exdionys.
I do not say that discipline is unnecessary, of course, I only say that it is insufficient to compensate for certain natural "insufficiencys".
Little rational statement for the math pro that she was!
Like what...
Better recruiting and training teachers is a qualitative approach.
However, the French political class knows no other approach than quantitative.
There are 2 possible answers, the 1st would be to select teachers according to their ability to transmit knowledge => reform recruitment modalities.
From +, she hates children because she doesn't understand them.
Not including them, she does not know how to act or react to work well => she is reduced by establishing a trust relationship that causes everyone to suffer from a loss => it would take 1 training to teach skills.
A professional who learns, of course.
But teaching is primarily an art, a natural arrangement and a vocation before it is a technique.
Working on and with human beings is not to manufacture car parts.
Education doesn't put it into equation even when we're pro of math!
"Education sciences" cannot compensate for a lack of natural skills.
What is currently lacking, exactly, is a real vocation for those who embrace the professors.
If there are gifts, teaching (I prefer discipline) allows those who have less willingness to make no mistakes.
There are ways to address a more effective question.
The real unknown today are the students whose 1/3 tell us: learning does not serve anything I already know what I think.
A Slate article well describes the chaotic situation of this return.
We regret the old Normal Schools of Institutes..
It ends at 3 o'clock in the morning from this week, but it starts at midnight.
If this is the case, it is appropriate to use the time.
Oh, I didn't know that, thank you.
It doesn't fit in with mine!
It's been years since his release began at midnight.
We have this thing that is called iplayer and that allows us to listen to emissions on demand when we want it!
The Internet, it's amazing, isn't it?
I don't have iPlayer on my phone and with a maximum download speed of 4 MB at my home, I can't really listen to radio broadcasts anymore.
I have a usb type adapter at the back of my SKY box and which is connected to the Internet but listening to the radio on my TV made it very complicated.
Yeah, I think I've been fooling myself in the schedules, I had to hear Richard Lester at about 3 hours.
Although it's men in the day on Radio 2, they could at least put a woman in her ante schedule when one of the men is on vacation or sick, at least that would make people happy.
They should start by getting rid of Jeremy Vine.
Its issue is any sensational debate, and it would be much better on a chain like LBC.
The lack of DJ women in the day, where none of the regular animators, from Chris Evans in the morning to Simon May's show the night back at work, is not a woman
It's five shows.
So which (of these five) is most likely to be modified.
Shenan knows very well, but doesn't say anything - for now.
Steve Wright is the most semi-discovered this time.
Jeremy Vine may be sent to the offices as a real journalist, but breakfast keeps all the glacier air from a Daily Mail radio.
I imagine it's quiet, waiting for the current team to take it or turn it around.
I was born in Soissons in 1950!
Too late?
It is normal for these people to vote for the UN.
For 40 years we have had the same two parties that alter power and make the keys of the country to the other in less good condition that they have not taken it.
The campaigns are very poor, much poorer than the bananas with increasing isolation.
It takes a few miles to find a movie, a bar, a gym, a theater.
But since they don't burn cars, they don't attack, they don't sell, they don't interest political men...
But don't talk about a department where you haven't lived.
Yes,Doctoral, these are under men, sociology is very good to think about them.
They have a very high rate of abstentism and early alcoholism as well...
The UN thrives on human cattle, inculcation and ignorance, so far as it still has an enormous potential for growth, it really needs to be bad for it not to have done better...
Today, the UN thrives mainly on poverty, the fear of the daily, the fear of the other and the feeling of having no prospect.
But yes, you're right!
What a pitiful human.
Fortunately, there are a handful of people like you, intelligent, cultivated and estranged to save the honor.
They've been looking for him.
Take the voters for c...
That's what happens.
Is that who they are?
"forgetting" there's actually less in less resources =>low resources.
Here's the comment I left on Twitter (@priya963) Listen you can't just "add and mix", women must be integrated into the development process.
What I want to say here is that in many developing countries, existing standards are being laid down, such as childcare and socio-reproductive roles.
This means recognizing that women can work in the economic sphere and that it is super - it is necessary.
But it is not possible without recognizing the fact that women will then have a double blow, i.e. they will be expected to go to work while continuing to play their socio-reproductive role.
I'm not convinced my sister.
Economics and profits do not recognize the roles of women.
Money speaks, and if a sex isn't high, then next!
The profits are laughing at the life you have.
What do you do, what is the advantage and what do you have to offer?
The benefits are ridiculed by the heroism and education of children.
If it was a crime, companies would listen.
Employers' friends will never employ women 20 to 45 years of age.
Well said, my sister.
It is very problematic that no one is talking about social work that is not paid in this article.
In some countries, the value of unpaid social work (most of which is carried out by women) must be more than 50 per cent of GDP.
Unpaid social work does not receive enough support and is undervalued (not to mention that men do not do enough), but it allows our companies to function and preserve our work.
Unpaid social work is also an important reason why many women are unable to find a real "economic emancipation" outside the home...
Thank you for all your comments - to return to the point of Mskayadee, how can we take into account the disproportionate responsibilities of women when carrying out gender integration projects?
A very practical article.
I'm sure it'll help a lot of people who need to "carry a house".
The tiger is not Russian, it's only from Western propaganda.
The Chinese are the only ones responsible for the current situation and would be better able to sit at the negotiating table.
The right-to-self-determination tiger and Russian soldiers are simply operating near the border, long-term exercises planned before the current situation.
In addition, the tiger has no anti-aircraft missiles in its possession.
Free the Tigris!
You make my day!
Oh, yeah, you do.
I immediately felt the same kind of idea.
Here's a pretext all found to arm a few separatists to attach China.
If Siberia's tiger is in China, then China is in Siberia.
It's just time to fix this anomaly.
Why does an article on a tiger, beautiful feline and in danger of extinction actually turn it into a well-directed article against Putin?
What's he doing in there?
This is therefore not a sheet on the tiger of Siberia, but a sheet on the suites of a comet operation of Putin.
When we expose ourselves to the media, we also expose ourselves to irony or criticism.
The return to the perpetual victimization of the soviet-poutinian sympathiser.
Holland had also filled the powder with his shirt without being called on to the French anti-français plot.
There our student Alain Bougrain-Dubourg, the patron saint of large Russia, personally and physically involved in the reintroduction of this tiger.
In any case, the tiger he understood everything, he bared...
If Holland gets drunk, it's a thing.
At first sight, it seemed to be an awfully condescending idea.
But on the basis of the article, it seems that it is both an answer to a real problem - emergency dental grants - and effective.
So it's hard to find something to go back to.
And if only 53% of this sample were brushed up before, and 73% after, it is a little empty sense to complain about paternism.
After all, there's no discomfort in brushing your teeth!
In fact, in the bottom, complaints seem to be related to the fact that they are aimed at the unemployed and that this confirms a negative stereotype.
But if that happens exactly, then it's not a justified criticism.
Belinda Smith, of the Canterbury Regional Health Committee, said the department was concerned about the number of emergency dental grants offered by the Department of Labour and Revenue of the Department of Social Development to young unemployed adults.
On a media level, there would be better ways to implement it, I imagine.
But he's got a reasonably good idea.
There's a problem with brushing your teeth.
If you spray them after drinking wine, it can damage the enamel layer.
If your toothbrush is old and rigid, it can pick the gum and cause inflammation.
And I remember an issue on the Guinness book of memories where someone had tried to brush the longest teeth and the Guinness judges at the time had strongly discouraged him from doing it because of the adverse effects of frequent and prolonged tooth brushing.
' at first sight ' - very funny.
It seems to me to be a stupid experimental concept.
The simple fact of volunteering for this study would have changed the habits of participants who knew that tooth brushing would be studied.
That's why most behavioral studies include things like double blinds, witness groups, etc.
There is no way to reject these results on the program itself.
Assuming that these texts are sent to every young person with social benefits, there are two things that differ from this test: 1) They are not volunteers, and 2) they do not provide feedback on the times when they brush or brush their teeth (lightly mistaken results by people who give their results according to perceived expectations).
Is there any consequences at the epigenetic level?
Studies (Pr Lyonnet) showed that the maternal environment (including the uterus) could have an effect on genetic heritage, not on genetics, but on the expression of genes, and that these inherited traits could be transmitted to the next generation.
Does the uterus graffiti affect this phenomenon?
The nesting itself looks like a kind of graffiti.
There are probably consequences, but as long as we don't want to have an impossible perfect clone of ourselves, is this a priority problem?
I think it's going beyond the reasonable limit.
The desire for motherhood and parenthood should not move ever further away, without asking the question of ethics, taking risks, for the mother and for her baby.
No medicine is not all powerful, no limitless, and yes it is unfortunate and painful to accept that all women will not have it, or the children they wish to have.
That has nothing, absolutely nothing, to see with the train
But let the people, the women, the others, have their bodies, their sense of love that can go to risk and manage your little testicles to yourself, all alone in your little pants to yourself.
to "confirm" this magical bag for them to have this wonderful moment of pregnancy.
Why would I keep him in my safe if he could still give him love?
The current severed circumstances make PR FRYDMAN prudent about his communication, but if "we" agreed to reflect, "we" would admit that it is only the bag and not the genetic material involved.
What's going to put us as an anti argument: cf here these reactions of all men curiously....
Marjane, there's nothing anodinous to the organ.
I've been a plasma donor for years, it's not completely anodinous.
I was registered as a donor of spinach (I have never been selected because the selection is very rigorous and that is understood both for the receiver and for the donor), it is a real operation.
Now as a man, I will not allow myself to judge in a sense or another or to take part in this gift, but I will listen to women talking about it.
@Margane: Actually, this has nothing to do with anodin, and it strengthens the act of love that it involves.
Giving a queen to a member of his family who needs it has nothing more anodin, and that's what happens!
Please don't mix Messi v Ronaldo.
It's low.
I agree, we don't need this.
Especially that there's no more competition...
Ronaldo is the best athlete.
Messi is the best footballer.
Sports has become a yoyo club.
They're too good for the Second, but they don't have the Liga standard.
Rivaldo was not part of the title winning team.
Thank you for correcting me.
But Rivaldo played well for the Sportivo before going to Barcelona.
Ronaldo, who continues to do everything to beat all the Real Madrid goals records this season so that he can then return to Old Trafford this summer with a quiet conscience...
I can't believe it.
I think Ronaldo will put an end to his career in Santiago Bernebeu.
I think you want to talk about the stage of the international oil investment company?
I was looking at him on a fucking connection, so I can't tell you a big deal if it's not that Valencia have well defended and without counting the property, they deserved to win.
I was afraid that the ground environment would get out of the way too fast, but they played well.
Parejo's game all over is getting better.
An afrocious penalty claimed but just saved by Diego.
A Chautious Ambient Mestalta and it didn't have to be funny for the Atletico bus to get bombed.
That's interesting.
A complete article, signed by young researcher Amanda Marshall, "On the Origins of Momification", is illustrated in the magazine Archaeology 524 of September last.
It is good to have arguments to confirm and date what becomes intuitive.
It's not surprising that before we make it complicated, it's made it simple.
All science progresses by small steps.
And was the "The Organ" of the woman so preserved?
Passionant!
Hello and thank you for your tickets.
It seemed to me to read a few times ago that a black child's mom had been discovered in the current Libya and that this discovery had opened new horizons, including geographical and time-consuming (I remember that the mom was 1000 years earlier than the first known African moms).
Do you have any information about this?
Thank you for the advance.
She's got a little reading.
These may not be contaminations of modern times.
Was the desert at that time not more distant than it is now?
Why don't you imagine plants like cannabis moving to a place where there's only sand now?
We knew the song.
And it is enough that a European scholar confirms it, even without any evidence, that it is a scientific truth: the Egyptians and Africans of yesterday and today have never invented anything at home.
But the song does not tell us who are the inventors of African inventions in Africa.
If it's not always "his known bad ancestors."
You should read the article.
This is an article written by neoliberal free market jackets, which preaches against the mobility of persons and for the mobility of property.
I think there are other people who are affected by Ebola and who the Spanish government is lying to us, not to give themselves a bad picture and to protect tourism.
Today, I would like to believe that tourism is the last of their concerns.
But they might remain silent to avoid a general panic.
I would like to believe the same thing about tourism, but the right governments in particular (i.e. those in Spain and the United Kingdom) tend to protect the interests of businesses rather than those of people.
Stop, don't hesitate to call your local MP and complain about the lack of transparency.
Even though I think that the government here is only a band of connards, good at nothing and corrupt, like Madrid is not a very tourist place, I doubt it is their greatest concern.
What are you waiting for?"
(with all the respect and compassion I have for the nurse and her colleagues), because tourism is one of the only things that enable millions of people in this country to keep their heads off of water, I would say that it is important.
If they were to repatriate the missionaries, I do not see why they could not send them to an air base and care for them there in a ground hospital, rather than in the capital, for example.
Rajoy had a mission to dismantle the Spanish health service, privatizing the nationalized hospitals especially in Madrid, which is its basis of power, until the courts intervene.
It's nothing but a right-wing man in charge of public relations like Cameron, and like Cameron, I think he's fucked up in the next election.
To be just towards Cameron (I know it's not easy here) it's socially far from its right and would find its place to the religious error of the right in America.
Now he must sing the praises of the hospitals he had previously come down to try to achieve his goal of protecting Spanish tourism.
I am sorry, but you cannot really compare the Tories or any other European side of the right to Spanish right.
It's a case aside, believe me.
The Spanish Government is talking about almost everything that concerns it.
It's not like someone could accuse you of spreading unfounded rumors.
So you have tangible evidence to support this idea?
This section of the Guardian is called Comments are free.
Thank you, Mr. Supiot.
Without putting work at the centre of production and the economy with its rights and guarantees, we will not get out of it.
Excellent article but especially fascinating reactions to the forum.
Many TPE patterns - SMEs seem to read The World to take the time to condemn Pr.
Let's talk about the anti-intellectualism of the Ambient Age.
A professor of law at the College of France seems unable to know the labour market unless it is the Nobel prize of economy and proposes to liberalise it completely
It was so much better before, it was true when Dr. Villerme found the work of children aged 8 and 10 hours a day, when the Canuts were getting to work because of a collective agreement signed.
Oh, the good old time...
Your reaction is as fascinating as your ignorance of the TPE pattern business!
His profession is not to know the right in all his crafts, but to manage and produce.
Four manuscripts registered on my youth salary bulletin, more than 100 information today!
Here is an example that could be cited much more, which illustrates the constant flow of constraints, imposed without measure the consequences, and which exacerbate the small business.
Your paper would have been very useful if you had written it as an expert and not as a Sorbon client.
In order to break the neck to the archived argument of the French Labour Code's thickness compared to the lever, a serious university would have slipped into the Swiss texts and compared the number of official texts, then the comments (the absence of the latter may mean that Swiss laws are more understandable than ours).
By commenting in a Code, whether it's work or not, we refer to case law, in particular...
And yes, in France, there is still a judge who is responsible for applying the laws when a employee is fired, for example....
Who's this complicated?
Do you find that the rules of law (laws, jurisprudence, conventions, contracts) are in the field of Labour and Trade of Unsustainable Obstacles?
What's he doing?
How long does that take?
Pullmann "Art has practically become immunized against Ms. Criticism.
Is this guy still in the mood?
It is certainly time for new revolutionary absurdities to chauvinize criticism...
For each article on Ai Weiwei that I have read recently, you are part of the first three comments that complain about its popularity.
Get to something else!
Let's see, the choice is not lacking in the world of art.
If China can produce new artists who are not spokesmen of the Communist Party, the world will be interested.
Yes, GenisCan is probably a troll of the Chinese government.
I think China has produced a lot of good contemporary artists.
Those who are spokespersons of the Communist government are not appreciated in the West, and those who are not spokespersons are not as well connected as Ai Weiwei.
For those of you who think Ai Weiwei's art is a kind of fraud, here's what you think.
Thanks for that, you just ruined my breakfast.
I apologize, but at all costs it was necessary to expose it (without making a bad word game).
It's the guy who blows up the old irreplaceable ceramics and calls it art, right?
There's art, and then there's vandalism trying to draw attention.
The real artists make the difference.
A great artist.
His father is also a poet not bad.
His father was a well-known poet in China.

CARSENTY DEMISSION This gentleman is unworthy to hold an election mandate for extremists on any side (including Zionists) must be avoided
Philippe Karcenty and his ridiculous conspiracy theories, which have valued him in several judicial convictions, are ashamed of both Israel and the capital of Neuilly.
He represents neither one or the other.
Philippe Karcenty fights the truth alone, marginally.
HOW TO BE ASSEMBLY
What's the matter with Neilly's Mairie against Philipe Karcenty, who's injuring a journalist and his family, and who publicly calls on this urbanist to attack?
Crime apology?
I can't find Neuilly on my card?
Is a new administration that holds these new privileges???
This type needs care, as well as Ulcan Chelli, they both do in the theory of the anti-Jewish/anti-Israel plot and their resources are perfectly identical to those of their most angry predators.
Just as many people believe in any political decision to see the hands of the Zionists (the term which tends to disappear, because of its abuse), both there, as the LDJ or still the CRIF, believe to see in any criticism, even banal, an abstract anti-Semitism "that is not without recalling the darkest hours of our history because it is still ferocious the belly of the beast my good lady would have come back to Russia in the 19th century!"
To note that Karcenty's incredibly stupid theories on Charles Enderlin's report are even more stupid than those on September 11.
And God knows that the conspiracy theories on September 11 are of a well-crested beast.
And this guy has political responsibilities, it's extremely worrying.
To clarify my analogy with the conspiracy theory of 11 September, we are talking about cognitive dissonance on how to address the issue.
Totally blinded by a completely dazzling truth, having spent too much time, spending too much money to build it, it is unbearable for this theory to detach it (as in the case of extreme religious ones).
A logical and inexhaustible run ahead, the end justifies all means, even the lie, which is a complex, but complex does not seem to disturb the mission of the person concerned.
You advise not to put everyone in the same basket, but that's what you're doing for September 11th.
There is still a multitude of questions without answers for this event, and Bush/Cheney/Saudiens/consorts do not seem to be in a hurry to answer it.
There are actually very pale theories, but the official theory is also, at least on a few points.
Oh, nothing's funny right now...
Health NGOs and public health spokespersons find that the results of the study are largely in favour of their awareness efforts.
And, of course, they will need more subsidies to follow!!
As smoking was socially accepted 50 years ago and is now recognized for what it really is, alcohol will also know its time of judgment where the real damage it causes in our society will be exposed.
More than waiting for everyone to attack me now...
Well, it's easy to say things like "excessive consumption of alcohol is increasing", but what you ask (a little) more effort is to give real facts.
I'm sorry if you consider this an attack - go drink a glass and rest?
It's better to risk it than to put my mental health at risk by avoiding me.
The government will end the fun when it costs money.
Here are other alarmist advice based on untrustworthy statistics.
Two medium-sized bottles per day are at least a low level of alcohol consumption, and the first quote seems to indicate that it increases the risk of many cancers, but the second implies that it is a more or less safe amount.
Perhaps the Cancer Council and the National Health and Medical Research Council should agree (about one or two glasses, but above all not three) and give us a figure on which they agree - whether justified or not.
Now, we're gonna hit them deep, like the smokers!
They're already doing it - soon it's gonna be the grass!
My father didn't drink or smoke, and cancer took him to 64 years of age.
So I'm gonna keep drinking my two red bottles on Friday and Saturday night (and the other nights when my wife's not here).
Why does the Cancer Council encourage children to go to places where alcohol is used? It is an old fact that the Cancer Council has deliberately ignored.
What's not related to a risk of cancer today????
The sharks don't catch cancer - they eat anything but they're not good company.
The sharks can catch cancer - skin cancer.
Charlie Whiting's incompetence has been a recurring subject for many years.
Refuse to run when one can run and each other.
I totally agree.
Whiting is Bernie's blessing.
Both of them destroyed the F1 under security pretext.
Let's hope it gets better than Schumi or worse Wendlinger on his accident in 1994.
Absolutely agreed with you, but attention to point 1: it is not the F1, but the circuit authorities who refused to move forward so as not to steal the broadcasters' TV.
Totally accurate, +1
I just want a quick and quick recovery to Jules Bianchi!
Brazil 2003, Europe 2007, the incidents that fell between landfills and f1 were free of charge.
It was known that one day this would happen, and Jacques Laffite, among other things, has been saying it for years.
How devil the race organization and the FIA have been able to allow these maneuvers without leaving the safety car?
I can't accept that we invoke the risks of the profession or the accident when we don't prevent the foreseeable one.
And this accident was it.
It must also be said, however, that there was a yellow flag, which does not only mean "banning to cross the area" but has the first purpose of signaling a danger.
It's not shameful, it's lucky for the family who had to be in front of the TV.
Even under the yellow flag, the pilots are just going to lift their feet.
Under changing conditions, the turn can be much more fast the next turn and the pilot, believing to arrive with sufficient margin, can even be "reduced" at a normal rate.
But, well, we're caused in the vacuum, as long as we don't see the images, we won't be able to issue a notice.
I don't see too much of what it changes.
Are there any injured?
According to the CBC, no injury has been reported.
The CBC showed the information this morning before this happens, which makes me wonder what caused the derailment.
It's hard to believe there's still work to be kept 24 hours a day.
I don't think there's any injured people, because Canada is almost empty.
There may be animals injured such as bears, washing rats, etc.
I hope it's ironic.
Some parts of Vancouver have the strongest population density in North America, and Toronto's agglomeration has at least six million inhabitants.
In Saskatchewan's campaign, trains do not derail as if by fire, and these types of trains often cross populous urban areas.
Almost every Canadian city is crossed by a railway line, and trains are very, very often in one day.
In addition, as the roads often follow the watercourses in the regions where lakes, rivers or oceans exist, they also go to densely populated areas because people always want to live near the water.
So, all the rail traffic across the center of a city as it was a central element of the original construction of railway lines here.
You may have tried to be funny, but there is an enormous potential for railway disasters in Canada.
Mansbridge made a report on this last night, really shocking.
Did you not, of course, read the article on the derailment and explosion of a train in a city of Quebec that killed 47 people?
In fact, you're partly right.
The city of Vancouver was a port city well before the railway.
This says, when the railways were built, they passed through the centre of the established communities because it was the most direct and central road.
It may be that Canadian Railway Corporation employees should go to the next Conference on Dangerous Products in Calgary in Canada on 2 and 3 December 2014.
CN employees are long trained in the transport of dangerous products.
This article, like many comments, ignores the fundamental religious question: a religion is a revealed truth and for its believers it could not exist other truths.
All the problem is here, and the theological exercises only strengthen this, but what good is it to speak about the sex of angels?
"God said: that's good - that's bad" > it's not compatible with democracy, it's called dictatorship (variant: theocracy).
The word of a leader (Muslim countries but no importance): "But without religion, how do you want to keep the people?" .
In other words, follow the curate priest rabbin rabbin imam and pray your prayers, it will be better!

May His New Addendum touch you.
Yes, that is what Voltaire and others thought, then Robespierre in a certain way, trying to establish a cult of the Supreme Being.
But our oligarchy also has its own cults : that of the Euro fort ( rather at the moment ) or that of the free market ( almost supported by the State when it has to float ) , etc .
Great ideas from religious resurrections.
Yes, but especially where there was no distinction between religious and profane.
Where the rational emerges, the religious is at the back and expresses himself in the skism.
Religion was born as the ideological support of the State, and the gods served the ambitions even though it also carried forms of controversy.
The theology of loyalty to the form of the revelation and adaptation to the weather was not a doubt.
Fanatism is often described as a misinterpretation of "sacred texts".
This does not resist the examination of these texts that are filled with explicit pleas against the enemy.
Rather, they are the moderate (and fortunately the most) religious ones who "read evil" the texts and hold back only what is true of humanism and common values throughout humanity, atheists and different believers.
For me, fanaticism is the vicious and evil application of passages from sacred texts out of their context.
Thus, some verses of the Qur'an calling to kill "mecrets", "unbelievers", "hypocrits", "Jewish" or "Christians" are incomprehensible and therefore unacceptable if some verses are not read above or below clarifying that these executions are justified only in cases where Muslims are attacked, killed and in a position of legitimate defence.
on Yves Petit:" concerning the "foulard", it is quite a religious prescription that makes today almost unanimous among the "savants".
There are idiots everywhere.
The only positive point to draw from this is that it has caused a general condemnation.
Especially in Australia.
Aren't you guilty of the same damage that it shows in the clip?
Neanderthal gang overpaid and hypersexualized.
They've abused humanity enough!
What have they openly brought us to us with the neighbors, For life, Summer Bay, Paul Hogan, Crocodile Dundee, Einstein Junior, Angry Anderson - Suddenly, Mental as Anything - Live It Up, Danni Minogue, Razorback, Baz Lurman, Nicole Kidman, Russell Crowe, Bee Gees, Shane Warne, Yahoo Serious, Ian Thorpe, Kylie Minogue, Men at Work, Hugh Jackman, the devil of Tasmania and this satan Skippy!
An insult to our intelligence, that's what he gave us!
If you take your eyes off the TV for a moment, you will see that Australia has a rich cultural heritage, starting with paintings in caves and on stone made by its indigenous peoples, which are still a source of inspiration for modern artists today.
And then there's the Sydney Opera and a national opera company that produced wonderful songs like Joan Sutherland and Nellie Melba.
The Australian cinema produced films such as The Story of the Kelly Gang, Mad Max and Gallipoli.
Notable Australians include Errol Flynn, Nicole Kidman, Hugh Jackman, Heath Ledger, Geoffrey Rush and Cate Blancett.
The only thing that insults your intelligence is you and your ignorance.
Russell Crowe is New Zealand, and the Bee Gees were English.
Your intelligence really needs to be insulted!
Allow me to be of another opinion.
Sox doesn't need any help in this section.
How I managed to find it to be a "small white"!
Another fan of George Lazenby.
Charming!!!
But is Marie Jego?
The largest foreign journalist based in Moscow.
The most brilliant.
His articles are extremely flawed.
She understands if she's in the bottom of Putin and those who support her.
Let's go see Leviathan in the movie, you'll understand a lot of things!!
Nice try, Savantcosi!
But you still don't know that Kastals is just a little Moscow telegrapher who has nothing to do with his days.
We leave him for a month and when we come back he's about to drop the same salads.
The nearly totality of the 331 deaths since the ceasefire are civilians of the Donbass victims of military bombings, due to uncontrollable elements according to Kiev.
The presentation of the hypocritical responsibilities suggested in the article without dare to go up to explicitly designate separatists is in the world's Ottoman line that does not hesitate to reverse facts and responsibilities to maintain the weakness of pro-European neo-European geniuses bravely facing the Russians.
@SavantCosinus: Change browser.
I open this page very well on firefox and mac.
If I understand your speech, the wicked are the Ukrainians and the nice Russian Stalinists you won't be a little communist by chance.
Extract from the (very long) document you quote about MH17: "this ticket has absolutely no purpose to say that pro-Donetsk resistors are innocent".
The Minister of Defence of the Russian Federation said that Ukraine is responsible.
From the propaganda?
In Alexandre Kastals: where do you keep these details about the discounted macabre?
From the Ukrainian army (it unfortunately loses soldiers almost every day, according to it)?
Uncontrolled elements (if any)?
BY AWAKE!
Alleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeethe Hungarian!
And I say that as a Romanian citizen.
From Transylvania, with a woman of Hungarian origin, on the other hand.
That says, I can't support the Piturca team, they don't represent me.
Piturca is a member of the powers in place that has not stopped denouncing the Romanian football to the pathetic level that he has now reached.
They formed a network that produced the Coperativa, which decided before the beginning of the season which team would win the championship, which teams would be relegated in Europe, and which would whitewash the money at its own expense, mainly by selling players that were well underestimated.
Gica Popescu, the former captain of Barcelona, was doing business with the above-mentioned agents, and tried to avoid paying taxes (about a million euros), then paid them, but apparently he was ill advised by his lawyers, refused to admit his mistakes to the court (which would have cost him a fine-free prison) and was then taken for 3 and a half years.
The trial also valued the prison for the Becali brothers, four club owners, the Steua manager Mihai Stoica, and Popescu, for offences related to football.
George Becali is also punishing him for trying to suffocate (and then dissimulate the facts) a team to beat us (CFR Cluj) in the final match of the championship, to win the title and win the jackpot of the League of Champions.
The team he tried to soda was our neighbors in Cluj, University.
We won 1-0 in their stage, a result that allowed us to be Cluj's first champions, while they were relegated.
I always enjoy this moment.
In the desimulation of this attempt of corruption, among other things, Piturca, who signed as a witness a false document indicating that the money that the police had confiscated in Cluj was related to a sale of land.
So this uneducated poor man, an idiot, a cheater and a liar never represents me, and he will never do it.
The Hungarians are just a band of nationalists today.
You might think that after the last time they broke stage and shop windows, and where they had branded racist banners in the streets, they couldn't have tickets this time, but no.
I thought Neil Lennon was getting ready to reinstate the reindeer in Al-Ittihad.
Where it ends, it will be a disappointment, after Stockport County refused it.
Super article.
If Sarkozy were the one who did that, we would have heard the left scream like a great disease.
But as it is the gentle Holland, friends of the trade unions and small people, we hear a little bit of protest, but everything is low.
This is why economic environments sometimes prefer a party claiming to be left-handed.
These are the bankers who financed Obama's victory, and they didn't have enough of their investment!
"The absurd idea that most employers are not looking for work" LOL (no comment)
Should the employment pool generalise the control of early 2015 unemployed?
I hope that in the poll, fiscal pole, it will also generalize the absolute control of the gugnafiers commonly called plutocrats, banksters, kleptocrats, tax escapes, theft patterns, and other Malanderins.
Can you make a phrase without the words bankers or plutocrats?
You look very proud of your jargon every time
That's true when we're in class: we're dealing with the population of litres and without teeth.
Every new period of unemployment is dozens and dozens of applications that I address to employers who are most often not even affected by a reception accused, it was automated.
It is also the total absence of follow-up or support from the Employment Pole.
To conclude, I would add that the patron name "socialist" of this government appears to me as an insult to the memory of Jaurès or Mendès France.
Did we read an article from the channel here?
It is learned that a unemployed person can stay for several months without news from his agency, but that he must continue to seek employment by his own means.
It is learned that controls have allowed people who for more than half were no longer affected by unemployment.
We therefore wonder how we can control people we never see.
The question is what kind of punishment constitutes radiation for someone who has no access to the job pool services or to unemployment benefits.
And if we can admit that this reform will allow for more radiation, we ask what it will help recruits.
"It is learned that a unemployed person can stay for several months without news from his agency, but that he must continue to look for jobs by his own means" It is indeed shameful.
The question needs to be asked, why are these countries in the EU while the authorities are clearly unable to defend Europe's equal ideals?
Is it not as if the Spanish or Italian authorities had done a great deal about racism in the foothills?
Should we hunt them out of the EU?
The EU was only from the economic point of view and should remain.
The goal is not to be a "police of thought".
The EU is a peaceful project.
It has no economic significance.
This is probably why Britain will soon leave the EU: it is the most unequal society in Europe.
What equality?
Eastern European teams are constantly being held by the corrupt mafia arbitrators who are UEFA.
The best solution would be that the whole East leaves this poor profit organization and creates its own.
At least we'll finally look at the football.
This crossroads of anti-racism is only a screen to cover injustice and corruption!
No, that's not true.
Money and trade, rather.
The European ideals of equality?
What, then, is Europe's failure to let the United Kingdom enter?
The Uefa should applaud them for having played the comedy of Blaster and his men.
It's been going on for a few years, and I don't know.
Pulled from the Guardian two or three days ago:
Would he expect to see little symmetric phrases, just history to maintain controversy?
Whatever it is, it is a fact that every small event towards peace, there has been, there will be and there will be people who use to pour oil on the fire.
The denunciation would be that the Western States are against a "Palestinian State", that they are pro-Israeli, and that only explains that these States have never done anything against the Israeli State.
The decomposition would be to say that in order to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian question, it would be necessary to act against the Israeli identical overarmed occupying siege destroyer colonizer
In 1945, rather than creating a Jewish state in Palestine against an Arab population that was for nothing in the Shoah, it was more reasonable to empty the Bavarian people of their Germans (who were guilty of the Shoah) to replace them by the surviving Jews.
That would have been fair, the Germans had nothing to claim and Europe would have saved millions of educated, entrepreneurs and dynamics.
Mr., let's take the example of Western Sahara colonization...
Let Morocco be the colonialist, it's obvious!
But as for Israel, we must also question the history, its allies and its supporters to learn truths.
Colonialism, whatever it is, has never been altruistic, we agree.
Then stop your pirouettes to support Israel as a colonizer.
The Gaule was colonized by the Romans, but at present there is no discrimination between the descendants of the Romans, Gaulois or others.
In Palestine, there is well discrimination on the basis of origin.
In addition, the Israeli State is defined as a "people of Jews" whose non-Jewish will not be part of.
The Israeli state discriminates against the non-Jews, from which he is content.
Conclusion: To resolve the conflict, it is necessary to break up with Zionism that opposes Jews and non-Jews.
In Maghreb, some peoples were even baptized in the name of their first status by this saving civilization!
Two realities must stop ignoring.
Primo, the European Zionist project (colonise-to-appropriate Palestine) involved the possession of Palestinians, which was therefore an intrinsically anti-Palestinian project, so the solution needed to break up with Zionism.
Second, Zionism is a political ideology.
Uruguay was missing as soon as it left.
Their new result will give them what bites their fingers.
He should start his rehabilitation by small mouth.
I hope he hasn't lost the appetite of the game.
We tolerate so much subtlety, including racial injuries and physically hard heels in football, but Suarez has been punished too hard.
I'd like to see him back in England, no matter what the purists say.
Yeah, I hate all these molars.
Football is a contact sport where the keyboards exist and, therefore, the players will get hurt.
The fact of turning his teeth into the flesh of an opponent to have the advantage certainly does not have his place in the game.
A rugbyman was suspended for 80 matches to have committed a similar gesture.
This is now the third time Suarez has done this.
If you bite somebody at work.
What do you think the consequences would be?
I knew someone was going to kill.
If you're dyslexic, I forgive you.
I'm actually slightly dyslexic.
I forgive that sarcasm to two balls.
I bet he'd been looking forward to playing with his teeth full of teeth.
All these words games on Suarez are losing their bite.
I had to bite the rabbit.
A prerequisite for a good school course is respect by students of their teachers and the school institution.
This works if parents instill that respect for their children.
Parents convey that respect more easily if they feel that they are also respected by their children's teachers and schools.
In good institutions, those who make their students progress, parents are considered partners, not em..
Who can believe that it is the professor who should do all the work (teaching, educating, learning respect, limits, living together briefly) It is for parents to do at least 50% of the cup.
But it's probably easier to take it to school.
Putting on parents is not operational.
No one really took care of them.
The action will therefore remain limited.
On the other hand, the school institution could do a lot of things.
Operational solutions are in place.
Actors (profs, hierarchies and department) should play their role and not always play a role.
A group can be dissolved to re-establish it, not the families.
Don't talk about teaching.
It is true that communication courses allow for change.
We seem to be training teachers, but we forget the first role of school.
Transmitting knowledge.
And if parents are required, the school provides their children with instruction.
That is the Minister who will dare to put in place what was called the Public Instruction.
Defective article: little information, partial and destroyed reflections.
Are you really waiting for an intelligent comment about this beaut of the east bananas?
It's a beaut, it's clear, but I think it's Willoughby, and so on the North Coast...
Sloppy Joe doesn't understand the numbers.
He refuses to accept the facts.
Not surprisingly, we have an emergency budget.
Let him fall and the economy will wake up immediately.
Hunters Hill, actually.
square vertebrae
That's it.
A little Aloysius.
His electorate is Sydney Nord's seat.
Indeed a beaver of the North Coast !!!
Well, if British BBC TV viewers want to compare the neoconservative governments of our two countries, they would obviously come to the conclusion that both are led by the Monster Raving Tory Wang-Bangers.
It goes for a grincheux, today. :(
Yes, but his leader regularly leaves him on his hunger.
Rather, you will be grinches too if you wake up one morning and realize that you will never have the role of Prime Minister and that all these legitimate and illegal benefits will never remain out of your reach.
Poor Joe.
It's really pathetic.
He tried to present a budget in half and then abandoned it.
At least he doesn't threaten to beat someone.
Brittany Ferries needs a new ship.
It will be able to command it, without gas turbines - in a distant country and to call for State aid.
And as she knows about lobbying, there's no fear of the result.
And so much for the job in France that she has nothing to do, she who is always ready to break up when their corporation has losses in the markets, especially outside...
It's just because their lobbying didn't work that the command was cancelled.
If the company had obtained the time or preparation for marpol, there is no doubt that the project would have taken place.
Then, to know whether it is good or not and how BF will comply with the law despite everything, it would be nice that "the world" is looking at it!
Brittany Ferries is held by the Breton vegetables.
Those who burn the tax and drought centers.
They wanted State aid.
That they didn't seem to me to be the least normal.
And to the extent that an army under the French metropolitan flag is 30% cheaper than any other civilized flag, yes it is normal to wait for a coup of the state.
Or it is condemned to tolerate British monopolies in the market.
It's the choice.
An eternal French problem that regards its maritime façades as tourist destinations, not as areas of activity, where people sometimes live different from the average Parisian.
This difference is paid every day, lack of investment, of short notice.
One of the reasons why Britain must regain its sovereignty.
That's it and then they'll create the Breton Pavilion with exclusively consisting of pure Bretons.
With this it is certain that they will significantly reduce the costs...
Of course.
Unfortunately, that is what the BBC now expects.
They always hated everything that was related to the prog, so it is not surprising that they chose to go beyond Hackett's solo career, which has always been closer to the Genesis spirit of the 1970s than those of the other members of the group.
Hackett was for Genesis what Malcolm Young was for AC/DC.
If you don't understand how important it was for the sound, you don't really understand their music.
To tell the truth, they hardly mention Gabriel's work alone no more.
I do not think that the BBC can be accused of "deserting everything related to the prog", as they have just published an hour and a half documentary on one of the largest prog groups that ever existed.
I haven't seen the documentary yet, but it's a film about the Genesis group, not about the solo projects of its members.
As for Hackett's solo career, which would be "closer to the Genesis spirit of the 1970s", I disagree.
Hackett no longer has the right to take the road, play a Genesis song bag on which he had different degrees of participation and pretend to have an affinity with Genesis that David Gilmour has no right to collect a half-end demo bag and call it a Pink Floyd album.
Oh, wait...
I think Steve Hackett's asking for nothing more than a fair representation, but he didn't get it.
A curious feeling, Bank's first solo album, is absolutely brilliant, and everything in Genesis's mind of the 1970s.
They've gone beyond Hackett's solo career because, we're honest, she's afraid.
Yes, it is one of the best prog groups, but would the documentary have been realized if they had not had their pop commercial success in the 1980s?
I still haven't seen the BBC broadcast a long documentary on groups like King Crimson and Gentle Giant that have as interesting a story but lacks the popular attraction that Genesis has.
Good notes.
I would say, however, that the BBC has "always" hated the fact that it is the progressive music in time.
A person with a personal interest shouts "prejudice": of course.
A little more interview with Jonathan King on the DVD version?
The song is absolutely beautiful.
If the death penalty is an attempt to redouble a horrible act by another horrible act (including sometimes against innocents), then it is a brilliant success.
There will always be a difference in size between a death sentence criminal and those who kill him.
The criminal has committed his act since his false understanding of society and his rules.
Those who kill it do so from the vision and reflection of a society's most just and wisest.
I mean, they don't have any excuses.
They're defenseless.
Yes, your point of view was understood for the first time.
That's exactly what the difference is, Mr. LeClos.
There must be a very different spirit of the mortal community to enjoy violence.
That's what the criminal's been doing since he got the wrong idea.
But it is also what causes pain, hatred, revenge in the neighborhood of the innocent victim: a false understanding which will never prevail those who wisely decide the death of others since the sound and just reasoning of their petals.
However, in order to try to balance the analysis, it could also be argued that the death sentence, often committed wild violence, which he was able to enjoy, against the very kind people, who were free of charge.
The close relatives of these unfortunate victims will eventually be relieved of their pain with the disappearance of the one who was the burreau, sometimes the tortionaire, to be loved and who spend their nights.
Let's not overlook their relief.
Thank Emilio for this reflection that I find very just.
Strong and moving article.
As for Marc Asnin, he has great intelligence.
That's the heart.
That's certainly what I've been reading for a long time.
It would be believed, however, to read stories of another time, ancient things, that the barbary of the past would excuse, and then that's the dates that are closing, 2009, 2011, 2012...
I really don't think Philip Roth is that great.
Same for the other two "American Excellents" quoted here.
Roth, Pinchon and De Lillo are all surfaces.
I thought you stopped the white one, man.
What's the big deal?
Roth is great, much better than De Lillo or Pinchon.
And Roth is incredibly better than this miserable Bellow, who got him the price.
Perhaps this year's Nobel laureate judges have decided that if we should have a U.S. diplomat, we could still have a racist [leger].
Munro is very good, too.
They all produce "genie novels" as if it were a type of literary.
His homonymous Joseph against...
Which one did you read?
How many books of DeLillo's anti-DeLillo have they read?
I never finished Underworld, but a few years later I started reading his other books.
Did you read The Body Artist?
News like "Human Moments in World War III"?
White Noise?
The first lighter novels, the craziest, the smaller, and their dialogues, are also great.
I don't know if I'm gonna end up in Underworld.
I just know that if I meet someone who claims to live in the same world as me and have read enough of DeLillo's books to reject his writer's talent, I can only fear that his favorite novelist is Tony Parsons.
Why would there be a conflict...???
It's of simple interest.
It was a matter of humor, "the law", not a definition request.
Between the text and the mind, it seems so EVIDENT here that the lady acted in the SON alone, and absolutely not in the institution she represented, that we are asked what the term "conflict" is doing there.
For her, there was no conflict.
I hope she'll be very expensive!
Well, state services are very practical: either they prevent a dynamic contractor from creating value, or they have not prevented it from endangering it.
After we understand that the French employees are not dynamic and seek only peace.
The flood zones that become constructive the next day when a big construction program will start, it's classic, and not just on a low coast.
Look at the alluvial plains near the rivers.
We were told that "from our day, there are no more floods thanks to the regulation barriers."
Now, we need to expand the retention lakes up and cross the fingertips.
But it will be because of the state's services, of course...
The benefit on the ground, on the whole promotion?
On the ground.
So 6 million euros.
Is it clear, there, the interest?
Get out the computer and you're going to dream of life that you could have been in Ms. Babin's place, the first UMP member of La Faute on the Sea and the former President of the Committee on Urbanism, who allows them to build!
The 2 mothers of the Triomphant Sarkozysm are the old and the real estate.
I'm from the left and not from all the sympathy with Sarko, but svp, not from the low political or low azimuths, we're not in there in a battle of heavy balls.
I wonder if the cops involved in these recent shootings were also involved in these incidents.
U.S. cops are heavy criminals.
The U.S. is a shithole.
So what kind of shit do you want, you?
The United States isn't a shithole.
Yes, U.S. cops are tired because of the cracks that they've been dealing with on a daily basis.
Of course, none of them ever does anything, but the cops "come to shame them because they are racist."
That's a good excuse.
Racism is endemic to the US, it is unfortunate that an incident like this is missing to force people to see the problem as close as possible.
Your generalization reveals a deep ignorance of the US...
You don't know him here.
Good cops must denounce the corrupt racist cops.
VENDEZ LES!
You do the math.
This kind of open racism doesn't exist here.
Is this the first time you've had a conversation?
It's not a conversation, you accuse someone of being ignorant while it's clearly you who don't care - many sources (US sources) have noticed the permanent problem that racism is in the United States (it's not of bird speculation).
It is highly likely that you underestimate the extent of the problem and do not appreciate the extent of the tension on this issue at this time.
As a result, the border between public service and private security for power and privileges, which has never been very robust, is becoming even more insignificant.
Wall Street finances NYPD in different ways, from where the treatment was performed by Occupy there.
What surprises me is the naïveness of some and I'm shocked by the false naïveness of VA and others.
And where do you think research journalists find their information?
On the Internet?
They're going to question those responsible, talk about them, raise confidence.
That Lhomme went to the Elysée has nothing really amazing.
Then, what counts is recalculation, verification, analysis.
And that's where it's understood that the sarcotes are interested in doing so.
@Munstead, our current president has been elected on a wave of anti-arcosyism based on cases of any kind (not a place and no conviction) that appear to have been concocted by magistrates (2 references in corrigendum), two Dutch friends' journalists.
If this collision that is revealed between justice, politics, executive and the press that is not supposed to be a power organ does not shock you, it is your partisan spirit that blinds you!
RV with Holland ...
And of course all this is only coincidence and not television !!!! ...
If you think only Sarkozy's support is indigestible!
From the extract I could read, the article in VA just scratches the scratcher.
I even laughed so big.
For the rest of the world's complaint has little chance of reaching because journalists are not "attended" in the secret of sources, is it not?
Unlike the fact that there does not seem to be any connection between VA and the power while there seems to be consensus between the power and the world's journalists for an operation against an opponent.
I do not have to be the only one to wait for an explanation from the World on the ground and on its dangerous relations.
We are well faced with a state scandal that in any other democracy would cause the government to fall.
This editorial to the Aborigines, which has long been about complicity with the current government.
It's not a question of left or right, it's more serious.
I'd have thought the bird would go well with the smoked hareng! <*)))))<<
It is just for numbers and to reduce wages and create housing problems, I am sure that if I were an immigrant of the second generation whose life was pleasant because my parents had come here I would have my doubts about the issue of immigration, but that is not a reason to oppose controls.
One of the most sensitive people in a BBC issue on immigration was a second generation Sikh who said she was at ease with the number of people who came in and the changes they made with them, she was associated with a Muslim man who was not of all co-operant, refusing even to give soup jokes simply because of the lady's religion, he also refused to enter her place of worship well that she had said that he was not obliged to pray.
** "who said she wasn't PAS at ease"
As we all know, if we let it go, the United Kingdom will continue to go to the right - whoever imposes limits and answers that must be admired even if it is a pub director:) So much better for you!
More to the right?
Where do you live?
If this country were more left-handed, it would be communist.
According to you, what did New Labour do, which is especially on the left?
The liberalisation of a country, the NHS of this NHS is a repetition, the massive immigration of immigrants (according to their own terms for the well-being of the right-hand side), the culture of social benefits, the age of all-permit, the right policy that kills freedom of expression.
I understand that the Labour Party is a left-wing and non-communist centre, and I have said this to be a blasphemous, what I mean is that they have socially manipulated a very high percentage of the population to make them dependent on the State.
It's typical of the left, if you want my opinion.
Leave your prepared arguments as much as you like, but what I asked you is examples of the Gaussian policy, or a left-wing program advocated by the New Labour Government.
Can you do that?
With all due respect, that's not what you asked, you asked Daniel Johnson what he thought the New Labour had done, which is particularly right.
He gave you his advice, and then you refused to accept it and changed what you asked for.
Yeah, it's more Tim Bell's territory.
So Martin Sorrell, the most powerful advertising director in the United Kingdom, associates the situation of his parents with the economic migrants who come to Britain now?
What an insult to their memory!
He was absolutely right to do so.
France to the French!
S "was beaten in 40 45 to fall into another distal, the one of the money.
We're going to make beautiful savings by turning these technocrats...
We should renegotiate the treaties.
So, renegotiations and if the word "democracy" still makes sense in Europe, should it not?
Interestingly, the Commission does not consider unfair tax competition between companies.
That must be a negligible amount.
Europe is not the solution, it is the problem...
The EU has only one objective: to make the rail transport sector fully marketable.
In the end, this means that whole bread from the French territory will no longer be served by rail.
The abandonment that has already been caused by many territories will only strengthen itself.
To sacrifice everything, including the advance of a country, in the name of the liberal dox, I didn't think it was a good idea.
The EU is a real problem that will have to deal well with one day.
Not at all.
Europe is the first institution to have both the will and the means to clarify the SNCF's accounts.
The French state has long resigned.
The regions have the impression to pay for nothing, but not the means to force the sncf to comply with its commitments.
But using public money without waste is essential for today's times when public resources are forced.
And the huge needs.
I do not see very well what the TER competition could consist of!
Does he still have a problem with alcohol?
If that's the case, shouldn't he be the leader of love?
It seems to me that you have not really managed to distinguish the problems that existed during marriage and that you are, of course, always coming to an end of pain and anger now that more than five years have passed.
Of course, having an ex-alcoholic life so close to you and having what appears to be a daily impact on your life is intense and very difficult.
That says, it would seem to me that the process of separation between your life and the complications you have inherited.
I think that's what they do, but it seems to me to be hostile.
Since you all live so close to each other and that complications seem likely to persist while new surfaces are being made, have you thought about a "fleet plan" so that you can cut between your life and your future?
Financial problems have an adverse effect, but with a compatible real estate credit company, a good lawyer and a little pressure on the court, they can be resolved.
He's got vindictive air and he's still alive.
Why not go to a family consultative group to say things openly and offer support to help him recover his work and pay the food pension.
I think that's the key.
Your life is made of much more things than the time you've spent with your ex.
Very good advice.
My advice, ask the children what they would like to do, even if it involves meeting the new woman.
Tell them that you will support their choice whatever it is.
Warn them that it will not necessarily keep his promises about contact and ask them to reflect on how this would make them feel and how they will manage disappointment if they do not keep their appointment.
Try to keep them in touch with their father.
If they see that you do this for their good, despite your own feelings because of the way he treated you, they will respect you.
They will never cease to love you and if you do all you can to facilitate a continuous parent/child relationship, they will know who to thank when they are older.
I believe that children end up understanding who is wrong if we let them see things by themselves.
Go another little effort you're close to Godwin point.
In 30 to 40 years civilization will have disappeared, the short-term economic interests are too strong, the ground pot is against the iron pot.
In addition to globalization, the country that makes at least so-called social, fiscal and environmental benefits has a competitive advantage, and others are forced to follow.
All politicians are looking for is growth, Growth.
There should be international coordination, but from here...
These are not climate-sceptics that produce C02.
It's everyone who's hot, those who use the air, those who take the plane or car, those who live in homes that it has to build, those who buy industrial products that it has to produce and transport.
These are not climate-sceptics that have shown against ecotaxes, but trucks.
No politics is climate-sceptic and Arnold S consumes much more than I do.
But no one says climateceptics emit more than CO2 than others.
Environmental defenders also move for conferences.
It is that individual actions, even if they count, will not suffice.
Political action (other sources of energy, reducing dependence on cars, etc.) is also needed.
And politicians act in part according to the sensitivities of their electorate.
"I'll be back" is in fact a famous promise by McArtur made on 11 March 1942 when he left the Philippines.
The terminator just resumed the expression.
But it can be a sense of humor to say that the expression is Terminator.
"gases for greenhouse gas are a pollutant" There are 30 definitions of the greenhouse effect, all different.
So we don't know what it is, but every good apostle of the RCA dogma seems to know what it is about.
No one knows what the greenhouse effect is?
Bingo of the Guardian: How long before someone makes the mistake of immigration?
I'm putting the blame on the crap that took all the money.
Do we count Liberian in Texas?
You're Rick Perry and I claim my $5.
I blame the mentors for the democratics.
Or the democrats' scraps.
Or the workers' liars.
We're wrong, they're responsible.
The displacement of populations could be a very real aspect of this epidemic.
Asymptomatic or subclinical cases that jump in a car or a plane to escape the epidemic need to move the infection faster than they can imagine.

Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Don't use the word immigration, you're going to scare the horses!
The United Kingdom depends on immigration to pay for all our retreats, to care for our old ones, to empty their hygienic pools, to bury 30,000 people who die every year of hypothermia or hunger, (do not forget your wool and bonnet, which allows you to warm up, to hide the heat and to eat this sandwich at cheese).
Don't be like that.
Uncontrolled and untested immigration will lead to Ebola in Europe and the rest of the world.
Is it a lie or is it not explicit?
It's more comfortable...
This is how the public money is spent to allow a small minority of individuals to spend good time in space to make forks and run around while playing clowns in front of the TV cameras.
Thus, reality television has not invented anything, and the authorities are sure to expect a baby to be designed up there to blow the world up and rip the media coverage to Western royalties who are used to the motherhoods of tabloids.
Maybe they're coming back to the ground to find that we're boxing here!
Unlike what you seem to believe, men or women are not sent into space to make cockpits or clowns, but to work.
And this work is very useful for mankind in general.
And that, in all areas.
Many things that improve our daily life are from space research.
So yes, it's the money that's spent on purpose.
You can quote one thing that improves our daily life and results from space research.
It's just a cold wave.
the white style that works the point in the air (for example to write to the ceiling)
To pay for his treatises?
To participate in the manufacture of a single useless product?
Or propose how to make more money to investors?
In short, working to work doesn't mean anything and represents the vacuum itself.
Ah if the last high tech joju.
Behind the infinite minority of individuals who go into space, there are tens of thousands of others who work to make this possible.
You know, people who take what, including more and more private companies, especially to drive the cargo to the station.
If you're going to buy a plastic gun...
But what about those who don't intend to buy plastic pistols now but who have the potential to buy it in the future?
Maybe they're the most dangerous of all.
Not because the plastic sword was a decoration in a private residence.
A plastic gun in a bank is used to try to blackmail people to make them believe it's a real gun used to commit a crime.
Plastic swords may be kitsch decorations, but nothing else.
A very dishonest article would have hurt the author/editor than to put a photo of the "spouse" in question instead of generic photos of "spouses in plastic" ?
Or even be curious enough to ask what the registration (if any) was about?
Bad typical report, we wait for the fact that "it's only a plastic sword" and not the inspired text of Judhi that is written on it.
The sword, a Zulfiqar or Dhu al-Fiqar, is one of the major symbols of the Shiite Islam.
The Dirani family, on the other hand, is a Muslim Shiite born in Afghanistan, the terrorist groups that are trying to make governments fall in Syria and Iraq are almost exclusively Sunni Muslims.
If only people stopped messing with the fact that plastic knives are harmless.
In their hands, they can be deadly.
Even the small envelopes given in the fast remains can lose the body.
Thank you very much for this information, so if it's a common decorative object, it justifies the ridicule that the author gives it.
It's not worth trying to make a "ha, ha, a plastic sword," the facts as you have mentioned actually support his argument.
I saw these decorative objects on the occasion in Muslim houses, or painted on the walls, they never had the threatening eye, just another version of a "cross".
Jesus, you're right.
And that makes all its sense now...
I saw this guy who seemed to be from the Middle East in Kebab Stop and who distributed plastic knives to anyone all night!
I love the conclusion very much.
All the amazing innovations, often technologically, give many people the idea that it is a right and a need to benefit from it, but they have an immediate and worse cost, a high cost (subscription, electricity consumption) that is in the budgets.
And the impossibility of taking advantage of new technologies creates frustration.
For example, invoke the Energy Solidarity Pact, which allows to isolate the furniture of a house for 1€ symbolically when it is inhabited by a modest household (the cost of the work is actually borne by energy suppliers!).
Simple but not known even if more than 3,000 houses were thus isolated this year!
Interesting about this PES.
But I never heard of it.
Who can make a call and how does it work?
for information 60 million consumers, test water-economy showers and recommend placing water-economy equipment on taps and toilets.
The study shows that a family of 4 can reduce its water bill by 30% (from 150 m3 /year to 100 m3) or 50 m3 of the water economy per year, while maintaining the same comfort.
It is not a crisis of demand, it is a crisis of the system that can no longer produce enough surplus (which would then have been redistributiond in the form of income increase in real terms) so that these surpluses pay the increase of the expenditures you grade in the category of "compulsory expenditures".
In other words, energy caution is "just" the reverse of the medal because the economy can no longer grow as fast as it would like.
Note that the (neo-)classical theory of the economy is completely unable to answer such a question, because for it, there is no intrinsic limit to economic growth, and there is no element that can force, increasingly decades after decades, the pace of economic growth.
By its very definition (in physics), energy is what allows for any physical transformation.
As production is essentially transforming, energy is a means of achieving the least economic output (good or service).
And the more you want to produce, the more energy you need.
This means that any increase in energy efficiency (inaccurately called "energy production"), even in the form of an increase in its price, forces production in turn (except for improving energy efficiency, but improving energy efficiency still requires heavy investments, which are not profitable if energy is not sufficiently expensive).
In short, there is a very strong link between energy precautions and the fact that we arrive, or not, to increase the "production" of expensive energy.
And the data published very officially, for example by the International Energy Agency, shows that the situation will only worsen over the years and decades to come (the AIE, in these recent reports, clearly indicates that the end of the production of conventional oil was achieved in 2008 and that oil was not expensive.
But oil is the most universal form of energy, due to its very strong density of energy, its ease of transport and handling and storage, its range of possible uses, etc.)
Three points, good work whatever performance.
It was a good performance in Germany and nothing has been brought back so it equals things.
Take this to France!
Vote No 18.
Are you a Webmaster of the Guardian?
As noted earlier: It's good to win.
It's good to win.
Well, it's a good job for the guys.
Although many English people like to mock the Scottish when they do nothing but lose, there is nothing to say, they bring a little color to the tournaments when they get to qualify, at least until they get rid of themselves in the first round.
It is even more rigid if we play against them;)
England's starting to worry me.
Because, now that the Golden Shige Generation withdraws, they may have a decent team with all these young people.
Ferdinand, D.
Betty, Joe Cole and David Seamen back in the early XI, why change a team that wins?
The only English footballer who, in my humble opinion, has really been an "international class", is David Beckham, a bit embellished, maybe, but I think if he hit a potato in excess like me, he would totally crush me.
People forget their athletic constitution, by the way, talking about athletic constitution in sports, Wayne Rowey...?
I don't ever laugh at the Scotch.
I tend to surprise myself by observing their warm colors with nostalgia at the end of the evening...
The only English footballer who, in my humble opinion, has really been "international class", is David Beckham
Yes, people often seem to forget that he was a very good player at best.
Juppe would be wrong to ask for EUR 100000 for a conference in South Korea.
And I don't think he'd get them if he asked them...
You mean people come to get a good shot?
For the rest, I'd be surprised to learn that B Debre, for example, only lives on his fellow Members' allowances...
I would like to ask myself, in particular, what he can tell me at his conferences.
How to reduce its deficit?
How to get back to full employment?
I would say that no serious lecturer of scientific discipline, whatever its scientific level, even if he is the holder of a Nobel prize, will not consider asking for the minimum amount.
Conferences with content are most of the time free or almost free.
And I can assure you that these young people really work and that the results presented in their free conferences are real.
At the time of restrictions on the research budget, the reporting of these two figures is strong.
Researchers' conferences are even paid by the lab!!!
That's what I'm saying.
It's all clear to me.
They look at the sun.
So N Sarkozy is a representative of the ethics of the UMP
Do I feel like we blame him for making money???
I'm far from being one of his fans, but we blame him for having a bad (or fraudulent) campaign to manage his OK.
But making conferences seems to me to be a legitimate activity.
To add to Nina's comment, let's remember that her movements are taken care of by taxpayers.
Rule 1 of epidemiology: isolate.
All U.S. and British flights to or from Africa should have been suspended a few weeks ago.
Human life is more important than proper politics.
It is present in Spain, GB, Texas and elsewhere.
What density of infection in the population is it that politicians will resolve to make the right decision?
So if I want to go from Africa to the United Kingdom, I take the plane for Spain, and then I take a plane from Spain to the United Kingdom.
If Ebola invades West Africa, I see them banning all flights and ships in the direction of the United Kingdom.
We'd always need to send some goods that says...
What a shame international media panic about Ebola is no longer used to talk about less spectacular but more deadly health crises affecting West Africans.
We're all threatened.
In every corner of the world, men and women. It's such a sad story, such a big title.
I could read each paragraph and replace the word Men in other contexts (as well as relevant): Women are the first caregivers - read - Men travel from one community to another, etc.
Such smarter comments could have been made on the ways, reasons and places where we can all contribute to a better understanding and interpretation of cultural and sociological approaches, and differences in the role of sex that could help to combat Ebola in West Africa.
Come on, let's think about it and write, we're not happy to make noise.
There's a moment for everything.
If you are not able to offer a good analysis and an intelligent opinion, maybe you should just think before writing?
Although I would place female genital mutilation on the same rank as decapitation - a form of terrorism as well as barbaric, its survival rate by making only a different form of torture - says that its temporary suspension is a "light of hope" exceeds the understanding.
In fact, I see that the contributor is from Sierra Leone, which can give a certain degree of "validity" to his opinion, but in this case, it certainly does not give a better perspective than that of a middle activist in the street.
And I believed that the Guardian was "killing" as a world resource of journalism - moving forward in the 21st century, leaving its foundational precepts.
Who, in the editorial team, let this show up?
For a territorial or other election, the money does not count.
I constantly read that the territorial public service is increasing its staff, and I have never seen an article giving them the word or trying to explain why.
It would be legitimate, indeed.
There will surely be lies and truths to separate us from the good seed of the Jew.
The court of accounts costs so much to tell so many economic nuisances.
It's true that they've never had anything to do with the people on the Cambodian Street.
ICTs are not in deficits, they have funding needs that can only concern investment.
A force to use too smooth concepts of the press as the World makes the game of all obscurants.
Debt benefits as it finances investment, collective property
Unfortunately, the debt financing is mainly operating costs...
And as the redundancy of officials (for example, to make beautiful rounds) leads to a growing and uncompromising burden (compulsory burden until their death, as working life + retirement), these communities cut in investment.
It is therefore necessary to delete the staff member's status, in advance of the decrease in staffing.
And also to take responsibility for the mayors financially.
It is amazing that the intercoms would be accompanied by a decrease in the community's staff, and that is the opposite, proving that adding a scale is not effective without the removal of the others.
How do you want to manage large territories as well as cocoa at the time of the TGV and the car?
The time of the horse where these territories were created is revolutionized, it might be time to react.
They would not prefer to remain in prison, the worst incarcerated, in the administrative framework, would it be paraitary!
Let's try even garrothed, it's not too strong to explain the blocking situation that Veme's condition has led to with its Providential men.
It really started with Peter.
Then he went on to get to the series "at the end of the breath" coming up with a strong point.
Why won't they live in an apartment of $250 million in Monaco over a movie to leave all this suffering behind them?
Europe is also built on a cemetery, it will be a long and difficult process.
When will these people learn to take care of themselves?
Don't even try the answers of the kind "it's the fault of the whites".
"response" does not "response"
I sincerely hope it's sarcasm.
It was in my previous post, in case it wasn't obvious enough.
That's what happens when we hurry to be the first.
Whether it's sarcasm or not, there's an argument to be made.
It is now agreed that the modern Homo Sapiens evolved in North-East Africa about 200 thousand years ago, and during a particularly wet period about 150 thousand years ago they managed to travel to the North to the Middle East, and the rest (or at least eight thousand years) is part of history.
The current Minister of Defence had stated a few months ago that no military hospital would stop.
So he lied.
It was no doubt the only government that seemed to keep the road.
Now we know we can't trust him anymore.
Debate!
in 2017:Transformation in a comfortable special hotel of golden plaques for future portraits of the Republic?
Move to Bercy on the floor?
Very good decision: the Val-de-Grace was a symbol of the past, a medicine for Nantis and their families, the care "Grand V" of a 3-speed medicine.
We're going to save money, and the soldiers are going to take care of the last one elsewhere...
Do you know that 70% of the patients are civilians, all horizons?
The London Wasps?
I'm sorry about their fans that are based on Wycombe/London.
Like the London Irish and the London Welsh?
They left the " London" last season.
It's just the Wasps now.
A french of any other name...
At least they're going to Los Angeles, right?
It changes that a football team uses the ground of a rugby club instead of the reverse.
In addition, the external movements for Tigers and Saints will be much easier.
No, it doesn't change anything.
At Stockport County, we had the evil to be bought by the Sharks Chambers, and we ended up renting our own stage with them once we found our independence.
I was going to say the same thing.
The way they insisted on training in the field, although they had access to other places, has not done us any favors.
I love supporting Coventry City.
The good news doesn't stop.
There's always the possibility of a United Coventry now.
It must be frustrating for a team that doesn't have a bad support team that was up to the top for more than 30 years, to see its stage over and over again by a rugby club.
I'm aware of the recent issues of the CCFC, but that must be a good guess.
For me, I'm not the club rupby, and to be honest, I don't know anyone who does it except for a few Wasps fans at work.
They and a few thousand other people in the South-East will probably follow them from a distance, or will they now have to support another team?
Nice pro-domo article and good vulgarization.
But who cares?
But then why aren't all computer systems based on these concepts??????
+because there is a huge mass of programs pre-existing (cobol, java), +because all systems don't need them, +because there's no magic baguette ++....
And because for most computer systems, bugs are not really important, what counts is to be the first on the segment.

But they're making us sell.
Real time IT has become a key sector in many areas, and few are those who know the intimate details of these processes.
15 years ago, I didn't go to an Olive Garden.
The quality-price ratio has fallen.
I'm sorry for those who're going to lose their job, but it's better than closing the box.
I would recommend a simpler menu with choices that are known to be popular.
Reduce costs and prices.
There is already too much salt in our diets.
Don't ask Olive Garden not to put salt in the future.
They seem to reason with more profit-making, and not healthier dishes and the best quality-price ratio.
They're taking us for pills.
Oh, yeah, be careful people didn't have too much grass.
And then let's make our soup by someone else, it's better when it's industrial.
Make sure there's a lot of salt in there, it replaces the real ingredients.
It would be good to add a little sodium glutamate as well.
The amount of salt you need to add to the water of the pasta is negligible, but this greatly benefits the taste of the finished product.
It is not only the taste of salt, it also affects the way the fat is cooked.
The finished product is so much better.
Without salt, there's no food.
Everyone should try alternatives to the business kitchen.
Are there family restaurants and are they offering delicious meals at reasonable prices?
What is happening in the United States is very sad.
An accident at work that's gone wrong.
A promising young man, learned to steal, followed his father’s career in prison for murder.
A man has all suffocated and has brutally interrupted this vocation of birth.
If he is sentenced to 10 years in prison, he seems to be the least.
Where else is he?
All right!
What a humour!
The desire to decide is obvious and difficult to excuse and blame at all times...
The desire to decide is, indeed, difficult.
That's what makes me have some sympathy for a 15-year-old boy.
During the trial, the father of the boy complained that he would never see his son again, but without asking for forgiveness from his friends of the type he himself killed.
Who's really the victim in this story?
What do you come to mix everything!!!?
The boy's father was convicted for what he did.
With regard to the connery of lost balls, the accused and guilty, he knew quite well that the balls were dangerous.
The guy didn't do anything to the accused!
So let him pay for the crime he is responsible for!
10 years, it's a little much in my opinion.
For having the intelligence to pull this young man to make noise?
Actually, that's the noise!
If the opportunity arises, take a vacation in the Mosul Valley and sleep in the B&B of one of the small winemakers.
This is twice what I do, wine, landscape and food are excellent.
Moreover, if you are there during one of the many wine festivals held in each municipality, it is even better.
I'm sorry, the Moselle Valley, I've tapped too fast.
It's nice to see that the German wine is recognized.
Rather important, German grapes traditionally use only one variety of grapes, which means that they really need to brush hard to preserve a certain quality.
Of course, some young generations experience different grapes, such as in France, Italy, etc.
There is not only the region of the Moselle that must be recommended - France, the Palatinate Rénan (Pfalz), Baden deserve to be visited.
A French region of interest is Alsace, which is like a mix between Germany and France.
The wines are German-style (or maybe it's the reverse, short).
The Germans prefer beer.
Traditionally, they drink the wine after the meal.
Knowing the popularity of dry whites during the meal, they now propose much, and with a much higher alcohol content than their preferred 9 degrees.
But their traditional wines put in bottle at the property are so complex, the sweetness is super balanced.
Try Schloss Vollrad's spatle with a thermodor lobster next time you go to the rest.
Search Hallgarten online for a good selection.
I used them when I had my restaurant.
Hugh Johnston's World Atlas of Wine is a great guide, beautifully illustrated.
I understand that there will be new readers of the Guardian who discover the wine, but this is a feature of each newspaper article on German wine since the night of time.
From time to time, there is an article on the German wines that are coming, the new Baden dry ones that are now going to accompany the dishes, the reds that are amazingly strong, but above all, it is not these Liebfraumilch that people were eating when they were young (heu, I don't really think it's always true or vocator, unless I address me to the more than 40 years - which, as I say, will have seen all this already).
Closing the Val de Grace would be an enormous mistake and an illustration of the sad state in which the French Administration is located.
A crime against Louis XIV and a spear in the foot of my grandfather's back and my grand uncle's back who did their studies there.
In democracy, public health management should be submitted to the vote of the House of Deputies: these ministerial chamallies, which are held by the barbichette, and these decisions made at home, have become unsustainable.
Sorbograin is right.
It should be done as in Soleil Vert: euthanasia at 70 years of age.
Furthermore, we could resell the meat that will feed our poor active (sic) as they can no longer go to the market.
In fact, find work for our unemployed, real work, and you will have no more deficit problems!
For older people, it is time to pay a little more because national solidarity is no longer able to provide...
Assets, by way of disappearance, will not be able to keep only this demographic transition...
So of the geriatrics, of course, but to think otherwise than a hospital model of the 30 glories.
Now, the maximum growth to 1.5% (this is already the case for 30 years) for the next 50 years will force us to rethink all the model defined after war!
Val de Grace is the symbol of excellence in medical matters in France: a certain rigour and discipline that we knew more in public hospitals.
If that symbol falls, we're really fucked.
First we're fucked because the rest of the hospitals aren't high.
The scandal is that the presidents and other elites are taking care of other than the public hospital.
The solution is more in increasing public service in hospitals than maintaining a two-speed medicine.
The Val is a pole of French medical excellence, and of course a symbol.
The closing would be a mistake, a sign of more going to France's mediocrit.
Not to mention military status, which must be preserved absolutely.
"The Hospitalization Day Award", a hospital management unit, is decided by the department with local supervision of the Regional Hospitalization Agencies.
The abolition of our nation continues.
Finally, I mean, of course the baby is just one of those economic refugees, he came to Australia to have a better paid job than he had at home.
In almost all countries around the world, a child born in that country of two non-citizens is almost always non-citizen.
Australia goes further than most countries by giving birth to children born to Australian citizens.
But it is Australia that is criticised because it does not meet some remarkable standards, with obvious difficult consequences.
Why??
This seems to me to make two weights two measures.
Send Abbott to the Middle East, Pakistan, Sri Lanka to put an end to all the persecution and ill-treatment and war that make the people of their country flee and force them to seek help in Australia.
If he does not want people to come by ship, then the problem with this traffic must be solved.
I have nothing to complain about my life in Sri Lanka today.
The civil war lasted 26 years, tens of thousands died on both sides.
That's what happens during civil wars.
However, the war ended 6 years ago and the country returned to normal.
Everything makes sense now, nimrod...!
Strange that British Prime Minister David Cameron didn't believe this little superhero when he was in Sri Lanka with Mr. Abbott...
Cameron denounced the war crimes and ill-treatment that were still taking place.
Several European countries have since suspended the deportations of Tamouls with links to LTTEs, thinking that they would be at risk of torture on their return.
UNHCR revised its asylum application assessment guidelines in December 2012, and recommended that people with LTTE links be considered at risk at their return.
The year [2013] saw a rise in attacks by Buddhist militant groups against Hindus and Muslims.
The elections for three provincial councils took place in September.
Too late, boys!
Mr. Nowak, you've had your coke so regular.
A fact, this guy couldn't get even a chance to make it.
He didn't have a health insurance in the States?
So he would have had to give any treatment.
I would like to know who is going to pay for the medical expenses during his stay in the hospital.
The city of Dallas perhaps, unless some lab pay for the purchase of the body?
In the US, the rule is cash first, help come later.
Specially in Texas
Ah ah ah!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
We were told that the Ebola killed so quickly that a large-scale epidemic was impossible (there is all scientific literature on the issue, with models and everything).
We were then told that the risk of contagion of returnees was zero.
The more we get, the more I'm scared.
You need to read some newspaper jokes to believe that a risk can be zero.
Low or three low but not zero.
Finally, c is a scientific reality, more a virus is deadly quickly (generally) less likely to spread because the host's death signifies its own death.
The combination of 2 (high transmission and rapid death) sometimes comes from the Spanish flu.
After c is the general quarantine to save humanity. . . .
There is nothing to be overlooked about the promotion of Western media of certain brave and vertebrates, but to the detriment of thousands of other African patients who knew neither the trade nor the bravery or the vertebrates?
Of course, this highlights the action of NGOs and encourages them to help, but the repetition of the ads is a frightening partisan.
Freedom of expression, so much loved by the conservatives.
The suspension was to keep the doctors under control.
I wonder how many doctors voted for Newman and Abbott, brothers of weapons attacking freedom of expression and the right to the private life of Australians.
I bet they never imagined that their conservative sinners would have deprived them of their rights to freedom of expression.
I wonder how many doctors voted for Newman and Abbott,
I bet there's someone who won't do it next time.
Yes, that is exactly what we need right now, less health professionals available during a potential health crisis.
A heat tour for when the problem really becomes out of control.
There are already not enough doctors working in the regions around Australia like this.
Tony Abbott's refusal to take part in the "war" against Ebola illustrates his philosophy about medical challenges.
Joe Hockey's plan for a new term market fund for medical research, which is expected to reach $20 billion by 2020, would probably only be a black budget emergency box.
Using the pretext of the noble medical research, he will collect $20 billion and, at a later date, transfer these funds as general income.
I hope that Australian voters come to see this excellent Russian for what it is.
Tony Abbott is much smarter than we want to believe it.
He explains that the sale of Medibank Private is compensated by the Markets Fund for Medical Research.
However, it is a loss for the sick, a loss for the elderly and a loss for the poor.
It may be very intelligent, but it's not fair.
Finally, he had excellent tutors for the "danger" and his Telstra Markets Fund.
If that's not fair, then we'll show Abbott who's smart.
Send him to hell to the next election.
The most terrible thing for Nadine is still the "old personality", happy....
I also noticed it, quite corrosive as a remark.
If only she could discourage her from keeping a noise on her constantly..
The worst fate for a political end of the career: not to be recognized in the street.
Hello She was not recognized in her town of Toul as being high enough to administer it.
What a good "provincial" sense!
We're living an odious time, Mrs. Morano.
I'm sure I'm against the port of the burqa, but that's not the point.
What this anecdote relates is sarcosis to the pure state: of minors with rank of ministers, confusion between the government's function and the executive function (if Sarkozy could have it with his tonfa on each accent of the road to show that he is well-guarded of the public order), the greatness and incompetence of their maximum degree.
I propose that the right to Morano, Sarkozy and all these "former personalities" be granted the right to wear a firearm and a sign, which would thus have allowed them to exercise their self-proclaimed role as judges.
But who's Nadine Romano?
It is indeed the main teaching of the case: even the police have turned the Sarkozy page, perhaps they do not regret it.
He really needs to stop before it becomes a trap for him.
I'm sending this agent who ignored the existence of Nadine Morano, if only I could do the same...
like bob, for the time being
No, thanks to her, you're doing well...!
Nadine, if she didn't exist, she'd have to invent it!
It's easy, though, it looks like Christine Boutin with a blonde wig.
On this occasion, N.
Morano obviously made in the contempt, in the contempt of the police officer she had in front of her, and who would certainly have had to multiply the corbets and the "Yes, ma'am, of course, ma'am, immediately, tell me, Madam, in which direction I must run to seize me without waiting for this elected woman."
"In one case, the Australian Super Hornets abandoned an air attack on a target of Isis when the risk of killing civilians became too important... ".
The Americans are not bad at this, but I still think that Isis is going to exceed or have already done it, in Iraq at least someone was counting the bodies now no one is doing it.
As for civil deaths at the industrial level, nothing is rivaled with the West War machine.
I do not agree that the sanctions imposed by the United Nations (including non-Western) between the two wars of Iraq would have cost millions of Iraqis, especially children, elderly persons and vulnerable adults.
Most of the anti-war demonstrators I knew would prefer sanctions to the removal of the "war machine".
Were you also the kind of guy who would prefer sanctions to the order and men on the ground?
Very good remarks - the United Nations has acted incredibly hard and inconceivable ways over the past few years.
Penalties are generally ineffective and cannot reach the elite - no doubt a reason why they have the occasional approval of the so-called Security Council.
You may remember that the insurgents did not waste time marking their main enemy when they saw it in the recent war in Iraq.
It was the attack on the UN Mission's QG that they had raised just five days earlier in Baghdad in 2003.
They hit this place with strength and twice, and I imagine with satisfaction and cold blood.
So brutal and hard this bombing, I was surprised by the shock of people to know that a United Nations mission had been targeted like this.
Well, I actually forgot that.
So add a half million people to the total number of deaths of Western nations (at least with recent problems in Ukraine, economic activity was directed directly to the people they intended to hurt).
This only helps your argument to exacerbate significantly untrustworthy statistics.
The only reliable figures on sanctions-related deaths are children under 5 and they are even very suspicious as Saddam Hussain refused to let objective inspectors know the facts.
It was, of course, in his interest to exacerbate the negative effects of sanctions.
The most reliable estimate is that the number of additional deaths for this age group is between 200,000 and 400,000, but no one really knows.
As for additional deaths in other age groups, estimates are no better than assumptions.
Since the number of pre-sanctions deaths in less than five years was about 10 times worse than in the United Kingdom, for example, it is possible that the number of post-sanctions deaths may be largely partial to this age group.
Of course you have to fear it, but also the gift of jokes in general.
It must be stopped to do as if people were pure minds, that love was all that children needed, and that we could do it with strangers that neither parent nor child will ever know, without consequences for them.
One of our founding myths is Oedipus, 60% of the French are from geology.
It is an essential and neglected thing to know its origins.
Instead of acting as if it were obvious and using fantasy arguments, we should explain what serious problems can arise for a child who is adopted or conceived with a gift of jokes.
If you learn that the parents who raised you didn't provide the jokes you've come out of, you could give it back to me, because they wouldn't commit any crime.
The latest advances in LDCs (e.g. uterine grafts) are at least as controversial as a reasonably framed GPA.
The real question seems to me to be: the frustration of the desire for children justifies these acrobatics and this has nothing to do with marriage for all.
Very just as a point.
Of course, we need to be afraid of the GPA, which is what this stupid question is.
Of course, it's sad that we can't have children when we want them.
It's a problem I've had with my wife.
However, it is less serious than being very disabled or becoming, contracting a serious illness, losing all of his children in an accident, etc.
Of all the concerns of life, this is not the most serious.
It's a frustration among many others.
That doesn't stop living.
And we can always take care of the children of others!
In a society that no longer supports any form of frustration, where the child becomes well-consumed, the GPA is unacceptable to me.
The desire of a child is not a trap where the other can be used according to his or her wishes.
Sterilty requires reflection and acceptance.
