Munich 1856: Four maps that change your view of the city
An Irish institution where young people should meet today.
A cavern, where it is now dug for the S-Bahn tunnel.
Kleiningärtners manage the root cause of farmers.
The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories for days.
It's nervous if the maps aren't up to date.
Everyone knew this, who had to get excited, because the car-ship instead of an surrounding road showed a green grass.
The historical maps of the digital Bayern-Atlase, an offer of the Geoportal Bayern of the government, are all different than current - but that is why it is very clear.
Especially when comparing it with current online cards.
Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities have changed in the München Merkur distribution area since the 19th century.
The digital Bayern-Atlas is a flashing carpet that is not recognized as such.
In the large map, more detailed maps for cities and municipalities, called Urposition Sheets, were included.
These were created according to data from the Bavarian measurement administration between 1810 and 1864 and originated from the first measurement Bayerns.
Your order: Napoleon.
The French army leader occupied Bayern since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.
Napoleon wished to have an overview of the occupied country and gave a topographical recording of Bayerns in order - of course for military purposes.
Even if the French troops finally withdrew with the peace of Lunéville on February 9, 1801: It was the present neighbors who created the idea of a flat-covered Bavarian map.
Kurfürst Max IV. Joseph moved on to the project, founded the "Topographic Bureau" - and thus the Bavarian Measurement Management.
The Urposition Sheet for Munich is from 1856 and is like all others on the website of the Bavarian Landesbibliothek.
The comparison of early today is the most impressive example of the capital.
The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.
An example of this is Sensing, which is still relatively isolated in the map of 1856.
Sendling was sent 21 years after the map was created, in 1877, when Munich was a district.
Today we are sending in the middle of the city.
The Houses of Disseminations focus around 1856 along the modern Plinganserstraße, which was first named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the rebellion of the Bavarian farmers against Austria 1705.
Where the Westpark is today, nothing is seen as a field - at the first glance: In the zoom of a small map with dozens of lines and numbers: handwrittenly numbered floats from the so-called "reception", from which the basic tax has been deducted.
There are no farmers there today - but small farmers of the plant "Land in the Sun".
A large green area is marked north by subsending.
The Theresienwiese, since 1810, was actually still a grass - and no concrete desert in the 19th century.
On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.
In the Urpositionsblatt you can read not only the street name "at the gasteig" or the height "at the air" - but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt".
Yes, here on the Auerfeldstraße, people were once locked up with vague ideas.
There the Munich Kreis-Irrenanstalt "On the Auer Lüften" was created in 1858/59.
From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden led the institution - the psychiatrist, who is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwigs II.
"He was progressive for his time and ended, for example, the commission of the so-called Irres.
He has also prevented staff from resorting to violence against the authorities," says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Hiyaussen Museum, who has been involved in an exhibition with the institution.
For 280 patients, there was first room, and then it was extended to 500 places.
At some point, this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the circuit assembly in Haar 1905.
Since 2006, the Isar-Amper clinic in Munich-Ost is one of Germany's largest psychiatrists.
On the area of the former Auer Anstalt, young people in Munich now meet in Salesianum.
The order acquired the building complex in 1920 and turned it into a youth home with training companies.
Westlich is the football site of the TSV Munich East, east of the 1980s.
In 2015, the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" was built - in architectural application to the construction of the Irrenanstalt, which was destroyed in the Second World War in bomb attacks.
The Marienplatz was listed as the main square in 1856, which was known as the Kaufinger Gasse.
A decisive change brought about the Second World War also in the heart of Munich.
The bombs of the Allied giants rose in December 1944 many holes in the city center.
A big one remained to this day - at the Marienhof.
The English Institute, a small business house and a middle-aged mining chapel were once at the Marienhof, where these days the preparations and on April 5, 2017 the spatenstich were held for the second S-Bahn family line.
With the slide rule, the old Munich map can be compared to the air picture of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.
Citizens' rights group published travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Promotion of Colorings has issued a warning for colouring people who travel to Missouri due to discriminatory policies and racist attacks by the State.
"The NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, which is due to enter into force by 28 August 2017, calls on African-American travellers, visitors and Missouriians to pay particular attention to travel by the State and to be given extreme caution, as a number of highly respected, racially-based incidents have recently occurred and are observed in the entire state," the Group's opinion says.
A recently adopted Missouri law, which makes it harder for people to overcome discrimination, as well as the criminal prosecution authorities of the State, who aim disproportionately at minorities, have encouraged the group to issue the travel warning, the NAACP said.
"They have violations of citizens' rights that happen to people.
They are stopped because of their skin color, they are killed or killed," said the President of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, Kansas City Star.
"We hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not yet heard."
It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the United States.
The group quoted events such as racist acts against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died under dubious circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no fuel during the trip by the State and was taken into custody by the police of Missouri without being charged with a crime.
The Council also points to a recently published report from the Office of the Advocate General of Missouri showing that black drivers in the state are kept 75 percent more than white.
"The recommendation is that people are conscious and inform their families, friends and employees about what could happen in Missouri," said Chapel.
"People must be willing to bring bail money or let their relatives know that they are travelling through the state."
Missouri reported 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime report programme, which classified the State in relation to the number of such violations to the 16th grade of the country.
Travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it harder to challenge a company because of housing or employment discrimination.
Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona, after the States had passed immigration laws, which obliged local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for immigration violations, which, in the opinion of the ACLU, would contribute to further racial profiling.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but in recent years interest groups have used the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the United States.
Wi-Fi project is an element
The Fischerbacher Weidezaun project is a success project and will continue next year.
The CDU agents Peter White and Kordula Kovac have taken a picture on site.
At the Court of Justice of the Schwedemann family, representatives of the Fisherbacher CDU Association met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two MPs.
Markus Schwendemann first provided insights into his operation, where he manages 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, provides 40 dairy cows and also many young animals and accommodates guests in five apartments.
The "Schwarzwaldmilk" is for him the alternative marketing route for the milk of his cows, such as Schwendermann.
On the table of the guests, only regionales come.
Since he is also BLHV president of Fischerbach, he called the Weidezaun project "important".
I can't win on such steep surfaces.
The green area ensures a lot of work, a lot needs to be done with the engine.
"We have to fight here with the conditions and with the topography," said Schwendemann.
In 2003, he took over the parent company and managed this without chemical plant protection and fertilisers, even if he did not carry on a biobusiness.
For Mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear: "The municipality has recognized the importance of the breeding project and is happy about the leadership".
At the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare, farmers had to be supported.
It is hoped that this could lead to further removal of the surface for a long time.
"The greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how to continue their operations," the mayor stressed.
Farmers are often criticized for promoting
In 2013, a total of 25 parcels of eleven participants were involved.
The opening area shall therefore be 40 hectares, which shall not be opened until 2023.
Of the total cost of 71,500 euros, half was supported over Leader, a quarter was carried by the community of Fischerbach.
The farmers thus stayed in 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of weidezaun.
"The great advantage is the longevity of the columns," explained Schwedenmann.
Kordula Kovac stressed: "You do a really good job without farmers and farmers."
Peter White also stated: "The best foods are produced here."
The Landschaftspleflegerichtline (LPR) Baden-Württemberg enables the public support of Weidezäunen.
The target is the discovery of the Black Forest.
Predominantly, the presence of a fund-raiser named by the LPR.
In addition, the area to be joined must not be flammable (over 35 per cent suspension) and must therefore be threatened by the explosion.
For the Fischerbacher Weidezaun project 2018, there are currently eight participants with 24 parcels who want to build just 16 kilometres of Zaun.
The opening area corresponds to 35 hectares, the calculated cost is over EUR 112,000.
Is nothing more sacred?
Now the White House of Trump takes over the status of freedom
The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.
The Americans appreciate these as much as anyone else - therefore the carefully designed storm Saddam Husseins at the Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he was doing when he took a symbolic accent in a heated dispute with Jim Acosta of CNN on the President's proposals for a drastic restriction of legal immigration with the status of freedom.
To stay fair, Miller did not attack the statue itself.
A horde of boat owners and Liberty immitators would have hurt him if he had done it.
But he took on its significance, and in particular the meaning attached to it when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to its base.
As Miller Acosta complained, "I don't want to go into a complete story here, but the state of freedom is ... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.
The mind to which you refer, which was later added and is not part of the original state of freedom."
Miller is really right, but as he himself formulated it, it's not really about history.
It is about the contemporary resonance on the stirring words of Lazarus, the only one in which a state introduces not only any old immigrants, but the poor of the poor: "Your fatigues, your arms, / your troubled masses, who then seem to be breathing freely, / the sad waste of your rich coasts."
There was never a time when the "lending waste" was better seen on our screens.
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people in Trumps USA were not welcome.
This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural conflict: in fact it is a conflict about the importance of America.
Lazarus - and her friends who used to place their words at the base after their death - knew very well that they were carrying out a high-political action.
The sculpture should show the links between French and American Republicanism by representing the female body of freedom in a depleted classical imagery.
Lazarus changed this meaning: In her mind the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.
And they have a completely different name: the mother of the exiles.
The connection of the poem to the picture is a brilliant feminist coup and a dominant attack on American Nativism.
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, people from the right wing wanted to change this for a long time.
The great shriek Rush Limbuugh, a species of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Freedom did not invite anyone, but rather was an early neoconservative that brings the American flame into the uninhabited world: "Lady Liberty goes ahead.
It is intended to carry the factor of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world.
The fact is not to light the way to the United States."
It's quite unusual that Limbaugh has been hit on something here.
The importance of the statue is quite a question of the position of perception.
The great fantastic fact of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted, sad but hopeful people after long and often terrible voyages on the decks of ships.
It is in the real sense to see the world from the perspective of people looking for refuge and an opportunity to improve their lives.
Her statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome that they must hear.
And of course, that's not the perspective that Miller and Trump would ever like to recognize.
Her spells should not illuminate the way, but expose the hatred that is the only source of power.
World Championship 2017: Neil Black commends Scottish members of the UK team
Elidh Doyle remembers a time when only two shots belonged to the team of Great Britain
The executive director of the United Kingdom's Light Athletics, Neil Black, says that the 16-headed Scottish contingent in the world championship box "will make a massive contribution to the team".
A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017, which starts on Friday.
Black believes that "Schotland develops something special" and that the UK's light athletics need to learn something about it.
"We welcome it, and we try to understand it, and we will continue it until we find out," Black said.
"I speak to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done.
The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they've done.
British Light Athletics: It has something to do with what they have done.
And also with the guy on the street.
Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant."
Several of the Scottish athletes are medalists, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who are being attacked against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track, while Elid Doyle was elected from the team to the team captain.
"Eilid is quite modest.
Your captain's speech was incredible," says Black.
"A number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they were living or training, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.
The passion and the real feeling that Eilid brought in of course were great."
The Commonwealth Silver Medal winner, who will take place at the 400-m watch during his fifth World Championships, says that it is "incredulous" that 16 shots are in the British team.
So far, Scotland's best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven, which were reached in 1983 and 2015.
The centre runner Muir is leading this way and has set up five British and two European records last year.
It will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m running.
Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another shot that you should observe after a great season that included the victory of the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers her first world championships when the only other shot in the team was Lee McConnell.
The captain of the team says that she's "extremely proud" of the fact that many of her countrymen are not only part of the team, but in some cases they will be involved in the medals and the finals.
"The special thing about being a team captain is that she was elected by the other members of the team, so it was a great honor anyway, but knowing that my teammates voted for me and chose me, it makes something very special for me," she added.
"I'm obviously very proud of all the shots that belong to the team.
It only shows how far we have come.
And they're here as established athletes, athletes who want to climb the podium.
What about my speech as a captain?
Yeah, I think she went well.
I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation because we have a home world championship.
So it is really important to put on this home support and benefit from being back at the Olympic Stadium.
I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it'll just be such a great atmosphere out there."
Blocking critics on Facebook: Do not apply for a public office if you can't hire voters
Our country's father knew something about bad news.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it did not last long until the newspapers beat him for everything, from internal politics to his political principles.
He cheated on the criticism, sure.
But he did not bring his critics to silence.
Because in 1783 Washington said, "Freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and stupid, we will be led like the sheep to battle."
This brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work on being more like Washington.
Hogan's employees blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.
And that's why the American Civil Liberties Union called on him this week.
The Governor's staff solved the complaint as a free move, and the online comment was full of a counter-reaction with "Na, and?" .
"It's just Facebook," many people said.
But it's important.
And it's especially important when it's a guy like Hogan.
This is a Republican Governor in an overwhelming democratic state, which is amazingly popular.
He has the highest agreement of the 50 governors of the nation.
Hogan's not a reactionary hothead.
He has shown a firm hand in guiding his country and strict compliance with the principles.
He was also very willing to use Facebook as the primary means to connect with his voters and play his hairless head after chemotherapy on his side.
Therefore, the blocking of persons coming to the governor's side - which is a public forum, which is officially designated and by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan's spokesman Amelia Chase defended the governor's actions and argued that the blocking of the comments was nothing more than a moderation.
But it's too easy to use the picture of trolls or spammers or hazelnuts that are pushing the peitscha online.
The post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And they are only real people who speak to their chosen leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur, and a pastor, no troll.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profan.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan’s Catholic faith.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not filled with hate, but she asked for hatred.
"I respectfully commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news," she wrote in the commentary section of the message "The Post".
"I don't appreciate this idea either, if a number of people take a position on the same subject, they will be ignored by some rather than by so-called collective use and not by a large group of affected citizens."
What the governor's employees called "concentrated spam attack" would probably be called "pre-language".
The Facebook era makes it easy to add a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It is much cleaner than before, if you had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn papers with critical leads or to arrest demonstrators and bring them to silence.
But that's exactly what happens to digital.
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticized for slandering Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is declared by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed.
One of the first milestones in this question was last week in Virginia.
The president of the Board of Supervisors of Louduun County violated the first amendment, according to U.S. District Director James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banned a voter from her Facebook page.
And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be that hard.
At the time of Washington, the time of the affordable port had a similar effect as the Internet.
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous writers applied to his leadership.
And even then Washington had an anonymous trolle.
People who used pseudonyms like "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius" and "Portius", wrote all letters to newspapers that undermine Washington's decisions.
Petitions, which criticised his position on the Treaty of Amity, trade and shipping with the United Kingdom, violated his office, according to the historical documents collected by the online papers of the George Washington Project.
But he didn't bring her to sleep.
Freedom of speech, differences of opinion and discourses are based on our nation.
And true leadership means accepting it.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for home comfort at the Renaissance Club
The former European No. 1 Ronan Rafferty will be hoping for home comfort in the next three days, as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian will hold the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
The Northern Ireland, which led near the Archerfield Links to the end of last year, before losing against Paul Eales, is connected to the new place of exhibition and works as a tournament ambassador on behalf of the association founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
"I have seen how the Renaissance club was built, and we see how it reached its fame with this event," Rafferty said.
"The players will see this course from his best side, he is in a great state.
Jerry did a great job when he found this place.
He is a jealous advocate of this game and is proud of his performance here.
This is a great showcase for this course."
England's Eales is happy to defend a championship for the first time, although in his 32-year career he won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour.
"This really feels special," said the host player in Southport.
"I have not been able to defend the Extremadura Open since she was taken out of the program in the year after I won it.
Back to this part of the world is magical.
It's a wonderful place to play golf.
The memories from last year came back, and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon to win here last year.
It was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate."
Gary Orr, who came to the European Senior Tour earlier this year after his 50th birthday, returned to action on home ground.
This event will be his first Scottish performance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"It always means a little more when you play at home," said Orr, the man from Helensburg.
"You want to do well, but you also feel this additional pressure.
I really enjoyed playing it again, and I played a solid golf.
I'm happy about how it went so far."
With the Trio on the field are the former Masters-victor Ian Woosnam and Senior Major Champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrence are among the six shots on the field, the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmair and Ross Drummond.
The entrance is free, the parking lot costs £ 5 per car with one seat and £ 10 per car with two or more seats.

Less lung cancer caused by passovers
In the past two decades, fewer people have died because of passive strokes on lung cancers.
This results in a study by scientists at the University of Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE).
"According to our estimates, 167 lung cancers are due to pass-overs per year," said Heiko Becher, head of study.
In comparison, he conducted his own study on the subject of 1994.
At that time, there were still 400 lung cancers due to per year of passive seizures in Germany.
The new study is published in the International Journal of Public Health.
Home connections are very complex
The construction works in the village street are in full swing and "sometimes in time", says the head of the Bauhof Fred Heinze.
In the area of house closures, the situation is more complicated than suspected, as in the background much is hidden, which is not found in the plans.
The traffic that continues to hamper construction is a major problem for the construction of the company Stumpp.
"The ignorance of the car drivers from red lights and extinguishers is already huge," Heinze reports.
The road is blocked and only the line buses are entitled to travel.
Angelo Caruso, Marvin Kostorz and Tim Kostorz from the company Stumpp have been busy working on the bridge for weeks.
"The hot days were already very exciting.
But luckily we were provided by our friend Fritz Matt with cool mineral water," says Marvin Kostorz.
Poverty and death in Indonesian goldland
If Bardina Degei cooks the dinner, she doesn't use a shepherd.
She doesn't even rarely use a topf.
In its wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of the Panai Regentage in the restless Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually places a sweet potato - locally called "note" - directly into the fireplace.
After half an hour, the knoll will be taken and swallowed with yellow, unwashed hands.
Degei is sitting on the Lehboden - she has no furniture - where she also carries out her daily work, e.g. washing clothes with turquoise water from the nearby soup.
An egg in a roofless room serves as a latrine.
As the youngest of the four wives of her husband, she was not assigned a field.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, it can be dangerous to work late: most villagers are unemployed, and many drink hard, and there are soldiers here.
"No one's waiting to walk around the village after 5:00," she says.
It is a rare sight of the daily life in the Highland of Papua, a former Dutch colony, which was taken up in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia, when only 1,026 elders were to vote by a public survey before the occupation camps.
An existing movement that challenged independence against the Dutch government quickly turned against the Jakarta government, which maintained control over the region and excluded foreign journalists or legal observers from it.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, with the independent part of Papua New Guineas covering the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is as remote as it is öde. The trip includes a 90-minute flight from Jayapura Province to Nabire and then a 5-hour drive by car.
There is no public transport.
The city with approximately 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo trees and well-blech roofs, which were transformed by rust into different yellow brown sounds.
Only very few Indonesians have made their trip here, because journalists and practically no foreigners have failed.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago Papuans worshiped a God named Uga Tamee.
There were other changes.
"We were not used to wearing this dress," says Degei and shows on her lively, hand-woven turbane, her dark shirt and her bright skirt.
"In the past, we only had leaves on our bodies."
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst infant mortality and literacy rates in Asia.
But it's also Indonesia's Goldland.
The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, Grasberg, owned by Freeport McMoran from Phoenix, is only 60 miles away from Panai, a highland province in the size of New Jersey with 153,000 inhabitants.
In 2015 alone, Freeport has demolished the value of 3.1 billion US dollars gold and copper.
In addition, Papua has an estimated $78 billion of wood resources.
However, these rich people are a source of misery for the Papua, which ensures that the powerful Indonesian military maintains a stunning presence.
A 2005 study in the New York Times reported that Freeport paid nearly 20 million US dollars to a single official, including up to $150,000, local military personnel and units between 1998 and 2004.
Papua's demands for greater autonomy threaten these golden gans and are treated in vain.
According to activists, more than 500,000 Papua were killed and thousands were raped, tortured and arrested by the Indonesian military since 1969.
Mass meetings in Papua's Tribesshochland in the 1970s were held in accordance with the Asia Human Rights Commission on Human Rights.
In the region alone, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful demonstrators last year.
"We're losing everything" means in a report by the Erzdioze Brisbane in 2016, which contains reports on the civilties of the previous year, such as illegal facilities and torture - rape and electric strikes are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal defeat of peaceful demonstrations.
"It is difficult to count the number of victims, as events happen every week," says Andreas Harrisono, Indonesian researcher for Human Rights Watch.
The screws have grown stronger as Papua's resources bring an abundance of residents from other parts of Indonesia.
The population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83% Christian, but demographic development changes as Muslim economic migrants come from the rich islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese warning canteens sell fried chicken and gado-gado, a mixed vegetable served with groundnut juice.
Local people are fighting to stay here.
"The migrants have started selling chickens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local Papua," explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old panai-in-home worker who moved to Jayapura Province.
"It cost the local Papua - the mother-mama [the women] of Papua - their market."
The Indonesian President Joko Widodo, known in the Volksmund as Jokovi, promised during his 2014 election campaign to address the inequalities and legal violations in Papua.
The former Zimmermann secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua - including Panai - on the way to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta.
But in Papua has changed a little, and today the natives feel deceived.
"Our hearts are broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014 with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored," you say.
In fact, Panai only suffered two months after Jokowi's dedication in October.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children were outside and sang Christmas songs in front of a campfire in Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers broke on a motorcycle through the darkness.
The frightened children told them that they should turn their lights on.
One of the soldiers attacked her and came back with four soldiers, so the local pastor Yavedt Tebai.
The soldiers who had drunk hunted and beat the group with their rifles, said victims and witnesses.
Then one of the soldiers set fire to the children's group.
A child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so hard that he fell into the coma.
A few hours later, the building of the nearby government commission was set up in fire and things were escalating the next day.
About 1,000 young Papua men, women and children gathered at a football club in front of the local police station and the military command center to seek justice.
They wore ceremonial hunting bows and led the Waita dance - running in the circle and imitating a bird song - from Papua Mee Pago tribe.
Some demonstrators began to gloat stones on police and military posts.
When the mood was heated, an internal radio command was sent to the soldiers: "If the masses resist more than three times, they shoot them dead," says an official document by TIME, which has not been released to the local media.
Jeremias Kayame, 56, head of the Kego Koto area of Enarotali, looked at the threatening danger and called for peace and asked the multitude to return home.
No one was in the mood.
"When I turned around, I was suddenly shot in my left wrist," he told TIME on the porch of his painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who's fired, but says the ball came from the ranks of the soldiers gathered here.
"It was overloaded, many shots were fired," he adds.
The local man Alfius Youw was met three times, so his cousin was witness to the shootings.
"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was," said John, who, like many Indonesians, bears only one name, the TIME in a dark mood.
"I saw that he was dead... I kissed him."
The chief inspector of the Papua police, Yotje Mende, told reporters that his officers wanted to "safe" their station because they were attacked.
"We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," said Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo, spokesperson of the Papua Police in 2015.
"It's about life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young demonstrators were killed and many others injured.
The news of the killings came only on the following day 'filtered' to Jakarta.
For three weeks, Jokowi in Jayapura spoke passionately, expressing sympathy for the families of the victims and swearing to address the historical misconceptions in Papua.
"I want this case to be resolved immediately, so it will no longer happen in the future," he said.
In October 2016, Security Minister Viranto said he had set up an extrajudicial mechanism to address historical human rights violations.
But the excuses began almost immediately.
"Most injuries have occurred long ago.
Some were in the 1990s and early 2000s.
The point is that we have committed ourselves to these violations, but there are processes that have to go through," he said.
Then Viranto made a withdrawal when he spoke to TIME in Jakarta on 5 June and said he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, "everything will be regulated by law," he said.
Viranto, who accused the UN of "crime against humanity", who demanded more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor's bloody independence vote of 1999, said that 11 cases of human rights violations had already been committed in Papua, including the Pania incident.
The families of the Panai victims rejected such claims with cruel disbelief.
"I have been interviewed four times in the last three years, but there has been no progress," says John.
"I'm tired."
He says he still lives in fear years later.
"I'm scared," he says.
"I'm afraid to be arrested by the military, fear to be shot."
His brother Yacobus repeated the view that people in Panai are afraid to discuss the incident.
He says he was beaten by the military after he helped bury four of the victims.
"After I buried the bodies, the military sought after me," he says.
The shootings have not stopped.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police shot villagers in Paniais neighborhood Deiyai.
During a confrontation between village residents and the manager of a construction company who refused to bring a unconscious man into the hospital, one person and 17 others were injured, including children.
The man, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who was drunk when he was fishing in a nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
Enthusiast villagers protested before the company's local office.
The police said that the villagers threw stones at officers who responded by firing fires.
But natives say that the mobile brigade (indonesian paramilitary police) started shooting at the crowd and killed one.
"We were so in panic, we were afraid that there would be cancer," says the 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lived near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were quickly delivered here, so the TIME.
"I've been hiding in my house for two days."
The Deiyai Parliament has called on the officials involved to be accountable and to withdraw the mobile police brigade from the area.
Panais was always an unrester for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development reinforces the dissatisfaction of the family members of the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal, who live in the green highlands of Papua.
Many agreed to the "Free Papua Movement" (OPM), the rebel army that claims to defend the rights of the Papua by attacking the traced attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top-OPM leaders come from Panai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Judes Kogoya.
In recent years, thousands of people in Pania have been arrested and voluntarily taken into custody, under the pretext of national sovereignty.
Some never wake up again.
Among the people in Papua, Panai is known as "a tragic, forgotten place".
Poverty strengthens dissatisfaction.
The little rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.
The bread is just as wide as the rich.
People here build everything they eat: especially notes and fruit and leaves.
Agriculture is the task of women who can edit four or five fields of sweet potatoes each.
You keep most of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten pieces of Note cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
During the time, economic inequalities between the domestic Papua and the new migrants have increased since the opening of new flights to the neighboring airport.
The few jobs in the region tend to go to the better educated and more prosperous migrants.
Papua rarely has the capital or the necessary skills to run its own companies competitively.
"The young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because there are no jobs or money here," says John Gobai, the president of the Panai tribal council.
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua.
Moreover, restrictions on international media reporting remain strained.
At the beginning of the year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported due to lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua, although they were given the rare permission to film.
According to Phelim Kine, the Deputy Director of Human Rights Watch, the promises of Jokowis election struggle, to lift the limits of the report to promote transparency and development, were not realized.
"There are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia's restless eastern provinces of Papua and West Papua: Visa refusal and a black list," he said in a statement.
Lack of press control means that the international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely limited to the immediate neighbours of Papua.
In March, six Pacific States - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to examine the "diversity and widespread injuries" in Papua, including the Pani ski resort.
These same countries have historically seen the OPM support.
The speaker of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Arrmanatha Nasir pointed out the group's proposals and said journalists in Jakarta: "In Indonesia there is still a democratic system, and there are free media, so it is difficult to forget the evidence for human rights cases."
People on the spot want more foreign governments to know about this.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, under the leadership of the human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar, Jayapura, visited on 4 May, locals broke their silence and pushed him "We want freedom", according to a source that also participated in the meeting, but wants to remain anonymous.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but the Papua says they will probably not vote again for Jokowi.
"Jokowi is a man who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by people who are involved in the Panai shots," says Gobai, the president of the tribal council.
He wants Jokowi to know that the Panai people, apart from living under the constant threat of a predatory military, are in poor education and health services.
Gobai says that the Panai people, like other Papua, view their voice for Jokowi as a "debt" he has to repay.
"They don't need money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the Pani-Schus' families carried out a last symbolic act of pride: the body of a victim was buried on a site exactly against the police and the military station.
They know that they may never get justice, but at least they do not let the perpetrators forget their crimes.
"A member of our family was killed," says Yacobus with a weak head.
"What else can we do?"
Fire captures the 'Torch' clouds of Dubai for the second time
On Friday, in one of the world's highest residential towers in Dubai, a fire found its way through its house and forced hundreds of inhabitants to flee 79-metre buildings.
It is the second fire, which covers only two years through the high house, which is randomly called the Torch Tower (Fakel Tower).
The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported, and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame.
"We slept, and we woke up at the fire alarm and the shouting of the people.
We ran down the stairs, and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor," said a resident who mentioned his name as George, Reuters.
Dubai civil protection authorities said that the units of fire control at 4.00 p.m. local time (0.00 p.m. GMT) destroyed the fire and cooled the building.
The government said it was working to provide accommodation for the affected.
The event can repeat questions about the safety of materials used in external areas of high houses around the world.
An investigation into the management of the Torch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that the majority of the damage from the clothing, the external clothing for decoration or insulation came.
In Britain, the police said they believed that the system of plates for insulation and wear at the London Grenfell Tower in June could have contributed to the rapid expansion of a fire in which about 80 people died.
No Davis-Cup reform: Next Best-of-five
The President of the International Tennis Association (ITF) has met with his great Davis Cup at the General Assembly.
At the meeting in Ho Chi Minh City, the revolutionary proposal for this sport to play Davis-Cup unit was not supported by the two-thirds majority required.
The very often long but therefore also highly estimated five-satellium classics remain therefore to be awarded to the traditional competition.
63.54% of the Member States agreed on the reform, and the goal of ITF President David Haggerty was therefore only barely missed.
"We respect this decision, but we are disappointed that our member nations have not adopted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and Fed Cup.
We need a change to ensure the long-term future of this iconic and historical competition," Haggerty said.
You will continue to work to improve the applications.
Even after many objections to the vote, the proposal to put the finals in a neutral position had already come to an end.
New from 2018 are only relatively smaller details: thus the finalists in Davis Cup and Fed Cup will have the host right in the next year in the first round.
In order to reduce the costs for the organizers, the requirements in training places etc. will be simplified and players will have to complete less official media terms before the Davis Cup.
More than 1 in 5 US passengers bring prohibited items into the aircraft, find an inquiry
A survey of air passengers showed that more than 20 percent of prohibited items at the US Transport Security Administration checkpoints were smuggled over, including at least 6 percent who owned the aircraft, while they accidentally carried prohibited knives or other items with sounds.
Less than 1 per cent claimed that they had discovered late that they were literally traveling with guns, ammunition or explosives.
The survey of more than 1,000 people - carried out by a Jet Charter Service, Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - also found that younger travelers were not aware of the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted that they had deliberately tried to fly with something forbidden by the TSA, 19.7 percent were Millenials, compared to less than 15 percent, who were members of the X generation.
The most common items that were deliberately passed on to TSA agents were food and fluids.
More than 3 percent added to significantly carrying items with sounds through the safety check, while 2.2 percent of female respondents and 3.7 percent of male respondents also confirmed that they had deliberately carried prohibited drugs to the aircraft.
The company said that it asked travellers throughout the country to find out how many accidentally brought smuggler goods through airport security and how many had done so deliberately.
It is no surprise that the people who are the first smugglers - consciously or unconsciously - carry through the safety of those who were most often flying.
However, the company points out that the TSA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People are often uncertain about which liquids they can take with them or how much of it.
It is not surprising, therefore, that the largest amount of the items seized by the TSA are those prohibited by the TSA.
For a long time, people thought that TSA could view books as smugglers.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
Elon Musk is equal: Ten thousand Tesla customers cancel order
Elon Musk is happy to present with the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla "Model 3".
He has so far suggested that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non-binding reservation.
In addition to the ever-increasing number of sales increases and even more gigantic targets, Tesla-Chief Elon Musk has for the first time betrayed a different, less glossy number: the cancellations in the new mass market model 3.
Musk had often spent over 500,000 pre-orders for the new car in the past months, the delivery of which began right away.
Now Musk saves: Of the total 518.000 pre-orders, 63,000 have already been withdrawn.
Critics have repeatedly pointed out that it is only non-binding reservations.
In the event of cancellation, Tesla pays back 1000 euros (in the USA 1000 US dollars and in the United Kingdom 1000 pounds) "Reservation payment".
At present, 455,000 such non-binding reservations are presented, spaced muscle in a telephone conference with analysts.
However, the Tesla Chief does not believe that the cancellation of about twelve percent of all orders could become a problem.
His argument: The challenge of ambitious growth targets is not the demand, but on the production side.
Last year, Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.
2018 will be - all models combined - 500,000, 2020 one million.
The request for this is obviously there.
According to Musk, there are currently 1,800 bookings per day.
Whoever orders a "Model 3" today can expect delivery first in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla makes it possible to drive its brand new, never in practice, production streets without major interruptions with maximum wear.
Many experts doubt that this is possible.
But if there are more delays, then the incompatibility of reservations could become a problem for Tesla.
Because then the company can't prevent unsatisfied customers from going into chess.
EPA Chief Pruitt withdraws due to the increase in Obama-Era rules to reduce emissions
One day, after being declared by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Authority, withdrew his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era rules to reduce emissions of smog causing air pollutants.
Pruitt presented the change when his agency demonstrated the needs of the state environmental authorities towards faster reactions than previous administrations.
He did not mention the complaints raised against his former position in a Federal Court of Appeal.
It is a deadline that expired on 1 October for States to comply with the standards of 2015 for ground-breaking ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that he would be extraditing compliance in a year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid "interrupt in local decisions or hinder economic growth".
Pruitt, who was, before his appointment by President Donald Trump, the State attorney of Oklahoma, was a reliable opponent of stricter environmental protection regulations for a long time.
Since his arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly gone to block or delay regulations to which the chemical industry and the fossil fuels industry are opposed.
The sudden return from Wednesday is the latest legal return for the Pruitt's regulatory Rollback Agenda.
Last month, a Federal Court of Appeal in Washington decided that the EPA administrator had exceeded its authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of Obama's administration, the oil and gas companies committed to monitoring and reducing Methanleks.
In an opinion published on Wednesday, Pruitt suggested that his return to ozone standards would simply strengthen the EPA's willingness to cooperate with the States through the complex process of timely compliance with the new standards.
"In previous administrations, the EPA often did not meet the deadlines for implementation and then expected to be charged by groups of activists and others, and in agreement to set the deadline for implementation," Pruitt said, who claimed the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job.
"We do not believe in a regulation through judicial procedures, and we take time seriously.
We also take seriously the law and the authority it gives us."
Nevertheless, the EPA opinion said that Pruitt will at some time use his "power to delay and all other legally available powers" to ensure that the rules "based on a sound policy and the best information available".
The Republicans at the Congress insist on a more comprehensive reintroduction of the ozone rules.
A draft legislation approved in the last month is intended to delay implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been put to the vote in the Senate.
The New York State Attorney-General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that had declared the EPA this week, said that the group intended to maintain the legal pressure.
"The conversion of the EPA - after our complaints - is an important benefit for the health and safety of these 6,7 million New Yorkers and those over 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smog that flows into their communities," Schneiderman said.
New York joined California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington and the District of Columbia.
Ground ozone occurs when pollutants from cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight.
The emerging smog can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive groups of people and contribute to thousands of premature deaths each year.
Representatives of public health and environmental protection were enjoying surprising exchange of courses over Pruitts.
"It is disturbing how much pressure it takes to take this reasonable step by the air-protector we are to breathe," said Lori Ann Burd from the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to fight against the ideological crossroads of the Trump government to offer themselves to environmental pollutants and their particular interests."
Tumlingen celebrates 750 years St. Hilary Church
750 years of St. Hilari's Church: On the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church, an invitation to a ceremony will be invited to the old Friedhof area in Tumlingen on Sunday, 16 July.
Whether its idyllic location and a beautiful view of the village is the historic St. Hilarius plant is a popular place to stay.
The visitors of the sixth Benefiz series can be delighted by this powerful place.
The rescue and maintenance of the oldest building in the village have made the friends and supporters of Tumlingen their concern.
Walter Martini emphasises: "It is a unique village littled."
In 1267, the St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in the Württemberg urkundenbook: Count Hermann von Sulz sold "the mountain with the parish church in Tumlingen and the Vogetti" to Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver.
The words of the decree were followed on the Tumlinger mountain, except for the former parish church, and also a royal court, to which the church or the patronage law belonged and not reversed.
So there were also people living there.
According to the description of the city of Feudenstadt of 1858, there was a "Berg" of the third, the ruling village of the village, in addition to the village and the village, which are still to be recognized today in the local image of Tumlingen.
Old maps from the time around the year 1600 undermine these historical events.
The right of the patronage was derived from the right of the early Middle Ages to own the church.
A Lord who built a church, furnished and possessed with a pastor, continued to own this church and could also inherit this own church.
This was linked to the right to appoint a pastor or to propose a new pastor to the bishop.
There were three ages in the church and two bells on the tower.
The size of the two collapses on Christmas in 1673.
The newly created bells were released for the first time in 1692, but later had to be released in the Second World War in 1942.
In the 30-year war (1616 to 1648) the windows were slammed and the bell lines were stolen.
The roof was empty.
In 1796, French troops were encamped near the church.
They broke out the canal and church chairs and used them as fuel.
The rest of the church threatened to destroy in 1809.
Until 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius-Friedhof also served as the last resting place for the dead from the hearthweiler.
In 1823 the Friedhof was extended and the Hillary Church was destroyed.
Only the church tower was left standing.
On the New Year's Eve in 1834, a storm broke in the church tower and half broke in.
To prevent an accident, the tower was broken down.
Only today the tower tower was still present as a witness to the 750-year-old history of the church.
Today Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem from the "Shaffigen Rentners" as successor to Dieter Dockhorn the Hilarius plant.
On Sunday, 16 July, the friends and sponsors of Tumlingen invited the 6th Serenade to St. Hilariusskapelle's old cemetery.
It is designed by the Combo of the Kepler Gymnasium Feudenstadt and with words by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.
Local leader Hartmut Romann speaks the final word.
The program starts at 4.30 p.m.
The reception is from 3.30 p.m.
In the wake of the Serenade, a coup takes place in front of the Friedhof.
"Enjoy a summer evening under the shadow of old trees and with the wide view of the meadows to the forest," the organizers present the fantastic view.
The Serenade takes place only in dry weather.
The organizers hope that many will support the historic St. Hilarius plant, which is important to the Tumlingen and the deaf.
The friends and supporters of Tumlingen feel particularly committed to home care, as confirmed by Serenade organizer Walter Martini.
The association wants to examine the approval of windmills
"Boisheim resists" does not see any legal requirement for the construction and has therefore turned to the Land Council.
The association "Boisheim resists" has called on Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw its approval for the establishment of planned wind power plants in the Boisheim network.
She's been law-enforced.
The association argues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016, no wind power plants could have been approved in the Boisheim network since only a wind power concentration zone existed at the city border in Schwalmtal at the time.
Within this concentration zone, the construction and operation of wind power plants is possible in principle, while the concentration zone will also result in an exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city.
These zones are intended to prevent a "sparing" of the landscape.
However, the city of Foursen had decided a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheim network a few days earlier by amending the area use plan - but the district government did not approve Düsseldorf because of a form error.
"By reason of the lack of planning law, the decision granted is still to be taken legally and therefore also to withdraw," said Christoph Erkens, president of "Boisheim resists".
Current state of affairs: The City Council has decided once again before the summer break the wind concentration zone in the Boisheim network; approval of the district government is still in place.
Recognition: "The granting of an authorisation for the establishment of wind power plants is thus excluded from the scope of planning."
The circuit confirms the entrance to the invitation.
"The corresponding letters have been entered in the circle fours since last week," one speaker explained.
The circle takes it to re-examine the matter.
However, it is not expected that the procedure will be stopped.
In view of the ongoing proceedings before the Administrative Court, on Thursday, the circle did not wish to comment in substance on the argument of the association "Boisheim resists".
The NEW Re, a subsidiary of the NEW, plans on an area on the Boisheimer Nete the construction of four 200 meters high winds.
Already last year, the company in which the city of Fours had been directly involved had concluded agreements with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of large land.
With the creation of the four wind power plants, the electricity demand of around 11 400 households is expected to be met - about one-fifth of the electricity consumption of all the four households.
The NEW Re wants to invest around 20 million euros.
Last summer, the Fourth City Council provided a green light for the purchase of three wind power plants in the Linnich Windpark near Aachen as well as participation in a wind power plant in Übach-Palenberg in Heinsberg district.
Car and tractor crash together: woman dies in a terrible accident
A horrific traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at 10 a.m. on the L 333 between Niederwallmenach and Bogel (Rhein-Lahn-Creis).
A woman was killed.
Two others were easily injured.
The road was closed for hours.
According to police reports, a 17-year-old young woman from Bornich with her Pkw ran the L 333 towards Bogel as a companion with her 53-year-old mother.
City and dealer plan "home shops" weekend
In September, Bad Langensalzaer and people from the region will discover the shopping opportunities in the city centre.
The trade association and the city administration want to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to lure the residents into the city center.
As the chairman of the trade union, Christian King, announced, the "home shops" weekend should make customers aware of what offers their own city apart from the usual supermarket goods.
It is therefore planned to be a market with regional suppliers, similar to the weekly market.
In addition, domestic companies should present themselves with their training stations.
In addition, the shops of the city center are to be invited to the "Merternight Shop".
The action is not only aimed at the inhabitants of the city and the nearest region.
In preparation, advertisements are on the radio, an Internet video and printed booklets pointing to the weekend of action, says Christian King.
The city administration and trade association cooperate with the Chamber of Industry and Commerce.
This will lead to another stage of the project "Attractive Innstadt".
These include new offers such as the first "Activ-Day" for the fountain festival as well as a sale Sunday, talks with all business operators and hosts to move them to active participation.
Attractive offers for Saturday and the discount on parking fees on this day are also part of the concept.
In addition, customer potential should be re-opened or re-opened.
These include curators and tourists.
But also many locals had lost the city when buying from the view.
In the end, everyone had to contribute to living in the city - up to tenants, the businesses of the whole city and associations.
It was true that with a network, the Lethargy, which had partly spread, had been told by the king in the spring.
Birgit Streich, head of the IHK Center in Mühlhausen, shared that on the third day of "home shops" were participating for the first time in five Thuringian cities.
Besides Bad Langensalza, these are Weimar, Sömmerda, Heiligenstadt and Bleicherrode.
The day is intended to "pursue for the value of local trade and demonstrate its importance for the common good of our cities", says Streich.
The action under the suspension of the IHK and with many partners also makes it clear that any citizen with his shopping behaviour can have a direct influence on his own environment.
Two deaths and several injuries after explosion at U.S. school
During construction, there was a gas explosion in the school building.
New people were injured.
In a gas explosion in the U.S. city of Minneapolis, two people were killed and nine others were injured, some of them hard.
According to the firefight, on Wednesday (placetime) there was another injured person in critical condition.
A man died when a part of a school building exploded at the explosion.
A missing person was later also buried.
The dead were employees of the school.
As a result, the authorities suspected work on a gas pipeline.
Only a few people in the Minnehaha Academy were present during the holiday season.
Trump put pressure on the payment of the border wall following secure transcripts of phone calls Mexico
Transcripts of telephone calls between US President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by Washington Post.
On January 27th, Trump called on the Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to stop saying publicly that he would not pay for a planned border wall.
The U.S. President lied to him because he had publicly attacked the wall. According to reports, he said to him, "You can't tell the press that."
Trump began his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall at the southern border of the United States, and it was difficult to let Mexico pay for the project.
Transscripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published and revealed an intense exchange.
Mr. Trump told Mr. Turnbull that a trade for the United States of refugees who emigrated to Australia would be "synthetic", "my" and "mutual" and that the existence on the trade that the Obama government had been given would make him look like a "depp" after he proposed a ban on the resettlement of refugees to the United States.
Mr. Trump ended the call after he had said Mr. Turnbull, "that is the most unpleasant call for all day."
Moores Ford Masker: Activists lead racist lynchact as a call for justice again
A 1948 Ford Mercury ran through a group of viewers in rural Monroe, Georgia, and ran to the Ford Bridge of Moore.
Before the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver who could reach the bridge, a group of white men came out with guns to block his way.
The leader of the mob - a man of middle age in a needle - took a long train to his cigarette and looked through the wind protection disc.
Indrins swam in fear.
"We want this n--r Roger!" the man whispered.
"Get him out of the car!"
Crying broke the silence when a young black man was crushed by the rider's seat.
Luckily, this terrible scene, which was played on July 22nd, is just a replay.
But when a snake is thrown around the neck of "Roger", almost everyone in the audience seemed very real.
Since 2005, citizens' rights have returned to Moore's Ford Bridge to celebrate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were born in 1946 by Ku Klux Klan.
No one was ever accused of murder.
"It is really incomprehensible that no one has been arrested in all these years - although we see them in our communities, although we know who they are," said Tyrone Brooks, who helps with the organization of the succession.
"It's a dirt stain on a story, but it's a burden to our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old former Congressor of the state of Georgia and a lifelong civil rights lawyer.
For him, the succession serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder to the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected.
"We want prosecution, we want the end, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we need justice," he said.
"We cannot attain salvation and reconciliation until we receive justice."
A medical doctor puts a bet on the body of one of the victims of the Moore-Ford-Lynchen on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI records received from NBC news, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding graphics were suspected in the lynch process.
But no one was ever accused.
Although the suspects have been on free foot for decades, citizens say that the dual motivation for the Lynch actions in the whole city has always been known: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a decision of the Supreme Court allowed black citizens in Georgia to give their vote for the first time in the summer pre-election.
About the same time as the election, according to the FBI, the Black Farmer Roger Malcom was a white landowner, Barnett Hester, during a fight down - allegedly because of a woman.
Brooks said that the rumor in the city was that Hester had slept with Malcolm's wife Dorothy and that the baby she carried was not from her husband.
On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, paid $600 to free Malcom from prison, so the FBI.
He was escorted by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey to prison.
But when they left the prison and the Moore's Ford Bridge approached, a Lynchmob surrounded the car.
"As it turns out, it was Harrison who prepared and arranged the murder," concludes an FBI report.
"It is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between the state and local prosecution, which was not only involved in the murders, destroyed evidence and changed the identity of witnesses."
Brooks makes it even more interesting.
"It was a right-wing mask," he said.
"They were all killed to send a message to black people in this community: "If you let yourself register and if you vote, this will happen to you here."
For almost a decade Cassandra Greene has led the annual recovery of the Moore Ford Bridge Lynch murder.
Its presentation is spectacular, aggressive and is based on a kind of deep racism, from which many would like to believe that it no longer exists in America.
It's hard to look and even harder to look away, but Greene said that's the point.
"We don't want to talk about the lynch, because then we are confronted with his madness in us all," she said.
"But I can't build a relationship with you if you don't want to listen to me or if you don't want to hear what I've done."
The samples for this year's production began in June, and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen whites and the rest blacks - began in a room and listened when Greene started a well-played overview of the piece.
Wade Marbaugh is a Greenes co director.
For years he has played the role of the chief member, but he said the role will never be easier.
"I feel dirty because I'm not like that," said Marbaugh.
"But I think it's very important to keep this story alive, because we don't want to go back to these times."
On the other side of the room, the actors Darius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, tried their lines.
The piece begins with Malcom, the horse jumps up and pushes him, angry that he slept with his wife Dorothy.
"I said, n-- he, get away from my property!"
Rascona is setting fire.
There's a break.
Then every soul will be in a state of confusion.
Greene was laughing at the very least.
"What?" asked Rascona.
He's alarmed and confused.
Was I too hard?
"No," said Greene, still kicking.
"I just don't think white people said 'n-- he' at the time."
"But," alternated one of the other black performers.
"You just have to meet the hard 'R.'."
And right there the energy moves in the room, a feeling of friendship replaces the discomfort.
Everyone is busy getting this right, not only because of the game, but also because of the memory of the four people killed.
The scene starts again.
This time, when Rascona says the N word, he says it sharp and with emphasis.
No one's lying at all.
This repetition ends violently and quickly.
There are screams, shots and then quiet.
A woman, dressed in mourning clothes, stands over the bodies of the actors and carries out Billie Holidays' mourning lobrede "Strong Fruit".
Her voice breaks every second word.
About a hundred meters behind it is a group of about four dozen spectators sweating and tears out of their eyes.
The audience is almost evenly divided between black and white.
A couple is from Ithaca, New York, driven to see the performance, many just come down the street.
They have all experienced a strong humidity for almost eight hours in Georgia when Brooks takes them on a pilgrimage to the graveyards of the Malcoms and Dorseys.
To this point, the murder remains an anecdotes, but now, when you stand in the same country where the Lynch murder took place, the air feels expansive.
When the last notes of the song turn off, Greene invites the amount to come closer and inspect the body name.
Children hook on their heads, register the fake blood and the quiet bodies and whispers to each other.
"They're not really dead," muttered a little boy, as he wanted to remember.
After a few minutes Green thanks to the amount - and suddenly it's over.
The actors throw away the Lynchsale and remove their tears.
Bradshaw hugged Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the clan member.
Nick Rascona hugs two of his associates and then tears into their arms, the emotional burden of performance breaks through with him.
"It's okay," whispers one of the women.
"We know it's not in your heart.
You did it for a reason."
Later, the audience will join the actors for dinner.
On a table, a white couple from Atlanta are excited about the succession with a black couple they have just met.
Denise Duplinski fought to find words that left the performance.
"It's hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... come from people who look like you and do it because they look like you," she said.
"What you really do with me, let me believe the Lynchen is still going on," she added, "it's only called police shooting today."
In the same room Tyrone Brooks Hof keeps on his table, he eats and remembers the rights of citizens.
He said he started planning the performance next year.
"The succession is in some ways inspiring, because it describes the fear of what we have brought, but it is also a moment of learning," he said.
"It's like, if we don't learn anything from it, then it can happen again.
Whoever does not study his own story, whoever does not know his own story, is doomed to repeat it."
The Wagnerians in Bayreuth
Also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner's monumental work, Director Frank Castorf is setting up a bub-free stage in front of giant, six-story scenes.
The turning stage (designed by Aleksandar Denic) is an elegant street corner as well as a wall rest and danerbude in Berlin, a "Plaste and Eleste" logo from DDR times or the New York stock exchange.
Before that, an open Mercedes-Oldtimer is parked in which the Rheintötters pose as rock girls, or alternatively an isteta.
Stacked oil fans remember Castorfs Leitmotiv - money, power and gear - which is drawn through his "ring" stage.
The three Rheintötters - songs by Stephanie Houtzeel, Wiebke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Steiner - harmonize wonderfully as already in the "Rheingold".
Kess causes Siegfried (Stefan Vinke), in Hollywood-Manier destroys a body in the trunk and gives the Krawallo-Clicke.
Stephen Milling sings the beautiful festive hagen surrounded by the aura of a weight boxer.
Brutal the scene when he beat Siegfried.
Later, Gunther (Markus Eiche) must also believe.
The audience thanks it to the ensemble with strong applause.
Fester, Milling, Vinke and conductor Janowski, who are modest and handcuffed to the Merkel wheel, are often celebrated.
There is a big deal for the festival orchestra, which first appears on the stage - in view of the great heat again in military leisure clothing.
The performance of Frank Castorf and his team was exciting.
If he had yet to have a valid pepper concert over him in 2013, there were five years later a great anniversary in which the single "buh" holes went down.
Feast leader Katharina Wagner may have been pleased about this.
"I notice that the audience has grown up with the "ring" in some way," she had just said before the dpa.
The public not only made a form of peace with Castorf, but it also grew an understanding of its way of view.
I'm drawing a positive summary.
Max Quantity works as a volunteer
They work in their volunteer year in several places.
Where everywhere?
Quantity: Usually in Steinfurt in the furniture exchange, once a week I help out here in Greven in the furniture bridge.
And I've been working at school all day.
How are your experiences like that?
Quantity: It's a beautiful wide spectrum that I see here.
I have to do with different people, young people, refugees, young adults.
They are now 26 years old, so a late volunteer.
How's it going?
Quantity: I've made an abitur.
And then a building engineering study, let's say it's broken down.
I realized it was wrong for me and I wanted to do something else to work with people.
And then I asked what you were doing.
Make a social year, there is an insight, there you can see how it is on the spot, perhaps in the focus too, is real.
And was it?
Quantity: I've collected great impressions.
In the winter semester, I will start my study in socialism.
I will study twice, probably in Jugendamt Herne a social worker training and study in Hamm at the university.
Is it not unusual to have several different places of use while volunteering?
Quantity: Yes, it is very variable.
I guess it always comes to where you make your FSJ.
You can make it from old age to youth work - in all possible aspects of social work.
With me, it was very varied.
I was also part of the OGS, that is, in the afternoon care.
For me, that was exactly the right thing to do.
I could recognize my own strengths and see how it really goes.
Other than in the engineering studio?
Quantity: Well, of course, here it's not about to calculate statistics.
You always have other people's heads that each have a completely different story behind you.
Whether a refugee, a young person who has been taken out of the family - one must always look into it individually.
Very interesting.
And you had no fear of contact?
Quantity: I'm not the type for that.
It's an area that's a lot.
A lot of love, a lot of kindness.
There are sometimes negative moments, but that's how life is.
Pearson cuts another 3,000 jobs and cuts the dividends to resume the business
The British education group Pearson said on Friday that it will reduce another 3,000 jobs and cut their dividends by 72 percent, as another restructuring programme will be launched to overcome the pressure facing the company.
The decommissioning, announced mainly by Director General John Fallon for the end of 2018 and early 2019, is also due to his previous restructuring, where 4,000 seats have already been lost.
In May, Pearson announced in a third cost reduction programme a cost reduction plan for another 300 million pounds (394 million US dollars) to revive a business that was hit by the fast step towards digital learning.
The company, which had pledged its participation in Penguin Random House to partner Bertelsmann last month, said that the outlook for the financial year was unchanged after it reached an increase of 1 per cent to 2.05 billion pounds in the first half of the year.
Kabul's convoy attack: Nato soldier killed in suicide
A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital of Kabul, killed a soldier of the Nato and injured several others, officials said.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, a Nato statement was given.
According to unconfirmed local reports, in the Qarabagh district, three civilians died.
Bombing is the last violence that Afghanistan has experienced this month - more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Herat on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide killer killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
In a Nato opinion, it is said that the explosion occurred on Thursday night when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by a "improvised tension" carried by persons.
The statement says that all injured are in a stable condition and are treated at the U.S. military hospital at Bagram airport.
Correspondents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh is a major concern for NATO troops in the nearby Bagram.
According to the United Nations, there were at least 1.662 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, about 20% of them in the capital.
At the end of July, a suicide bomb killed at least 30 people in a mostly Shiite district of Kabul.
The Taliban said they would have carried out this attack.
On 31 May, a violent bombing in the city centre killed more than 150 people with the country's most deadly militant attack, since 2001 the US-led troops forced the Taliban out of power.
The violence underlines the precarious security situation in Afghanistan, as US President Donald Trump is considering increasing the number of US troops supporting the military and police in the country.
Correspondents say that in the last few weeks, the suicide victims in Kabul have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government, their politics, and in particular in the name of President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA decides to delay the smog rule to appeal
The U.S. Environmental Protection Authority has a decision to delay a regulation of the Obama government, suspending which states are obliged to suspend the emission of smog-producing emissions. This happened one day after 15 states declared the agency because of the move.
The EPA announced on Wednesday the decision to advance the so-called "Ozone Regulations 2015", and said it showed the Agency's obligation to cooperate with States.
"We believe in dialogue with and react to our state partners," said EPA Chief Scott Pruitt in a statement.
Pruitt had announced in June the intention of the EPA to measure ozone-related emissions in a part of the country in order to determine where cuts need to be made in order to comply with stricter air quality standards - to delay one year until October 2018.
A group of 15 mostly democratic states, together with the Colombian area, filed a complaint on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal.
The government of President Donald Trump has tried to bring back a wide range of environmental concerns raised by former President Barack Obama as part of a wider agenda that, according to Trump, is expected to call for economic growth.
However, efforts have triggered the return of the Democrats and Nature Protection Groups, which are concerned about the effects of higher emissions on public health.
The EPA website says that the breathing of air, the ozone, contains "reducing lung function and can enhance respiratory symptoms" such as asthma.
The Community is seeking a common area
At the end, the decision was clear: in two votes, the municipality of Fluorne-Winzeln decided to establish a Community space in the future old-age housing facility.
Before the discussion there is an important information: the purchase contract for the missing property is signed, said Mayor Bernhard Tjaden.
While it will still take time for the church community to be part of the community, there is no longer any planning barrier for the project to be approved by a private investor.
There is a discussion on a Community area for this.
One of the two investors who are still on the boat has offered to resist the community.
On the ground floor, he would provide a living area - about 55 square meters - and a adjacent terrace with yet 70 square meters area for a special price.
The administration and the majority of the municipality are required to provide such a Community space not only as a meeting point for the residents of the elderly, but also to enter the community openly.
For example, the word "strickcafé" ran.
The decision already taken by the provision of appropriations for the current budget in the last autumn will be welcomed by means of incentives.
The building is located in the repair area.
The establishment of a Community space, as reported by Tjaden, would be beneficial by 60 per cent of 30 per cent.
The proposal for a decision is designed to signal to the investor that in this respect it is not intended to be thrown into a knot between the legs, the finding that both satellites - what is borrowed from the environment - as well as pultdach - would be possible to reduce the height of the grapes and make the construction more economical.
Unnecessary, that's not just Wilfried Sohmer, be this addition.
If it helps, he's going to pass the body on his own.
It is not that simple for the Community.
Daniela Ruf refers to many of his own buildings, with which one does not get so far, to which one now leans in the community room from the window, she says, "I am making it hard for me to do so."
Yvonne Staiger is certainly speaking for the Community - however, absolutely against a municipal participation.
It then sees a hidden subsidy to no longer an asset or even an external investor.
That is not the case, because the acquisition of the area does not give you any subsidies, but it does get a real, marketable counter-value in the event of doubt, the opposite is the case.
The proposal for a decision to be distributed in accordance with the rules of procedure shall be submitted by three sponsors.
In this way, two votes remain in the original programme, as Stefan Haller sums up: "If we take the decision so, we will take a huge step to close a huge gap in our infrastructure."
Collision with car: Radler speeds on the road
At the crossroads, an 82-year-old bicycle driver was taken by a car on Wednesday in Garath.
As the police reported, the 82-year-old Langenfelder was on the way to Hilden at 12.20 a.m. with his bike on the road of the Black Road.
The senior wanted to cross the road at the height of the road On the Buchholzer Busch.
A Pkw leader in the same direction gave him priority.
When the Langenfields went on the road, however, he evidently did not pay attention to the opposite.
He was with a car that controlled a 66-year-old Hildener.
The man was rushed to the street.
He suffered serious injuries and was taken to a hospital by a rescue car.
FC Bayern Munich must abandon David Alabama and Thiago at the Supercup against Borussia Dortmund
The Supercup takes place without it: David Alabama has to let the game against Dortmund dry.
With personal care, the FC Bayern travels to Dortmund for the first time in the new season.
Seven professionals are missing the title defender in the Supercup against the Pocalian.
The staffing of the German football recordmaker Bayern Munich will be increasing ever more in front of the Supercup on Saturday (20.30/ZDF and Eurosport) at Pokalsieger Borussia Dortmund.
Trainer Carlo Ancelotti must also ignore David Alabama in duel with the BVB.
This was confirmed by the Italians on Friday.
The Munichs also lack Manuel Neuer, James, Thiago, Jerome Boaeng, Arjen Robben and Juan Bernat.
For the five defeats in the past six test games, Ancelotti has made the physical state and the missing balance in the game of his team.
"We know that we are not in the best physical constitution," Anceloti said, adding: "The most important point is the balance of the team.
It wasn't good lately."
The 58-year-old, however, believes in an increase in performance in the first official duty game of the season.
" Football is also tactics, strategy, personality and motivation.
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities.
The team is ready.
We want to play intelligently," said Anceloti, who expects a "hard, intense game".
The duel of the two German football weights draws fans into their bands.
The party was sold with 81,360 spectators, the Deutsche Football League (DFL) announced on Friday.
Walk in the resin of stars to stars
In Harz, the first "Star Path" is to be created throughout the country.
This is planned by the association Sternwarte Sankt Andreasberg.
There is a planet trail in Göttingen - since 2003.
A "Star Path" met the need for information from many Harz visitors, it was called.
It combines nature, science, movement and sports performance.
The members want to build along the planned route tables and inform about stars and constellations.
In a first phase until 2018, the association plans "goodly accessible installations in five to six locations" in the Upper Harz.
Inquiries come from St. Andreasberg, Braunlage, Highhegit and Sieber.
The information on the tables should be added via the Internet.
Therefore, in selecting the location, a good mobile reception plays a role.
Freedom of access is also a criterion.
Later, the star path will be extended by train.
"At the star path, the viewers learn a lot of knowledge, for example, about the physics of the individual stars," the association explained.
In addition, they learned why stars had different colors or why one star was brighter than another, although it was essentially further away.
It will also be provided in which star is a selected star and when it is best to see it.
Since 2014, the association has been operating in the mountains of St. Andreasberg in the highest state of Northern Germany.
The location in the middle of the National Park Harz is listed by the Federal Nature Protection Office in the six darkest regions in Germany.
Often from there the Milky Way and even the Andromeda galaxy are clearly visible.
Since 2003, at the initiative of the Association of Planetarium Göttingen there has been something similar to the planned starry - the planetary path.
Starting at Gebhard's hotel in the Goetheallee, which forms the interior of our solar system, the planet's path leads up to the Hainberg and the Star War - as well as a "outland" location in Diemarden (Community of Similars) with the planet Sedna.
The cells with the individual planets - including the pluto degraded to the two planets at the end - are exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion.
So the earth collapses into a sphere of 6.5 millimeters diameter, while the exact sun, 75 meters away, still measures 70 centimeters.
The entire distance of the planet's path is good four kilometers.
While the light from the sun to the pluto takes about eight hours, pedestrians need a good hour to stand with pluto.
So pedestrians are faster than the light in the world.
But the march to the next fix star would take another half year.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discuss a possible showdown
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who were supposed to be in a collision course to stage the most exciting box struggle in the near future under 147 pounds, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms in ESPN offices in Los Angeles, to Garcia, the unbeatable World Boxing Council Lightweight Champion, the flur went down to welcome Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization Super-Federweight Champion.
After Garcia's victory by unanimous decision about the former four-division world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday on showtime, both fighters are members of the Top Five Pounds for Pounds list.
Garcia stretched out his right hand and said, "What's up, champ?
I wish you a lot of luck."
Lomachenko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday night at 7 pm on ESPN.
When the couple posted for photos, Lomachenko manager Egis noticed that a possible showdown between the fighters would be the "perfect size order".
"I am a former springweight," Garcia recalled.
"I'm up for Broner [on 140 pounds], but I'm not that big.
I'm small for 140.
I want to get down to light weight.
And he has to move on lightweight [135 pounds] and then we fight.
That's what the fans want.
Let us give them that."
Lomachenko agreed.
"Boxes need this fight."
Climate asked whether it should be on pay-per-view, part of a strategy that Lomachenko has to fight with a 135-pound debut this year in order to agree a date (37-0, 30 knockouts) next summer with Garcia, who also has interest in fighting the winners of Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell after their lightweight title struggle in the forum on 23 September.
"This fight could take place in pay-per-view mode because all fans have asked for it," Garcia said and later expressed himself openly to fight the network that offers the best financial package.
We're the best.
No other names can produce this kind of attention.
Whenever they're ready ... "
Garcia said he appreciates Lomachenko as "a huge fighter", and perhaps he will participate in his Saturday fight.
But Lomachenko kept up with the generous praise for Garcia and said that he thought the three-man champion from Riverside looked "very slow, I'm sorry Mikey ... you wanted the Ko-aus".
Garcia said the focus is to show strength, then box.
They both said they could feel the moment that was built up for their own struggle.
"This is the fight that must be carried out.
No other fight creates so much attention and enthusiasm.
I am more than happy to work on it," Garcia said.
Lomachenko said, "I've waited for the top fighters, and that's Mikey.
It'll be a great fight."
Four injured by tires
In the case of an A7 accident, four persons were injured in part on Thursday afternoon.
According to the first information, the driver of an Opel Zafira lost control of his vehicle shortly before the market outlet.
The Pkw slipped right into the bush where he crossed and then remained on the roof in the green strip.
The four inmates - two adults and two children - were partially injured in the accident.
During the first delivery of the injured by the rescue service, the A7 was closed to the north for about an hour, followed by traffic on the left lane at the accident site.
Fortunes Hoffmann: "Drier chain works better"
Andre Hoffmann hopes after 2:2 the season up against Braunschweig that the optimization of the defense formation will lead to points.
Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the first season, and with the result, there would not have been the two opponents at 2:2 against the braunschweig.
"These were two opponents too much, and we need to be more careful in Aue," says the rebel of Fortune Düsseldorf.
In the Erzberge, the triary chain should also be further optimized.
And a door after a break, the fortunes don't even want to catch up.
"For the future it will be so that no one will stand on the line next to Michael (Rensing)."
Hoffmann is convinced that his team will be better qualified even after the experience in preparing with the trier chain than with the four-string.
"I still don't know how we're going to act in the eye," says coach Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is sure of his thing, "because we have players who can build well in the trier chain at the semi-positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann," Hoffmann said.
"Provision is, but that we are even better at harmonizing and we do not make so many play mistakes in the construction."
Of course, Hoffmann also leads to Aue to win the game.
"But if one can talk after a disagreement from a wrong start, he doesn't know.
The performance could be quite okay," Hoffmann said.
"But if we stand there on Sunday with four points and can focus on the pool, we will certainly be able to talk about a regular seasonal rise."
His coach didn't want to know anything about it.
"The start of the season I will judge only after six to eight days," said Friedhelm Funkel, who did not want to speak of an advantage over the eye, only because the game of the Saxons in Heidenheim had to be cut off in advance because of a storm.
"Now they can start the season almost with a home game," Funkel and Hoffmann said that the players from Aue might even be something fresher, as they had no heavy and complete game like Fortune against an uphill favorite in the bones.
"But they don't know exactly where they are at the moment," says the Fortuna Interior Defender.
Although the guests from the Rhineland go to the meeting at the final (fast) stadium of Aue as a lighter favorite on Sunday.
"That we take them away, just because we have the claim to come under the first six, is bloodsinn," says Funkel, whose balance is completely positive with only one defeat against Aue from nine games.
"There is no team in the 2nd federal league that must be beaten from the front," explains Fortunes Chefcoach.
"It would be arrogant and excessive to make such a statement."
And so Funkel doesn't want to experience his players on Sunday.
New results of the Swedish Asyl-Alter assessment test published
The latest results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden, which were subjected to a new method for the medical evaluation of their age, show that more than 80 percent of tested persons are older than 18 years old. But not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish authority for forensic medicine (rechtsmedicinallverket) began the tests last year.
During the asylum procedure, they should make the assessment of the age more accurate after the Swedish Migration Authority (Emigrant Agency) has been criticised for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were minors.
To date, 6,880 migrants have been sent to test cases and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from mid-March to 31 July 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) were assessed as 18 or older, while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was "maybe 18 or older".
In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person is "maybe under 18 years of age".
The tests are carried out only in cases where the age of the person is questioned.
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results have been constant over the past months.
"We don't see any big difference in the statistics of the past months, the numbers are pretty constant," he said in The Local magazine.
The high proportion of cases in which the person was judged to be over 18 does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker lied about his age.
In May, the Agency published the results of 581 tests and said there were 442 cases that "suggest that the investigated person was 18 years old or older".
When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet investigated the results published in 581, she found that in 243 of these cases the person had said that it would be 18 years old this year.
The method of medical age assessment, in which X-ray recordings of stents and MRT recordings of knee joints, then analysed by dentists and radiologists, were also criticised in some areas.
One skeptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose work involves assessing the biological tires of people to see if they were going through puberty sooner or later than usual.
"I had reason to think about it, and I don't think the type of measurement should be used.
To evaluate the biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't say for sure, we shouldn't do as much as we could," said the Metro newspaper.
Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, however, defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general you can say that the risk of misjudgeing a child as adults is low.
The biggest risk lies when the person is almost under 18, in this case it is about 10 percent."
Full Plan
The work on the three bridges of the Landstraße 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is well advanced.
On Wednesday, a seven-ton heavy concrete part was installed at the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach.
"We're very good at the time, it's going great," says Reinhold Light, construction director at the Department of Roads and Transport in the Freiburg Government Bureau.
At the same time, in April, the work began on all three bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach.
The builder is scheduled for October and easy is sure that the schedule will be kept.
The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads across the Trombach.
It is a concrete weaving bridge that is decorated with red bottomsandstone and has a total length of 4,80 metres.
It was built in 1900.
Like the other two bridges, it has now come into the years.
In order to ensure stability and road safety, the three buildings are now thoroughly repaired.
The two other bridges lead over the Lauterbach.
They're made of red bottomsandstone.
Both were built in 1939 and are twelve, i.e. 10.60 meters long.
The bridge at Lauterbach’s entrance has now received on the north side on Wednesday morning a 1,30 meters wide and seven tons heavy so-called bridge cap.
This is a border anchorage which is also used as an operating route.
The southern part of the bridge is to be used on Friday a 2,20 metres wide bridge.
It is then to be followed by the trail.
The special thing is that it is manufacturing parts, a patent of Schramberger Company Dizwo.
The other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps.
A special feeling of fingertips has required the laying of lines through the construction in Lauterbach.
Because there is also a glass fibre cable that is connected to many companies.
The residents were informed in advance of the work on the project by handbook.
In addition, fish and crabs had to be fished first.
For the bridges between the building and the building, in the direction of Schramberg, traffic is regulated by a lamp.
For the construction work at the bridge at the Lauterbacher village entrance, the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels "Tannenhof" and "Sieben Linden" is fully blocked.
The cost of the three bridges is EUR 700 000 in total.
The whole country is financed.
AfD in Gerolstein: Bunter Protest with German potato salad
It is not so often that parties draw on a string, but when it comes to the alternative for Germany (AfD), it comes together, which is otherwise only difficult to bring under a hat.
The parties represented in the Kreistag Vulkaneifel (CDU, SPD, Green, FDP, FWG, Left) are part of a broad alliance, which shows a peaceful flag on this day, because the AFD in the Gerolsteiner Stadthalle Rondell introduces the poster "great electoral campaign".
And famous names begin - like Alice Weidel, who together with Alexander Gauland forms the top duo for the Federal elections on September 24th, and the Deputy Federal President Beatrix von Storch.
But those who are already hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the AFD students, but demonstrate.
The word "the evil remains."
Originally the city picnic was planned under the motto "All on a table" on the well, but is now taking place in the parking lot below the Rondell - and thus directly in front of those who come to the AFD event in the city hall.
A colourful picture that is available there.
And what Christa Karoli, the chairman of the Forum A world and one of the major organizers, really rejoices: "Great how many people have come together here."
There is music and every amount of food, including a "Urdusian potato salad, which could also eat the AFD without problem", says the woman who brought it.
The police have ordered many officers to go to Gerolstein, and it shows the presence at the train station, which is only a few metres away from the venues.
How did the AFD actually come to Gerolstein?
Mario Hompes reports from the AfD Vulkaneiefel, he has been working on such an event and has received the award.
The 45-year-old from Gönnersdorf had first requested in Daun, but there was a discount because of the already built Laurentius farms there were not enough parking places.
So the Rondell, Hompes, is pleased that "we can have such a nice event here."
With a view to the event at the roundground, he says, "This is the good right of people, the main thing, it remains peaceful".
The same is true: By 20 o'clock in the roundground, there is a band for entertainment, in the town hall of various Redners, including the Rhineland-Pfalzian AFD president Uwe Young.
In the hall there are about 200 listeners who expect the top candidate for the federal day election, Alice Weidel, and the Deputy Federal President Beatrix von Storch to keep their speech.
The police presence is unchanged, but so far the officers had a quiet evening.
A little more than an hour lasts the AFD event, the guests on the ground have a longer breath, but also there it is just 21 hours away.
The police can cancel - no special events.
Trompte's crew
A rehearsing with the Wolfach Posaunist Frederic Belli there is in the series Haslacher monastery concerts tomorrow, Sunday, at 20 o'clock in the monastery church.
Together with the Bulgarian trumpeter Miroslav Petkov, he presents a concert under the motto "Black sea meets on black forest", or also "Balkan folklore" meets a classic German training with roots in blasphemous music.
Both soloists are winners and prize winners of numerous international competitions and have solo positions in European high-level orchestras.
Thus Petkov Solotrompeter is the renowned Concertgebouw Orchestra Amsterdam and Frederic Belli is a soloosaunist of the SWR Symphony Orchestra.
Both combine the desire not only to exceed the limits on their instruments but also to blend the boundaries of the different genres.
This is how Johann Sebastian Bach, in the case of the two new walls, Daniel Schnyder's "World Music" unites with Bulgarian folklore, and in the piece of "Exchange Suite" by Jazz Prize winner Nils Wgram, classics, jazz and the free play are mixed into a fascinating art.
This core part of the programme was launched this spring with huge success in Freiburg.
The renowned composer Nils Wogram wrote it specifically for the two musicians and more: The Haslacher monastery with its special acoustics will be included in the concert.
Kristen Stewart talks about her bisexuality
"Some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives.
But I want to try everything," says Kristen Stewart openly about her bisexuality.
"If I bite in grilled cheese once, I think, 'Oh, that was cool, what comes next?'
The most well-known relationship of the Hollywood star was with her "Twilight" colleague Robert Pattinson, who finally became bitter.
Despite all this, the brown painter assures against the "Harper's Bazaar" magazine: "I was in love with everyone I've dated.
Or do you think I'd play it?"
After her separation, Christians admitted that she was bisexual: "I have always lived and seriously believed in dualism.
So it's never bothered or hindered me.
I just never wanted to be taken seriously."
Especially among them she suffered, according to "Bang Showbiz" but in school time, when she preferred to dress like a bub: "Not all girls are typical girls.
That really hurt me a lot.
When I was eleven, the kids told me I'd look like a bug.
I really felt attacked, frightened, and embarrassed.
Now I look back and think to myself, 'Friends, be proud of you!'
Especially to the public, they don't like to explain their love life: "People expect you to behave in a certain way and that upsets me.
And maybe some call me unappreciable, but I don't like to have to justify myself in front of the whole public."
The governor of West Virginia announces that he is changing the party
The democratic governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced on Thursday evening in a press release with President Trump that he will change the party.
Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have distanced themselves from me," said Governor Justice.
"Today I will tell you with many prayers and much thought ... today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia, I cannot help you any more if I am a democratic governor."
The news broke out in jubel.
"In the morning I will change my registration to the Republicans," Justice added.
"As a coach, I'd say it's time to play another game."
Mr. Trump promised a great announcement at the West Virginia Rallye.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia with 42 points, and Justice did not approve the democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, according to Forbes of the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states, and has acquired a coal business from his father.
It's worth about $1.59 billion.
In the meantime, the Republican National Committee made a statement on Thursday evening, saying: "The change of the party of Governor Justice is another blow to a democratic party that would prevent us from working more than to make our country great again."
"With only 15 governments and the control of the smallest legislative bodies in history, the announcement of Governor Justice is only the last rejection of a party that is from the top to the bottom without leadership and is unable to find a positive, unanimous message," RNC President Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News.
Coe praises "honest" Russian apology for doping scandal
On Thursday, the world leader of light athletics, Sebastian Coe, praised what he described as an obvious apology from Russia as a doping scandal, but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be admitted back to the sport.
Russia's Light Athletic Chief Dmitry Shylakhtin said during the IAAF Congress on the night before the Light Athletic World Championships that the ban on his country from sports was correct and that he was determined to fight doping.
He said he felt sorry for "all athletes who were taken away from gold and silver medals at competitions".
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress agreed to maintain the ban, which was suspended in November 2015 after receiving a report from the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) on State-funded Doping in Russia.
"I thought it was a very open answer today, a very honest presentation," IAAF President Coe told the reporters.
"The entire Council and Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation had recognized itself that it had experienced some rather hot times and would do everything possible to ensure that the Federation was redesigned."
Coe said he was also "happy" that Russia would accept the criteria for its reintroduction.
"I think it was a very constructive day, and I think progress has been made, but the Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to re-use Russia," Coe said.
"We have to do everything in the coming months to normalise this situation.
The guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the corrupt system," he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes will become neutral players in the Light Athletics World Championships, which begin on Friday in London, according to the strict IAAF criteria.
The head of the IAAF Task Force, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia had to meet some of the criteria for re-setting.
Drug testing is still insufficient and banned trainers are still working free, he said reporters in London after a lecture at the IAAF Council.
Grief for soldiers who have been beaten in Mali
At a mourning party in the Nordic Fritzlar, about 1,000 people thought of the two soldiers surrounded by a helicopter crash in Mali.
The ceremony took place on Thursday in the city of Dome under high security conditions.
For the unexplained cause of disruption, Minister of Defence Ursula of the Leyen (CDU) said nothing.
She referred to the two pilots who came in, but as the "Knowledge of her skill".
"We refuse this highest sacrifice they have made on behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany," she explained.
The 33-year-old Major and the 47-year-old Stabshauptmann from North Hessen were killed on Wednesday one week ago in West African Mali.
Her pain was transferred to Germany and accompanied on Thursday by a death watch of the Federal Defense in the Fritzlar Dom Sankt Peter.
In the middle of the day, only the members of the church were divorced.
After that, the party began in the circle of family, close friends, from representatives of the fedswehr and politics.
Among these were Hessen's Prime Minister Volker Bouffier (CDU) and the Inspector General of the Bundeswehr Volker Wieker.
Regretts put roses down, the relatives stood arm in arm to the wounds.
Before the church, Fritzlars and numerous soldiers persecuted the ceremony on a canvas wall.
The Minister of Defence of Leyen referred to the soldiers who came in as "highly decorated" and used experience.
The Stabshauptmann has built up the air operations of the fighter-screwing tiger in Fritzlar and has been one of the first six trained tiger pilots of his regime.
Volker Bauersachs, commander of the government to which the soldiers belong, also stated: "If this occupation could not avoid the collapse, then no one would have been able to do so."
Doubts at the UN mission in Mali did not show the minister of Leyen: the use is dangerous.
But he was also of high importance "for a country from which we are separated only by two states," she said.
After the fire of grief, the sorrows were brought out of the grave.
When and where they were ordered, the German defence did not provide any evidence.
Prince Henrik doesn't want a grave next to his wife.
The man of the Danish Queen Margrethe (77), Prince Henrik (83), does not want to be married to his wife after his death.
This was shared by the Royal House on Thursday.
Traditionally, the Danish royal couple is added to the Domkirk of Roskilde.
The sculptor Bjørn Nørgaard already prepared a sarcophagus for the two.
The Queen agreed with the decision of her husband, as stated in the communication.
Where Prince Henrik is buried, it's still unclear.
But he did not intend to be added to his French home.
Prince Henrik had never made a hero out that he was not happy with his title.
After the throne of his wife Margrethe in 1972, he would like to become king.
In 2016 he went to rest and also left the title "Prinzmahl".
Since Henrik in Denmark did not receive the title and function he wanted, he did not consider himself equal to his wife - not even after death, Lene Balleby, the chief speaker of the Danish Royal House.
Where the last resting place of the 83-year-old will finally be, be unclear.
However, he did not intend to be employed in his French home, but in Denmark.
He likes the country he's worked for in the last 50 years.
The famous Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, son of a French noble family, had known Margrethe in London in 1965.
He worked on the theme in the French message.
While his later wife was always fleeing the people's sympathies, Prince Henrik had a difficult situation in his nearly 50-year reign in Denmark.
In an autobiography Henrik said about the first years in Denmark: "Just a few months after I arrived, everything I did was criticised.
My Danish was swinging, I preferred wine instead of beer, silk rumps instead of stick socks, lemon instead of Volvo, tennis instead of football.
Even for the Gauloises I smoked instead of Virginia-Tabak and those in this country had the call to be the brand of society's critical intellectuals, I couldn't hope to be sober.
I was different.
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not ashamed of myself.
That was the same two mistakes!"
Minister because he wants to quickly re-election
CDU and FDP before a possible majority in Lower Saxony
The Dutch Prime Minister, Stephan Weil (SPD), after the loss of the red-green majority of the government for a rapid re-election of the country's day, does not want to go back.
Because on Friday, he spoke for the resolution of Parliament.
In the past, the surprising withdrawal of a Greens member from his country's group in the Netherlands had put the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the official date of the elections, the red-green coalition in Hanover lost its narrow majority in Parliament to the opposition from CDU and FDP.
The former Green-Registor Elke Twest justified her step with the non-nomination for the 2018 election in her round of elections in Rotenburg (Wumme).
"I see my political future in the CDU," she explained in Hanover on Friday.
CDU fractional leader Björn Thumler wants to recommend his group to take it.
Thus CDU and FDP together had 69 seats in the Low-Saxon Land Day, SPD and Green 68 seats.
So far, the relationship has been reversed.
The new land day will be scheduled for the following year on 14 January.
Thumler said that the red-green country government should now decide whether to continue ruling in this situation without a majority.
However, Stephan Weil considers it essential that the land day decides its self-resolved solution as quickly as possible.
The CDU will be expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday.
The country constitution also foresees the possibility that the Prime Minister will be given the opportunity of taking confidence and choosing a successor on the ground day.
"Our Constitution offers several options.
These possibilities need to be legally examined clean," said Thumler.
"All questions will be discussed in peace if they are legally examined."
Thümler called Twesten's step "but something weird."
The politician himself said, "I'm not a traitor.
I feel very good."
She named herself a supporter of Black-Green.
The Greens called on the derogatory Members to return to their term of office.
"We of course assume that she has been given her land-day mandate, which she has received over the green country list, with immediate effect," said the presidents Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Körner.
The group president of the Green Anja Piel said, "We regret the decision of every West."
She decided not to hold a debate in the Group.
"Even in the background that there were no differences in content, we cannot follow this step."
SPD Chancellor Martin Schulz condemns the abuse of the Lower-Saxon Green Deputy Every Twest to the CDU as a traitor.
"The behaviour of the former Greens in Lower Saxony is not only a betrayal of voters and voters, but also a betrayal of the Reds," the Federal Head of Social Democrats wrote on Facebook on Friday.
He supported the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) to allow the country day to be re-elected.
The West Austria costs the majority of Red-Greens in Niedersachsen.
Politicians place their personal interests "in their hurt vanity and in their hunger before the good of the country," SPD Secretary General Hubertus Heil criticised.
"It is a scandal that the CDU in Lower Saxony co-operates and tries to beat political capital."
Niedersachsen's CDU fractional leader Björn Thumler wants to recommend his deputies to take every test to the CDU.
The head of the SPD Group on the Bundestag, Thomas Oppermann, suggested that Twesten fake the outcome of the 2013 elections with personal careers.
The CDU was then the strongest force before the SPD, the SPD and the Greens had a thin majority of a voice on the land day.
Minister of Agriculture in Interview - How do we protect ourselves from poisons, Mr Schmidt?
Germany is discussing fertilized eggs.
How could the scandal happen?
How can consumers protect themselves?
Minister for Agriculture Christian Schmidt (CSU) is in the interview with the Editorial Network Germany (RND) speech and response.
Mr Schmidt, how can consumers protect themselves from poisoned eggs?
I can only encourage all consumers and consumers to look at the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamp.
At the Consumer Protection Portal www.Food warning.de, the Federal countries present the latest information on the egg charges concerned.
The eggs concerned should be destroyed or returned.
Even if, according to everything we know at present, a health hazard is practically excluded.
Is Aldi now taking over the best possible crisis response - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the respondent is not really being taken into account by the Federal Minister of Agriculture?
Food monitoring is the task of the federal countries.
Nevertheless, my house has been switched off immediately and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since the announcement of Germany's concern.
All information and risk assessment are available to the consumer.
Trade has the same responsibility as the manufacturers to ensure that the products sold are transportable and healthy.
If the maximum residue level of 0,005 mg/kg is exceeded in eggs, they are not transportable.
Unloaded eggs, however, can be sold and consumed.
This time, the companies are not guilty.
Are production companies and consumers sitting on the same boat?
According to the current level of knowledge, production companies are not directly liable.
However, they must be treated with economic damage due to the excessive illegal practices of service companies.
As always, there are too few controllers in the event of a serious accident.
Is there only a lack of staff or the key responsibility?
It was precisely the official controls that revealed the process.
However, it is also true that food fraud and criminal energy can never be excluded by 100 percent.
This is precisely why a consistent explanation of such events and the transfer to the public prosecutors in cases where criminal offences can be found is crucial.
I have already made it clear many times that I expect the responsible authorities to be able to make a clear statement.
Is regular alarmism really necessary in food scandals?
Consumers and consumers have the right to obtain only safe and transportable food.
If an unauthorized insecticide is used in the food industry, consumers and consumers are properly encouraged.
By means of the tapestries, manufacturers, dealers and consumers have become in a situation that is absolutely not necessary.
In principle, the legal use of the insecticide Fipronil in the treatment of food-producing animals is not acceptable and must be terminated without delay.
This must be done consistently and with high pressure at all levels.
I expect from all the competent authorities that the matter will be clarified in a timely and unmistakable manner.
How the financial rules of football on Neymars move to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing the unhindered expenditure of the European Football Associations will not interfere with the transfer of Neymars World Record from Spanish Barcelona to French Paris-Saint Germain.
Some consequences will still come for Paris Saint-Germain from UEFA, because the leading organisation that monitored the European game has the power to ban teams from accessing the prestigious Champions League tournament.
Financial fair-play rules, which were launched by UEFA in 2011, mean that PSG must at some point prove that the transfer of Neymar was financed without major losses.
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ($262 million) to buy the Brazilians out of his contract, and Neymar will receive an amount of several ten million dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's transfer to France.
The PSG can secure the money to sign Neymar and bring him into a galaxy of other stars, given the funding of the team by the power-rich family of Qatar.
Associations may spend a lot of money on the acquisition of players, but they have to compete with legitimate revenue sources that allow them the Break-even point in their football-related business.
FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA president in 2007.
The former French player believed that associations that had committed enormous debts in their pursuit of success had effectively deceived and risked ruining themselves if banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, FFP withdrew from the focus on the club's debt to monitor its losses.
The change meant that the business model used by Roman Abramovich originally in 2003 in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily in order to improve the team and build a global brand - should become a tougher issue.
During the current three-year FFP recovery period, which runs until 2018, Clubs can take losses of EUR 30 million.
And although Platini has fallen to Hungary in 2015, his UEFA successor, Alexander Ceferin, continues to be afraid of excessive spending.
"Surely FFP is not dead and we will certainly strengthen the rules for the future," said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for the UEFA, compared to The Associated Press last week.
Although the PSG has paid Neymar's buy-out clause in a simple scale, it can distribute the amount for the billing over the duration of its contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract so that the redemption amount for the next five years can be set at EUR 44.4 million in the year-end.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, the PSG, together with Abu Dhabi, who is owned by Manchester City, faced the most severe sanctions.
The PSG received a fine of 60 million euros (then 82 million dollars) which was reduced to 20 million euros later - and it was arranged that the team members for the 2014/15 Championships League remain limited to 21 players instead of the other normal 25 players.
UEFA is looking for a club that could try to list its financial supervision by pushing its revenues through companies that are connected with the owners of a club.
While a Turkish company could sponsor the PSG if the value of sponsorship was to exceed the standard market rates, UEFA would not allow this to be considered as legitimate income.
That is exactly what happened in 2014, when UEFA decided that the value of sponsoring the PSA was set up by the Qatar Tourism Authority.
It was reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come to Qatar on payments made by the WM 2022.
But PSG and Katar 2022 argued that Neymar would become WM ambassadors and that such a manoeuvre could be easy to find for UEFA regulatory authorities.
The previous sanctions against PSG mean that the UEFA will be even more sensitive to any attempt to comply with the rules.
UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG about Neymars transfer, said on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation.
They spoke under the terms of the anonymity with The Associated Press, as they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.
The latest published reports show that PSG 2015/16, with a turnover of EUR 542.4 million, has achieved a profit of more than EUR 10 million.
The accounts for the last financial year still have to be published.
PSG expects Neymars' arrival to be a blessing for sponsoring deals, marketing and trikot sales.
The association assumes that after the signature the sales will increase by at least 30 per cent.
The Spanish league was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players, and she tried to prevent Neymar's move by claiming that PSG would hurt the FFP.
"It is a clear case of "financial doping" with the club and the state," said the president of La Liga, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar's final ownership of PSG.
Arsenal Manager Arsenal Wenger, whose association is owned by an American sports tycoon, shares La Liga's reservation against a state that is financing a association.
"It is the consequence of ownership and this has completely changed the entire football landscape in the last 15 years," said Wenger on Thursday.
"As soon as a country has an association, everything is possible.
It will be very difficult to respect the financial fairplay because you can go different ways or have different interests if a country has such a big actor to represent a country."
Swiss is looking for a new shoe supplier
In the past years, Chocolate Frey has produced chocolate for the Swiss.
Now the following cooperation is ahead of a possible end: the airline re-writes the order.
Swiss speaker Meike Fuhlrott confirmed, at the request of the news agency, a corresponding report from the newspaper "Northwest Switzerland" on Friday.
Under current planning, the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018.
The products would be reviewed every two to three years and subject to quality control.
"We are very pleased with the current supplier Chocolate Frey," the speaker said.
Approximately 17 million small redboards packed up to 14 grams per year distribute the air carrier before landing to the passengers.
The Swiss did not want to give any information about the costs.
Industry insiders estimate the order volume according to "North-West Switzerland" to 1.5 to 2 million francs - the Migros daughter achieves an annual turnover of around one billion francs.
But more important is all the advertising effect: for a shoe manufacturer it is a prestigious order.
As many applicants exist in the new tender, the Swiss does not want to betray.
However, only Swiss manufacturers come in question.
According to the newspaper report, Chocolat Frey intends to seek further renewal of the Spring 2018 Treaty.
For the sda, the largest Swiss chocolate producer was not available for an opinion.
The Swiss chocolate tables have been distributed on board their flights since 2006.
Before the Swiss concluded a contract with Migro's daughter, Barry Callebaut had delivered the chocolate tables in cooperation with Hug.
The possibility to place the logo was introduced by Swiss two and a half years ago with the start of cooperation with Chocolate Frey.
The airline works with various Swiss chocolate producers.
On long-distance flights, the customers of the First Class with lecheries from the Confiserie Sprüngli, in the Business Class weave passengers Shoggi of Lindt and in the Economy Class Shoggi of Chocolate Frey.
Also on the short track, Swiss Schoggi distributes chocolate Frey, both in business and in the economy class.
Light Athletes - Diskus-Olympiaster Robert Harting achieves WM-finals
The three-time world champion fights for a medal on Saturday in the final.
His brother Christoph, the 2016 Olympic winner, was defeated in the national WM decision and was able to watch the discussion competition only by the Tribune.
Also with the first attempt, the Polish champion Piotr Malachowski, the 65,13 meters wide, qualified for the final struggle.
Nostalgia goes to "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective" in the Nice
This repetition of history is also nostalgic because of the glorious days of the 80's, for the 90's-year-old Grunge-era (as the predecessors David Wain and Michael Shawalter turned the Sketch-Comodie "The State" for MTV), and for themselves - that is, for 2001, before their stars, such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd went to bigger things.
As a cultural artifact it is equally a parody and a body of our Facebook-enabled era of permanent memories.
But as Franchise it feels like the time would be short.
"First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not only because of his absurd humor (it included an original history for a speaking dose of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).
By staring at the core of the gag - actors of middle age play noble kids who grow up - they still made it impossible to win back the last part of the joke.
"Ten Years Later", with his adults now playing adults, is less emotionally rooted and his parody goes beyond the caste principle, including a riff on the stalker films of the 90s such as "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle" ("The Hand That Turns the Wave").
At one point a character is crushed by an Apple Powerbook, some inline skates and "a series of other things from 1991".
Many of the central stories are the same.
The beloved Coop (Mr. Showalter), now Roman author, has still not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) has still not lost his youth.
And there's another crazy-major plot that includes Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter) who is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a well-founded impression by Michael Ian Black).
As always, the excursions are the best part of the Franchise.
It is particularly fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rudd, the Matt Dillon's underreliable of "Singles", whose former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy now feels like an old knocker.
It is the moments of random madness that could heat up this Franchise like a kind of repeating "Seven Up!" series until he achieves what I accept as his logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later", whose last scene will show the band how she will visit the movie premieres of "Wet Hot American Summer".
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon now reminds of another kind of nostalgia: the revival of the Cold War of "The Americans", the film "Atomic Blonde" and even the "GLOW" with its east-west Rinkamp iconography.
The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka with Rhys Thomas as director indicates to be a found TV series: a Romanian drama of the 1980s with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest fighting for truth, atheism and the path of Marxism-Leninism.
The main roles - a hard-satisfied Gregor and an idealist Joseph - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, whose dialogues by Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt are synchronized in English.
It's a brilliant idea.
But it's not much more than an idea.
There are some nice gags to watch (the police spend the time watching chess on TV, as Americans might do with football).
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevigny - provides for a decent game 'Find out the voice'.
But "Comrade Detective" is so committed to the truth of a suspicious propaganda drama - a murderer who wears a reagan mask - that it often plays like one.
In six long episodes, the comedy is not fast enough or often enough.
"Comrade Detective", which has been edited for a less long time, could deliver its Agitprop satires better, as Gregor and Joseph are constantly visiting the American message, whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who sneezing a Haupen Hamburger.
The message for the imaginary communist audience is that Western culture can do anything to feed a camp.
The fictional Romanian creators were not wrong: we even do it with our own younger history and with their own.
Fighting Drug Mafia in the country
The police beat the Italian Mafia in Baden-Württemberg.
On Wednesday morning, in the Schwarzwald-Baar-Kreis, in Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart, numerous objects were searched, as the state prosecutor Konstanz announced on Friday.
In this case, 15 accused persons between the ages of 25 and 77 were arrested and already issued arrest warrants against them.
In addition, the officials secured larger quantities of marijuana and cocaine, firearms and several hundred thousand euros.
At the same time, two persons were arrested in Italy.
Against the two suspicious Italians there were German prisoners.
The two are therefore likely to be delivered to Germany.
The action was attended by Italian and Bavarian investigators.
In total, more than 300 police officers were involved.
The members of the Mafia will be subjected to organised drug crime, serious violence, attempted murder and robbery and repression.
Since the summer of 2016, the Public Prosecutor's Office has been investigating the situation against organised drug trafficking in the South German area.
Between the state prosecutors in Konstanz and Palermo there was a regular exchange and the investigators of the Kripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily.
Therefore, on Wednesday, four officers from Palermo were also accompanied.
In view of the studies, Italian nationals were particularly close to the Italian Mafia.
Also, an event on May 27 in Hüfingen, where several shots were fired in a guesthouse early in the morning, should go to the account of the band.
Way of complaint large gaps in the foreign register
"Data of citizens who should not appear there": According to a report, the foreign register in Germany shows significant shortcomings.
This leads to partly grave decisions in asylum procedures.
The Head of Refugee Management of the Federal Government, Frank-Jürgen Way, noted a media report on large gaps in the foreign central register.
Failures to the data registered there could lead to "partially serious decisions" in the case of asylum procedures and removals, warning in an analysis that is available in the "South German newspaper".
According to the list, ten million people with foreign nationality are recorded, including about 5.7 million from non-EU countries.
The data are therefore managed by some 600 foreign authorities in Germany.
Since the data has not been sufficiently processed, the data quality in parts has not been good yet.
In individual cases, data were found from 1921, "of people who are no longer alive, or of citizens who have become German citizens and should not actually appear in the register."
"False data inputs can significantly slow down return processes," the report goes on.
In the statistics on eligible persons, EU citizens are also included, who should not even leave.
However, such misappropriations led to "a distorted debate on how to deal with outbound obligations", says the analysis.
In the meantime, the Federal Government has obviously begun to send refugee families with under 16-year-olds back to Italy when they are travelling from there.
This emerges from an internal paper by the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), reports the "New Osnabrücker Zeitung".
In the paper, then, BAMF has been conducting such procedures "for families with children - with the exception of infants and grandchildren - to Italy since 1 June 2017".
Since the end of 2014, it has been practically impossible, so the newspaper has referred to the difficult situation on site.
After the Dublin Agreement, refugees of the EU state are responsible for their first achievement.
If a migrant moves to another EU country, that country can send him back to the country of entry.
For reasons, the Office now writes: "In the meantime, the recording capacity for families with minor children in Italy has increased significantly."
Italy has provided guarantees for the admission and accommodation of families.
Even the European Court of Human Rights (EGMR) considers these commitments to be sufficient.
Other EU countries would also send refugees back there under the Dublin Agreement.
The inter-political speaker of the Left Group on Bundestag Ulla Jelpke criticised this decision: "Family with children are threatened by the lack of human rights conditions in the Italian asylum system and a danger of child welfare".
Gets the second best result
A total of 220 litres of blood from people living in Oberreichenbach already provided blood donation to other people.
At least twelve of the citizens who were distinguished on Friday.
All ahead of Jürgen Greule, who now shared 50 litres of blood with his 100 donations.
Traditionally, the community in the meeting of the municipality deserves the multiple willingness to give blood.
"It is great how our body is designed for this and we pay tribute to the donors who provide their blood for strangers, even useless," stressed Mayor Karlheinz Kistner.
"A single amount of blood helps several people," explained the chairman of the German Red Cross (DRK), Holger Maizenbacher, because the cans are stored in their parts.
That's how three people could benefit from a blood transfusion.
At the same time, Maizenbacher reported on the actions carried out in the spring in Oberreichenbach.
"In this year, with 114 donors, we achieved the second best result," said the DKK-Creispreparation Manager.
Apparently, the change in the theatre house led to higher participations a few years ago.
Already Thomas Bockstadt, Susanne Reichle, Sandra Schöck, Thomas Reichle and Meta Umbeer were among the multiplicative donors and were awarded 50 awarded for each.
Half so many books Herbert Meir and Dorothee Riexinger, while Tamara Pfromer, Petra Schleeh, Stefanie Stoll and Uwe Veter 10 times a 500 millilitre of her living room.
The Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that the interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the weakening of inflation have dampened speculation over an increase.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain "treasures" when it maintains the interest rates on family income in the middle of a growing pressure.
The Bank’s Monetary Committee (MPC) policy makers agreed with 6 to 2 to maintain interest rates at 0.25%, with fewer members seeking an increase this month, as weak economic growth has weakened the support for an increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts by 1.7% for 2017 and by 1.6% for 2018 and warned that pressure on budget revenue would continue, with inflation expected to rise by almost 3% in the autumn.
But she signaled that in the coming years, interest increases would be needed to raise the inflation fuelled by Brexit and said that credit costs might have to increase more than expected in the financial markets.
The members also agreed to withdraw part of the Mammut economics package, which was issued a year ago after Brexit.
It will call for time for the financing plan to provide cheap funds for banks from the coming February, although it has been said that it is now expected to provide 15 billion pounds more in this system - with 115 billion pounds sterling.
A few minutes after the interest rate decision, the Bank said: "In the central forecast of the MPC, gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak in the short term, as the pressure on households' real income continues to weigh the consumption."
In the interest rates, it repeated that "a certain penalty of monetary policy" would be necessary to cool inflation and a "something larger" extent than the markets expected.
Markets are currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.
However, the Bank stressed that increases would be "step by step" and "limited".
The Bank's below-corrected growth forecasts for this year and next year are compared to the 1.9% and 1.7% forecast in May.
It maintained its growth forecast to 1.8% in 2018.
The pound fell after the news about the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5% to US$ 1.31 and fell by 0.4% to Euro 1.11.
The decision does not change after the latest disappointing growth rates have dampened the rising expectations of interest increases and GDP has risen to 0,3 % in the second quarter of the previous three months.
Growth is expected to be 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will be easy to recover after the bank by the end of the year.
The latest inflation report offers little enthusiasm for households affected by rising inflation and low cost increases, as the increase will be even worse before it becomes better.
She added that in the next few years, monetary policy cannot "stop" income collapse, but she added that the wages will be "clearly" recovered at the end of their three-year forecast.
The economy is also strengthened by the increasing demand for British goods, which is due to the weak fund, which will compensate for some of the lower consumer expenditure.
The decision will come one year after the interest rates fell to 0.25% in the last August following the shocking EU vote that caused the fund to fall.
The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years until prices and the economy are fully reached.
Before the Bank's last judgment on interest rates, the call for interest increases, as inflation increased the pressure on hard-pressed households, with three political decision-makers calling for an increase of 0.5% in July.
Inflation fell from 2.9% last month to 2.6% in June, although the Bank said it was expected and will be withdrawn in the coming months.
The Bank said that the excess in relation to its target of 2 % was "full" to assign to the weak fund.
Andrew Montlake, director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "In view of the recent decline in the swap rates, the mortgage market may again become more competitive, since the creditors are looking for business and want to end the year in a positive way.
The market looks particularly good for those who run the existing deals and close the new mortgages, and many with duty-free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular."
NHS (National Health Service) is expected to place 10,000 people in conflict HIV drugs
Patients will be given access to a "transformative" HIV prevention treatment from September after a struggle before the High Court against the financing of the drug in the NHS.
NHS England reported that a pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) taken prior to sex transport, which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by about 86 percent, is now being delivered by the health service through a first three-year study for estimated 10,000 people.
He declared himself prepared to finance the trial after the Court of Appeal had confirmed a judgment of the Supreme Court last year, under which the NHS had the power to pay for the PrEP despite the claim that the local authorities should finance it.
On Thursday, the Schachtweg was welcomed by NHS England-Chief Simon Stevens as an "significant new intervention", while the National AIDS Trust (NAT) referred to this as a "decisive moment".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to be able to register people, and further clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a consequence of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces the transmission of HIV in infected people.
PreEP before sex is taken means that just enough medication is available in the body of a person to prevent an HIV infection.
Such medicines can be taken every day or two hours before sex.
For those involved in treatment, male or bisexual, transsexual and people with HIV-positive partners who have not been successfully treated.
Appropriate participants are identified in clinics who agree to the study, including men, women, transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral therapy.
People who live in England and are registered with a home doctor may also sign up for possible participation in their local sexual clinics.
The programme will be £10 million and NHS England signed a contract for the supply of medicines this week after an international competitive purchase.
The study should evaluate the overall potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence, as used, taken and implemented in a large degree.
Stevens said: "This great new intervention should complement and overcome the extensive and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It is another milestone in the continued progress over three decades in addressing one of mankind's greatest health challenges."
Deborah Gold, Chief Executive at NAT (National AIDS Trust), said: "This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, if it is targeted at people who are in need and are in danger, offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic.
From September, people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner, leading to the improvement of many, many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement."
Ian Green, CEO of Terrence Higgins Trust, said: "The priority must now be that the study will be carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV will be left behind.
Now that the PrEP test medicine has been obtained, we are in the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV-infected people."
Sharon Hodgson, shadow minister of health, said: "The beginning of the PrEP process is welcome and overcrowded after months of delay and sudden implementation by the government.
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life-changing infection.
This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP.
Now it is important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible throughout the country to protect people who are HIV-infected and that it will help us to take a step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society'.
Living the big life: Intermediate shoe and smarter designer tricks have transformed this little Earls Court apartment into a generous home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, reduced herself from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment in 2014.
It's on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it's a proof for the new design that Joanne didn't pack and sell her bags.
"Before that, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room," says Joanne.
"I was looking for something that was comparable to my price.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and she had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and made an offer on that day."
Since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot apartment has been completely taken over.
Originally a one-room property with a hidden layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add sturaum and an intermediate shoe to make optimal use of the generous ceiling height.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.
That was my request," she says.
To this end, she commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use 12,5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development, but also a place to live for Joanne.
The deck was not large enough to place two spaces over each other, so the architectural challenge was to create an intermediate space where one could stand.
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the default.
"The steelworks are quite complicated," he explains.
"We had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked together, without having to book us.
It was not just to build a simple platform, but to lay the steel so that he had the right height for the function above or below."
This arrangement allowed Erfan to place two rooms in full space - with a lot of additional drama.
For the intermediate shot, a classic copper light window of Retrovius is overlooking the glamorous residential area.
Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and Vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theater, space and light.
On both ends a short corridor is mirrored to allow it to work longer.
In the kitchen, the mirror feels like a window in another room.
At the entrance, mirrored units provide space for all bets and glasses of Joanne.
By observing a more glamorous room, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used.
Interruptible kitchens are nothing new.
The special thing about this is that it's a garage door.
"A bit of engineering went in there," explains Erfan of the reinforced MDF door.
"It's important, so if you lift the door, it's very easy to move."
Thanks to the clever use of space and stauraum, Joanne was able to win an additional 16 m2, an additional bedroom and an improved layout.
"At the end of the day you will sell the base - or how your property is valued," Erfan says.
"In a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and calculate based on the soil size."
Here they have managed to increase the surface and use high-quality materials that offer the space its luxurious advantage.
"The materials are the things you touch and therefore help create an emotional bond in a home," Erfan says.
"You don't fall in love with the electric plugs in the walls.
These are important, but they don't play with your heart."
It shows that an apartment can be transformed by good design and increased square meters from something standard to something completely amazing.
In fact, like Joanne, you could decide not to leave them.
Brothers fight for a 500 million US dollars real estate empire
Two brothers are four decades old after their Italian family founded the Dynasty, in a conflict due to one of the largest real estate empires of Victorias worth over $500 million.
The former director of the 'Carlton Football Club' and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, only three doors away from his younger brother Paul. He brought him to the Supreme Court to explain how his property and business assets should be divided.
Since 2014, Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business, but a sharp dispute over the separation takes place in the Supreme Court.
Together with her mother Anna, the brothers own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, collected since the family bought a business in Smith Street, Collingwood, in 1973.
There the Westco Jeans family founded and grew into a chain of 160 retail shops.
It was sold for $85 million in 1999.
This money was invested in real estate, and the portfolio of De Lutis now includes offices in the city center, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller, as well as shopping centers in the city.
After an agreement with her deceased father, Colin, described by Paul as "the principal operator and the dominant person" in the De Lutis family, describes about two thirds of the company's assets and about one third of Paul's assets.
A legal act says that this means that Colin has property worth $316 million and Paul has a value of $176 million.
The division of property and money has proved to be a problem for Paul.
"The divisions proposed by Colin have left him with what I thought was the best objects," he wrote in a first affidavit in 2015.
The first hearing of the Supreme Court was held on Friday following several cases.
The brothers are now fighting for control of the existing business - from which Colin, as Paul claims, has excluded him.
Colin argues that this is not true, but Paul suggests that some holdings are incompetent to manage.
In an early affidavit presented by Colin, he says he hopes to put up with the fight.
"My Italian heritage predicts that the family is the most important priority," he wrote.
The costs rise, with hundreds of pages with affidavits, e-mails and reports of companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and lawyers' offices held on both sides.
Ms De Lutis and her deceased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated dairy and delicacy businesses from the late 1950s and bought a business in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
They used security to buy the Collingwood property, in which Colin opened the first Jeanslade of the family.
Colin says he started there when he was "in my last years of high school, when Paul was still a little child (about 10 years old)."
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass on their property to their sons.
"Luig often told me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis company group, and Colin claims that Mark was paid $26 million while leaving the company.
Both Luke and Mark, Paul says "have become bitter about the conditions of their financial separation".
Colin stayed very back, although he was a former AFL member and after a 2015 biography by Eddie McGuire, the best friend of the TV star.
Fairfax Media took contact with Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.
Only Colin responded by texting to say "I really can't say much", because the case was before the courts.
"It is very, very sad that my brother Paul has decided to call me and draw our family names through the courts," he wrote.
In mid-2016 Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to meet his brother's demands.
"Our father would not have wanted Paul and I to end in our current struggle," he said, adding that he "always hopes for a solution".
On Friday, this hope seemed to be over.
"Our matter will be resolved in the near future by the courts," Colin wrote.
Trump's new chief of staff plans to restrict the president's media withdrawal.
Others have tried and have failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.
If so, he'll be the first.
Politico reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to restrict the flow of information to President Trump - including the news media reports - in the hope of keeping the Chief on a more uniform course.
Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:
"As John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, met with leading employees on his first day of work, he presented a major problem in President Donald Trump's White House, which he wanted to repair: bad information that came into the President's hands.
Kelly told the employees that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he received good information."
Kelly's diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to cool Trump by monitoring his media diet.
President Trump's relationship with television is back for decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his television industry is still strong.
"If candidate Trump was upset because of an unfair report, it was productive to show him that he received a fair report from authorities that were to be convinced," said former election counselor Sam Nunberg in February against Politico.
Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to maintaining the Twitter habit of Trump, according to six former election officials, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a constant price of praise."
Okay.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habit was once "under control" is ridiculous.
Maybe these campaigners know something we don't know about others - that Trump's Tweets would have contained more fuel without their intervention.
We'll probably never learn something about the tweet that Trump hasn't sent.
If his employees made it a few times to keep anger from him, then their efforts were rewarded.
But no one has ever been able to prevent Trump from calling for controversy.
Part of the problem is that people in a white house, which consists of competing parties, constantly try to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump material that may promote their views from the world.
Politico - which is very busy with this story - reported in May on the preference of the consultant to provide the president with questionable information for strategic reasons.
This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldmaker:
"Current and former Trump officials say that Trump can react like a volcano to negative press outlets, especially those with damaging leaks, and that he can figure out where they come from.
That's exactly what happened in February, when someone accidentally gave the president a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internetprovokator Charles C. Johnson, who accused Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of being "the source behind a hood of Lecks" in the White House.
Although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter because of his sketches, or that he had not offered any concrete evidence, or that he had made false predictions in the past and rejected them.
Trump read the article and started asking employees about Walsh."
Goldmaker added that the then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary-General of the White House, Rob Porter, "have tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper cream, the Trump receives".
How'd it go?
Kelly tries to do the same three months later.
He may prove to be more effective manager as a preebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisors are still striving for influence.
These unchanging factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Most wanted criminals get a post from Europol
Since the address is unknown, the assistance of the population will be sought and sought.
The police all over Europe send (virtual) postcards this summer to dangerous criminals on the run.
Since the addresses of the sought-for offenders are not known naturally, information from the population is sought and sought.
On Friday, Europol reported on the action following the "EU Most Wanted" event calendar from the winter.
The experience had shown that many refugees were hiding at holiday destinations, it has been called Europol.
21 postcards have been compiled for wanted offenders from 21 EU countries.
Since 2016 the website www.eumostanted has been viewed more than 2.5 million times.
36 of the online searches have so far been arrested, at least eleven of them due to indications after publication on the website.
Travelers negotiate a grave and return to the 'Millionary Series'
Some of the most prosperous houseowners of the West Midlands are once again standing with some determined travelers on foot of war who have negotiated a tomb taken by the community to reclaim a field in front of their men's houses.
The travelers parked their 20 caravans on a field outside a well-being street of Solihull, which is called the "Millionary Series".
They brought horses, babies and an army of transporters after they had been thrown out in May, but without being frightened by a tomb dug by the Council to prevent their invasion.
The tactical group found a gap in the defense systems and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained uninhibited to find a way.
Angry inhabitants have harassed the Council of Solihull, who said it was "useless to deal with the problem".
An anonymous resident said, "They were taken there on Monday night after they were sent by Bentley Heath where they threw stones at the passengers.
The Council must be forced into action by shame to implement it, since it was useless in dealing with the problem.
The travelers were there in May, were further moved and are now back.
More came last night, probably more today."
She added: "The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with this by holding long instruction to protect their parks.
I live on the Streetsbrook Road and I am not happy to continue paying my municipal tax if the Council can't even stop it."
A resident who didn't want to be named said, "It's ridiculous, we've just seen the last round of these travelers just for another round.
The numbers have increased this time and you've even seen a horse in the parking area."
A spokesman of the Solihull Council said: "We are aware of an unauthorized camp in the country beyond the Streetsbrook Road and work with the Solihull police. We take the necessary legal steps to move on as quickly as possible.
In order to support our evidence collection, it is very important that as many residents report anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101.
This contributes to creating an image of the situation in which we have to examine the Court when we present our case."
From Birkenhof Waldhotel Luise
From the former hotel Birkenhof the Waldhotel Luise will be located.
The house before the gates of Freudenstadts is currently being renovated and will be reopened on 1 March next year.
That's good news for the city.
Because with the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof by the then Ambiente company mbH on 13 April 2014, about 30 000 nights a year lost its time and also revenues by the Kurt tax.
In the autumn of 2014, the hotel building was offered to the Land Council as a collection meeting, which provided controversial discussions.
The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location.
The decision was not incontrovertible at the time in the municipality.
But above all, the mayor of Freudenstadt, Julian Osswald, defended the hotel location and, at that time, spoke of a growing interest in the house.
He should keep right.
The group of Luisenhotels with Managing Director Birgit Scherer with seat in Bad Bergzabern has purchased the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and will again make it a house of the three-star Plus category named Waldhotel Luise.
The group has four houses with the city of pleasure.
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.
You are called Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.
The former Birkenhof Hotel has been standing in front of the entrance for a long time, and when you enter the house, it will be clear what extensive renovation work is being done.
The floors were dug out, the roofs were partly decomposed, old bathrooms away from the rooms.
The entire hotel building is a single building.
There's still much to be done by March.
"It's actually a nice hotel," says Thomas Scherer in a conversation with our newspaper.
Everything is to be renewed in the black forest style.
The rooms are equipped with large comfortable showers, the entrance area is redesigned, new windows are built.
Everything is to be "beautiful citizens" as Thomas Scherer put it.
"We want to make a beauty out of it."
Swimming pool, wellness area and a meeting room belong to the equipment.
You don't want to be positioned on the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad, but already on a elevated downtown level, sheerer stresses.
The Waldhotel Luise, with its approximately 60 rooms, wants to build wide, explains Scherer.
Both individual holidayers, groups or business people should feel comfortable in the hotel.
Talking to OB Julian Osswald and Tourism Director Michael Krause has already led, so Scherer.
The city's performances are similar to that of the hotel group.
"We're on the same line."
In response to the level of investment, Thomas Scherer does not want to determine himself.
Just under a million euros, he's counting.
The external installations are also brought to Frontermann, which is already clearly visible.
In a courtyard there is a large terrace that will be accessible from the restaurant, which is public.
Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "The city of peace is a good market".
Russia-Affair: US special mediator sets up Grand Jury
In Russia's affairs about US President Donald Trump, special mediator Robert Mueller is expected to have used a so-called Grand Jury after a report.
The board took up the job last week, wrote the Wall Street Journal, calling on people familiar with the matter.
The newspaper considered the step as a sign that Mueller has expanded and intensified his findings.
The CNN broadcaster reported that there were already first lectures of the board in connection with a meeting between Trump's oldest son and a Russian lawyer.
US intelligence services have been accusing the Kremlin of having been targeted in the 2016 presidential election campaign.
Mueller investigates whether there were talks between Trump's election team and Moscow.
The focus of the investigations should be on several men who acted in the election struggle as a adviser to the Republican.
According to reports, Mueller also took more and more Trump's private and business environment under the Lupe.
The Washington Post wrote a few weeks ago that the special mediator Trump had personally gone to the centre and examined the proposal whether the president might have prevented justice in the course of the affair.
The main task of Grand Jurys is to examine the evidence in possible cases and decide whether to file a complaint.
This is why Grand Jurys is also called prosecutors.
In general, they are activated when it comes to larger and controversial cases.
The procedure is always carried out behind closed doors.
The board may also be activated by the Public Prosecutor in order to invite persons to be admitted under oath.
According to CNN's envoy, lectures have already been presented that revolve around the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.
The report called for a statement by those involved in the meeting.
They should also provide documents.
In addition to Trump Jr., Trump's advisers and son-in-law Jared Kushner as well as his then election leader Paul Manafort were involved in the conversation.
Legal experts said on Thursday evening at the US television show that the introduction shows that Mueller does not get intimidated in his work and that he wants to act quickly if necessary.
However, it should not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on at the end to decide on the prosecution.
However, the establishment of the body of the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for concern for President Trump.
In the midst of the new discoveries, the President used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday to represent the Russian affairs as a campaign of his political opponents.
"The history of Russia is a total invention," Trump said.
The topic gives the Democrats an opportunity to "be nice to me because they have nothing else they can talk about".
His Special Adviser Ty Cobb stated in an opinion that he knew nothing about the establishment of a Grand Jury.
But these also usually work in secret, he stressed.
The White House supports any measures that speeded up the work of the Special Representative in a "far" way.
The former FBI chief James Comey has said three times that he will not be found against the president.
There is no reason to assume that there has been a change in this, as stated in the Declaration.
But Mueller was only used after Trump Comey was fired.
Because of this draft, drafts against Trump had become public, he wanted to prevent justice.
Comey said in June before a Senate committee, Trump asked him to set up investigations against the then national security adviser Michael Flynn.
The President is under great pressure from the investigation.
After depicting US media, the White House collected material against the special mediator and his employees.
The resulting speculations about whether Trump would want to release the Mueller.
Unlike an independent special representative of the Congress, such as in the Watergate affair of late President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be punished on the demands of the President by the Ministry of Justice.
Several senators of both parties, however, want to prevent such a step.
On Thursday, two groups of Republican and democratic senators introduced draft laws that would no longer allow the special mediator to be dismissed as easily as possible.
Antarctica: Giant Iceberg in Antarctica
In the West Antarctica, a giant iceberg has emerged from the almost seven-fold size of Berlin from the Shelveis.
This was shared by the Bremerhaven Alfred-Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday.
The heavy over one trillion tons and 5800 square kilometers of big colossus now runs north and will probably take two or three years until it is wet.
It has a length of 175 kilometers and a width of up to 50 kilometers of one of the largest ice giants that researchers have recorded in the past three decades.
A danger to people does not come from him.
As far as climate change has played a role in the collapse of the iceberg, research is unclear.
Overall, however, for about 30 years there has been a series of unusual collapses of icebergs in the region, the U.S. Research Centre for Snow and Ice (NSIDC) writes in a fact-finding background.
According to many researchers, this could be related to global warming.
The now broken colossus was a part of Larsen-C-Shelfei.
Shelveis swims on the sea and is eaten by large glaciers.
As a result, it continues to grow into the sea and falls regularly.
The Larsen-C-Shelfeis is located almost at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula in South America.
The weight of growth and abstinence was disrupted in the north of this shellfish a few years ago.
A complete shellfish falls there, AWI researcher Daniela Jansen writes.
Some say that the Larsen-C-Shelfei is also in danger, because the front edge has never gone back as far as it is now.
In addition, the ice plate may fall under tension if a piece is broken at a key point.
The melting of Schelfeis and iceberg does not increase the sea level, as it swims on the water and forces ice as much water as it produces after melting itself.
However, the loss of the shellfish leads the glaciers directly to the sea and can flow much faster than before.
This could possibly increase the sea level, however only to a small extent, writes the British research project to observe Antarctica (Midas).
The Larsen-C-Shelfei is the fourth largest herb of Antarctica, according to AWI data, with almost 50,000 square kilometers.
At the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, on the front edge of the free ocean about 200 meters.
It breaks down regularly there.
"Although it is a natural event and we are not aware of any direct connection to climate change, the ice shield is now in a more dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary of the British Swansea University.
"This is the largest withdrawal since the beginning of the records," he also confirmed.
Amongstst the scientists, the Larsen-C-Shelfei will now grow up again or go back in the long term and possibly collapse, his colleague Adrian Luckman said, adding: "Our models say it will be less stable."
But this development will take decades.
Even though these researchers do not lead to the collapse of this giant iceberg, many of the Arctic Peninsula’s ice spheres have collapsed in the past decades.
This long edge of Antarctica extends towards South America.
According to data from the British Antarctic Survey research programme, the Arctic peninsula's ice area has fallen by 28,000 square kilometers since the 1950s.
The rise in temperature has contributed to the decline.
The Antarctic peninsula has warmed up about three degrees in the past 50 years and is one of the fastest-growing areas.
CDU wants home fare for staff
Because it is becoming increasingly difficult to hold free positions, the CDU asks to leave the employer's association to become more attractive.
Just before the summer break, the Kreistag won 41 new positions in the administration.
More than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in Metmann.
Now 17 trainees have their first working day behind them.
The classrooms are obviously very desirable.
Around 620 applications were to be made for the places to be granted this year.
However, the circle still lacks staff to handle the increased requirements and tasks.
Currently, there are still 50 unoccupied places in the Mettmann district.
Doctors and engineers, as well as the forces of the general administration, are sought.
The CDU now wants to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG in the Kreistag and address the lack of expertise in the administration.
The administration is intended to "make a concept for the acquisition and development of personnel" at the request of the parties.
The aim is not only to meet the short-term needs of professionals, but to counter the future-oriented shortage of applicants.
The overall concept should focus on the inside and the outside, show concrete measures for cleaners and include training offensives, call for CDUs, FDPs and UWGs.
This is in line with a good approach.
Because the circle has to do with personal problems that you didn't know before.
Other cities hire good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.
The talk is from a regular competition of public employers.
A large number of employees are excluded from the service, either sickness or old age.
So the maximum time to act, so that no more seats remain unoccupied.
But Klaus-Dieter Peoples, the head of the CDU Group, goes beyond the joint request with his party.
He had recently been in the Kreistag for a fake surprise when he questioned the staff cost coverage in public and the rest of the parties baffled.
Peoples would like to see all the possibilities that would allow an exit from the municipal employers' association.
"If we do not come here to a satisfactory solution in the short term, the circuit administration should seek a home tariff with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the surrounding cities -," said the Peoples.
In this way, the CDU tries to pay the employees and officials better than it actually provides for the tariff support for the public service.
The containers are currently exactly prescribed, increases or more money is available only if you switch to a higher level that is oriented towards years of work.
But the tasks of the circle have grown ever more in recent years.
Only a few weeks ago, new spaces had to be set up, in which employees would take care of the provisions of the new Prostitution Protection Act.
Not least because of the rising number of asylum seekers, Landrat Thomas Hengele and circle director Martin Richter have a problem: they have too few staff.
Italy reinforces the tone of NGO-Migrant rescue boats
Italy has warned NGOs that the rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean should not continue to do so if they do not comply with new rules for their operations.
"If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can work on it," said Interior Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily newspaper La Stampa.
Minnitis Warning came one day after the Italian authorities had seized a boat from the German aid organization 'Youth Rechtet' because their team had worked effectively with human dealers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.
The aid organisation, which has been in operation for only one year, refused to comment on the detailed proposals of the Italian Public Prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
"For us, and the salvation of human life remains our top priority, so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," the organization said in an opinion on the social media.
"We can assess all the charges that are currently being raised only after we have collected all the information and are able to assess the situation."
The Italian authorities had been watching the boat of 'Young Right', the young people since October.
It is suspected that his crew will take on board hose boat Migrants that are supplied directly to them by human dealers, and that the smugglers can leave so that the ships can be used again.
At least one such meeting took place only 1.3 miles before the Libyan coast, according to the State Prosecutor's record, the content of which was published by Italian media.
The occupation is suspected of being monitored by the Italian Coast Guard Authority, the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not for any other reason.
Under the Code of Conduct, boats such as the Yuventa must have an Italian police officer on board who is monitoring their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue have so far declared themselves ready to stick to the code: Save the Children, MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary, but acceptable, as they would not bring with them "essential changes or obstacles" of their rescue actions.
Among those who refuse to sign, the Nobel Prize winner organization is doctors without limits (MSF).
Minniti now said that the number of migrants who arrived after the rescue measures in Italy had declined significantly in recent weeks, which meant that efforts to strengthen the Libyan Coast Guard and to cooperate with local mayors had borne fruit.
"In the last days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," said the Minister.
He announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in hope to reach Europe.
Increases and Trials
Nine Weilermer biker, the "Berliner Outposts" and two guests met in Wachenheim in Nordpfalz to enjoy four days of trial and sightseeing.
For this, three friendly guides were available.
The accommodation in the Wachenheim valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.
The castle and wine festival of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.
The first tour led to Michaelskalle above Dedesheim at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards.
There were views, partly on towers, from which one could look far across the plains of the forest and the premier plains.
In the meantime, there were ever-long increases that were rewarded for the long trials.
On the second day, it went to Bad Dürkheim to the salinity and to the People's Festival Wurstmarkt.
Again, the point of view was selected at the point of view, connected by "flowy" trials and moderate increases.
In the last two days, many heights were said again.
Hulls, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and caravans brought welcome breaks.
In Bad Dürkheim, the bikers in the free-of-air hall smell healing sun.
Newstadt was also controlled.
After 173 kilometers and almost 4,500 meters of height, the group had known the forest of the forest from its best side - sporty and culturally.
Console instead of Rasen - Bundesliga is equipped for e-sport
Are the sports stars sitting in front of computer consoles in the future, instead of sneaking through wind and weather over the stadium terraces?
The fact is: e-sport is the longest to become a serious industry, become a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gags.
This has also been recognized by the first federal leagues, which are increasingly engaged in this area.
At the beginning of 2015, the VfL Wolfsburg, later followed the FC Schalke 04 and lastly the VfB Stuttgart, which established an e-sport department in mid-July and took two professionals for the FIFA 17 computer game under contract.
"We hope to enjoy a whole new target group for the VfB," says the Board of Directors Jochen Röttgermann.
He is sure that "there will be more associations on this train".
In the coming weekend, the FIFA Football World Association in London will organize the first "Interactive Club World Cup", where the gamers of different clubs will come together.
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, for example, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or the PSV Eindhoven have qualified.
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sport.
The former trainer of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen currently advises an agency for virtual football players.
"The real football must, in particular, be united with the 14 to 30 years old, that young people will also go to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old.
And: The unions tried to conquer all possible markets, especially Asians.
With prominent e-sporters under contract, you could be more often online in these markets than once a year to send the Federal League to Asia.
What's going on?
In e-sport, computer games such as "League Of Legends", "Dota 2", "Counterstrike" or the FIFA football simulation are run at competitive levels.
At the very least, as in normal sport, they have established leagues in which the profession came together.
And in the Asia games 2022, e-sport is already part of the official program.
But is it even a real sport?
For many, the idea is certainly necessary.
Ingo Froböse has also been involved in the issue for a long time.
For the professor at the German Sports School in Cologne, E-Sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that are also found in classical sports - for example increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes.
It also needs cognitive skills, a technical and tactical understanding and a rapid response ability.
Professional gamers should not only train their bodies on the console, but also take care of their diet.
"The fat player is a good player."
But Froböse also sees problems: "Doping becomes more and more a topic".
Controls are difficult to perform in online games, and in the scene the structures of classical sport were lacking.
Positively, the scientist has the high integrative effect of e-sport.
The players are international on the way, this is like a large global family, as there are no intercultural obstacles.
A study of company advice Deloitte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) tells e-sport a rapid growth.
In 2016, 50 million euros were implemented in Germany, mainly through advertising, sponsoring and major tournaments.
In three years, revenue will be at 130 million.
Against the nearly 2.4 billion Euros of the football fedsliga, however, this is not enough.
However, the e-sport is "not far from the other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey", the Deloitte advisors write.
There are already many countries on the international scene.
Large markets are Asia and the USA where ex-Basketball players Shaquille O`Neal and Baseballstar Alex Rodriguez participate in the US Team NRG eSports.
Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher invests in the eSport Wetteller Unikrn.
In Europe too, there are some things that are going on.
In a Norwegian school, e-sport was introduced as a teaching phase, says Froböse.
In the Netherlands and France, the football-Erstliga associations are currently obliged to set up an e-sport department.
"In the European comparison, Germany goes back," explains VfB-presenta Röttgermann.
Only to fall into nostalgia, and to explain the old times, today is not enough.
It is about preserving the tradition of the association, but at the same time setting the company up in the modern market.
"We live in a digitalized world," says Dutt.
"There's no point in the fact that only at football everything remains the same as it always was."
Gift egg ade - The egg alternatives for cooking and baking
In the meantime, almost all of the federal countries are affected by the scandal of poison-damaged eggs.
Aldi South and Aldi North have responded and have removed all eggs from sale throughout Germany.
Only eggs are to be taken into the regals, which are proven not to contain fipronil.
Michelle Carter condemned for the texts that Conrad Roy forced to commit suicide
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend through texts and calls for suicide.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of her sentence behind bars and have been sentenced to five years.
Carter was sentenced in June due to the imminent murder of Conrad Roy, who took his life on 13 July 2014.
Roy's father said on Thursday at the hearing: "My family is untrustworthy.
My son was my best friend."
Carter could stay free until the call.
She was confronted with a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr. Roy were suffering from a mental illness.
Dressed in red pants and a cream-coloured flower, Carter stood there with tears in his eyes, with his hands folded and with his eyes directed down when she was convicted.
"Your actions have killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
"She ended her life to make her own better.
She has taken no responsibility," she said.
"She didn't show no remorse."
But Carter's lawyer said it was a "horrible situation which they felt utterly sorry for."
Judge Lawrence Moniz said, however, that he did not find that her "age or maturity or even her mental illness have a significant influence on her actions".
A public prosecutor read a statement by Roy's mother Lynn Roy, who said that there is "no day on which I do not trust the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I care about everything. I try to be there for his sisters, despite all my pain that we will bear for eternity," it says.
Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, said that she would be "followed" by the realization that she would never participate in her brother's wedding or be a aunt for her children.
"No longer having this only person with whom I have been with since I was born every day is a pain that I will always be left with for the rest of my life," she said.
The case seems to be a legal precedent because there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to invite another to commit suicide.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead from carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.
The case drew national attention to itself after Carter's text messages revealed that she had encouraged him to end his life.
"Get up, jump from a building, fuck yourself, I don't know there are many ways," she said in several news she had sent in the two weeks before her death while he and his family were on vacation.
In the moments before his suicide, she wrote: "You have to do it, Conrad" and "All you have to do is activate the generator and you will be free and happy."
Justice Moniz said that Carter was looking for attention by Roy's death and ordered that she benefit from the case through any press.
The case has divided the legal opinion.
Among the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was sentenced to death in 2007 to her British roommate in Italy before she was released two years ago.
Ms. Knox, 30 years old, published a comment in the Los Angeles Times: "Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not prison."
Joshua Kimich: Learning from the new mini-lahm of FC Bayern
The fact that Joshua Kimich was able to run the Audi Cup as a captain is not a coincidence.
The FC Bayern trusts the confed-Cup winner a great season - extra motivation does not harm there.
Something else was there in his place in the cabin, which Joshua Kimmich saw immediately, even though the extra clothing was very, very small.
But there and there on the second day of the Audi Cup, of course, there was no Philipp Lahm and there was no Manuel Neuer to see, he kept the bond he had assigned him to hold on to his arm.
"The coach didn't announce it," said the confed-Cup winner behind, after his first use as Bayern captain.
Well, the unit could have run better than at 0:2 against the SSC Naples.
But the sign of the coach could also show Kimmich.
Not the eight-year-old Arturo Vidal was selected in the C-Elf from youth players, debuters and just from the holiday profession as the leader, but he.
Zuckerl is the best person to share with those you care about who want to keep with Laune.
So whoever has been chosen to enter the inheritance of Lahm, a small extra motivation can only be used well.
Kimmich confirmed: "This is what you want as a player: take responsibility".
On Wednesday, the 22-year-old floated as a mini-lahm over the field.
Right behind, that's his position now, the white belt on your arm did the rest of it.
And at all times Kimich acted in this initial formation as the one who can also take the Ruder into the best hands.
He gave instructions, tried to link the unintended troops.
He had the view of the whole, while many others were busy with themselves.
Vidal with the aim of overplaying his missing fitness (he hardly hit); Renato Sanches with the use of the services of the Asian trip to hell (he just hit the condition); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle with the aim of not being negative in their first appearance in the Bavarian Trichot.
That was good at it anyway.
Süle lived next to Kimmich, Rudy before the rebellion, both acted sovereignly.
The so-called Napoli storm was often difficult, and also tried to succeed in the construction of the game a few times.
His colleague Rudy said that the result "was not the way we expected it."
But he also showed proper performance when he was in debt.
Game lagging, Tempowel: "For this style I was picked up too."
As this unusual Bayern world is still for the new entrances, one looked at the party.
Rudy, for example, did not give one or two interviews in the catacombs, but definitely six or seven interviews.
Kimmich agreed to make a few silly statements in the back of his new partner.
There he heard an interesting sentence from Süle: "What's going on here, I've already noticed.
In Bayer, you just have to win every game."
Still, he doesn't have to do that to the new one anymore.
Alaba motivated ÖFB ladies
David Alabama believes in the success of our ÖFB ladies
Austria's most famous footballer just before the game on Twitter and the ÖFB ladies wish everything good.
The Bavarian Legionary is almost a club colleague from ÖFB-Capitán Schnaderbeck and fevert with our Lady.
The tweet of the Austrian footballer of the year and the Champions League winner should be a special motivational leap.
The famous Bayern divers might also need our ladies.
Entrepreneurship satisfied with Rhineland-Palzian Minister: Economy Praises Knowledges Tempo
The relationship between the country and the regional economy, even though Evelyn Lemke (Green) was the Minister of Economic Affairs of Rheinland-Pfalz, was often inconceivable.
This is shown after more than a year in which the new Minister of Economic Affairs, Volker Wissing (FDP) is in office.
Chambers and companies from the region speak on T V's request for a change in economic policy - and at the same time the old minister.
Frank Natus, chairman of the Trierer Company Association (VTU), says: "Wissing raises the wishes of the economy that has blocked the limbe altogether".
The largest turning point is Natus in the infrastructure policy: the closure of the motorway 1 between Kelberg and Adenau is now in the country's priority list.
This year, the Ministry hopes for a planning procedure until 2021.
A role in the country's plans is also played by the Western Trier, which is in the urgent need of the Federal Roadmap.
The aim is to take the route into operation in December 2020, says Prime Minister Cornelia Holtmann.
Natus sees a guide there to support regional but international competing companies.
The Chamber of Industry and Commerce (IHK) Trier aims, as Wissing suggested, to establish a Rheinland-Pfalz label for wine to increase the paragraph in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German wine exports for ten years.
Furthermore, Wissing has an open ear for people who want to set up their own company, praises the IHK.
In the new master bonus, the Chamber Trier sees an additional incentive for young learners, says Managing Director Matthias Schwalbach.
A premium of EUR 1000 is provided for the existing master examination and EUR 2500 if graduates become independent within ten years of the master's training.
However, the country's home task list remains long.
The planned construction of the road was quick to create facts, while the country lacked the necessary personnel, says Jan Glockauer, chief businessman of the IHK Trier.
Of the 56 new engineers who want to set up Wissing in the country operation, only 29 seats have been occupied so far.
The IHK calls for more orders to external offices.
The CDU fractional visa Christian Baldup refers to the calculations of the Court of Auditors that the country invests in 2017 and 2018 more than 20 million euros less in obtaining country streets than proposed.
Frank Natus also expects another concept of the country, as it wants to address the lack of expertise in the region.
In addition, the former broadband expansion in the country is not far from over.
In 2016 regional companies had assessed the network supply in an IHK survey only with footnote 3.4.
They complain about stacking internet connections and interruptions.
Former Minister of Economic Affairs Eveline Lemke is currently out of politics and is still in the Supervisory Board of the Wind company Pro Wind.
The Green Group left Lemke in April to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe - where after four months because of disagreements, it had already cleared the field again.
Audi is about to change 850,000 Automotives - Automakers are confronted with a reaction
One day before the Audi announcement, BMW said it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW president said that the company was of the opinion that "there are smarter options than driving restrictions" and therefore referred to European cities - including Munich, where BMW is located - ban or restrict the vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that three million Mercedes vehicles will be modified in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.
None of the companies described the companies as a recall.
European car manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions rules.
But the nitrogen oxides that emit diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The costs of the car manufacturers to install systems for the neutralisation of the exhaust emissions from Diesel vehicles also take into account what makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.
The German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of harassing the powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem.
The companies are trying to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen that could regulate the use of so-called off-road devices that could regulate emissions in order to comply with the rules when a car was tested but would fall back under normal driving conditions.
Several employees of Volkswagen were charged in the United States, and others were investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics was arrested in the development of Audi in Germany.
The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be brought to justice in the United States.
At the beginning of this year, Audi was involved in German criminal investigations in Volkswagen, after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to comply with the emission regulations in Europe and an application focused on the United States was extended.
The involvement of Audi in the investigation could weigh heavily on Volkswagen: The luxury car manufacturer contributes disproportionately to the profit of Volkswagen.
This message has the flow on Saturday on the Isar
The city wants to protect the Isar.
In order to join the Isar visitors, on Saturday morning, a river runs through Munich, which has a special message.
On Saturday it will be seen a great river between Flaucher and Richenbachbrücke.
And that's not the usual river, with Isar tourists.
Except for the farm trip, I'd like to explain.
On the river you see a great info transparency.
It shows a Müllberg.
The launch of a public campaign to appeal to the Isar visitors.
With the motto "True Love is ..." the understanding for the Isar is to be enhanced as a protective wildlife flow.
Last summer the river ran over the Isar, and this year there are other actions and measures to achieve a considerate and environmentally conscious behaviour.
Mordillaless Knobs and the Laughing Against Suffering
Mordillo was also one of the most widely published cartoon characters, and the nozzles of his figures are his trademarks.
Also with 85, the Argentinean still draws and works on a film.
His message: Laugh, "because there is too much suffering in the world".
Guillermo Mordillo was born on August 4, 1932 as a son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires.
In the first years as an artist, among other things, he became a sign of happiness cards - which frustrated him.
"The happiest day of my professional life was the day when I lost my job," he once said.
After stations in Lima, New York and Paris, he reached the end of the 60s of the breakthrough: with the publication of his cartoons in "Paris Match" and then also in the "Star" and other leading magazines around the world.
Even in China, Mordillo found many fans.
Every time, the artist was inspired by cities.
Large, round Mordillo figures take place in drawings with the ship's tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow.
Early in the morning, he also sits on his own records today at the sign language, working almost ten hours a day.
About calendars, puzzles, books for big and small, T-shirts, plywoods and watches, his wild figures continue to be widely distributed around the world.
He's been working on a cartoon film and a TV series with his characters for six years.
The main person in the movie "Crazy Island" is a giraffe - the most popular animal in its drawings - who has a thousand-fesser as an opponent.
For the first time, his figures are spoken in the 3D film, which is due to come to the cinematographic wall in 2019.
"I don't know exactly what they're going to say, it's strange for me," says Mordillo.
The spinbook is not written by him.
That's why he's putting on the TV series, which, like his original drawings, is produced in vain.
lavender from the Provence of Climate Change threatened
He has become a symbol of the Provence in South France, but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change.
The lavender is depressing due to the conditions and insects that remind Dürre, which prepares scientists and farmers who are trying to find solutions to major headaches.
Eric Chaisse, expert at the CRIEPPAM Agricultural Research Institute in Provence, said: "The lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because last year the plants were exposed to the effects of climate change, which caused much less rain in the spring and much more in the autumn.
This has effects on the lifetime of Lavendel.
There is also a small zikade, a microbacteria that transmits zirgzicade, and in very dry weather there are many of it."
And there's a lot on the game.
Lavender oil not only attracts holidayers, it is also very much asked for perfume and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: "Instead of having a very long plant eye with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.
So we have less parts with essential oil."
The solutions to be considered include better water distribution and slowdown of pollution from the soil, but also spraying plants with a protective mixture of tones and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to drought.
The town of Geisa in the Thuringian Rhine celebrates its 1200-year-old existence today.
This Saturday and Sunday is a mid-term festival.
Kramers, fifths, merchants, vagans or a land miner are to be experienced these days in the city centre.
The murder of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico
The employees of the Riodoce weekly usually meet in the middle of the week to review their plans for reporting on the latest chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and unstoppable drug wars.
But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.
They were told that it was important to change their routines.
Two high-ranking journalists discuss what feels safer: they are going to take their children to the office, which were the target of an attack with grenades in 2009.
Security experts have written three words on a table on the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies.
You ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no proof is necessary, to get perceptions and abdominal feelings.
There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists suspected of standing on the government or cartel's payroll, a catalogue of criminals who endanger the chaos of Mexico.
There is no rest of the violence, and while the bodies are increasing throughout the country, there are more and more journalists: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto arrived in December 2012. 589 are following attacks and threats under federal protection, and so far there have been at least seven deaths in seven states.
Among the latter are her publisher and her inspiration from Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence in connection with drugs.
His shortcomings will be deeply impressed, although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez, which shows his middle finger with the word "Justice", depends on the facade of the Riodoce building. Two reporters in the thirty years, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts, showing his smiling face with glasses or his typical panamaut.
The workshop takes place less than two months after its death, and the reporters discuss their shared topics, the trauma, their alpine dreams, insomnia, Paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor was set up in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists, it, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, initiated only two criminal procedures.
Like most of the thousands of murders that are linked to drug trafficking and organised crime each year, the murderers of journalists are only rarely brought to trial.
In Riodoce, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are untrustworthy and even more treacherous.
Without information about the killers, without justice, the meeting for the discussion of security has little benefit, says Ibarra.
"It's very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.
"If we don't know why, we'll all be disappointed."
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the Riodoce newspaper in the capital of Culiacan.
He only managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was arrested by two men. He was forced out of his car and was shot 12 times on him, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with "Twelfth River".
The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it in the vicinity.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left behind a woman and two adult children.
Sounds tend to fly freely to Culiacan.
But there is practically nothing about Valdez.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and delivery to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the country's bloodiest battlefields, as rival groups are fighting here to fill the vacuum.
It does not matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people are shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of rotten, two-storey museums for drug kings, who are bigger than many homes for the living.
For a minute forget that there is a state of "ruhe" if only one cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes in the United States.
Nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the danger of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, was unable to protect his friend.
He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.
First, in February, there was the release of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel factions in the war with Guzman's sons.
This publication may have upset the sons, suspected gang members bought every copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to Zeitungskisjöch.
The second error was not to force Valdez to leave the country to his own safety after the seizure of another newspaper that had published the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.
He had lived so long that his friends and colleagues would accept that he would always be there.
He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroest in 2003 when he joined five colleagues to establish Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to operate journalism without facing the root cause problem," Bojorquez said.
In time, the newspaper received a call for courage and honest reporting, and the sales and advertising took place.
Reporters loved to be able to publish hard-standing studies without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else was waiting to treat.
Eight years after the establishment of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot-Price" for her report in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for His Courage in the pursuit of Mexican drug history, where she always introduced it.
He voluntarily admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to live on," he said at the time of the CPJ award.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa "is a way of life," he said in a interview with Rompeviento TV last October.
"You must take over the task that you like as a journalist - either that or you play the fool.
I don't want to be asked, "What did you do in the face of so many deaths ... why didn't you say what was going on?"
The Riodoce team misses Valdez, the fun bird that could fly like a port worker, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trusted his routine.
He'd always wear his hat.
He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and sit there on the same table.
Now they ask: Was his love for routine his destruction?
His death has also forced her to question her own beliefs about how they can do their work and stay alive.
"They don't like to deal with their women, their children, their clean business, their secret starting and land routes," to move drugs.
"These things were not allowed," said Bojorquez.
The result, even in the best times, is a high degree of self-esteem and self-esteem.
Trust his own instincts.
If it smells wrong, stay away from it.
The trouble is, the publisher of the Riodoce Andres Villareal said that "A sense that can be deceived ... and then the thing happened with Javier."
The old rules, as he and others say, are no longer applicable in Sinaloa - not as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states, where a toxic mixture of lucid smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the room where Riodoce employees met for security training, no phones were allowed. Days earlier it was known that spyware, sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two policemen were looking for protection against the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.
They were commissioned by the government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a middle-class district of Culiacan.
Half in the joke, some of the reporters asked whether these officers belonged to the 50 percent of the policemen, who themselves referred to the Governor as untrustworthy.
It's been months since the reporters went to the mountain range where the drug gangs are de facto controlled.
For this week's edition, Riodoce has looked at three main stories.
There was the murder of the brother of the former-known boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also had an exhibition on state spending that focused on the governor's home city.
And there was a group that carried out a kidnapping in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the Public Prosecutor's Office.
There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was offered when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: the restaurant is a favorite place of drug dealers and authorities.
A reporter found out from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who is part of the governing institutional revolution party (PRI), who ruled almost all political levels throughout the century.
Recently, several PR governors were accused of high-level cases of corruption.
Villareal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this location, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman was killed by a military incident.
Only a few months earlier, the readers had considered the column of Valdez as the best-informed source of the kidnapping.
"Before, we had known what happened," said Villareal, 46, with the tip of "El Flaco" because of his slim body state.
"Now all channels of communication with our sources are broken."
The office of Valdez was dedicated to the storage room for signs and stickers who protested against the murder of journalists because the employees had become something they had never expected: activists on behalf of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez took a few signs and went to a demonstration next morning because of another journalist at the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the western state of Michoacan.
A burnt body was discovered and officers said based on DNA tests that it was his.
Throughout the country, journalists have become louder by having written "SOS Press" on roads and buildings in organized protests.
On this day, director Bojorquez is away in Washington and is trying to collect international support for justice in the case of Valdez.
At a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa on the day after Valdez was murdered, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and killing them because they had told the truth.
She has since prayed that she be re-distributed by the government because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were "indicted" by organized crime, involving government officials and an equal society.
In his last book, Narco-Journalism, he wrote that reporters were killed not only by drug gangs, but also at the command of politicians and security forces who were under a cover with organized crime.
The media watch group "Articul 19" has assigned more than half of the attacks on police and officials' journalists last year.
"In Mexico you die because they want you to shut your mouth," Ramirez said.
Obviously, the murder has a frightening effect.
No one forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
Her body was found together with a note signed by Zetas cartel: "I am here because of my reports."
A computer keyboard and headphones were next to their separate head.
Some branches have chosen to close as El Norte newspaper in the northern Chihuahua border country following the murder of the correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others continue to do as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the murder of her director in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartel with a headline on the title page with the title "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled from their homelands or even from the country.
It's a painful decision.
It is difficult to find work in exile, and they still observe the streets and seek dangers.
And sometimes they are hunted, as it is apparent to photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the flight from Veracruz.
For those who remain behind and continue to work, it is a daily dance with risky decisions.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, says that the drug trade scares him.
"Mexico goes to hell, and that's why I became a reporter," he said.
About midnight on the last Friday, when the last issue was finished, the editors of Riodoce sat on the citizens' stairs in front of the office and drank beer when all their phones started to add up at once.
A series of shootings with band rivals and security forces near Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed deaths.
The war continued to escalate as promised by a number of cartel messages in the region.
They published the news on the website of Riodoce on mobile.
The title page had to be changed the next day.
Sirens appeared in the vicinity - another shooting in the area.
Bojorquez took a look at the cops who kept the watch to see if they were ready.
If they were afraid at all, they wouldn't show it.
Under the violent portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible for the whole Sinaloa, the employees of Riodoce followed his tracks.
"How can you just think about it," said Bojorquez, "when on the same day that Javier was murdered, the practitioner asked me to send her to report on the street."
Dinosauri used tanning to remove its enemies
At first glance it looks like a statue, even a scary one.
Now researchers have discovered that the first findings of an incredible nest of a Canadian mining worker were received so well that experts described it as "Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs".
It was so well received that they could even find that his dirty skin was of red brown - and they said she had something of a "unrestful past".
The report in the journal "Current Biology" referred to him as "the best-maintened dinosaurs that were ever found and one of the best dinosaurs in the world".
Fossil is a newly discovered species of nodosauri, which lived in the middle of the period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
Its incredibly well received condition has been exacerbated by researchers who describe it as "very remarkable"
According to reports in National Geographic, the parked plant fresco is the best-retained fossil of its kind.
It was found by Shawn Funk when he was found in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
He found something that seemed to be missing from the surrounding rocks in the square, and decided to look more closely.
The fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
They spent the next six years discovering the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds (1.100 kg) of heavy earthquakes.
After all this hard work, the final result is now ready to be revealed.
"If you just blink a little with your eyes, you could almost believe it was asleep," said the chief author Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is to be seen.
"It will be included in the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best-preserved dinosaurs - the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs."
Researchers have found that this plant fresco, although covered with a weapon and similar to a walking pan, is likely to be threatened by meat-freaking dinosaurs.
The heavily painted dinosaur used a red and white tanning to hide from predators, and used a protective technique known as counter-estimation, which is also used by many modern animals.
This would have allowed for better mixing in his surroundings and alienating his enemies, experts say, which suggests that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million-year-old creature from the Nodosauri family first made a series of battle lines in May and is now seen at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Borealopelta markmetcheli, according to museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours in this process to discover it carefully.
The amazing preservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of shells and weapons over his body.
They discovered the counter estimate, a widespread method of defense in the animal realm, which means that the tip of the creature was darker than its underside.
Although counter-estimation is common, the results are surprising because the size of Borealopelta is far superior to that of the animals living today.
It should be noted that the dinosaur was hunted by sufficient pressure by meat-flavouring dinosaurs that the evolution favored the distortion of confrontation as a means of survival.
But most modern animals that use counter-scatheting - think of rehe, zebras or rodents - are much smaller and more vulnerable than bees, which indicates that this nodosaurier was a real struggle to survive.
"Stark predator behavior on a massive, highly pangered dinosaur shows how dangerous the dinosaur predators of the cride time must have been," Brown said.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was red brown.
Scientists continue to examine the animal’s life, including its preserved Darminum content, to find out what it has eaten as its last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur, when he died, was driven into a river and driven out into the sea, where he fell on his back to the bottom of the sea.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as South Florida today, and rivers and oceans are likely to be much further inland than they are today.
"This nodosaurier is truly remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved spicy skin, but also preserved in three dimensions and retains the original shape of the animal," Brown said.
"The result is that the animal today looks almost the same as in the early days of the crisis.
You don't need to use a lot of imagination to reconstruct it. If you just brush a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that he's asleep."
The time of the cry was a time, as huge theropods, flesh-flavoring dinosaurs that stood on two legs that penetrated the earth.
Although the king of them, the Tyronasaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of his frightening ancestors.
The Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11.5 m) long, six tons of heavy monster, belongs to the Acrocanthosaurs.
Scientists, whose latest findings in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta was drowned after death in the sea and mummified in the mud.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he was found in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
According to the museum, it is the world's best-maintened dinosaur, including skin and armor, and is complete from the snout to the hip.
The creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
It contains two 20-inch long peaks that were cut by its shoulders.
The researchers believe that the clustered plant fresco was swung by western Canada until a flood flow flowed into the open sea.
But the underwater supply of the dinosaur kept his weapon in exquisite detail.
The hidden remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the Händer still cover useful panzer plates along the dinosaur
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is as 'selten' as a gain in the lotto.
The more I see it, the more confusing it will be.
Residues of the skin still cover the side plates that carry the animal’s shoulder.
His right foot lies on his side, his five fingers are stretched up.
I can count the shells on his sole'.
In the wind: Mass carabolage on A8: Many injured
Severe accident on Thursday evening at A8: Almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass carnival.
There are many injured, km of staus and gaffers.
On the Stuttgart-München motorway (A8), about 20 people were injured on the late Thursday morning at a mass carnival.
According to the police, at 5.00 p.m., almost 30 vehicles, including trucks, were forced in between the Aichach-Friedberg and the Adelhausen connection points during a lift.
There were no data on the exact number of injured.
It's about minor to medium-sized injuries, said a police speaker.
A large offer to rescue vehicles was at the crash site.
The A8 was completely shut down towards Munich.
In the direction of Munich, there was a 10-km return.
As reported by an AZ reporter, there were also massive obstacles on the road through numerous luggage.
The firearm noted the characteristics of the vehicle anchors that now have sensitive penalties.
Shortly after 6:45 p.m., another accident occurred on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.
There was a collision between a car carrier and a passenger.
A rescue shooter was on his way to the crash site.
Deutsche Bahn: Group tested "Comfort Check-in"
It is a moment that almost everyone has already experienced: nothing foolish is sitting on the train and sleeping.
Or you're deep in your work and you just have a great thought.
And then: puff.
The creator comes and wakes up an uninvited person or rides the guest in the middle of the workflow.
Vehicle card control.
But the times of interruptions are soon over.
The German Bahn is currently testing the creative road map control.
You simply confirm by phone that you take your place and thus evaluate the road map.
Currently a test operation runs on two tracks.
"If the offer is offered, we will extend it.
It will then be expected to be available on many further routes in Germany in the beginning of the year," said one train speaker.
"Comfort check-in" calls the train the driver's rating without any creator.
However, in order to use them, some conditions must be met: you need a smartphone or a tablet.
And you must have booked an online ticket - what no matter what most passengers are doing.
You must also buy it over the app of the train that the DB Navigator has bought, which is the most convenient type of ticket booking.
And lastly, you need a seat reservation.
Because the "comfort check-in" works like this: You get up in the train, you call your ticket under "My tickets".
In the case of test customers, then, a button appears for electronic evaluation.
The train drivers get a message on their mobile devices that the driver X is in the train and has taken the booked seat Y.
When the train driver comes to check the ticket in place Y, he knows that there is a passenger with an already rated online ticket.
So you can go on sleeping, work on, keep on sweating.
The "Check-in" has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the train - which is to be used by the passengers.
"Whoever wants to travel by train crew without a check-in check-in simply checks in the DB Navigator itself.
This enables passengers to make their travel time more personal," says Michael Peterson, marketing representative of DB TV.
Second, "And our employees have more time than they do today to address the individual customer needs".
Those who often drive a train know that in addition to delays and missed trains, road map checks are one of the biggest problems.
Because often you have yourself, in any case, but one of the participants does not have all the documents you need to evaluate online tickets.
Either the credit card or staff card is missing or another document you need to present.
The consequences are endless discussions between train crews and passengers, leading to too bad moods in the department or big room and delays in controlling their own ticket and taking time to take care of other concerns at the end.
Only a small number of test customers can still use the new service.
And this also only on the links ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.
Further train numbers on the same track are not yet activated.
How did an activist come to learn the answer to the question: "Whose Streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shot to the core.
Just one day after she arrived in New York City, the natives of St. Louis sat on the bed of an airbnb apartment that she rented and scrolld through Facebook on her phone.
She knocked over a post from someone from the high school.
"The police just killed an 18-year-old child, and it's still on the street," he said.
Confused that no one else had posted the information on her feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user with @TheePharoah was constantly re-weeted on their timeline.
The rapper from the area of St. Louis was killing Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, who was killed alive by a white policeman in Ferguson, Mo..
He posted a picture of Brown's living body that was stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours.
"That's wild," Ferrell thought to himself.
But death was nothing new to them and their community.
She dropped her phone to return to Tweets later in the evening to people on the Canfield drive.
There were photos of the police band and people screaming, and of a man who claimed to be Brown's father who had a sign with the inscription: "Ferguson's police just killed my unarmed son!"
She watched a live feed where a policeman stood in front of a group of demonstrators with a belligerent dog.
In another video, she said, another police officer took his gun and yelled, "I'll kill you... animals all."
"This is not usual," Ferrell recalled her statement.
"That's not the kind of murder that we've been used to and which we can call typical."
At this point, I felt a gunfight.
I was angry and sorry."
She booked a return trip and went home the next day.
After the landing at 23 o'clock, she took her six-year-old daughter out of her father's house and decided that they would drive to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson in the next three years is the theme of a new documentary film, "Whose Streets?", in the cinemas from the 11th century.
It is a story of survival and of protest, of love and of loss, of strength and of resistance from the perspective of the people who live in the Community and have filled the streets to ask for answers.
When Ferrell and her daughter, who had a flower dress and a suitable crown, went to Ferguson, the two discussed a conversation they had several times before this morning “about the black experience and the black condition”.
"Do you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe?" she remembered what she said.
"We're going to Ferguson now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that wasn't right.
I couldn't take her," Ferrell said later.
"What has happened today is a highlight of what has happened in the past.
She must know it and see it and be picked up there.
It must be well developed, not only activism and organization, but also the different layers of black experience and black constitution, and what we need to do to be free to free ourselves.
Even if I'm lucky to give her an experience in which she doesn't personally experience excruciating racism, she's no different than the next black woman's child.
I feel like I'd show her a bad service to keep her away from it."
The first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was located at the South Florisance Road, a place with the police authority, who became a camp area when the activists waited for the possible non-accused officer Darren Wilson.
There Ferrell and her daughter are connected to a local businessman who made lunch.
They prepare bags and help to pass them on to demonstrators.
Slowly a new kind of activism for Ferrell began to be adopted.
"My activism has changed completely since 9 August," she said and noted that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities.
"I had no experience in organizing.
It's all come."
A week later Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the film's co-registrations.
Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farranr just wanted to "document" what happened.
One question came up with Ferrell saying, "Do you want to document or try to find a story that you can use?"
This skeps was touched by countless cases of people, often by whites - in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance.
As Folayan recently stated in an interview: "We had heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson did not focus their voices and we wanted to do it differently."
Folayan had already collaborated with the former co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism about death extracts.
Ferrell brought the project closer together with six other natives followed the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years after Brown's shooting.
"This documentary is not someone who talks to us or speaks to us. We talk," said Davis.
"That was the main thing for me, how these people are represented, because that's how I'm going to be represented."
The goal was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - to show that the movement "is not a Messiah leader, but a community that comes together," Folayan said she turned out to be the most open participant in the film.
As a result, documents from "Whose Streets?" show surprising personal aspects of Ferrell's life, how she loves herself and marries her wife.
"I felt like naked," said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time.
"But I understand that in this work and in the creation of black people, there must be a certain vulnerability."
In addition, Ferrell's story repeats the role of black and black women in the wider Black-Lives mother movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement, who, after the murder of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, marked the film "BlacklivesMatter" in social media, identify themselves as bad.
"Black, poor women in leadership positions have brought the movement together," said Ferrell, "and that is why we are constantly fighting on different fronts.
Black, dark women must bear the main burden of everything."
Folayan agreed to note that "the movement is truly maintained by black women and many black women".
However, it states that "this is not an affirmative type of action", when Ferrell was selected as the heart of the film because of her identity.
"She was the person who raised this energy," she said.
"It is no coincidence, although she was on the front, because in a life of these crossings as a black, deaf woman is so much on the game.
You can sense their energy through the screen."
Meanwhile, the news cameras in Ferguson have disappeared for the longest time, but the racial connections between the community and the police continue.
Ferrell has been on hold for 21⁄2 years because of the blocking of a highway at a demonstration.
She describes the social political atmosphere of the area, which she calls her home: "A chaos".
However, she complains about a song and feels obliged to this memory since she went on the road three years ago in Ferguson.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We need to love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose - except our chains."
From "Traum" to "Sizeway": TV readers discuss bit-galerie
The Bit Gallery moves people, although it hasn't been built for a long time.
But the idea of a shopping centre in the south of the pedestrian zone has split the population into supporters and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.
Cold leaves the subject barely one.
Also on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg" the topic is discussed.
While those who say to the bit gallery: "This would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "This would be a real class" (Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side: "Don't need a man" (Siggi Betz) or quite easy: "Sizeway!" (Lars Scholz).
While the sponsors are building on the fact that a gallery attracts more customers to the city, which also benefits the rest of the business, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will bleed out.
In addition: The gallery is planned exactly on the plot on which the farmer market hall is located, in which 13 direct marketers offer their products.
At the beginning of the construction work, this will be the end.
The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - and to the beda site with the possibility to sit outside.
Simone Room: "We've been buying in the farm shop for almost a week for many years.
Most of all, our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the women, are always very pleasant.
We also discovered the metzgeries for us.
We would like to see that during and above all after the building of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer.
There's this in other cities too.
In particular, the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting."
Gerd Densing: "If direct marketers sit in a market hall in the gallery, the rent is high.
It should not be too low in the new project."
Eva Kilic: "What's the shopping mall in Bitburg?
Whether clothing, shoes, drugs or supermarkets: I find it overwhelming.
There's enough of that in our city.
You can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years.
However, since there is not even a proper weekly market here, it is all the more important that at least we get the market hall.
However, the product offered there is fresh, most of which is offered directly by the producer and is also priced.
As you can see, shops in a shopping mall are rented only by larger companies, because the rentals there are often not affordable for a retailer.
Unfortunately, special business is almost gone and what's left of it will probably still disappear."
Wolf Fandel: "A shopping center with a market hall does not fit for me.
And the gallery doesn't fit into Bitburg.
Above all, where should the farm market hall go during the time of construction?
The old Edeka would be the solution - even for a long time, if the bit gallery comes sometime.
Or does the bit-galerie's mind already manage to distribute all the businesses from Bitburg?"
George Marquet: "It just won't work.
And no one needs a shopping center that's empty.
In my view, it would have been better to promote a real agricultural market rather than this gallery.
But for a farmer market hall, thanks to the crazy many - as I find - useless construction projects in Bitburg no longer take place.
If the agricultural market hall is cut off, a piece of culture will disappear again."
A suitable similarity: Artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA
In the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York there are many faces to see - white, black and brown, which are almost unmarkable - hanging on cables from the ceiling.
The 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupfern and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the extracts from the prison Fort Leavenworth, where the former intelligence analyst was sentenced to 35 years in prison after she made secret diplomatic messages about the WikiLeaks website.
The new exhibition opened on 2 August is called A Coming Resemblance (A suitable similarity).
It is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline combined its expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transfrau and misleading dissident, whose conviction of Barack Obama was transformed when he had only three days in his office.
Dewey-Hagborg has a sharp, though some intellectual comment not only about the formability of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also about the identity.
Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but has spoken openly since her puberty about identifying as a woman, was sentenced in 2013 for 20 charges, including six violations of spy law, computer fraud and theft.
Through the prison, her picture was suppressed, so much that there was only one photo - a black and white selfie, in which the manning is obviously sitting on a driver seat and wearing a platinum-blown wig - with which she was associated.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg just came from the great success of its 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.
In it, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts such as cigarette stems and rubber by extracting the DNA from the waste to create a picture of what these people might look like.
That was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper store.
"They conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," Dewey-Hagborg explained in a press release of the new exhibition.
And she couldn't visit at this time and she couldn't be photographed, so you contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.
The artist and her incarcerated museum were among the same letter friends who exchanged several letters over the course of two years.
They even created a comic "Superpressed Images", illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which predicted a future in which President Chelsea's judgment would change and would be able to see the exhibition personally.
The fact that Obama would be calling for only a few days after the book was published, after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas, was a kind of happy meeting.
There is also now the opening of the exhibition some depth and strengths, as Donald Trump is waging a war against informants from the government camp and against Transgender troops in order to find new, two-way ways to further expose the steep divisions that he should actually resolve.
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked after the strange timing of all these things, she said that "things happen for a certain reason".
In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning called for an end to the "automatic fragmentation, whose basis has been gender, race, sexuality and culture" (the "i" in her family name).
On the opposite wall is its mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousand feet of Cs and Gs and As, written in blesift.
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show by including the 200 letters (or nucleotide according to the highly developed scientific lexicon of the artist) how amazingly similar, at least in biological terms, we are all.
"What people hope to take on is that our genomics does not care who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work from 2007, Spurious Memories, is also to be seen.
"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories."
The last piece in the exhibition, which is stored in a private room, is a page from the comic novels mentioned above.
She shows Manning how she appears with a free speech phone in her hand from the United States disciplines like King-Kong.
"When they cold your speech, they win," it says.
"So never keep your mouth shut."
"It came directly from a letter she wrote to me," said the artist, who is welcoming from Philadelphia.
"I'll still get my hair when I talk about it."
Manning has not seen the exhibition personally - as it was previewed in the comic book - but if she should do it, she will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks, by her own genomic simulations, which combine like the horrors of Protestants.
This was also targeted, as everything in the exhibition, to the size (5 " 2, Mannings Statur), where their genetic haplo groups were written with pencil.
"In the past I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a lot of people," said Dewey-Hagborg of the portraits.
"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed itself with Chelsea, like the movement that was behind her liberation."
Professor of the University of Northwestern and an employee of the University of Oxford sought for murder
A nationwide manhunt is in charge of a professor at the Northwestern University and an employee of the University of Oxford who is being sought suspiciously after a man in a luxurious apartment in Chicago was struck with deadly injuries.
On Monday, Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) were issued arrest warrants for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, as the files of Cook County's court show.
The documents say Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several stabs.
A Community warning system published by the Chicago Police Authority said that the body was discovered on July 27.
Officials received a call, came to Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries on his body.
Cornell-Duranleau was still declared dead at the scene, and detectives are investigating the stick as a murder, while the police are actively looking for the two suspects, said officials.
Lathem has been an extraordinary professor of microbiology and immunology at the Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, Vice President of University Relations, said in an e-mail statement that Lathem was now allowed and was excluded from the campus of the Northwest University.
"This is now a criminal matter investigated by the competent authorities, and the Northwest University cooperates in this investigation," Cubbage said.
Warren is Senior Treasure Assistant at Oxford University.
A speaker from the University and Somerville College said in an e-mail statement that "we are in contact with the police in the United Kingdom and are ready to help the US intelligence authorities in any earthly way."
The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and wanted him to stand up.
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Authority, Anthony Guglielmi, said he urged the suspects to express themselves to the authorities.
"The police have an idea of their place of residence, and our efforts to locate them are strengthened," Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi said that local, regional and national authorities are helping to find suspects.
Guglielmi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand-Plaza building, who had just received a decisive tip, saying that something happened in apartment 1008.
The police described the scene as very cruel.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident occurred on July 27th.
It was confirmed by security camera that Lathem and Warren were in the building.
"We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi said.
Grand Plaza's management team published a statement to the residents: "The police are currently working on the time axis and the background of the victim and are investigating a variety of motives, including a possible home incident."
"We will complete the WADA flight plan in the near future" - the Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko
The Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it will not take long to implement the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) for the restoration of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).
"At a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the roadmap, RUSADA has been given the right to plan and test in cooperation with the UK Anti-Doping.
The WADA flight plan was updated in this respect," Mutko explained on Thursday.
The PM commented on the second part of the WADA roadmap to comply with the code, which describes the criteria for the re-establishment of RUSADA and was recently published on the organisation's website.
According to Mutko, he contains nothing that could cause concern for Russia.
"Everything has been announced, everything will be implemented.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the WADA in the near future," he added.
One of the criteria set out in the list, however, shows that the Russian Anti-Doping authorities must publicly accept the results reported of the investigation approved by the WADA by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren to allegedly supported dopings in the Russian sport.
Regarding the issue, Mutko said: "We are conducting the investigation because our anti-doping system has made an error.
All measures have been implemented.
But there were no state programmes, and we will not give anything that does not exist."
Mutko's words were in agreement with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of the independent Russian Anti-Doping Commission.
In the conversation with the Russian sales agency RSport at the beginning of the day, Smirnov added problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organisations, but added: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
No one intends to accept this report unconditionally," Smirnov added.
RUSADA was excluded in November 2015 in the course of the Doping scandal by the WADA from carrying out doping checks in Russia.
However, you were allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and UK Anti-Doping (UKKAD).
After a visit to the organization's headquarters in Moscow in July, WADA Director General Olivier Niggli stated that RUSADA is moving "in the right direction" to be used again.

This is a purely precautionary measure, which could continue to be the result of no health damage, as stated in the Communication.
From now on, only eggs should be delivered to Aldi, which have been proven negatively tested for fipronil-containing anti-laundering agents.
Aldi wants to make clarity and transparency with his customers.
The startups that will help your company not become the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure the luck of your employees at your e-commerce start-up, but the queries did not work.
The answers were often vague, less helpful or - even worse - deceptive.
And even if you promise anonymity, some workers don't trust the process.
"There was just never consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who operates the 75-person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care Society Madison Reed.
She called people from outside for help.
A new race of Human Resources Start-ups is growing to help companies find out how their employees feel.
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring the employee's commitment, it enables companies to carry out inquiries, address special groups and demographic groups, provide employees with anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases allow whistleblowers to deal with C-Suite leadership forces and directly with the Board of Directors.
"They now have tools such as Strava and Fitbit to track their health, but where is the Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive by Redwood City Start-up Glint, whose software analysis tools are used by companies to measure employee commitment.
Errett said that she had a better insight into what your employees thought and felt in the three years she won with Glint.
In addition to the Snap inquiries and surveys of certain teams, it offers a hot card from the company that shows at a glance what units have most complaints and which leadership have low consent results - so that you can nest, why.
Companies come to see that they must stay at the top of the workplace culture so that you do not become the next Uber that was developed in scandals, since a former employee has published a blog post describing an environment of harassment in which those who spoke were punished.
For start-ups like Glint, this desire is a lucrative business option after a review.
The Global Governance, Regulation and Compliance Branch could have more than $118.7 billion in 2020, according to the Let's Talk Payments financial website.
Denver, Colorado, start-up Converter, the company helps prevent and detect bad behavior, saw an increasing interest and activity in the beginning of this year in the middle of the Upper Fall in Miscredit.
Convert has almost 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber has recently signed up as a client.
Like Glint, Converter lets companies send custom "Puls-" queries, collect confidential answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline, which allows employees to report bad behavior.
And if the Chief Executive is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board.
"The court of public opinion has recorded the regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and manager of Convercent.
When a company is found which treats its employees badly or behaves unethically, it can experience costly consequences through consumer boycott, employee fluctuation and complaints, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations, has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures and have a simple opportunity to reach their corporate headquarters.
Earlier, when an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a telephone number or e-mail for the company headquarters, file a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously.
It was often a frightening and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Council, who said there was no good opportunity to follow the complaints of employees.
Now, since the company uses Converter, problems that have previously been hidden from leaders sitting in offices in cities or states can be identified and addressed more quickly - such as discrimination, harassment or inadvertent practices.
"I can get closer to this comprehensive, 360-degree view into the experience with employment," said Vitrano, who led the Risk Management Group of Ruby Tuesday.
"And we protect our shareholders from employment disputes."
Business started to take the importance of ethics, values and employee engagement in 2002, after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations by the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.
But it took until the "Social Media came to their right", that companies recognized that you couldn't prevent their dirty laundry going online.
"Before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service, and charge companies with repeated fees for the use of their products.
It is a business model and a chance to find the agreement of Venture Capital Investors that have supported both startups.
Converter received $10 million in the financing of companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital in February, raising the total capital to $47 million.
Glitzern secured $10 million in November by Bessemer Venture Partners and brought his entire funding to $60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising, given the networked nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
There is a growing complexity of research that shows that today's employees expect more of their jobs than they have ever expected.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high fees and interesting projects are only investments.
The employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.
"If people are happy to be in a company, feel that they are part of their voices, and that the work they do is rewarding, then they feel more committed to making this company succeed," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, who uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors achieve income when their portfolio companies run well. Companies run well when employees are employed and engaged.
If the Analytics tools promise third-party commitment and the use of employees, it is no wonder that you will find support.
The data on the employee's commitment to the experts of the workplace culture is important.
But the data is useless if the managers of a company do not take action.
In fact, when a company asks for your feedback, it can have a expectation that change is on the way.
And if the change doesn't come fast enough, or not at all, this can cause disappointments and discourage employees.
"If you ask 4,000 suggestions, you must be ready to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the Business Management company Kotter International, who has seen companies that have left too much to collect data.
"Because if you don't follow, employees will ask themselves, "Have you really heard me?
Are you taking care of that?
And if you don't worry about it, why should I?"
Madison Reed, who is now conducting monthly employee inquiries, was in a position to initiate measures on the same day when a problem is reported about Glint, so to speak.
And after the collection of feedback from frustrated employees, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems by means of the speed of decision-making and quality of communication.
With Ruby Tuesday, the company always has new insights about employees, and it hopes that in the long term this leads to a better binding of employees in a sector known for high sales.
"If you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people," said Vitrano.
"And if you lose people, you also lose customers.
And if you lose customers, then you lose companies.
The NSAA eliminates the two-day practices and makes a long day for the browns
It goes at 23 hours when a lot of UCLA football players are on one side of the team's new practice fields on campus.
Some have removed their tricotober parts and show their backs full of sweat from the first day of the training camp.
For a good part of the team, these inactive minutes represent a lunch break.
Players who are enrolled in the summer courses will return to their final exams after the three-hour exercise before they return to the Waterman Football Center the next morning at 6:30 p.m.
"This is a real tree mill for the boys next three days," said Bruins-trainer Jim Mora shortly before Monday to Tuesday.
The NSAA eliminates two-day exercises to facilitate player load, and it has actually extended its days - at least until the final on Friday.
Therefore, the first three trainings of the UCLA should start at 19:15 to correct the already packed schedules of the players.
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bruins moved to the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mora's six games in Westwood.
They will be held during August 18 exercises. 20 before the beginning of the formal preparations for their rise against Texas A & M in September.
Mora said that he supported the regulation of the NSAA even if it added another point to the multi-worked route of the players.
"We put this huge burden on them three or four days, and it is very challenging," said Mora.
"And they've just pushed it through, they're going on, they're great people.
I think as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time, it will really be great."
The UCLA will end its practices as soon as the camp is finished, which, in view of the clear lines of its fields of a adjacent parking lot and the adjacent Luskin Center, a hotel of the elevated class, which has already been awarded foot-and-mouths, which will be no easy task.
Bruins players are supposed to occupy the hotel from this weekend, but Mora admitted that there might be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season.
"We will use our security," said Mora.
"That's a real problem, and it's not much to think that people rent a room there and then decide to record a practice there.
If you have the video tape from a practice, it's a pretty good deal.
But we have security forces there, and we have security forces on parking 8.
We'll do the best we can with what we have.
That's why I'm not so worried.
We have a plan."
Facebook wants to intensify fact-checking in the fight against false news
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false reports to fact-finders from third parties and then show their results under the original contribution, said the world's largest online social network on Thursday. It's one of his efforts to fight so-called fake news.
The company said in an opinion on its website that it will start using updated machine learning methods to identify possible misstatements and send them to fact-finders, which may show the results of the fact-checking from the original article.
Facebook has been criticised as one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news, many of which believe that they also influenced the 2016 presidential elections.
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe, with the French voters being overwhelmed by false stories in front of the May presidential elections, and Germany supports a plan to be punished after social media networks, if they fail to succeed, to eliminate horrendous posts as before the elections there in September.
On Thursday, Facebook said in a separate statement to Germany that a test of the new facts will be launched in the USA, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to the knowledge that stories of fact-finders are being challenged by third parties, people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share," said Sara Su, Product Manager for Facebook News in a blog.
She added that Facebook will continue to test its feature on the "connected article" and work on other changes to its news feed to reduce false messages.
Making a comic novel: A castle in the history of England
In his younger past, the little Scotney Castle was seen in a Squeeze music video and was a locker for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
But Scottney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his cozy seat in the Bewl River Valley in Kent and has now become an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a Mophaar Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents.
"I find it so beautiful to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years," he says tired.
"What for a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand."
'A Castle in England' extends the time from the Middle Ages to the Age of Edward and documents the families that lived in Scotland. Each story was illustrated by another emerging British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
It is not the first book of Rhodes based on an archive: He wrote in 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpectedly emotional.
"I have only reacted to the thumbprint on the side of a letter written by a doppelganger in the 1700s who worked for the Jacobiners," he says.
"That's his thumb impression!
And letters always smell like smoke, for at that time a fire was kindled because of the light.
For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect, as if he himself were in it.
Oh, I love archives!"
For someone so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle for almost four months ("To be honest: I have overestimated my welcome"), all this seems to be nice to be true.
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, visiting the archives, and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the mounted hyena heads on the walls and bottles that had spent centuries in the grave.
He walked through the fields and ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscapers, gardeners and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.
Then, at night he drank "Whiskey and started writing".
Scottney's intimate history is relatively unknown, as the National Trust was given full access only in 2006 when the last Erbin, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived a decade later, the employees just started to take care of the archive that he described as "hunts of years in which the aristocrats said "Oh, throw it on the roofs".
Diaries, letters from the time of the English Empire, maps that represent who owned something: "You might think that conflicts of land would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was a birch to fight the two families.
Boys, let everything go his way!"
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to enter the English history on a broader basis, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the construction of 1381.
"There is a record of a riot that occurred in the castle in 1380, in this book entitled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex'," says Rhodes.
"The construction industry began in this area and I thought a rebellion was a good start.
Maybe the two are connected?"
Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - as 'The Priest', which tells the story of the Jesuit father, who the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or 'The Smuggler', in which the smuggler Arthur Darrell of the 18th century is portrayed, who staged his own worship by filling a sarg with stones (a discovery made only years later when his sarg was dug out).
The Darrells are the Rhodes' favorite family of Scottney: "The men seemed to be pretty good, always making debts and spending money on things they couldn't afford.
Other generations of Darrell men solved their debt crises by marrying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of good-looking boys, with a talent to hire women."
After the end of his use in the castle, Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences
He has taken a two-week stay in the Finnish Wild for a comic novel about Elemmannmäki, the site of a sanatorium from the early 20th century, which has since been called back from nature.
But Scottney has a special place for him.
"I was sad to go again," he says.
It was like, "Oh, now I have to finish up with the damn life again."
Campaign started: Over 300 years old Mariencapelle hidden in Rhöndorf
With the 301-year-old Mariencapelle in Rhöndorf, the city of Bad Honnef launched its campaign on Friday to introduce a new roof brand (round view of Thursday).
Until Thursday, Mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team around Nelson Artz want to keep the logo and the slogan secret.
At the end of August, there will be a festival on the island of Grafenwerth as the highlight of the campaign.
"Very nice for us.
Or?", the action makers have been asking about the posters on the Rhöndorfer Kapelle since yesterday.
"We don't really think that (of course!)," they wrote on their yesterday-free website.
"But we use this measure to win your attention.
And to make it clear that some are better than it seems.
In fact, we are firmly convinced that we as the Bad Honnefer citizens know very well about the beauty and attractiveness of our city."
In the action it goes about more than "only" a logo and a slogan, it goes on.
"It is worth formulating a self-contained promise, one that gives the city an unmistakable single-setting feature."
Finally, they compete with other municipalities.
The city of Bad Honnef is able to cost its new roof brand and the campaign.
Military Reforms in Turkey - Erdogan's Fear of the Army
Every year in early August, the Military Council (YAS) advises on pensions and transportation in the office.
So is this week.
At first glance a normal process.
But nothing is routine with the Turkish forces one year after the coup attempt.
The meeting was no longer held in the building of the General Staff, as before, but at the office of the Prime Minister.
The consultations were held under the chairmanship of the Government and the five Vice-Presidents, as well as the Minister of Defence, Home Affairs, Justice and Foreign Affairs.
Thus the civilians in the YAS were in the majority.
The government is pulling the triggers in the military.
Chief General Hulusi Akar remains in office, but the commanders of the army, the Air Force and the Navy have been suspended.
Since the failed coup, Head of State Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals.
Over 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to the close links to the movement of the exile preacher Fethullah Gulen, who sees Erdogan as a drag of the puttch test.
Against 486 people who are to be directly involved in the coup attempt will be negotiated in Ankara since this week.
Already on the day after the pusch Erdogan had referred to the attempt to change as "God's gift" as he gave him the opportunity to "clean up the fighting forces completely".
But does Erdogan really have the army in his grip?
At the end of February, the newspaper "Hürriyet" published an article entitled "Unhappiness in the Military Headquarters".
In the General Staff there are concerns about an increasing "islamisation" of the army, which, among other things, manifest itself in the lifting of the capitulation ban for soldiers, wrote the newspaper.
In any case, the Great Cleanup at the Army and the Security Forces continues.
In mid-July Erdogan had another 7395 civil servants, including 2303 police officers and 546 soldiers.
It seemed like Erdogan was beating the military.
The generals were earlier than the real lords of the country.
Trimal called on her role as the guardian of the world government order.
Following his election in 2002, Erdogan pushed the military's power back step by step, not least by calling for the European Union's reform proposals.
Former officers say Erdogan drive targets Islamization of the forces of war.
In the magazine "Vocal Europe" a non-named officer who was looking for fear of persecution abroad warned that the Turkish army would be "full of extremists and Salafists" in a few years.
If this is the case, such a development could not allow the nato to be cold.
Nevertheless, there is doubt in the alliance after the cleansing of the Turkish army.
The management structures and operational capabilities are "weaked", says Nato diplomats.
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
There will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card, said President Donald Trump, quoted by the media.
It foresees lowering the legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, stricter rules for obtaining visas for a long-term work permit and restrictions for families-oriented visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the President.
The draft legislation is to be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, increase wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers, and this will be done by changing the way the US is going to change the way the citizens from other countries are spending Green Cards."
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system.
This new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English who have the financial resources to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy," Trump, quoted by the American media, said.
Ministry wants to fix routes for racing shuttles
Always again in the past months, there has been a dispute about the future of the race shuttle - now it should go very quickly.
Even before the end of the year, it is intended to be built on the Moroccan route on which the tour is taking.
In order to ensure the long-term future of the race shuttle, construction work is expected to start on the track this year, according to the Ministry of Transport.
"With the decision to continue ordering and repairing the route Ilmenau-Renneg, the country recognises this connection especially important for tourism," said Transport Secretary Klaus Sühl on Friday in Erfurt.
The cost of maintaining the route was approximately EUR 2.5 million.
Of this amount, the country took 75 percent.
The contract, on the basis of which the shuttle is to be ordered from the country in the future, is now finalized, Sühl explained.
The Ministry and the Südtüringen Bahn as operators have already agreed on the technical details.
"This is how the roadmap, the vehicles used and the quality standards are negotiated," Sühl said.
The proposed contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be concluded for a period of 11 years.
In order to be ordered on a regular basis, the Rennsteig-Shuttle will be ordered on December 2017.
The Rennsteig-Shuttle is a railway connection, particularly popular among tourists, between the railway stations Ilmenau and Rensteig.
In the past months, a pilot operation has been tested whether the route is used by enough people to order it regularly again in the future.
The track is also very blasphemous in parts.
The rise of sex robots is real, and we should worry
Just as you thought it couldn't get any more crazy in 2017, a new report on the technological developments in the field of sex robots is coming.
Yes, indeed.
Sex robots are a big deal right now.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Sharkey, an emeritus professor of robotics and artistic intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founders of the FRR, we need to start taking her up seriously.
Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the chest and the type of fingernail.
"People make fun of them, but companies deliver a lot of them, and we will see them much more often," said Mr. Sharky in the publication of his new report.
Modern funguses have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone hat that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence.
The user can also "adapt" his robot according to his convictions and by choosing everything from the robot's eye color through the shape of the chest scales to the type or color of his fingernails.
But it will be even more disturbing, as many robots have the "personalities" that would allow a stepford woman to appear progressive.
Modern specimens have developed into robots with a silicone hat.
For example, the RealBotix robot allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appropriate, such as fearlessness.
And then there is the Roxxxy Gold Sex robot developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities such as "Frigid Farrah", which conveys the impression of fearlessness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventive" personality.
"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is as well adapted to your personality as possible", the website of True Companion warms up.
So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.
She also has her voices during the day - just like real people!
She can be tired, fixed on conversation or she can be "in a mood!"
There are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the underlying female characteristics, the acts of rape, when you take a step towards Frigid (meaning here: objective) Farrah, most of the worry.
On his website, True Companion Roxxxy compares with a vibrator, but for men.
"If women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can't men have Roxxxy?" it says on the website.
However, these sex robots are not just a festive or just another sex toy.
Their emergence and increasing refineries point to something darker and deeper in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with undermining as an optional addition.
Of course, most men do not keep sex robots, and while the FRR notices their increasing popularity, they remain on the edge of consumption culture.
But what is secure from the border zones can be very educational in terms of the spirit of the time in which we live.
And many people are not unusual or offensive until the free market gives them permission to do so.
However, there is a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots occur at a time when women's rights are threatened worldwide, where there is a president in the White House who has warned women to have sexual assault.
The most frightening aspect of the television series 'The Handmaid's Tale' ('The Report of the Magd') are not the graphic images, the faint bodies and the sharp eyes, but how realistic this vision works.
The Republic of Gilead is a jump, but at the moment this does not feel like a big jump.
The aim behind these sex robots is to create a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible (if also with pornostar proportions).
Their builders want them to feel humanly that they follow the movement of a real body.
But when it comes to their "personalities", the robots are not real women.
You can't separate from her companion or just leave.
They have no mediation or background history, nothing that suggests independence or anything that could interfere with the imagination of total undermining.
In other words, they are fallen slaves.
Or to express it in the speech of 2017: Service girls
Trump's great performance?
He makes with Romney the meaning of a healthy human mind.
It has become a vitality of the Trump era that the political divisions that have polarized the U.S. election have also split families into minority information.
Around Christmas and Easter there were newspapers in the United States with advice on how to deal with the horror of Trump-elected relatives.
We're all insisting on putting our filter bubbles in place.
Less noticed is the power of Trumps to bring together families.
I mention this because my cousin, a left-handed poet who lives in Chicago and has been working with the Republicans in our family for a long time, visited me this week in New York.
She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican relationship with which she had fought for decades because of politics, is suddenly and very peculiarly on the same side.
It is certainly a good thing about the dining table, but I think in another context that this also brings significant risks to myself.
The left was strengthened by Trump, but the creative effect of his presidency has the power to move us all to the right.
When we talk about "normalization" and Trump, we refer to the cruel possibility that his measurements of one day will no longer come to our attention.
However, there is an even more frightening long-term scenario in which the Trump Republicans of the right wing are "normalized", which suddenly appear to be a sense of reasonableness in comparison with its standards.
I find myself today from an active nostalgia for the middle of Romney's hilarious version of the crazy - the dog on the auto roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how to look at his tax statement) - both of which were actually a very mild penalty compared to Trump.
If Trump is going, the next candidate of the Republicans must be spiritually healthy only to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.
When my cousin was in the city, we brought our children to Karussell in Central Park, the largest carussells in the New York Park Department, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need coffee.
The horses are enormously large, the Fiberglas designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are narrow and the animals turn around to look full of fear over their own shoulders - extreme window and the climbing music conveys this in a remarkable way.
So many clichés of a city are disappointed: the views of high buildings will be old, the cylinders will be trusted to offer a lot of excitement, and the reality of the city will not be justified in the dream.
Thirty-five years later, and I'm still not far from the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is actually not a Swiss Cottage - the theme pub Ye Old Swiss Cottage is not - but a big circuit in Northern London.
The Central Park Karussell, however, is still a rare magical experience, since here two-year-olds, an 11-year-old and two-year-olds can go to it in the 40's and all have a great time.
If I could have evaluated the Karussell, I would have given him the full number of points, but luckily no one has asked for it.
On the other hand, this week I was forced to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale from one to five stars before I was able to pass my credit card.
In the coffeehouse at the corner of my street it is the same, plus the option to compare the rating with a 15% drink money - this to buy something about the shop.
This not only slows down what should be a neutral exchange, but also exerts pressure on the server to put personality into a situation where it is not necessary.
The poor woman in the storehouse was apologizing, while I was tired of getting my credit card with five stars.
Oscar Pistorius with chest pain from prison in the hospital
Pistorius has for the second time left the prison for a hospital visit.
Last year, he was taken to the hospital because of the treatment of cuts in his wrists, which he was sent to the prison authorities after a case in his cell.
Pistorius was sentenced for murder after an appeal from the prosecutors against a first death sentence.
He killed a stone camp in the early morning of Valentine's Day 2013 by shooting her several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed that he kept his girlfriend for a night walk that was hiding in the cabin.
The prosecutors have announced their intention this time against the six-year prison sentence of Pistorius Appeal, from which they say they are too careful.
The National Criminal Prosecution Authority said that it will be brought before the Supreme Court of South Africa and that the opposition could be heard this year.
Pistorius runs a risk that his punishment will be increased to 15 years if the prosecutors are successful.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
As a farmer Arnold finds a remarkable egg
As the last of the Blumber schools, the four classes from foot and epfenhofen were released into the holidays and further schools.
Three of the graduates will go to the gym in the future, four to the real school.
On Tuesday, the school principal Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public in the Biesental civil house in Epfenhofen.
The 29 students of the four classes under the leadership of Sophia Schumacher and Regina Meder chose a young eagle who grows up in the chicken yard, but then will be released to freedom.
To this end, the coiner Schar conducted a musical entitled "The Adler in Hühnnerhof".
Bauer Arnold found a remarkable egg, and it was broken by his chickens.
Instead of a chicken kitchen, a little eagle came out.
But the hope of making a cave out of it failed, the Adler spread out his wings on a high mountain.
Then the classes showed three and four in Yvonne Frank's one study a chicken dance.
The Hens danced with the young gockels who wore cylinders to the law.
The Adler stood for integration, the school principal Angelika Sitte said.
The young animal is different from the other young animals (cooks), but it is one of them.
But he'll never be like a cave.
His destiny was to be free.
She wanted every fourth grader to feel accepted in his new school.
It was followed by a thank you to the colleagues, former school principal Michael Müller, who was always at teaching courses, and the parents' representatives.
The kitchen time was now over, Professor Sophia Schumacher explained.
After two years of teaching, she left her students very low, because it was a really great time.
Finally, they have been able to rely on the fourth class.
At the end, all the students made a song of summer time and vacation time.
This brought great joy to the children.
Eight first-class students are already registered for the new school year.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal camping in Greece, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, quoted from television, shared with them.
In the morning of August 1st, a group of illegal-sacrifice people, including the two Bulgarians, were arrested by the police in Sithonia.
They were released on the same day, while a study is currently under way.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported that the Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have strengthened control over the free camps and have placed considerable fines on anyone who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose.
The checks will continue throughout the season.
The Ministry said the court could charge a fine.
Software update for diesel vehicles: What the affected need to know now
How exactly does the software update take place?
Should Diesel professionals participate in the action?
The main questions and answers in the overview.
At the Diesel Summit, BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for about 5.3 million cars.
They are intended to improve the charging behaviour of cars in the Euro 5 and partly Euro 6 emission classes.
Euro-4-diesel or worse are excluded.
Anja Smetanin from the ACE Auto Club Europe provides estimates:
Is the new action mandatory?
No, the negotiated software updates are voluntary.
"The mandatory updates are only applicable to vehicles that have foam software," says Anja Smetanin.
Their refurbishment has been arranged by the Air Traffic Unit (KBA).
How and from when will customers be informed about updates?
The manufacturers have announced a rapid implementation in the coming months, but have not yet called an exact date.
Daimler has announced to write to each person concerned.
If there is no inspection, it will be carried out within their framework.
How long should the total replacements be allowed to go?
"Sweet to say," Smetanin says.
This depends on the commitment of the manufacturers as well as on political pressure.
"For we have seen, the car manufacturers are not acting voluntarily on the topic of the environment so far."
How long the update should take.
The refurbishment itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop.
It could be time-consuming to get a date.
What are the drivers who do not drive BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW group?
The ACE advises to wait.
It is likely that foreign producers would be following, as Smetanin.
Are you threatening a massive price drop in Euro-4-cars?
The ACE fears that.
But just in the regions where traffic bans are threatening.
In the rural area, there are still no value losses for older diesel.
The ACE advises to wait with a sale.
LL Cool J receives Kennedy Center award
Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington.
The first award under President Trump promises to become political.
One of the winners does not want to come - from protest.
LL Cool J (49) is the first rapper to receive one of the desired awards from the renowned Kennedy Center.
As the cultural institution announced on Thursday, this year also includes singer Gloria Estefan (59), Lionel Richie (68) and choreographer Carmen de Lavallade (86) and TV producer Norman Lear (95).
The awards will be handed over at the beginning of December.
Traditionally, US President Donald Trump will host and participate with his wife Melania in the award.
For this reason, Lear, who became known as a progressive TV series, already announced that he would refuse to participate in the Gala.
The "New York Times" said, "This presidency has decided to completely ignore the arts and human rights - even to take away their funds - and that weighs me".
The 59-year-old Estefan stressed that she would use the conversation with Trump to clarify her views.
The Kennedy Centre, named after former President John F. Kennedy, is the largest cultural institution in the U.S. capital.
Among the former prize winners are Meryl Streep, Aretha Franklin, Robert De Niro, George Lucas, Tom Hanks and Sting.
We make the city a living
Roland Wacker, Haslach's city treekeeper, goes to rent next year.
The place is already written - suitable applicants are rare.
For 31 years, Wacker has been a city builder.
And the work still makes him great fun, as he communicates in the press.
He reports on many varied but also demanding tasks that await his successor.
At the same time, he is surprised that no application has yet met the requirement profile.
The city is looking for an architect or builder as soon as possible.
Thus - given the regular deadlines - there should still be enough time for processing.
Since Haslach works for the administrative community as a lower construction authority, the applicant must present the relevant conclusions.
Because this function wants to keep the city anyway.
If they could no longer complete it, the citizens would have to go to Offenburg for advice.
But close to the city and to it itself is important, says Wacker, who reports from a good operating climate as well as good mood between authorities and citizens.
In more than 30 years at the office, some important projects have been gathered, looking back at the Wacker with pride.
"We make the city of life", he is sure about the building and his employees.
But also in the future there are many different projects on the agenda: the transformation of the former Hukla area and the Lowerhofen parking lot have been attacked.
The kinzig bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is being renewed, and the stadiumization is still a topic.
The latter alone will be hit by about 1.5 million euros, "if we do it right", Wacker appreciates.
"All in all, great tasks await my successor.
The work here is fun."
It is designed for a city tree builder of large playgrounds.
With Haslach's own farm and gardening, it is possible to react quite flexibly to many.
"You can move a lot," said Wacker, and the design of the greenery is often mentioned by citizens and visitors.
Since the old town as an ensemble is under the protection of mind, it is important to have "an eye for what is clean", when new buildings are approved, the distinguished city builders stress.
Nonetheless, the city tree builder bears high responsibility.
He's a builder. "It's all about my table at the end."
He can count on long-term employees for care and coordination: Markus Neumeier (high construction) has been Manfred Schöner (deep construction) for ten years.
Also, that his successor remains long, Wacker wishes: "We are looking for someone who really identifies himself and wants to stay."
Because continuity was important not only for a good operating climate, but also for the further design of the city.
If Roland Wacker wants to take over, he should be able to present a completed study as a graduate engineer or a bachelor with expertise in architecture and have good expertise in the areas of construction and planning law.
The city building is supported by high and underground construction, construction planning, basic employment matters, management of the city's properties, the city's operating court with Bauhof and the city garden, as well as the lower construction authority, including mental protection.
Cycling cast on lines: South railways closed
According to the police, the unknown workers had so far cast the blue bike from the railway crossing in the area of the Leobener Street (B116) on the lines.
They were so badly damaged that the lifting suit had to be held.
The investigators go out of two men's taverns and look for them from the hour of the night.
Near the tator, a pink roller and a bicycle driver were observed by witnesses.
"This goes far beyond a loophole," said ÖBB speaker Christoph Posch to the APA.
They or the perpetrators would have put themselves in great danger and would also be in danger of transport.
In addition to the damage to the hole and the installation, as well as the delay minutes and the cost of rail replacement transport, there could also be pönals of the railway customers.
In total, it was a "great" sum, the speaker said.
The damage was remedied on Friday morning, and rail traffic on the southern railway route could be managed without obstacles.
Nearly ten passenger trains were missed on Friday morning, two of which covered the transport.
The goods did not fail, but they were late.
According to ÖBB speakers, Christoph Posch had to be replaced by some 200 meters of overheads.
Insulators and masts were also damaged.
Red meat, milk products and chocolate could help to relieve IBD (inflammatory tanning)
Red meat and chocolate can sound like an alpine dream for your digestion system.
But a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could relieve the symptoms of patients with inflammation of the liver.
The unacceptable state, which affects about 1.3 million in the United States and in Britain 300,000, causes stomach cramps and swellings, recurrent or bloody accidents, weight loss and extreme tiredness.
While the affected are normally found to milk meat and milk products to relieve their symptoms, researchers at the University of Washington found that the essential amino acids tryptochan of proteins contributes to developing immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine.
The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells are patrolling the intestine to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in food do not enter the body.
Cells capable of triggering inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
If the balance is too far in the direction of inflammation, it can result in an inflammation of inflammation.
In experiments, it was found that a type of tolerant immune cell occurs in mice that carry a certain bacteria in their tissues.
And the bacteria need tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of cells.
Professor Colonna said: "We have a link between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the Darm microbial, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.
The more triptohan had the mouse in their food, the more they had these immune cells."
He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and one rich diet at Tryptohan promote more tolerant, less ingenious Darmmieus if the same system works in humans too.
The postdoctoral Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan investigated a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, which was kept apart, had not.
She suspected that the difference had to be made with the stomach microbes of the mouse - the community of bacteria, viruses and mushrooms that normally live in the stomach.
The mice were sequenced DNA and six bacteria were found that were present in the mice with the immune cells, but without them missing in the mice.
Mouse was removed in a sterile environment, so they lacked a intestinal microbial and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells.
To understand how the bacteria affected the immune system, researchers let L. reutery grow in a fluid and then transferred small amounts of fluid - without the bacteria - to unusual immune cells isolated by the mice.
The immune cells developed into the tolerant cells.
When the active component was purified from the fluid, it proved to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism, known as indol-3-milk acid.
When researchers doubled the amount of tryptohan in the mouse's feed, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the tryptohan values were half-haled, the number of cells fell by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerant cells as mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our stomach contractes.
It is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develops the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptohan have been found in humans with inflammatory darkness.
She said, "The development of these cells is probably something we want to encourage, as these cells control inflammations on the inner surface of the intestine.
Potentially, high tryptophan values in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an expansion of this population."
Jose Maurinho believes Manchester United with Nemnja Matic has committed a "Genie"
At Manchester United, with Nemanja Matic signed a "Genie", Jose Maurinho believed that after the middle field player had his debut on Wednesday night against Sampdoria.
The 40 million pounds of Chelsea's signature began with a 2:1 victory in Dublin, the last preseason game, before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday, and impressed in the holding roll, as people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira marched into love.
Matic, however, was excluded from the prepare-up Asia Tournament of the Blues and only made 45 minutes, which gave Maurinho that he had to improve before the start of the premium League season.
"He needs time, but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football," said Maurinho.
"We will help him to be ready sooner than later."
In addition to Matic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku started at the Aviva Stadium when Maurinho formed his start XI for the beginning of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Maurinho wanted three further new obligations, but he insisted that the club had already performed a "funastic work" to meet three of its four priority new obligations.
"Three out of four, I thank the association for that," he added.
"I'll be happier if they get four out of four for me, but they've done a lot of work."
Boeing "Malt" Dreamliner in Heaven
The US aircraft manufacturer Boeing painted the silhouette of a dreamliner in the sky.
The pilots fled from Seattle in the U.S. state of Washington, but the drawing began in Marquette in the U.S. state of Michigan and moved in the form of a dreamliner across the United States, which is several thousand kilometers.
The action lasted 18 hours and a minute.
On the radar screens was the form of a dreamliner.
The whole thing was a long-lasting test for new engines.
Boeing had already made such an announcement.
Thus the number "787" and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky.
New depth strike for Martin Schulz - Hannover, we have a problem
As the wind moves on: As Sigmar Gabriel was still SPD Chief, social-democratic Prime Ministers were always looking at elections with a certain concern for Berlin.
Just no fire from the party center, just no counterwind from the alliance - so said the most important desire of the voters.
Since Martin Schulz led the party, this has changed fundamentally.
Since then, employees from the Willy-Brandt-House have been observing the events in the SPD-run capital cities with growing growth.
What Schulz has been getting from there since the beginning of the year would not have been described in the approach.
It was a deep blow.
And after each other.
After the surprising end of the red-green majority in Niedersachsen, the Bundes-CDU sees a general signal against the coalitions of SPD and Greens.
"This shows once again: Red-Green simply cannot be ruled reliably," said Secretary General Peter Tauber to the German network of editors (RND).
The surprising fact that the Greens' Group's opposition to the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) has become a major crisis.
Five months before the country day election, his red-green coalition lost its one-vote majority to the opposition from CDU and FDP.
The Green-Bundesbehavior Michael Kellner has called on the dissatisfaction of the Lower-Saxon Green-Register Every Twists to return their mandate.
Transgression to CDU means a clear counterfeiting of the electorate's will.
Each of the tweets must immediately return their mandate," said the Federal Business Manager and Electionr of the Greens to the Editorial Network of Germany (RND).
"It must not be all true," says an SPD Wahlkäckfämper, when on Friday morning the new hiobs message reaches the party centre.
Stephan Weil, President of the SPD Minister of Lower Saxony, is standing there after the rebellion of the Green MPs, every twist to the CDU without their own majority of government.
It is the provisional highlight of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD country associations.
And no one knows what comes next.
The miseries began with the unexpected clear defeat at the Saarland elections in March.
A blue eye, no more, calmed down the associates of his time.
After the country day elections in Schleswig-Holstein and Nordrhein-Westfalen, everything will be different.
This has also become worse - and yet it has become much worse.
The defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into the Taumeln, the Düsseldorf-Pleite was shooting the party.
Hard to recall the associates in the weeks after that.
Then, when they had just created new courage, the G-20 summit came from Hamburg.
And with him came the next strike.
Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD captain, lost his Nimbus that weekend because he was sitting in Elbphil harmony while burning his city.
And because he then made so much of everything wrong in the crisis communication that you can make it wrong.
Since then, school has been fighting for its political survival.
So now we're still Stephan Weil.
Because of the VW gas deal and its role in the Supervisory Board, the Dutch Prime Minister has been in criticism for a long time.
Misses surveyed came along.
However, or perhaps just that is why, because of the past few weeks, it has been increasingly trying to put accents in the fed.
The efforts of the former mayor of Hannover to expand his power in Berlin were also not hidden in the environment of Martin Schulz.
They allowed him because they promised a stabilization of the party.
Now the exact opposite could occur.
Because of this, there is basically no blame on the party's domestic bid of the Lower Saxony Greens.
And Schulz isn't.
Sometimes, therefore, the partners try to keep their own rows closed.
Her anger is directed at the greens, and here, above all, at the detractive parliamentary Twest.
"It is ineffective and democratically damaging, as Mrs. Twesten puts her own career interests over the interests of everyone else," says Matthias Miersch, Head of the Party Links in the SPD Federal Party, the Editorial Network of Germany (RND).
Mrs Twesten has not been elected as a direct candidate for her person, but through the country list of the Lower Saxony Greens, so the Lower Saxony MP continues.
The logical consequence would be that she gives back her mandate.
Thomas Oppermann, head of the SPD Federal Party, accused of a "undemocratic Manover".
"The voter will was clear four years ago: the people made Stephan Weil the Prime Minister," says Oppermann, who leads the SPD as the top candidate in the federal day election, to the RND.
"Now the personal career memory of a future CDU agent distorts the election result," Oppermann continued.
He asked me to explain the reasons.
I want to know whether there has been more or if there has been any further promises of the CDU Lower Saxony.
Funding for local areas III
Those who want to repair the house in the years to come can receive support from the country first.
About this, Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of STEG City Development were informed on Wednesday in Refingen.
At the beginning of the information event, Schindler once again gave a look back to the past.
Since 1991, it has been in Recefingen healing areas.
At that time, in the recovery zone I from 1991 to 2004, the country of Baden-Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding.
In the recovery zone II from 2005 to 2016, the grant was still 60 percent.
For Schindler, the previous renovations are a "success project" - it is finally important to promote internal development, and not only to open new construction areas.
On 4 April, Karlsruhe received information from the Government Bureau that there will be a recovery area III.
The aid amount amounts to EUR 833 333, of which EUR 500 000 is coming from the country, the rest of which is received from the municipality.
How does a healing area come about now?
One will, so Schindler, continue to examine where the "real old" houses are.
But it also plays a role in improving whether there is any interest in the planned area at all.
If so, the boundaries of the area could then be re-moved.
The STEG represented Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel on Wednesday.
Keller presented the contents of the "Social City" program in which the repairs would then be carried out.
The core of the programme is the revitalization of urban areas, the improvement of living and working conditions and the maintenance and expansion of infrastructure.
The measures would be carried out on an object, i.e. per piece of land.
The area of repair would finally be established as a statute.
The period of authorisation for the funding shall run from 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026.
However, until September this year, the stocktaking would only be carried out in the framework of which the participants received a questionnaire to be completed.
In November or December, it will be possible to take the legislative decision so that the reforms can be started in the coming year.
Pietzschmann then explained that each municipality had to carry out the abovementioned preliminary investigations.
It is to assess the urban disasters and decide when and to what extent they will be healed.
For each piece of land, a repair notice will also be entered in the basic book.
Pietzschmann himself will come to receive and take a picture of the situation, she promised.
Gotzel stressed that a key success factor for the project was the involvement of the participants.
Therefore, there will be questionnaires that will be posted to the citizens in the coming weeks and can be completed by the end of the summer holidays.
The yellow questionnaire is the "building and land books", where it is about the construction state and the recovery intentions.
In the grey questionnaire, the "house and apartment books", data can be made of size, distribution and inhabitants of a living room.
The blue "operational bow" is only to be completed when operating in the building business spaces.
However, it should be noted that Gotzel pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding.
In addition, new measures are not conducive.
Schindler also stressed that the distribution of funds works according to the "Windhund principle" - who comes first, paints first.
You can't make any money for "reserving" later.
In conclusion, the photos of the project "Placeskern II" were also shown to make the residents a "tasteful" repair.
British inventor sets himself a microchip to come home and car with a hand movement
A British inventor is the first in the country equipped with a microchip so that he can open his door, enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement.
Steven Northham, 33, had implanted the tiny chip between thumbs and pointing fingers and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through his company BioTeq.
He joined Dr. Geoff Watson, a consulting anaesthesiist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hunts, to ensure that the implant procedure is carried out according to medical standard.
The technology resembles a cat and dog implanted microchip and lasts only 30 seconds.
The company of Mr. Northham also wants to change the locks of houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip, all for a price of £ 300 per lock.
The married father of one has now built up both at home and at his BMW Z4 technology, which starts when his hand is on the tax.
The advertising costs of the White House cost the taxpayer thousands
The decision of the White House to fly a marine helicopter to the South Lawn for an event that highlights the American production in the last month costs taxpayers according to the military's data leaving the TIME magazine up to $24,000.
The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the president is on board, was the heartpiece of the event on 17 July in the White House with American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence and Chief Executive Officers of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 states.
The helicopter manufactured in Connecticut was exhibited in addition to a Maine yacht, a wisconsin fire car and a Mississippi forklift.
The military office of the White House demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or FRAGO, almost 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, following the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter.
"I just wanted you to be aware of it because it is such an unusual event with high visibility," the commander of the HMX-1 wrote on the night before the event to his commanding officer, the deputy commander for aviation.
The message showed that the helicopter arrived at South Lawn on 17 July at 7 a.m. for the event at 3 p.m. until the races between 18:00 and 21:00 were cleared at this evening.
The note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed, due to the limited hours of service, a second crew would be required for the return.
The original flight crew was on the ground during the event at the helicopter, while the unit's safety staff remained on the ground during the flight.
The time records provided by the TIME did not indicate whether a second flight crew was necessary.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using public property for political purposes.
Data sets show that HMX-1 has asked whether the event could affect the destination.
"One question we asked was whether it was an infringement of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case," the commander wrote.
"Sounds like you're locked," replied the Deputy Commander.
The event "Made in America" was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.
But official events also have political responsibilities.
At the event, the President made an appeal to the reform of the health reform that was in progress in the Senate, and he promulgated efforts to enforce government regulations.
The use of the aircraft known as the Marine One or Air Force One for politically beneficial purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are obliged to use them for travel.
But their use is unusual only for a photo-OP.
Trump conducted a survey in February when the President's aircraft was operating in Melbourne, Florida, taxi services in the background of its first campaign, and his Twitter account is full of reports that complain about the use of the President's aircraft by its predecessors.
"The White House is thrilled by the "Made in America" show - the products from all 50 states that are produced by American workers with American materials," said the Deputy Press Secretary of the White House, Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 crews often conduct training flights in the area around Washington and South Lawn to replace the US presidents in the White House with precise centimeters.
When Trump was on the G20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July, HMX-1 conducted 58 exercises in the White House.
The flight for the "Made in America" event included the flight crew training requirement for the month," said an official.
Helicopter units also flew 11 hours this day for "non-presidential support missions".
The White House said that the taxpayers took the burden on none of the other requirements presented at the event.
A speaker from Sikorsky said that the company was not involved in exposing the helicopter on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not hold budget records for the President's flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.
According to hourly rates of the US Ministry of Defence for the financial year 2017, however, the DoD compensation rate for the VH-3D is 24,380 USD per hour per flight.
Unit records record the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia.
The White House argues that the actual costs for the operation of the helicopter are far below this rate.
"To determine the costs for taxpayers on the basis of the estimates for the refund rates is highly misleading," Walters said.
"These estimates include personnel, maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual resources."
According to a 2015 RAND study, the refund rates for DoD do not include staff costs, but take into account the costs of fuel, maintenance and contract termination.
At that time, the former press speaker of the White House, Sean Spicer, defended the use of the helicopter for the event.
"The idea is to present this week things that are produced in America," Spicer said.
"And I know that Sikorsky and the Federal State Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security, and I assume that hundreds, even if not thousands of people depend on it.
And I think, like most Americans, we are all proud of the helicopters and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly.
It is of course appropriate to highlight this."
It was not clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter when he walked across the South Lawn for the event, but he sat in the seat of a firearm.
In the White House Trump spoke to representatives of Sikorsky and joked with the media about his own fleet of company products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the president, "I have three of them."
TC BW News before Knife Task
The top rider of the second tennis league will take place at the third table of SV Searchdorfer.
The TC Blue-Weiss Neuss will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m. in Kiel in search of SV.
Despite the fact that five parties still have a smooth balance sheet, the top rider of the Second Tennis-Bundesliga has been given the sense of reality.
Team chief Marius Zay has respect for the opponent.
"This is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation.
Especially on the rear positions I find the team very good."
For the class and stability of the SV search village, the imports from the high north are especially important.
"These Danes and Finns can even refer to insertions in the Davis Cup.
And they are also strong in double," says Zay with a view to Harri Heliovaara (Finland), Andre Göransson (Sweden), Sören and Esben Olesen, Martin Pedersen and Andreas Bjerrehus (all of Denmark).
"It's always going to be hard for us.
There you also need a good lot of luck."
The Newer team for the trip in the high north is practical.
His debut for blue-white could give Maxime Janvier.
If, at the moment, there is no active French at the Challenger tournament in the Italian Biella, the Zdenek Kolar (Czech Republic) who plays at the tournament in the Czech Liberec comes to its first use in this season.
So far, Chilean Hans Podlipnik-Castillo was yesterday with the white Russian Andrei Vasilevski at the ATP tournament in Kitzbühel am Ball.
He should be in Kiel as well as Botic Van de Zandschulp, Niels Lootsma (both the Netherlands) and the Belgian Julien Cagnina.
After his two victories last Sunday against the club at the Alster, Máté Valkusz could also return to the team.
If it is not enough for 18-year-old Hungary, who was still the number one of the junior world rankings in January 2016, someone from the training staff fills the box for Marius Zay.
How America can harm the OMV
Indeed, Donald Trump was not happy when he placed his signature in the law on strengthening sanctions against Russia in the middle of the night.
"In his haste to adopt the law," the Congress packed a few "constitutional rules", he said.
The reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected, and Brussels even boasted against the US defeat.
However, the draft proposes to punish European companies that help the Russians to build gas pipelines in the EU.
Since then, investors of the domestic OMV have been concerned, who, together with other European companies, have co-financed the construction of the Russian Baltic-led Nord Stream 2.
The drugs are violent.
However, it was too early for an assessment of the consequences, so the official status of the oil group.
In fact, Donald Trump himself had to raise the sanctions even by execution order to life.
Twelve weapons are at his disposal.
"The press" looked at who the group could reject and who could really hurt him.
Narcos Staff 3 Trailers: Without Pablo Escobar, the Cali cartel is headed in the speed of Netflix in the center.
Despite the second staff of Narcos, which Pablo Escobar's killer reveals, the series of Netflix is not yet over.
The staffs were already confirmed by the streaming service, the first to receive their first trailer and show the latest evil weights of the show.
With the third staff, the DEA has focused its attention on the world's richest organization of drug trafficking: the Cali cartel.
Guided by four powerful patents, they operate "like a Fortune-500 company" only with more state arrests and violent actions.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is her head, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) is a Mexican member, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) is located in New York.
In the newly published trailer Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña, the type that invites American and Colombian law enforcement authorities to support the war on drugs.
Other new actors are Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third staff of Narcos will begin on 1 September.
Roll back: The city sets up 46 kitchen aids
The city reorganises the Kita lunch table itself.
With strong contact for the children and an assignment to the team.
The watch is returned to the city’s children’s living quarters.
On 1 September, the city of Krefeld will take over the food supply in the city's children's day-care facilities (Kitas) in its own right.
For Sonja Pomeranz, Deputy Head of Youth Assistance, this is a good message: "We are all very pleased".
Cooking is still outside the house: a Catererer takes over this task and supplies freshly cooked cooking.
The city operates 46 children's places in the Krefeld area, in 44 children get a warm meal for lunch.
In the past year, 2,800 children were sitting at the tables, and the need is growing.
"In the meantime, not only eat children who are being treated for 45 weeks, in the Kita to lunch," Pommeranz explains.
"The offer also applies in the 35-hour service if children stay up to 14 hours."
46 part-time workers have a kitchen service from September 1st: they heat the served meals, add them to salad, raw food and fruit, share the meal individually, give out the food, clean, wash and clean the kitchen.
"The employees are firmly assigned to a kite," says Pomeranz.
The size - there are two groups as well as seven groups of institutions - decides over the amount of hours.
"The kitchen assistants are now firmly part of the Kita team," says Pomeranz satisfied.
"So they are much more involved and it is easier to implement teaching concepts for the sewerage."
For this is also the case: healthy nutrition and cooking.
"The children are supposed to help prepare the food."
The direct connection of the kitchen power to the team is meaningful.
For the kids, too.
"They have a known power in the Kita, a person who trusts them, and not constantly changing people."
This continuity is important for the children.
The cleansing of the Kita rooms - up to now also the task of the kitchen staff - will be carried out in the future by special cleaning staff.
This variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has, in addition to the improvement of the quality of the kitchen service, also the charm that she has exposed to in comparison with the cost of self-registration and extra charge for the city as the most economical one, is from the press office.
And that, although 46 partial-time forces will be reset.
"But these hours don't even fall to the weight of about 750 people in the education area," says Sonja Pomeranz.
Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women, says the UN
Elections can only be representative if all members of the society, including women, play a role, said the Head of the UN Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, the official leader of the United Nations mission, said that hundreds of women will be candidates for the Council elections in the provinces. Three women are candidates for the role of Vice-President and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overestimated," he said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women participate unrestrictedly and are included in all parts of the electoral process.
Afghan elections for the Provincial Council and presidential elections will take place on 5 April.
The Taliban has published threats to an election process that coincides with the transition from international fighting to a consultative role.
This year, elections will be handed over for the first time to power peacefully by a democratically elected government.
Haysom said a strong role for women will still strengthen Afghanistan's democratic success.
The Afghan Independent Election Commission reports that 1.2 million women from all registered 3.6 million voters are registered.

Men try 13-year-old girl out
Two young men aged 19 and 23 were supposed to have tried on Thursday to hire a 13-year-old girl.
According to information from the police, the men spoke to the 13-year-old who had stayed with friends on the Kolpingstraße at 2.55 p.m. because they wanted to call the girl's phone.
The 13-year-old refused, however, and went on with her friends.
Then one of the killers tried to grab the girl's phone and necklace, but it didn't work.
Without bets, the duo flew.
The two young men were later arrested by the police.
The investigations are under way.
GMB interest on investments in the McVitie factory in Glasgow
A trade union would like to point out to the managers of the Bishop-Manufacturer McVitie the long-term obligation to produce in its work in Glasgow.
GMB Scotland said the company had sworn about the future of investments at the Tollcross Standard.
More than 500 employees work in the work, which produces in addition to other products Hobnobs and Rich Tea Kekse.
McVities Owner Pladis said he invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years.
He added that employees and trade union representatives would "first experience" if their activities changed.
In a letter to the head of the company, GMB Scotland McVitie called on "to take care that funding for the modernisation of production lines will not be pre-empted".
GMB Senior Organiser Drew Duffy said: "The fact that we cannot gain clarity from the General Site Manager about business needs and investment plans for the future of the Tollcross is deeply concerned by our members.
Generations of families have worked here, and the workforce is very focused on the local community and the large area of Glasgow, an important pillar for decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social disadvantage.
Therefore, from the perspective of jobs, wages and well-being, and from the background of Brexit, the rising cost of living and the chronic decline of production, the eastern end of Glasgow urgently needs a flourishing production presence at McVitie."
A speaker from Pladis said: "The head of the office at Tollcross received a letter from GMB Scotland only yesterday, and the company will respond directly as we value the continued commitment of employees and trade union representatives.
Two months ago we had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross, where some questions were discussed openly.
We discussed with the employees that we, like all companies operating in a highly competitive and uncertain economic climate, constantly check our business - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - in order to remain competitive.
She added: "In recent years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our Tollcross stand, especially in production lines and operational improvements.
We recognize the heritage of Tollcross as a full production site. If we change our operations at the site, the employees and their trade representatives will be the first to experience this."
Did the PSG Barcelona warn Neymar three years ago?
The page of La Liga may restore her interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not be left behind in his persecution of Neymar after giving a bid of £ 189 million to trigger his release clause, but have they warned Barcelona three years ago before the World Record Overrun?
The sensational approach has heated the transfer window in summer, because the League 1 club is ready to break the world record more than twice the previous brand, with Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United for 89 million pounds last season.
After the end, Neymar will be the most expensive player in the world and the world's top-paid professional athlete. PSG offers wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week.
Barcelona is furious about the way Neymar forced his way out, although a source close to the Catalan subject is that the club has always given its best to take care of him since his arrival in Santos in 2013.
But was the football world warned three years ago by the PSG president before this view?
As Manchester City 2014 interested in the signing of Blaise Matuidi, Nasser Al-Khelafi had a strict warning for every association that wanted to sign one of the best players in PSG.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we'll stand up to them, we'll contact their players," Al-Khelaifi said.
"We respect all the clubs.
But if they try to let one of our players sign with them, this will have consequences."
Barcelona seems to have exceeded this line, with the Spanish association expressing interest this summer at the PSG midfield player Marco Verratti.
The PSG made it clear that they would not allow the international from Italy to leave under any circumstances, and Barcelona could sense the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price offers for Neymar.
Rolls placed and damaged
In the night of Friday on Saturday, an unknown actor deliberately turned a roll set aside in the King's Field Street before the number 30 in question and thus set aside more than 200 euros in the clothing of the vehicle.
The Schramberg Police, Phone 07422/27 01-0, asks for information.
In an accident at B 215 between Stolzenau and Leese, the police are looking for witnesses.
Because a car hit him on his tracks, the driver of a VW Touran had to leave and touch the guideboard.
On Thursday evening, the 34-year-old from Rehburg-Loccum with his VW at 19.55 p.m. on the B 215 from Stolzenau was heading towards Leese.
In the area of the town of Stolzenau he had a pkw on his trail, so he had to leave to the right.
The Touran-Fahrer touched the lead board.
The Pkw was born in Sachsbaden.
The driver of the opposite Pkw, a Mercedes Benz, had taken over a truck and continued his journey without worrying about the traffic accident.
According to the accident injury, it may be good that the Mercedes driver did not even notice the accident.
The police are now asking witnesses of the incident and the driver of the consumer's vehicle to contact the police station in Stolzenau.
Interview: "Domspatzen report released by Pope-Brüder Georg Ratzinger"
The Regensburg Domspatzen report on the abuses released by Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger.
This means author and historian Michael Hesemann.
The final report on the abuse scandal in the Regensburg Domspatzen continues to provide discussion.
Christian Wesnder, speaker of the "We Are a Church" reform movement, explained after publication against the German Press Agency, he expects an apology from the former Regensburg Bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller, as well as from the Domcapell Master Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of Pope Benedict XVI.
It would be very useful for the view of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger expressed their deep regret over their own omissions or their false assessment of the proceedings at that time.
On the other hand, the Vatican newspaper "Osservatore Romano" criticised that the report on violence in the domestic courts will be measured with "secondary dimension".
With regard to the overcrowding in Regensburg, no one doubt that it is "degradable and shameful" that should be punished and prevented in the future; however, it is obvious that it is the "grade of media manipulation", said author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the National Committee of Bioethics.
"The habit of calling the Catholic Church a source of all evil is already part of daily experience and prepares the public opinion to keep it for normal," Scaraffia writes.
Prince Gloria of Thurn and Taxi also said in the interview with the Bavarian Rundfunk: "You like to go to church and that's a french found."
In addition, she pointed out that in her youth, "fighting was a very normal teaching medium" was to be "to be done with fearless children like I was."
She found it unfair to apply today's standards to decades ago, because the world has changed.
In the context of the reports on abuses, Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared.
Totally unjust, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote with Ratzinger the memory band "My Brother of the Pope" (translated in 12 languages).
"I have to take Georg Ratzinger for protection," says Hesemann, "because all this had nothing to do with him," he evaluates the results of the final report.
What exactly is stated in the 440th report submitted by Lawyer Ulrich Weber, commissioned by Bistum Regensburg with the explanation?
A total of 547 Regensburg Domspatzens were sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s "with high plausibility" victims of abuse, 67 domspatzens.
In the final report, Georg Ratzinger, who worked from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg, said: "In summary, therefore, it can be observed that in many cases forms of physical and mental violence have been applied by Domkapelmänder R..
Especially with high emotionality, the punishment for the students was also more severe.
However, unlike many other blamers, many victims value the general humanity of R. and therefore in many cases even connect positive memories with him despite violence."
In the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburg Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger explains his opinion.
Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "Events of Violence against Protective Persons at the Regensburg Domspatzen" gives a dissuasive picture by Domcapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.
For one, many students raise their "humanity".
On the other hand, he also appears as a choler and perfectionist, who of the latter became handy when a Domspatz gave no musical top performance.
How do you rate this final report as his biograph?
Michael Hesemann: If you are making the effort and reading the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you need to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger is at all.
He has just been dedicated to him eight pages, and he will clearly be freed from any suspicion of coercion or coercion in the horrific cases of sexual abuse.
The violence in the preschool also occurred outside its scope.
In any case, it may be suggested that he learn from it too late or that he should not have taken the first statements seriously enough.
The domspatzengymnasium, on which he worked, was felt by practically all the respondents as - so literally - "resolve", "heaven" and "better world".
Likewise, the vast majority of his students, Georg Ratzinger, describes him as "hothearted", "believed", "right", "competent" and "understanding", as extremely kind teachers who regularly provided the boys with cakes, biscuits and bonbons and were "always surrounded by grapes from children".
Only a minority complains about its perfectionism and its high emotionality, which has already led to riots.
That he not only slammed with chairs and threw the key on the floor, but also spread earpieces and pulled too many boys into the hair or ears, he himself admitted years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for it.
However, it has to be said that such methods of education were widely distributed in the 1960s and 1970s, at parents as well as in teachers.
Do you also know such cultivation methods?
Of course, I think every one of us who was born before 1968.
I have also experienced this in a world school, a state gymnasium.
Compared with what is actually in this report, namely sexual abuse and violence in preschool, they are free of charge.
The question is, does it not have to do with his reputation and role as a brother of Benedict XVI, that many of the media had just stumbled on him?
In the Bavarian Pope, many who have never understood him are still working hard.
But the truth is: the report releases Georg Ratzinger in every way!
In the media, much has been reported in connection with the report on abuse in the Regensburg Domspatzen.
Will Georg Ratzinger also put any development or awareness into the final report with regard to sexual abuse?
Michael Hesemann: Not at all.
None of the 67 victims of sexual abuse claim to have trusted the master of the dome.
Not even the parents were poisoned.
"I never believed to talk to my father or my mother about it," said one concerned representative to the others, "It was very painful for me."
The real problem with the disclosure of sexual abuse was and is that most of the victims are in shame.
If they did not even trust their parents and siblings, they would certainly not be a choir leader who would, in fact, have been a colleague of the workers.
How do the Domspatzen-Stuler Ratzinger's role in the case of abuse?
Michael Hesemann: An interrogator put it this way: "Expertly sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) had timely knowledge and could have stopped the individual offender.
I hold it ... even for really absurd to assume that it is calculated to him ... Bubes have opened up more impermeable or clearer or even more than their parents, interns, trust teachers, etc.
That you're talking to him about sex... inevitable."
The report thus concludes with the very clear conclusion: "The fact that students and/or their environment were entrusted to him in the past could not be confirmed in the course of the investigation".
So, as far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is free from any conscience.
Thus he cannot be denied, prevented, or brought to his notice.
Therefore, there is also no reason to link his good name with these opposite crimes, as it has happened in some cases.
In the media there was a lot of "gewaltexs" to read at the Regensburg Domspatzen.
The former Mayor Georg Ratzinger is proposed in the report "Too View".
Does he have to live with this proposal?
Michael Hesemann: That is the big problem that in the report, everything was mixed up and mixed into a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere, in the middle, Georg Ratzinger.
But that's exactly what's wrong with the report.
There is a clear separation between the preschool and the gymnasium of the domspatz, between sexual abuse and violence and, once again, other suggestions.
In addition, the report has dealt with events since 1945, including four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not the head of the Domspatzen.
The whole horrific prégel pedagogy, the cases in which the children of sadist teachers were regularly harassed and tortured and left behind were all at the preschool in Etterhausen and Pillenhofen, where truly scandalous conditions must have prevailed.
But with them, Domcapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do with, because he only got the boys face-to-face when they were already on the Domspatzengymnasium.
On it was how most of the witnesses stressed the topic "Preschool" tabu.
You were just happy to be away and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paradise" states.
What else was on the domspatzengymnasium?
Michael Hesemann: There was already discipline, but there was no sadistic force.
And this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that "many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore in many cases even connect positive memories with him in spite of violence".
That's the way it's going to be, at the very least, to have been shot off.
In spite of all the efforts, however, the report was able to define only two periods in which it was reported by the state at the pre-school.
The first time in 1970/71, when he began to establish himself and from the proceedings at a school where he was not as active and responsible as he was, he did not want to hear anything (so the Witnesses) and then again in 1993.
Does Georg Ratzinger lock the ears in front of the conditions?
Michael Hesemann: No, since 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium, who even reproduces the report.
He pointed out that "in the pre-school the punishment will continue to be practised".
In view of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended an urgent step forward.
This was, of course, at a time when there was legal clarity, when trials were also prohibited in Bavaria for the longest time.
Before, they arrived in a legal grey zone, as each of us might know.
It was also difficult for him to estimate where the affected might be exaggerated or dramatized and where the permissible limit was really exceeded.
But you can't say he'd always looked away.
That's just not true.
It was only in 1980 that the criminal punishment of schools was officially abolished in Bavaria.
Prince Gloria of Thurn and Taxi claimed yes, it was unfair to apply the current pedagogical standards at that time.
How do you see that?
Michael Hesemann: We historians are talking about the "Falstrick des Anachronism", that is, the danger of evaluating past moral standards today.
That's where the princess is right.
But of course this does not apply to sexual abuse, which has been apparent at all times, nor to what was interrupted in the preschool by vices and violence on innocent children's souls, which goes far beyond the usual ones at the time.
That's all very scary and I'm glad it's finally done.
But at the same time, I have to take Georg Ratzinger for protection because all of this had nothing to do with him.
His means of discipline and punishment, so to draw ears and ears to the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.
When physical punishment was prohibited, he also strictly refrained from it.
What picture of his Regensburg time did Georg Ratzinger present in the talks with you for the book "My Brother of the Pope"?
Did the subject of prügelfence also come to the language?
Michael Hesemann: Now, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI, tells from his perspective, since the dominoes played only one side role.
However, I do not hesitate to say that he had a strict regiment there.
But this also has to be said once: Without this perfectionism, without requiring unrestricted discipline, it would probably have been impossible for him to form an institution of world rank from the previously known Regensburg Domspatzens, a true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition, who went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).
With Keksen and Bonbons alone, you make no great singer and you are now faced with every success, just in what area, but always discipline, passion and overcoming self.
So, what kind of a person did you experience Georg Ratzinger when talking to her book?
Michael Hesemann: Through the work on the book and more than that, I have really known Georg Ratzinger very well and always have experienced as a wonderful, humorous, fundamental, deep faith and good heart, from which one cannot imagine that he could even do something about a fly.
I get regularly with how many former domestic rats still today, 23 years after his emigration, keep in touch with him, visit him, read him - he's almost blind - and treat him like a member of his family.
Those who do not forgive him to this day that he once was hard on them are thus clearly in the minority.
Most dominoes are grateful to him today for enriching their lives and bringing them closer to the world of music.
And that he was always a good, father-teacher - a strict father, of course, that may be - but he was also a loving respectable person, to whom they still look today and who they really deserve.
And, once again, make it quite clear that all that is meant to him is the teaching methods that were in the order of the day.
We can be happy that we have overcome this time for the longest time.
But it is most unfair to make a man, only because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother, to make a medium-sized sinner.
There is the evil intent behind it all too obvious.
For the report which has just been published will release it.
Now the stand would be offered to a 93-year-old man who has earned great merit and without the outside Bayerns and perhaps even Germany would not know the Regensburg Domspatzen, at all in peace.
