The members of the Wells Assembly worried that "they look like fools"
Among some members of the Assembly there has been a concern about the proposal to change their title to MWP (Members of the Wells Parliament).
This has come as a result of plans to change the name of the assembly in the Wells Parliament.
The members of the Assembly from all political groups are concerned that this could lead to ridicule.
An assembly member of the Labour Party said his group was concerned "that this reunites with Twp and Pwp."
For readers out of Wells: In Welsh, twp means "asshole" and pwp means "cake".
A member of the Wells Party said the whole group was "satisfied" and proposed alternatives.
A Wellsian conservative said his group was "managed" about the name change, but it was said that there was little difference between the words "MWP" and "Budilla".
In this context, the alignment of the "w" flower in Welsh is similar to that of the "u" flower in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly's commission that is currently drafting legislation to declare the name change was said: "Of course, the final decision on the appointment of Assembly members will depend on the members themselves."
Wells government law 2017 gave the Wellsian Assembly the duty to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a consultation with the public, and the last proposal for the appointment of the assembly as "the Wells Parliament" found broad support.
With regard to the issue of the title of the Members of the Assembly, the Commission promoted the designation "Members of the Wells Parliament" or "WMP", but the "MWP" option found more support in a consultation with the public.
The members of the Assembly seem to be suggesting alternative elections, but the war on consensus can be turned into a coup for Prime Minister Elin Jones, from which the presentation of legislation on changes is expected within a few weeks.
The legislation on reforms will include other changes in the way the assembly is functioning, including rules on the exclusion of Assembly members and the structure of the committee system.
During the legislative discussion, the final vote on their appointment will remain with the Assembly members.
Macedonians vote in the referendum on the country's name change.
On Sunday, voters will vote for the change of their country's name in "North Macedonia Republic".
The people's vote was put in an effort to resolve a multi-year dispute with neighboring Greece, which also has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that its northern neighbour's name constitutes a claim on its territory and has consistently opposed its requirements for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the referendum on the change of name, has expressed that he will not recognise the votes.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change in name is just the price to be paid for EU and NATO membership.
St. Martin's bells fall silent, while churches in Harlem face difficulties
"Historyfully, the elderly people I've talked to say that there was a bar and a church in every corner," Mr. Adams said.
"Today both are missing."
He said the removal of bars is understandable.
"Today, people are socializing in other ways," he says.
"The bars are no longer the point of meeting the village, where people go regularly."
As for the churches, he expresses concern that the money from the sale of property will not last as long as leaders claim "and sooner or later they will return to the initial point."
He added that the churches could be replaced by palaces full of people who would not support the holy places that remained in the countryside.
"The overwhelming majority of people who buy living environments in these palaces are white," he said, "so very soon the day will come when these churches will be closed once well, since it is unlikely that most people who settle in these dwellings will become members of these churches."
Both churches have been built by white congregations before Harlem turned into a metropolis of colored people - the Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation was transferred in the 1930 ’ s.
The building was owned by a colorful people’s congregation that had their place of worship nearby.
Saint Martin passed through a people-colored congregation under the direction of Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of minority merchants on the "125th" road, a major shopping street in Harlem, who refused to work or promote people with color.
In 1939, the building was badly damaged by a fire, but since Father Johnson's family members planned for reconstruction, they ordered the cariion.
Rev. David Johnson, father Johnson's son and heir to St. Martin's, called the chario with pride "the sword of the poor."
The expert who played the career in July called it something else: "A cultural treasure" and a "historical instrument irreplaceable."
Expert Tiffany Ng from Michigan University also stated that this was the first career in the world played by a colourful musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who was transferred to a larger career in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin didn't replace him.
The events of the last months in St. Martin have been a complicated confession by architects and contractors, some of the church’s contemporary leaders and others of the bishop diocese.
The Council -- a leading organ of fame, made up of contemporary leaders -- has written to the diocese in July, concerned that it "will attempt to transfer costs" to the council of fame, despite the fact that this latter was not involved in the employment of architects and contractors sent by dioceses.
Some family members complained of a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Fishing wounded 13-year-old during a dive to catch gafors in California
A fisherman has attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while he's infiltrating to catch traps in California on the day of the opening of the traps season, officials say.
The attack happened just before 7 a.m., near the Beacon's beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel has voiced for the KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been in contact with some friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning, when he had heard the boy screaming for help, and then had driven towards him with a group to get him out of the water.
Hammel said he had initially thought that the boy was just exhilarated by the arrest of a robbery, but then "I understood that he was screaming "He killed me!
He bit me!"
Hammel says that when he got to the boy, he did not see the whole of his keyboard being torn apart.
I said to them all, "There is a fish in the water." Hammel added.
The boy was transported by helicopter to the children's "Rady's" hospital in San Diego, where he was declared critical.
The species of fish responsible for the attack was unknown.
Coast Guard Captain Larry Giles said at a media conference that a fishing was seen in the area a few weeks ago, but was defined as a harmless species of fishing.
Giles added that the victim had suffered traumatic injuries in the upper part of the body.
Officials stopped access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours, for investigation and security purposes.
Giles was said to have over 135 species of fish in the area, but most are considered harmless.
Sainsbury's plans to enter MB's cosmetic market
Sainsbury's is competing Boots, SuperDrug and Debenhams with big store-style cosmetics, with a specialized sales staff.
In the framework of a considerable effort to enter the US cosmetic market of 2.8 billion pounds, which is continuing to grow as the sales of fashion clothes and household ornaments are falling, the biggest cosmetics will be tested at 11 stores around the country and spread to more shops next year if they are successful.
Cosmetic investment comes at a time when supermarkets are looking for ways to fill the space of rifles used for televisions, microwaves, and household appliances.
Sainsbury's said it would double his offer of cosmetic products up to 3,000 products, including for the first time such brands as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Even existing lines from L'Oreal, Maybellline and Burt's Bees will be given more space, with dedicated areas for related markets, similar to those in shops like Boots.
Also, the supermarket will re-market its Botique cosmetic line, so that most of the products are made up of vegan products - something that is increasingly required by younger buyers.
In this regard, the retailer of Fragrance Shop perfumes will test concessions in two Sansbury shops, the first of which was opened last week in Croydon, south of London, while a second is expected to open later this year in Sally Oak, Birmingham.
Online auctions and a trend towards daily food purchases in small quantities in rural shops mean that now supermarkets need to do more to attract people.
Mike Coupe, the executive director of Sainsbury's, has said that the outlets will start to look more and more like big shops, while the supermarket network is trying to fight down Aldi and Lidl's prices with more services and dairy products.
Sainsbury's has set up "Argos" outlets in hundreds of shops and has presented a series of "Habitats" that after the purchase of the two networks two years ago, which according to him has encouraged food sales and made them more profitable purchases.
The previous effort of the supermarket to restructure its cosmetic and pharmaceutical departments resulted in failure.
Sainsbury's tested a partnership with Boots in the early 2000s, but the union was split after a debate on how to divide the revenues from pharmaceuticals into its supermarkets.
The new strategy comes three years after Sainsbury's sold his pharmaceutical business of 281 Celesio stores, the owners of the "Lloyds" pharmaceutical network, for 125 million pounds.
He said "Lloyds" would play a role in the plan, adding an expanded range of luxury skin care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, the commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: "We have transformed the view of our cosmetic concerns to improve the environment in favor of our customers.
We have also invested in a specialized training staff, which will be ready to give advice.
The range of our brands has been designed in such a way as to suit any need, and the attractive environment and voluminous locations show that we are now a cosmetic destination, which makes a difference to the old way of making purchases."
Peter Jones "whispered" after Holly Willoughby withdrew from the 11 million-pound deal
The star of Dragons Den, Peter Jones, has gone "shinded" since the television speaker Holly Willoughby has been drawn from an 11m-pound deal with his dedicated business a certain lifestyle, to focus on her new contracts with "Marks and Spencer" and "ITV"
Willoughby doesn't have time for their home ordnance brand and Truly accessories.
The business of these two was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's "Goop" brand.
The 37-year-old representative of "This Morning" directed Instagram to declare its departure.
Holly Willoughby has upset the star of "Dragons Den", Peter Jones, after the recent attraction from their lucrative business dedicated a certain lifestyle - to focus on its new promising contracts with "Marks & Spencer" and "ITV".
Sources say Jones was "quicked" when the golden girl of television agreed during a tense meeting Tuesday at his business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new agreements -- worth up to 1.5 million pounds -- meant that she had no longer had enough time to dedicate to their home ornaments brand and the accessories "Truly".
The business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's "Goop" brand and was predicted to double its estimated worth of 11 million pounds.
While Willoughby, 37 years old, was directed to Instagram to declare her departure from "Truly", Jones has flew out of Britain towards one of his holiday homes.
A source says: "Truly was undoubtedly at the top of Holly's priorities.
It would be her long future to accompany her in the coming decades.
Its decision to withdraw left all the persons involved absolutely bent.
No one could believe what was happening on Thursday, it was so near the opening.
In Marlow's offices there's a warehouse full of goods ready to be sold."
Experts believe that the removal of the representative "This Morning", which is among the most successful British stars, can cost millions to the firm, due to considerable investment in products starting from yachts and Chinese to domestic clothing and ornaments, and cause further delays in its opening.
And this could be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, the mother of three children, and her husband Dan Baldwin, have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined her as director in March.
Couples spend their holidays together, and Jones has 40 per cent of the shares in Baldwin's television production firm.
Willoughby is expected to become an M&S brand ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as a representative of "I'm A Celebrate" and ITV.
Last winter, a source near Jones has said, "We don't want to comment on his business issues."
Hard conversation "and then a ram in love"
He made a joke about the criticisms he would get from the news media because of his comment, which some would call him "undeserved for a president", and because of the positiveness of North Korea's leader.
Why has President Trump surrendered so much?
He said Trump was jokingly imitating the voice of news reporters.
"I didn't give up at all."
He said Kim is interested in a second meeting, after their first meeting in Singapore in June was greeted by Trump as a major step towards the nuclearisation of North Korea.
But the negotiations for nuclear disarmament have been interrupted.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's main diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, was addressed to world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday, saying that Veriu doesn't see any "corresponding response" by the US towards the first steps taken by North Korea for nuclearisation.
On the contrary, he says, the US is continuing sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump kept a much more optimistic view of his meeting.
"The things are going our best with North Korea," he said.
"We were going into war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have a great relationship."
He said his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim have led to positive results - stopping missile testing, helping to free hostages and returning to the home of the rest of American soldiers.
In his talk about Kim’s relationship, he protected his unusual situation.
"It's very simple to act as President, but instead of having 10,000 people out trying to enter this neighbouring area, we would have about 200 people standing there," Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
Cunami and earthquakes in Indonesia destroy an island, killing hundreds
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, nonprofit foreign organizations were told that their presence was not necessary.
Despite the displacement of more than 10 per cent of the Lombok population, no national disaster was announced, which is a prerequisite for the catalyzing of international aid.
"In fact, they have made it very clear in many cases that they do not seek international support, it is a little challenging to do," said Mrs. Sumbüg.
While "Save the Children" is setting up a team to travel to Palu, it is still uncertain whether foreign staff can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman of the national disaster agency, said that Indonesian officials were evaluating the situation in Palu to see if international agencies would be allowed to contribute to aid efforts.
In view of the frequent earthquakes in Indonesia, the country remains quite unprepared in the face of natural indignation.
While in Aceh shelters are built against the tsunami, they are hard to reach in other coastal areas.
The apparent lack of a siren for the warning of the tsunami in Palu, despite the fact that a warning had been issued, is likely to have contributed to the loss of life.
Even in the best of conditions, traveling among the many islands of Indonesia is difficult.
Natural disasters make logic even more complicated.
A hospital ship that was stationed in Lombok for treating the victims of the earthquake is traveling to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the area of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo used the improvement of Indonesia's steel infrastructure as the central point of his election campaign, and has invested a lot of generous money for roads and railways.
But the lack of funding has troubled Mr. Joko's administration, while it is facing new elections to be held next year.
Mr. Joko is also facing pressures from continuing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim community have embraced a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people have been killed, and tens of thousands have been displaced from their homes after the collapse of Christian and Muslim groups on the streets, where they have used gangs, arrows, and other cold weapons.
See: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool marks in the last minutes an equalizer goal against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge has saved Liverpool from a loss in Premier League against Chelsea, with a goal at the 89th minute of Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge took a pass from Jerdan Shaqiri at about 30 yards away from Chelsea's gate, while his team was losing the result 1-0.
He pushed the ball gently to his left before he made a strike towards the far gate.
The ball flew over the area until it turned to the right and the top of the network.
The ball saved the dance in the air of Keppa Arriszabalaga and ended up online.
"The symphony was to be placed in the right position to get the ball and players like Shaq always play with the balls ahead, so I tried to create myself as long as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming, I checked the ball with a touch, and I didn't think too long, but I just hit it."
Chelsea was leading with the result 1-0 in the first part, after a goal in the 25th minute of the Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The blue attacker repeated with Mateo Kovacic during that game, before turning to the field and sprinting toward Liverpool’s midwife.
Kovac made a quick mix in the middle.
Then he gave a beautiful vertical pass that led Hazard to the area.
Hazard passed the defense at speed and with a left strike marked on the second pillar, passing the ball behind Liverpool's porter, Alison Becker.
Liverpool will face Naples at the Camp League group stage on Wednesday, 3 a.m., at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton at the UEFA European League on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
The number of dead from the tsunami in Indonesia goes to 832
The number of earthquakes and tsunami deaths in Indonesia has increased in 832, the national disaster agency has voiced in the first hours of Sunday.
According to reports, many people have remained trapped under the ruins of buildings like earthquake 7.5 against which hit Friday and caused waves up to 20 feet high, Sutopo Purwo's spokesman said at a press conference.
The city of Palu, with a population of more than 380,000, is built under the ruins of similar buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man suspected of murder after a woman's death from a knife wound
A murder investigation was announced after the wife's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old was found at 7:55 in the morning with knife wounds at Grayson Mews on John Street, while a 32-year-old man was arrested as suspected of murder.
The police have called on the residents of the area who have seen or heard anything to appear for testimony.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said, "The challenge is early, but I'd like to call any person who's been near John Street in Birkenhead, who may have seen or heard anything suspicious, to contact us.
I also want to call on everyone, especially the taxi drivers, who may have taken pictures, to contact us as they may have important information for our investigation."
A police spokesman has confirmed that the victim is Birkenhead's resident and her body is found inside a dwelling.
This afternoon, friends who thought they knew her came to the scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is continuing, while the police have said it is reporting the victim's family.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mess has tried to enter his apartment, but is informed by the police that no one is allowed to enter or leave the building.
He's left without a word when he discovered the event.
Now, residents are being informed that they will be allowed to enter their homes only after a few hours.
A police officer has been heard telling a man that the whole area is being treated as a crime scene.
A woman has come to the scene of the crime.
She repeats the words "that's terrible."
At 2: 00 a.m., two police vans were inside the perimeter and another van was outside.
A number of officers were located within the perimeter, monitoring the housing block.
Each person with information is asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact "Cremspotpers" anonymously in the number 0800 555 111, choosing code 247 to 30 September.
Cromwell's statue in Parliament, the last monument touched by the debate on "historic writing"
Its removal would be a deserved punishment for the Taliban destruction of many of England's cultural and religious artifacts by its Puritan fanatic followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as "privileged" and "try to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "In the midst of the current debate on the removal of the statues, the marking of Oliver Cromwell's image was inevitable outside the Westminster Palace.
The iconoclassism of English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps this would be a wrong sacrifice of Cromwell for his predecessor Thomas's actions in the past century.
The excellent portrait of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is the testimony of the 19th century's opinion and part of the historiography of a figure that many think is still worthy of praise.
Mr. Goldsmith spoke of "The Sunday Telegraph": "Many people, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, saw Cromwell as a defender of parliament from external pressure, which in his case was, of course, the monarchy.
The fact that this is a completely accurate portrait is the subject of ongoing historical debates.
What is certain is that the 17th-century conflict has shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a known individual figure that represents one side of that medal.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be celebrated and remembered."
Until the killer kills the Chinese farmer for death
A farmer has been attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only with his nickname "Yuan", was found naked with a broken artery and covered in blood near a pile of holes in the Leupanshiu market in Guizhou province, reported "South China Morning Post" on Sunday.
A pig farmer is about to inject the pig vaccine in a stable on May 30th 2005, in Xining of the province of Qinghai, China.
It is said that he had traveled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs in the market.
On the next morning, his cousin found him naked and discovered the door of a wooden stable nearby.
He said there was a large man with blood mouth in the stable.
A medical examination has confirmed that up to 550 pounds has injured the farmer for death, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were bloodthirsty," said his cousin identified with the nickname "Wu," as quoted in the evening news in Guiyang.
In the images filmed by the security camera, Yuan is seen entering the market at 4:40 in the morning of Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager has reported on evening news that the pig was kept in isolation to prevent another attack, while the police collected evidence on the scene.
According to reports, Yuan's family and market authorities are negotiating a compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of people attacked by the trees have been noted earlier.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts, causing severe injuries to their husband.
Ten years ago, a 650 - pound [650 kg] pig caught a Welsh farmer after his tractor, until his wife drove the animal away.
After a farmer from Oregon was bitten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that usually, the pigs are not aggressive, but blood taste can act as "stirring".
"They just want to play.
They're very curious little... their purpose is not to hurt you.
You just have to show them proper respect," he said.
The consequences of Hurricane Rosa are expected to bring great reliefs with wide spreads in the US Southwest
As foretold, the power of Hurricane Rosa is waning as she moves toward the coolest waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, during the next days, Rosa will cause floods in northern Mexico and in the south-west US.
On Sunday, 5 a.m., Rosa accompanied the wind at 85 miles an hour, classified as Category 1 hurricane, and was 385 miles southwestern Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, on the Pacific Ocean, a low atmospheric pressure zone, moving toward the East, towards the US West Coast, is beginning to be formed. While Rosa is expected to approach the Bay California Peninsula on Monday in the direction of a tropical storm, she will continue to push a great tropical rainfall towards her north, towards the South-West US.
On Monday, Rosa will cause up to 10 inches [10 inches] in some parts of Mexico.
Then, the interaction of tropical humidity with the low atmospheric pressure zone will result in the coming days of strong rainy rains in the southwest.
At local level, rain showers up to 1 to 4 inches will cause immediate floods, waste streams, and possible flooding of the land in the desert.
The high tropical rainfall will result in the rate of snowfall in designated areas reaching approximately 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in some parts of Nevada and southern Arizona.
2 to 4 inc are predicted in some parts of the southwest, mainly over a large part of Arizona.
There is also the possibility of immediate floods with rapid deterioration of conditions due to the natural distribution of tropical rains.
Because of the threat of tropical rains, it is not recommended to walk through the desert.
Large rivers can turn cannons into powerful rivers, and strains will bring strong winds and dust storms to the area.
Approaching the low atmospheric pressure zone will bring great rainfall to parts of the southern coast of California.
The total level of nuts can reach up to half an inch, which can cause small traces of waste and waste.
For the region, these will be the first seasons of the rainy season.
Some tropical rains will begin to reach Arizona on Sunday night and Monday morning, before rainfalls spread further on Monday and Tuesday night.
Strong plans will be distributed on Tuesday and will continue until Wednesday.
October in the United States can be characterized by large temperatures, with temperatures falling in the Arctic, while tropicals remain warm.
Sometimes, this leads to drastic changes in temperatures in short distances.
A good example is the dramatic difference in temperatures across the United States central on Sunday.
Between the city of Kansas in Missouri and Omahas in Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa, the temperature difference is about 20 degrees.
During the coming days, the remaining heat of the summer will try to accumulate and expand again.
A good part of the Central and Eastern US is expected to start October with warm temperatures, with an average of 80, from the South to certain parts of the North.
New York City can reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, a temperature that would be about 10 degrees above the average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows high chances for temperatures above average in the eastern US during the first half of October.
Over 20 million people have attended Brett Kavanaugh's trial session
Over 20 million people have been following through six television networks the interesting testimony of High Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of a sexual assault suspected of having occurred in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
Meanwhile, political blockade continued, and broadcasters interrupted regular programs to broadcast the turn in the last minute of Friday's events: an agreement reached by the Senator of Arizona Jeff Flake to conduct a weekly FBI investigation on charges.
Ford expressed to the Senate's Judicial Committee that it is 100 per cent sure that Kavanaugh had touched it while he was drunk and was trying to switch to a gymnasium party.
Kavanaugh, in a flat testimony, expressed that it was 100 per cent certain that this had not happened.
The number of followers is likely to have been greater than that of 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen on Friday.
The company was measuring average visibility in CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News and MSNBC.
The figures for other transmission networks, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business, were not immediately available.
And Nielsen usually has problems counting viewers from the offices.
To put this figure in perspective, the size of this audience is similar to that of a football elimination or that of the Academy Awards.
The Fox News channel, whose opinionaries have strongly supported the appointment of Kavanaugh, led the other networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the 24-hour session, Nielsen said.
ABC came in second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
The interest continued to remain high even after the end of the trial session.
Flake was the main character in the Friday drama.
After the office of the moderate Republican issued a statement that he would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, he was filmed by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning as he faced protestors' riots while trying to jump into the elevator to go to the judicial session of the Judicial Committee.
In the transmission of CNN, he appeared looking down for a few minutes as he was corrected.
"I'm staying here, I'm facing you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the country the truth?
He said to him, "You have power over women, and they have authority over them."
Flake said his office had issued a statement, and before the elevator door closed, he said there would be more to say during the committee session.
A few hours later, all cable and satellite networks were covering directly the time when the Judicial Committee would vote for the passing of Kavanaugh's candidacy to vote in front of all members of the Senate.
But Flake said he would do this only with the conviction that the FBI would investigate charges against the candidate next week, as a minority of Democrats had requested.
Flake was partly convinced by talks with his friend, Senator Democrat Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several other senators after him, Flake made a decision.
Flake's election was smart, as it was clear that the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without conducting the investigation.
President Trump has requested the opening of an investigation by the FBI into charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "playing political games" with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused critics of her plans to withdraw from the European Union that "they are playing political games" with Britain's future and are compromising national interest, in an interview for Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain, September 29, 2018.
In another interview with her on the main page of the newspaper, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson continued to attack her plan for Brexit, called "Checkers", expressing that the proposal that Britain and the EU pay taxes on each other's accounts is "very absurd."
Wayde Sims gun murder: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson for LSU player's death
Police have arrested a suspect for the murder of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
20-year-old Dyteon Simpson has been arrested and questioned in prison environments under the unimaginable murder charge, the Baton Rouge Police Directorate has said.
Official sources have released the video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and the police say that Sims had lost his eyes during the fight.
The police have found their fingerprints on the site and say they have found Simpson's DNA trails on them, the WAFB branch of the CBS reports.
After receiving Simpson's question, the police said he admitted that he had shot a gun on Wayde by causing death.
The amount for his release is set at $350,000, the lawyer reported.
Baton Rouge's Eastern Medical Office has issued a preliminary report on Friday, expressing that the cause of death has been a head-to- neck-to-back fire-fighting wound.
The Department thanks the task force of fugitives near the Louisiana State Police, the State Police Criminal Laboratory, the Southern University Police and the area's citizens for helping with investigations that led to the author's arrest.
LSU's athletic director Joe Alleva has thanked the law enforcement authorities in the area for "their zeal and for establishing justice in the country."
Sims was 20 years old.
A six - foot - six - inch - long boy grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, had played basketball for LSU.
In the last season, he had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 beats for each game.
On Friday morning, coach of the LSU basketball team, Will Wade, said the team was "pained" and "complicated" by Wayde's death.
"That's why we're worried all the time," Wade said.
The Volcano Takes a Break on Mexico’s City
Hire from Volcano Popcatepetl has reached the southern shores of Mexico's capital.
On Saturday, the National Center for Disease Prevention warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after the crater was reopened and 183 gas emissions were recorded within 24 hours.
The center had monitored a number of earthquakes and earthquakes.
The images in the social media showed little joys that had covered car windows in some parts of Mexico’s city, such as Jochimilco.
Geophysicists have seen an increase in the activity of the volcano, which is 45 miles (72 km) south of the capital city, since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake hit Central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists before the independence polls anniversary
Six persons have been arrested in Barcelona on Saturday following the clash of pro-independence protestors with the peace police forces, while thousands have joined the rival demonstrations to mark the Catalan's first polarizing vote on divorce.
A group of masked pro-separatists, surrounded by peaceful police forces, struck with eggs and powder, creating dark clouds of dust through the streets that are usually swallowed by tourists.
Later during the day, there was also a crackdown, while the police had to use the tires to end the strikes.
For a few hours, repeating the phrase "Don't forget, we don't forgive", pro-independence groups faced Union protestors shouting "Spain Rofts".
Fourteen people were treated for easy injuries received during protests, according to local press reports.
In the region where feelings of independence prevail, tensions continue to remain high one year after the October 1st referendum, which is considered illegal by Madrid, but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The overwhelming majority of voters chose independence, despite the fact that participation was low, as the citizens opposed the break-up boycotted the votes.
According to Catalan authorities, about 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop the polls in the polling centres in the region through violent strikes.
Friday's warming, pro-independence groups set up camps outside to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration continued, but it was forced to take another stream.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who took part in the separatist protest with his wife, said there was no hope that Catalan would gain independence in the future.
"We had one of our best moments last year.
I saw my parents crying out joyfully that they would be able to vote, but now we're stuck," he said.
In spite of the fact that in the December local elections, they achieved a vital victory, although with a close outcome, the Catalan pro-independence parties have found it difficult to keep the honi this year, since many of their most well-known leaders have voluntarily left the country or are in pre-trial detention and are awaiting trial for their role in the organisation of the referendum and declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who was registering the protest on his phone in police assistance, said the conflict was fueled by both sides' politicians.
"The situation is becoming increasingly tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in prison awaiting trial since last year, said he would run in elections for the European Parliament next year.
"The candidacy event for European elections is the best way to oppose the return of democratic values and the pressure that the Spanish government has given us," he said.
Londonderry: Some arrested after the car broke up with the house
Three men 33, 34, and 39 years of age have been arrested since a car was hit several times with a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday, about 7:30 BST.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said damage has been caused to the main gate and to the home itself.
A arrow is thought to have been thrown in the direction of the car at a given time.
Menga's strike gives Livingstone a 1-0 win against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingstone secured the victory
The team came from a category below, Livingstone surprised Rangers by causing Steven Gerrard to lose second in 18 matches as team coach from Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's strike resulted in decisive results while Gary Holt's team matched the second-country Hibernian point.
Gerrard's team has not yet won an outdoor meeting in Premiership, this season and next Sunday, will face Hearts, the difference with which is eight points.
But before that, Rangers will wait at the Rapid Vienna house at the valid European League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingstone has extended the series of matching winners at six meetings and Coach Holt has not yet tested the loss since Kenny Miller replaced last month.
Livingston loses cases in the face of well-defined opponents
Holt's team must've been in the advantage a lot of minutes before they signed it, as their direct attacks caused Rangers a lot of problems.
Scott Robinson managed to pass but hit the weak in the door, and then Alan Lithgow hit the top down after he followed up with Craig Halket's head.
The settlements were willing to leave Rangers to play in front of them, knowing that they could cause problems in standard hits.
And that's how it was empty that set the meeting.
Rangers caused a hit and Livingstone created space. Declan Gallagher and Robinson combined to create the Menga opportunity, which hit and marked the center of the area.
Until then, Rangers had dominated the holding of the ball but the local defense had turned out to be unbearable and porter Liam Kelly had not been tested nearly ever,
This kind of game continued in the second part even though Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to make a wait.
Scott Pittman's strike was stopped by Rangers Allan McGregor's porter while Lithgov hit out of another Livingstone standard strike.
Harkations continued to come to the Livingstone area and were constantly cleared, while two demands for penalties - after Halket's intervention against the incoming player Glenn Middleton, and another for touching hands - were not taken into consideration.
Livingstone's Phenomenal Game - Analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland on Tony Macaroni arena
A performance and excellent result for Livingstone.
For a man, they played excellent games and continued to surpass expectations in this growing trajectory.
The style of their game and their team has not changed much since their return to the top, but a great merit belongs to Holt for the way he has electriced the team since his arrival.
He had a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett was outstanding, leading a perfectly organized defense, while Menga had to endure the difficulties of Connor Goldson and Joe Worall during the entire match.
However, the Rangers lacked inspiration.
Although in some cases they have played very well under Gerard’s leadership, they lack quality.
Mungo's final pass -- only once they got through the opposition defense -- and this is something that should serve as an alarm for Rangers, who find themselves in the middle of the table.
Erdogan is expected with suspected feelings in column
Saturday (September 29th) was characterized by blue sky smiles as Turkey's and Germany's leaders met for the morning in Berlin.
This was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany -- which aimed to regulate relations between NATO allies.
They have fallen into opposition to issues such as human rights, media freedom and Turkey's EU membership.
Afterward, Erdogan headed for Cologne to open a new giant mosque.
The city covers the largest number of Turkish population outside Turkey.
For security reasons, the police stopped the meeting of a crowd of 25,000 in front of the mosque, but many supporters came out on the streets to see their president.
Hundreds of protestors against Erdogan - many of whom were Kurdish - also raised their voice to condemn Erdogan's policies as well as the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
Opposition protests reflect the divisive ability of a visitor worshiped as a hero by some German Turks and despised as an autocrat by others.
Road accident in Deptford: Cyclists die after car crash
A cyclist has found death after being hit by a car in London.
The accident has occurred near the crossroads of Bestword Street with Evelyn Street, a traffic road in Deptford, south of the city, about 10:15 BST.
The car manager stopped, and the help providers arrived immediately, but the victim changed his life to a location.
The strike has occurred several months after another cyclist lost his life in an accident where the author left the scene, which occurred in Children Street, about a mile away from the country of the September accident.
The Metropolitan Police said officers were working to identify the person and to notify his family.
The roads are closed and the buses are announced to use other roads, while car drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long High Prison: Six wounded officers during a rebellion
Six prison officers have remained injured during a riot in a high-security prison for men, the Prison Office has said.
The rebellion exploded at HMP Long Lart in Worcestershire around 09:30 BST Sunday, and still continues.
"Tornado" specialists have been called on to control the harassment, including eight prisoners and who are confined within one prison arm.
Officials have been treated locally for some minor facial injuries.
A spokesperson for the Prison Service said: "The prison staff with specialized training is mobilized to control the incident currently taking place at the HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members have been treated for injury.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we have made it clear that the responsible persons will be referred to the police and may take a lengthening of the prison sentence."
HMP Long Martin covers over 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the director of the prison was subjected to hospital treatment after an attack by one of the prisoners.
And in October last year, officers of the peacekeeping police were called to prison to keep a serious situation under control, where personnel were attacked with billiards.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with immediate floods (which may be an advantage for drought zones)
Although a tropical depression rarely strikes Arizona, this is probably exactly what will happen the first days of the next week, while the remaining power of the Rosa hurricane passes through the southwest desert, spreading the risk of immediate flooding.
The National Meteorological Service has already issued warnings of immediate flooding for Monday and Tuesday from the western Arizona to the south and east Nevada, Southeast California and Utah, including the cities Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take the lead in Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching the late hours of the moon with rain showers.
The National Meteorological Service in Phoenix said on a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones have received the status of storm or tropical depression in a 200-mile line from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of Arizona border."
The latest models of the Uragana National Centre predict 2 to 4 inc of recreation, with isolated amounts up to 6 inc of the Mogollon border of Arizona.
In other desert areas in the south-west, including central Rockies and the Great Basin, settlements are expected to be at level 1 to 2 inches, while their total isolated areas can reach 4 inches in total.
For areas beyond the risk of immediate flooding, Rosa's devices may be a blessing, after the region has been hit by the drought.
Although floods are a serious concern, some of these droughts may be helpful, since the southwest is currently facing drought conditions.
According to the U.S. Center for the Monitoring of the Tatar, a little more than 40 per cent of Arizona is facing extreme second category droughts," weather.com reported.
At first, Hurricane Rosa will hit the California Bay of Mexico.
Rosa, still with an emergency power Sunday morning, with wind speeds of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and is moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm is struggling with cold waters over the Pacific, and power is being lost.
As a result, the hurricane is expected to strike Mexico with tropical storms in the afternoon or the evening of the month.
Rain regimes over some areas of Mexico may be strong, presenting considerable flood risks.
"Average of rain at an average level of 3 to 6 inches is expected from Baja California to the northwest Sonora, and can reach up to 10 inches," weather.com reported.
Then Rosa will move north through Mexico, in the direction of a tropical storm, before reaching the border with Arizona in the early hours of Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, which will then move through Arizona, reaching Utah south on Tuesday night.
"The main risk expected by Rosa or its consequences are strong devices in Baja California, the North-East Sonora and the South-West desert of the United States," the Uragana National Centre said.
These nests are expected to cause immediate flooding at risk of life, waste streams in deserts, and landslides in mountainous areas.
Violence in Midsomer Norton: Four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old have been arrested as suspected of attempted murder, after the 16-year-old was wounded with a knife in Somerset.
Adolescents were found wounded in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, around 4:00 BST on Saturday.
He joined the hospital, where he is currently "sustainable".
According to the Avon and Somerset police, a 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old were arrested during the night in the Radstock area.
Officials have called for the presentation of anyone who may have been caught with a cell phone video from the event.
Trump says Kavanaugh "is faced with the humiliation and anger" of the Democratic Party
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the ruthless and cruel tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said in a rally at West Virginia Wheeling.
Trump said Kavanaugh "has faced the humiliation and anger" of the Democratic Party during his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified in front of Congress on Thursday, denying with conviction and emotion Christine Blasey Ford's accusation that he had attacked her sexually decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also gave a witness during the session regarding her charge.
On Saturday, the president said that that day "the American people witnessed the greatness, character qualities and courage" of Kavanaugh.
"A vote for the appointment of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for one of the most proud lawyers of our time, a lawyer with a clean record of public service," he said in front of the group of supporters in Western Virginia.
The president stressed the appointment of Kavanaugh during the talk on the importance of Republican participation in the long-term elections.
"We are divided by one of the most important choices in our lives for weeks.
I won't run, but I'm contributing," he said.
"But I'm doing so much effort and fighting for excellent candidates."
Trump argued that the Democrats have a mission to make "block resistance".
The first main procedural vote by the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh is expected to take place not later than Friday, CNN's assistant GOP senior director said
Hundreds of earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia, while numbers are expected to rise
At least 384 people were killed, many of whom were stabbed by giant waves that were hit by the beaches, when the island of Sulawesi of Indonesia was hit by a earthquake and tsunami, authorities expressed themselves on Saturday.
Hundreds of people were gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday, when the valleys up to six feet (18 m) of height fell to the shore in the musculoskeletal, exhaling the death of many and destroying everything ahead.
Cunami followed a 7.5 earthquake.
"The day of the morning, when the threat of tsunami was born, people were still carrying out their usual activities on the beach, and as a result they did not run immediately and fell victim to it," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson of the Indonesian disaster prevention agency, said at a press conference.
"Cunami didn't come alone, he took with himself cars, drills, houses, hit everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had crossed the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 miles per hour), before hitting the coast line.
Some people went up to the tree to save the land and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Peru.
The air photographs published by the disaster agency showed a number of destroyed buildings and shops, twisted and similar bridges and a glass of water.
The post - earthquake attacks continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
The earthquake was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) was expressed in a statement that energy emitted by the massive Friday earthquake was about three times the power of the atomic bomb released in Hiroshima during World War II.
The geographical position of the city, which is located on the edge of a long, narrow slope, may have multiplied the power of the hummingbird, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as "great floods" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels were exemplary.
Some bodies were found blocked under the ruins of similar buildings, he said, adding that 540 people had been injured and 29 had been missing.
Nugroho said that the number of victims and the scale of damage could be much greater along the 300 km (190 miles) coastline in northern Palu, in an area called Dongala, which is near the end of the quake.
Communication networks "stopped completely without any warning" by Dongala, Nugroho said.
That area has over 300,000 inhabitants," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were traveling to covered areas.
"It's already turned into a tragedy, but the situation may even worsen," he said.
On Saturday, the agency was severely criticized for not giving notice of Paul’s beating from the tsunami, despite the fact that officials said that the waves had arrived at the time of the warning.
In amateur films distributed in social media, a man on the top floor of a building can be heard warning passersby down the road for the arrival of the stormy bristles.
Within a few minutes, a dam is blown to the shore, taking with it buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to verify the truth of the film immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a massive energy interruption, which cut off communications across Palu, making it difficult to coordinate efforts to save from authorities.
The army has begun to send cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but evacuated persons continue to have great needs for food and other basic needs.
The city's airport is only reopened for rescue efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was expecting to visit the evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The number of victims from the tsunami in Indonesia is over 800.
The situation is pretty serious.
While World Vision staff from Dongala have arrived unresolved in the city of Palu, where workers are staying at inter-auline shelters in their office yard, they witnessed the destruction scene along the road, said Mr. Dosebah.
"They told me they had seen many destroyed houses," he said.
The situation is pretty serious.
Although the relief teams began to make serious efforts to move humanitarian aid mechanisms, some complained that foreign relief workers with extensive expertise were stopping them from traveling to Paul.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies and external staff can only begin to circulate if the disaster zone has been declared a national disaster zone.
This hasn't happened yet.
"This is still a regional disaster," said Aulia Arrian, a spokesman for the Red Cross.
"As the government says, "OK, this is a national disaster," we can seek national help, but this status has not yet been given".
The second night after the earthquake and tsunami in Paul’s day, friends and families of the missing ones still had hope that the case of their loved ones would be among the few miracles that sometimes occur in the event of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy came out of a well.
On Saturday, the rescue forces released a woman who had remained two days under the overthrow, with her mother’s body next to her.
Gendon Subandoro, the Indonesian national team's coach of presoutism, had trained two of the missing presoutists for the Asian Games, which were closed early this month in Indonesia.
Some of the others locked up in the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
"As an old professional in the field of presoutism, I am very emotionally charged," he said.
Mr. Gendon recalls how in the hours that followed the broadcast of the "Roa Roa" hotel show between the presoutism community, he was desperately trying to write to whatsapp competitors from Palu, who were taking part in the festival at the beach.
However, his messages ended only with a mark of gray scaling instead of two blue marks.
"I think that means that the messages were not sent," he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 while relieving a ATM in Newport in Levee
According to a press statement by the Newport Police Directorate on Friday morning, some thieves have stolen $26,750 from a Brink employee, who was relieving a banknote in Newport of Levie.
The car manager had been emptying a ATM in a entertainment center and trying to spread money to others, Detective Dennis wrote in the statements.
While he was busy, someone "went running after Brink's employees" and stole a cash bag for surrender.
According to the statement, the witnesses had seen some suspects leaving the scene, but the police did not specify the number of persons involved in the incident.
Any person who has information about their identities should contact the Newport police number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The list changes the name in Ye
The Kanye West will change his name in Ye.
Advertised the change on Saturday, he wrote: "It's officially known as Kanye West".
41-year-old West has been called with Ye's nock ever since, and has used it as the title of his eighth album, which came out in the market in June.
The change came shortly before his release on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album "Yandhi".
He will replace the singer Ariana Grande in the show, which cannot come for "emotional reasons," the director of the show said.
In view of the fact that his current name of art has been shortened, West has stated in the past that the word has a religious meaning for it.
"I think "yes" is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means "you," said West early this year, talking about his album title with the radio representative Big Boy.
"As for me, it's you, it's us, it's us.
I went from Kanye, which means "the only," in just "the Ye", which is the reflection of our good, our evil, our confusion, everything.
The album is more a reflection of what we are."
He's one of many famous rapists who've changed their name.
Sean Combs is known differently as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, or Diddy, but this year he said he preferred the name Love and Brother Love.
An ex-collaborator of West, JAY-Z, has done as he has done with or without a shared visa and capital letter.
AMLO of Mexico promises not to use the army against civilians
Mexico's newly elected president, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has pledged that he will never use military force against civilians, while the country is approaching the 50th anniversary of a bloody reprisal against students.
On Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza, Lopez Obrador vowed that "he will never use the army to oppress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, military troops launched a fire on peaceful demonstrations in the square, killing 300 people, at a time when the left-wing movement of students was being waged throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by giving monthly grants to students and opening up more public universities without payment.
He has said that unemployment and lack of opportunities for education push young people towards criminal gangs.
US needs to double funding for artificial intelligence
While China is becoming increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US has to double the amount spent on research in this field, says the investor and expert in artificial intelligence Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments have come after various parts of the US government have announced discoveries of artificial intelligence, despite the lack of an official general strategy for artificial intelligence by the US.
Meanwhile, China has announced its plan last year: within 2030, it aims to take the first place for innovation in the field of artificial intelligence.
"The dissemination of the budget for research in the field of artificial intelligence would be a good start, because the other countries are still far behind the US and we are looking for a great discovery of the future in this field," Lee said.
The double funding could double the chances of the next major achievement in the field of artificial intelligence being made in the US, Lee said in an interview for CNBC this week.
Lee, author of the book "The Superpowers of Artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and New World's Randy," published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is executive director of Synovation Ventures, who has invested in one of the most prominent companies of artificial intelligence in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, at the "Carnegie Mellon" University, he created an artificial intelligence system that also passed the U.S. leader in Othello, and then worked as executive director near Microsoft Research and as president of the Google branch in China.
Lee praised the previous American government's competitions for technology, such as the Agency's Robotics Challenge for Advanced Research Projects in the Defence Field, and asked when the next competition would be held, so as to help identify new visionaries.
Lee said that often, researchers in the US need to work hard to receive grants from the government.
"It is not China that is removing academic leaders; they are corporations," Lee said.
Over the last few years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have been working brainwashed by universities to work in the field of artificial intelligence.
Lee said changes in immigration policy could help the US push its efforts into the field of artificial intelligence.
"I think green cards should be automatically given to people with the doctor's title in the field of artificial intelligence," he said.
In July 2017, the State Council of China issued the Plan for the Development of the New Artificial Intelligence Generation.
The National Nature Science Foundation in China provides funding for people in academic institutions, as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations give money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Early this year, the American Department of Defence set up a Joint Centre of Artificial Intelligence, which is expected to include partners from industry and the Academy, and the White House announced the establishment of the Selection Committee for Artificial Intelligence.
Meanwhile, this month DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called "AI Next".
As for the NSF, it currently invests over $100 million a year for research in the field of artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, American legislation aimed at creating a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence has not found implementation for months.
Macedonians vote in the referendum on the country's name change
On Sunday, Macedonia's people voted in a referendum to decide whether its name would be changed to "the Republic of North Macedonia", a movement that could resolve a ten-year dispute with Greece, which had blocked its efforts for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, believes its northern neighbour's name is a claim on its territory, and has set up its blocking veto in NATO and in the EU.
Two governments reached an agreement in June based on the new name proposed, but nationalists argue that the change could complicate the ethnic identity of the majority of the Slavs of the Macedonian population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has expressed that he will not vote in the referendum, and a boycotting campaign has cast doubt on whether participation in the election will reach the 50 per cent necessary for the validity of the referendum.
The question in the referendum's ballot card reads: "Are you proposing NATO and EU membership through the accession of the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that for Macedonia, as one of the countries created by the collapse of Yugoslavia, this is a price worth paying to achieve membership in structures such as the EU and NATO.
"I have come today to vote for the country's future, for Macedonia's young people, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, as this means a safer life for all of us," 79-year-old Oliver Georgievska in Skopje said.
Although the referendum has no mandatory power, a sufficient number of members of parliament have said they will retain the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
The change of name requires a majority of two-thirds in parliament.
The State Election Commission expressed that no irregularities had been reported until 1 p.m.
However, voting was only 16 per cent, compared with 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, where 66 per cent of registered voters cast their vote.
"I hope to vote for my children's sake, we have the country in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62-year-old, voters in the capital of Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dusko cast their vote on the referendum on Macedonia's name change, which would open the way for the country's membership in NATO and the European Union, in Strumice, Macedonia, 30 September 2018.
In front of parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov was preparing a small scene and was setting up a chair in front of the camps set up by referendum boycotts.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our head up, not by entering the back door," Kavadarkov said.
"Our country is poor, but we have dignity.
If they don't love us with the name of Macedonia, we can address other states such as China and Russia and become part of the Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring enough necessary investments for Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of over 20 per cent.
"I think the overwhelming majority will be pro, since more than 80 per cent of our citizens are pro for the EU and NATO," Zaev said after his vote.
He said a positive result would "confirm our future".
According to a poll published last month by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research, about 30 to 43 per cent of voters would participate in the referendum -- a figure below the necessary level of participation.
Another survey conducted by Macedonian television Telma found that 57 per cent of participants planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 per cent said they would vote pro.
For a successful referendum, the scale of participation should be 50 per cent plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would give the government's pro-western policy a strong first blow since its arrival in power last May.
See: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City passes through all the protection of Brighton to mark
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling took over all of Brighton's defenses in Manchester City on Saturday, at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made his goal in the 65th minute look extremely easy.
Argentina's hunter took a step back in the middle at the start of the action.
He drove through three Brighton defenders, before he went out into the open field.
Later, Aguero found himself surrounded by four green blouses.
He crossed a protector and speeded up some others at the entry of the Brighton area.
Then he followed the left where Sterling was.
The English attacker used his exit to follow the Agueros ball, which hit the right and crossed the gateway Matthew Ryan by throwing the ball into the right corner of the network.
"Aguero is suffering from a foot problem," City Manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We discussed that he would play about 55 or 60 minutes.
Here's what happened.
We were lucky he was empty at the time."
But Sterling was the one who gave the whole class the first advantage in the game of the Premier League.
This goal was marked in the 29th minute.
During that action, Aguero took the ball in the middle of Brighton.
He was pretty vertical for Laroy Sane on the left.
Sane moved a few steps ahead of following Sterling in the second column.
The attacker took the ball into the net and then ran out of the border lines.
The city will meet with Hofenheim in the valid challenge for the Camp League groups, Thursday at 12:55 p.m. at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to save the role of the "slipper" against Rockies
With nationals eliminated from the chance to reach the eliminations, there was no reason to impose another start.
But Scherzer, who is always competitive, hopes to be given the opportunity to mark against Colorado Rockies, but only if there is a chance of playing for Rockies, who have an advantage with a match against Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western National League.
Rockies got at least one chance for the playoff due to winning 5-2 against the Nationals on Friday night, but they're still trying to get the title of the division.
"And why we're playing for no reason, at least we can mark knowing the atmosphere of fans here in Denver, and the fact that the opposition team will play at the highest level I can face all year round.
Why didn't I want to play on such a challenge?"
Nationals have not yet announced who will be the headline on Sunday, but it is reported that they are inclined in such situations to leave Scherzer to start the meeting.
Scherzer, for which it would be the 34th appearance as a titler, held a training session Thursday and could be presented in the field on Sunday, which could be a normal day of rest for it.
The player from Washington, who shot right is 18-7 with an ERA 2.53 ERA and 300 "strieouts" in 220 2/3 of the shootings this season.
Trump gathers Western Virginia in the meeting
The president referred to the trajectory of the situation regarding his election to the High Court, Brett Kavanaugh, before discussing the importance of Republican participation in the long-term elections.
"The body is decisive for everything we've done so far.
Five weeks separate us from one of the most important choices in our life.
This is one of the biggest elections -- I'm not running, but I'm contributing, and that's why I'm trying so much to fight for excellent candidates," he said.
Trump went on, "You see this terrible group of radical democrats, you see what's going on right now.
And they have broken up their minds to regain power in every way, so you see their disgrace and their folly.
They don't want to know who they are, who they are who are, who are they who are, who are they, who are they, who are they, who are they, and who are they, and who are they, and who are they, and who are they, and who are they, and who are they, and who are they, and who are they, and who are they, and we are, and we are, and we are not."
The Democrats, he said, have a mission to make "block resistance".
"And you have seen this during the last days," he said, calling the Democrats "enraged, cruel, filthy and wicked."
He was referred to by the President of the Senate Judicial Committee, Diane Feinstein, as a source of dissatisfaction from the audience.
"Do you remember her answer?
Do you have any knowledge of the Qur'an?
Well, well, what?
No, well, no, I... wait a little...--her body language was pretty bad--it was the worst language of the body I've ever seen."
The part of the job is no longer an open house.
It's intolerant to those who say what they think.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted for the motion of disbelief against me, they did not live up to it.
Finally, I am not the first of the MPs of the Labour Party to whom it is said that they are not welcome - all of this because we say what we think.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan was treated similarly, simply because he firmly opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of disbelief was a criticism of me for failing to agree with Jeremy Corbyn.
Regarding the importance of responsible economic policy, national security and Europe, ironically similar issues that Jeremy faced with previous leaders.
In the announcement of a meeting of the Labour Party at Nottingham East, it was said that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
For the most part of my eight-year period as local Labour Party MPs, the GC meetings have been similar.
Unfortunately, the meetings no longer have their previous tone, and the promise of a "mildest and most gentle" policy has been forgotten since, if ever.
It has become increasingly evident that the opposite views are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and every opinion is judged on the basis of its acceptance by the party's leadership.
This began a little after Jeremy became a leader, while colleagues with whom I thought that the share of similar political views began claiming that I would take a 180-degree turn and maintain positions with which I would never agree - either on national security or on the EU's single market.
Whenever I speak to the public -- no matter what I say -- they break down social media criticism, with people asking for my discharge, they denouncing the policies of the centre, they tell me that I shouldn't be part of the Party of Labour.
And this isn't just me.
I am aware that I am happier than some of my colleagues, since comments about me tend to be political.
I am amazed by the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face gender discrimination and racial discrimination every day, but do not hesitate.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is the normalization of levels of violence.
Last week, Jeremy Corbin said the Labour Party should feed a culture of tolerance.
In fact, we are no longer a "open church", and with every motion of faith and with any change in the rules of selection, the party becomes increasingly closed.
Over the last two years, I've been advised to lower my head, not to be so loud, and that's how everything "will be fine".
But that's not why I entered politics.
Since I joined the Workers' Party 32 years ago as a school student, encouraged by the disregard of the Thatcher government that led my class to a general school failure, I have tried to lobby for better public services for those who need more - whether as a member of a local council or as a government minister.
I've never hidden my policy, even in the last election.
Everyone in Nottingham East had clearly my political attitudes and the points of opposition to the current leadership.
For all those who voted for the motion Friday, I just want to say that the country is heading towards a Brexit that will touch our families, businesses and services, and I cannot understand the desire to spend time and energy with my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact, the only message I want to follow is not addressed to Nottingham Momentum, but to my voters whether or not they are members of the Party of Labour: I feel proud that I am in your service and I promise you that no threat to download or political favor will prevent me from acting in your best interest.

Father 38 - 17 Melrose: Invincible Fathers Lead the List
Two late attempts may have somewhat changed the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to triumph in the extremely entertaining game of Tennant's Premiership today.
Now they run the lists as the only invincible team among the ten teams.
Finally, it was their wonderful protection and courage to take the risk that the winner of the local team, and coach Peter Murchie was absolutely right to be pleased.
"We've shown ourselves in every game, and we're still invincible, towards normally I'm happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "We want to congratulate the Air team, who took more risks than we did".
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, which was turned into an empty one by Frazier Climo, passed Air to the advantage, but a yellow card for the Scottish player Rory Hughes, who came to this challenge by Warriors, allowed Melrose to show numerical superiority and Jason Baggot got a useless top.
Climo increased the advantage of Ayr with a penalty while shortly before the end of the first part, he marked and turned into empty an individual action bringing the result to 17-5 for Ayr before the break.
But Melrose began to welcome the second part and Patrick Anderson's attempt, which returned empty from Baggot, reduced the difference to five points.
Later, there was a long interruption as a result of the serious damage of Ruarid Knott, who left with the bar, and after the game was re-launched, Ayr increased the result through an attempt by Stafford McDowall, signed by Climo.
Ayr's captain, Blair Macpherson, was later punished with a yellow card, and Melrose again took advantage of the fact that they had an extra player, with an unarmed attempt by Bruce Colvine, at the end of a hard-pressing piece.
However, the locals were returned and when Struan Hutchinson was punished with a yellow card because he obstructed Climo, without a top, by the penance line, MacPherson made "touch down", after the third (small) air behind which he was advancing forward.
Climo marked and did the same almost after the game was over, as Kyle Rowe caught the ball hit by David Armstrong in the area and led to the striker Gregor Henry, for the fifth attempt of the local team.
The Styl Game star seems set for the new career in the restaurant industry
The star of "Still Game" Ford Kieran seems determined to enter the hotel industry, after it was found that he was appointed director of a licensed restaurant chain.
56-year-old Jack Jarvis plays the role in BBC's famous show, with co-scanarist and co-protagonist partner in the world of comedy, Greg Hemphill.
The suspect has announced that the ninth season will be the last for this show, and it seems Kieran is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Agringmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on the story, even though a source for Scottish Sun made it clear that Kieran was trying to enter the "flowering restaurant industry" of Glasgow.
"The sea is ours": Bolivia without leaving the sea hopes the court will open the way to the Pacific
Marines patrol an improvisation of the ship's headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings have raised the blue ocean flag.
At sea bases by Lake Titicaca in Amazon, the motto is: "The child is our property.
His recovery is a duty."
In Bolivia without exit into the sea, the memory of taking the coast from Chile in a bloody conflict for sources during the 19th century is still quite alive - as is the desire to sail once again across the Pacific.
Now, these hopes are more likely than ever for decades, while on October 1st, Bolivia expects the International Court of Justice decision after a five-year review.
"Bolivia is characterized by hovi, the spirit of unity and tranquillity, and of course, is looking forward to the result," said Roberto Calzadella, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will attend the GJND session on large screens across the country, hoping that the Hague tribunal will decide in favor of Bolivia that - after decades of irregular discussions - Killy is obliged to hold talks to give Bolivia a sovereign territory out of the sea.
For Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic Indian president - who faces a controversial battle for taking the second mandate in the elections next year - the decision of the month is very important.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he pledged at the end of August.
But some analysts are thinking that there is very little chance that the court will decide in favor of Bolivia -- and that even though they would change little.
The United Nations headquarters in the Netherlands has no intention of giving another state part of the territory of Chile, and it has been said that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the GJND is dating only six months after hearing the final arguments shows that the issue "was not complicated," Paz Zárate, an expert on international law, said.
And instead of helping Bolivia's cause, the events of the last four years may have penalized her.
"The issue of access to the sea is complicated by current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
Morale’s aggressive rhetoric has disappeared every trace of kindness left in the Chilean, she suggested.
At a certain point, Bolivia and Chile will continue the talks, but it will be extremely difficult to hold discussions after that.
Two countries have not been trading ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltz, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, objected to the idea that the court's decision was unusually fast.
On Monday he will offer Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Kilin" and a chance "to end 139-year-old disagreements with bilateral benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America - was using the maritime issue for political interests.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific," he added.
"The decision is an opportunity to understand that we must leave behind the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not be carried out for as long as it can't trust the United States.
North Korea's Foreign Minister, Ri Yong Ho, says his nation will never do the first nuclear firefighting, as long as it can't trust Washington.
New was holding a talk on Saturday before the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to keep the promises made during a summit in Singapore among the leaders of rival states.
His comments come at a time when the US Secretary of State Mike Pompey seems to be at the threshold of the resurrection of nuclear diplomacy so far as "to beg", but three months after Singapore with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
According to Ri, hopes that the continued sanctions and US opposition to the declaration of the Korean war ending will make North Korea kneel down are empty hopes.
As long as Pyongyang does not act first to make important eviction movements, Washington hesitates to accept the statement.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is a broad skepticism about the seriousness of Pyongyang's goal to attract its arsenal, which the state most likely sees as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo is planning to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris reveal the latest line of giant chapels that will soon come on the streets of your city
If you want to enrich your collection of chapels or provide full protection from sunlight, do not ask for more.
Valentine’s and Thom Browne’s stylists presented a series of strange giant chapels for their SS19 collection in the landscape, which left all the stylists open in Paris’s Fashion Week.
Very impractical hats have been taken to Instagram this summer, and these stylists have brought their surprising creations to the ground.
Valentino’s special creation was a very extravagant, well - adorned chapel with a wide range of details similar to that of the monkey, which surrounded the head of the model.
Other large accessories included decorated balconies with stones, a magic hat and even a pineapple -- but they're not done to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of odd - time masks for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had their lips girded and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than the leather coat.
One creature was like the earth’s surface, filled with the air tube and the water’s glasses, while another was like a molten ice cube.
And if you like to follow this courageous way, you're lucky.
Fashion analysts predict that giant chapels can soon come on the streets of your city.
The trend of giant chapels has followed that of La Bomba, the castle chapel with a two-legged shelter, which we have all seen, beginning from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand hidden behind the very unpractice hat that it took through social media brought another great creation to the ground - a bag of the beach, almost as big as the model of the bathroom that was holding it.
The brownish-coloured orange box, decorated with cloths and with a white handle on top, was the most special creation of the collection La Riviera SS19 of Jacquemus in Paris’s Fashion Week.
The stylist of famous personalities Luke Armitage reported for FEMAIL: "The next summer I predict seeing chapels and bags of giant beaches in the streets of the cities - after the stylist has left a huge impact as it would be difficult to ignore requests for large accessories".
John Edward: Essential linguistic skills for global citizens
Private schools in Scotland record academic excellence and this has continued in 2018 with another set of excellent results in the trials, reinforced further by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other fields.
With over 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Private Schools (SCIS), strive to offer the highest level of service to their students and parents.
Private schools aim to prepare their students for further education at higher levels, for their chosen career and their country as global citizens.
As an educational sector that can prepare and implement a suitable educational curriculum, we are witnessing how modern - language branches continue to be a popular and popular choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak in a language that he understands, your words will be heard.
If you speak with him in your own tongue, your words shall reach to his heart.
Those words are a powerful reminder that we cannot rely only on English when we want to establish a relationship with people from foreign lands.
From the results of the recent trials this year, we can see that languages are taking the lead in the results list, with the highest degree of last-minute notes among private schools.
A total of 68 per cent of students who have studied foreign languages have received the maximum note A.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 per cent of students had received the maximum grade A in Mandarin, while 72 per cent of those studying German, 69 per cent of those studying French, and 63 per cent of those studying Spanish had also received grade A.
This shows that private schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as one of the life skills that children and young people will no doubt need in the future.
Currently, the foreign language branches are considered as important as the STEM branches (scientific, technological, engineering and mathematics) in the curriculums of the next private schools.
A 2014 study by the United Kingdom Commission for Employment and Skills found that among the main difficulties faced by employers in filling the vacancies, 17 per cent of them related to the lack of language skills.
As a result, language skills are becoming increasingly necessary for preparing young people for their future careers.
With the expansion of the jobs that are conditional on the ownership of foreign languages, these abilities are essential in a globalized world.
Despite the career that a person chooses, if he has learned a second language, he will have real advantages in the future as the owner of such a long - term ability.
The ability to communicate directly with foreign people will automatically position a multilingual person over competitors.
According to a survey by YouGov, which included over 4,000 adults from the United Kingdom in 2013, 75 per cent of them were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to develop a conversation, and the French was the only foreign language spoken by a 2 - figure percentage, specifically 15 per cent.
That is why investing in language learning is important for today’s children.
The possession of many languages, especially the possession of the languages of developing countries, will give children a better chance of employment.
Within Scotland, each school will be different as to the languages taught in it.
Some schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will offer languages that are considered the most important for the United Kingdom in the year 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s interest, there will always be a number of languages that you can choose in private schools, with pedagogical staff composed of field specialists.
Scottish private schools are committed to offering a school environment that will prepare children and "armatize" them with the necessary skills to succeed, however the future.
At this time it cannot be denied that in a global business environment, languages continue to have a vital importance for the country's future, to this end it must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should really be considered as "international communications operator".
Private schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to Scotland's young people.
It's a good thing to do.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Private Schools Council
LeBron is expected to debut with Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The wait has almost ended for fans waiting to see LeBron James in his first game for Log Angeles Lakers.
Laker's coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the opening pre-season game on Sunday against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
It is not yet known how much minutes he will play.
"There will be more than 1 and less than 48," Walton said on Lakers' official website.
Lakers correspondent wrote on Twitter that James would probably play for a limited number of minutes.
After training early this week, James was asked about his plans for Lakers' six-season pre-season games.
"I don't need pre-season matches at this stage of my career to prepare," he said.
Trump assembly time in Western Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump, launches a series of electoral meetings tonight at Wheeling, West Virginia.
This will be the first meeting of five of these planned to hold next week, including stops in the friendly areas including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote of approval to suspend his election to fill the empty country in the High Court, Trump aims to create support for the upcoming long-term elections as Republicans risk losing control in Congress when the elections are held in November.
What time is the Trump Summit taking place today in West Virginia, and how do we follow it online?
Trump's meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled to be held at 7 p.m.. Eastern time tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can follow the Trump Summit in West Virginia online below, through direct broadcast on YouTube.
Trump is likely to address this week's hearing sessions at the High Court of Candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who was pressured by charges of his indiscriminate sexual conduct, with the expected vote of confirmation by the Senate remaining suspended for a week while the FBI was conducting investigations on the issue.
But the primary goal of these many gatherings is to help Republicans get a egg ahead of them in November's elections.
Therefore, President Trump's campaign staff said these five meetings next week are intended to "give energy to volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majority held in the Senate and in the House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Congress control is so important for his agenda, as the President will travel to as many states as possible as we address the hot season of the campaign," a Trump campaign spokesman, who did not want to be identified, told Reuters.
The planned development in Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the gathering of tonight's evening can bring back supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and covered by the Pittsburgh media, according to the Western Virginia Metro News news agency.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump visits Western Virginia, the country where he won more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate of the Senate for Western Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who is behind the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come and try to give him a push in the poll," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: US team showed readiness to fight as they held their hopes alive by running the tech races on Sunday
After three single seasons, the remaining four for the afternoon of Sunday, could be what this Ryder Cup needed.
This tie of the wheel, it is a completely created sports concept, but a concept where players truly believe in and never more than in such a race.
But where can we say that he feels this noise now?
"They had a six-point separation that has now gone to four, we can say that it has been created to some extent a kind of hole I believe," Jordan Spieth said while he closed the day.
Of course, Europe has the advantage of four points ahead, when it remains in play and twelve points.
As Spieth states, Americans hope that the limbs are in their favor and have a lot to encourage, especially in the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day when they took three out of four possible points.
Speeth has been rude from the start of shooting to the grave and is leading by giving his example.
The cheers of the festival increased as the rounds came, throwing the golf ball with an easy hit to bring the match to balance, when he and Thomas were previously two points down after two rounds.
His easy shot to give them the victory in the 15th tomb was expected with a similar brochure, which shows that he believes that the American team is not yet out of the race.
"You just have to work hard and worry about your match," Spieth said.
All the players left now.
18 holes to leave a trace.
The only players with more points than Speeth and Thomas in the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed story of the Ryder Cup.
The strange, but worshipful European couple has accomplished four out of four and can't go wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't catch a shot at the minimum on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided shootings at the minimum on Sunday morning, Friday night and at the other nine shots on Friday morning.
This result and the way their energy seems to flow towards the enthusiastic crowd and the anasellas reinforces the idea that they are players to be able on Sunday and that there will be no more known player than Fleetwood and Molinari to seal a possible European victory, while the sun prevails over "Le Golf National".
Maybe both at the same time in different pits.
However, the declarations for a European triumph are still premature.
Baba Watson and Webb Simpson made it very easy for Sergio Garcia, the four - morning hero when he got married to Alex Noren.
One point above the minimum and two two to the south front placed Spanish and Swedish in a pit from which they had no chance of leaving.
However, no one will be there to help you get out of your grave on Sunday.
The four and couple games are so amazing to follow closely because of the interaction between the couple, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and the way a strategy can change there.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has taken a significant lead to the finals, but these four sessions also showed that the US team will still face even though some people, especially the Stateside, have questioned this.
Europe heads 10-6 as it goes to the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe has a fundamental advantage on the final day of Cup Ryder since it has come out of the four games and with couples with a 10-6 advantage over the United States.
The inspirational suspect Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari headed the two-way race against a Tiger Woods found in difficulty to increase their advantage at four points in 'Le Golf National'.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, offered to take the trophy he lost in Hazeltin two years ago, dominated the inpowering American team at two mornings, leading it to the 3-1 series of results.
The American team showed more resistance in the four games, winning two matches, but they could not reduce the difference.
Jim Fury's team needs eight points from Sunday's 12 individual matches to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European first player to win four rounds, while he and Molinari, survivors of 'Mollwood', after a sensational ending, are the second couple in the history of the Ryder Cup who win four points in their four open matches.
After Woods and Patrick Reed crashed in the four games, they were combined quite well to enable a powerful Woods and American beginner Bryson Dechambeau with an even more dramatic 5&4 result.
Woods, who had a hard time at two meetings on Saturday, showed sudden explosions of magnification, but he has already lost 19 of his 29 matches in the four and with couples and 7 major matches.
Justin Rose, retired for the four-morning match, returned to partner Henrik Stanson in the match with the couple and received a 2&1 loss from Dustin Justin and Brooks Koepka - ranked in the first and third world.
Europe did not have everything in favor on a very beautiful and fresh day in southwestern Paris.
Three times the professional winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas made the difference that was to be caught by Americans on two Saturdays.
They won a bold 2&1 victory against Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter at the four matches and later returned to Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the match with couples after they had lost in the first two graves.
Only twice in the history of Cup Ryder a team has returned the result after a difference between four points in individual games, even though Fury's team holder needs only one equation to keep the trophy.
However, since he was the second best player for two days, a protest on Sunday seems to go beyond their possibilities.
North Korea says it won't be cleared 'in any way' unanimously without gaining faith
North Korea's Foreign Minister told the United Nations that the continued sanctions on Saturday were deepening the United States' disbelief and the country would not give up its nuclear weapons unanimously in such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual body from around the world of the General Assembly that North Korea has undertaken "significant measures showing good will" in the past year, such as banning nuclear and missile testing, decommissioning nuclear testing areas and promising that it will not add to the arsenal of nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we are not seeing any response to this from the US," he said.
"Without trust in the United States, our national security will not have confidence and in these circumstances there is no way we can unify ourselves the first."
While Rei repeated North Korea's usual complaints regarding Washington's resistance to a separate "in phase" situation for the nuclear disarmament process where North Korea would be assessed due to the gradual steps it has taken, his statement seemed important because it did not exclude the unilateral nuclear disarmament, as Penieni had previously done.
The new was referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a summit held for the first time between a Korean-Nordic president and leaders in Singapore on 12 June, where Kim was pledged to work towards "nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula" while Trump was pledged to guarantee the security of North Korea.
North Korea has requested an official ending of the Korean War 1950-53, but the United States has expressed that the Peniani must first withdraw from nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls for the abolition of international strict sanctions on North Korea.
"The US insists that 'nuclear disarmament' be carried out at first and increase the level of pressure through sanctions to achieve their goal compulsorily, even by opposing 'the declaration of the end of war'," Ri said.
"The perception that sanctions can crush us is dreams in the sun of people who are uninformed of us.
But the problem is that the continuation of sanctions is deepening our disbelief."
New did not mention the plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, a statement that the US leader earlier stressed this week in the United Nations.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae in the last five months and added: "If you face the issue of nuclear disarmament would be South Korea and not the US, the process of nuclear disarmament in the Korean Peninsula would not have come into this state without a roadblock."
Nevertheless, the tone used in the New Talk was significantly different from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly, that the US territory's position under the flag with the Korean-Nordic missile was inevitable after "Mr. President Djalli" Trump called Kim "a rocket man" with a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, who threatened last year that it would "completely destroy" North Korea thanked Kim for the courage shown in taking steps to clean up, but said there was still much work to do and that sanctions should continue to be active until North Korea carries out nuclear disarmament.
Wednesday, Trump said he didn't have a time frame for this, saying, "If it takes two years, three years or five months--it doesn't matter."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should pay Penian for the interim steps.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in the United Nations Security Council on Thursday: "The implementation of the Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and without stopping until we realize the full and final verification of nuclear disarmament."
The Security Council has unanimously decided to increase sanctions for North Korea since 2006, in an effort to end the funding of the Kenyan nuclear programmes and ballistic missiles.
Pompeo met with New Foreign Affairs at the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Penian again next month to prepare a second meeting.
Pompey has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit didn't go so well.
He left Pennsylvania in July saying he had made progress, and only within a few hours North Korea denounced him as having done "a mafia style request."
North Korea was pledged at a meeting with Moon this month to clear a missile zone and also a nuclear complex if the United States would take "relevant measures".
He said Kim had told him that the "relevant measures" he was seeking were security guarantees for which Trump was promised in Singapore and moving towards normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students get lessons on how to rest enough
A new course at Harvard University this year has included all students to sleep more, in an effort to fight the growing culture of the study 'mass' through the use of caffeine by these 'pays'.
An academic observed that university students number one in the world often have no knowledge when it comes to basics than how to care for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham Hospital and that of Grave, prepared the course of lectures, who believes he is the first of this kind in the United States.
He was inspired to take this course after giving a reference to the influence that sleep has on the teacher.
At the end of the day, a girl approached me and said, "Why is this saying to me now, in my last year?"
She said no one had talked to her before about the importance of sleep -- which surprised me,' he said about 'The Telegraph'.
The course, included in the program for the first time this year, explains to the students the essential elements of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic ranking, as well as how it improves their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and general director of university medical services, said the university decided to present this course after finding that students were seriously deprived of sleep for the week.
The course that lasted an hour involves a number of interfering duties.
On the one hand, there is a view of a conceivable room, where students click on the cupboards of coffee, parsleys, athletes and books so that they can explain the effects of caffeine and lighting and how athletic rankings are affected by the lack of sleep, as well as the importance of the routine of hours to be spent in bed.
In another part, participants were explained that the risk of heart attack, ischemia, depression, and cancer increased as sleep deprivation for a long time.
A map of the camp, with interactive icons, further encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
'We know that student behavior will not change immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to know -- just as you have the right to know -- the health impact when you choose to smoke," added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride to spend 'a pay-night' continues to exist, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students always meant that sleep deprivation was a permanent and growing problem.
The assurance that you have taken enough sleep, of a good quality, must be the students' 'secret weapon' to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said -- even to avoid weight gain, because sleep deprivation leads to a hunger mode, making them feel hungry all the time.
Raymond So, a 19 - year - old Californian who studies physics and chemistry, helped Professor Cheisler to prepare the course, having participated in one of his classes last year in Harvard.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and had inspired him to return to a course for the entire camp.
He hopes that the next step is to ask all students of post-university studies to complete a similar study programme before joining competitive institutions.
Prof. Czeisler recommended that students should set a time by day when they should go to bed, as well as when they should wake up, and be aware of the damaging effects of the blue light that comes out of electronic screens and LED lighting, which can produce the biological rate of out-of-work sleep, which leads to problems in sleeping.
Livingstone 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga marks against Gerard's boys
Rangers received another hit as a visitor while Dolly Menga's hit gave Steven Gerrard's disbanded loss of 1-0 in Livingstone.
The team from Ibrox was seeking to record his first win since the February 4-1 triumph in St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team caused him to lose the second in 18 Gerrard matches as a coach, leaving his team eight points behind the fugitive leader of Ladbrokes Premiership, the Hearts team.
Menga marked seven minutes before it ended the first part and with a position of the Rangers team that seemed completely powerless to equalize.
While Rangers now falls in sixth place, Livingstone goes on third and is directly behind the Hibernian for the difference of goals.
Rangers may expect to have more trouble after their arm player Calum Spence was treated for a head strike after being hit by an object likely thrown by visitors.
Gerard made eight changes to his team, which passed Air to the mid-finals of the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt, went into the same 11th field that took a point at Hearts last week and that he would feel satisfied with the way his well-organized team beat the opponents in every round.
Rangers may have dominated ball maintenance, but Livingstone created more when he owned it.
They should have marked only two minutes from the start of the meeting, when the first pass that Menga gave Scott Pittman to the sheltered port of Allan McGregor, was not exactly used by him by shooting the ball out.
A long cross from the execution of Keaghan Jacobs found Captain Craig Halket, but his defense partner, Alan Lithgov, just shot him out on the back of the gate.
Rangers took control of the game but seemed to be more hopeful than they really believed in their game in the opponent area.
Alfredo Morelos thought he deserved a penalty after four hours of playing as he and Steven Lawless were beaten, but Albert Steven Thomson did not hear the Colombian complaints.
Rangers managed to make two hits at the front door, but the former porter of Ibrox, Liam Kelly, didn't worry about hitting Lassana Coulibally's head and hitting Ovie Ejaria's powerless force.
While the first target of Liv in the 34th minute may have been contrary to what was being seen in the field, no one can deny that they deserved it only for the argument they showed.
Sergeant Rangers failed in the long passport service for Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher hit the ball towards Scott Robinson, who maintained calm to pass Menga and to mark in a simple way.
Gerard acted on the break between the parts while Coulibally replaced Ryan Kent and this change for a little while did not give an immediate effect while the sidecar followed for Morelos, but the admirer Kelly ran away from his position to block it.
But Livingstone kept making guests play as they wanted, where Lithgow and Halket followed each other with balls long after.
Holt's team could stretch his lead at the final stage, but McGregor stood firm and denied Jacobs before Lithuania was shooting out of a ball taken from hitting the song.
Ranger's deputy Glenn Middleton later claimed another penalty during the game, while he was confused with Jacobs, but Thomson again allowed the advantage.
Almanac: Geiger’s Watchman
And now a page by our Germanman of "Sunday Morning: September 30, 1882, As today 136 years ago and IN VAZDIM... the day the next physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the production of what is known as Geiger measurement.
A key pillar of science since then, Mategeger became a major pillar of popular culture as well, as in the 1950 film "The Days of Coronado," with a set of actors of scientists noticing professionals like Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger matt that is used to trace radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you set these limits, you can really hear the effects of atoms released from radioactive activity into minerals."
Evans: "Don't tell me, I'm listening now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name continues to live on.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system "to distinguish" the bad cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system "to distinguish" the bad cells and kill them.
Vaccines teach the immune system to recognize bad cells as part of treatment
Method includes removing immune cells from a patient, changing them into a laboratory
They can 'get out' a protein that finds severity in many types of cancer and then reinject.
A vaccine that is being tested is showing promising results in patients with certain types of cancer.
A woman who was treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize bad cells noticed that cancer in the ovaries has disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method involves removing immune cells from a patient, changing them into a laboratory so that they 'get out' a protein that is severe in some types of cancer called HER2, and then reinjecting these cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the American National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said, "Our results show us that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 "incentives the growth of some types of cancer," including breast cancer, ovaries, mules and fatheads, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar condition of immune cell extraction from patients "to teach them" how to discover cancer cells has worked in treating a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West appeared in a Pro-Trump crowd, wearing a hat with the MAGA inscription, after his appearance in SNL.
Don't go right
Kanye West was greeted by studio protests during a broadcast at the "Saturday Night Live" issue, after a disappointed interpretation where he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run for this post in 2020.
After interpreting his third song for that night called "Ghost Town", where he was standing on his head a hat writing "Make America Great", he followed to speak with our strong against the Democrats and re-examined his support for Trump.
"When I talk to a white person and they say to me, "How can you like Trump, he's a racist?"
Well, if I were concerned about racism, I would have left America long ago," he said.
The SNL began the show with a parody that was in role as Matt Damon, where Hollywood star played Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate's Judicial Commission on the charges of sexual harassment raised by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, records of West's harsh speech were loaded on social networks by comedian Chris Rock.
It remains unclear if Rock is trying to laugh at West with that mail or not.
West also complained to the spectators that he had spent a difficult time in the backyard because of what he had put on his head.
"They mistreated me in the back.
They told me, "Don't come out with that hat on your head. "
They mistreated me!
And then they tell me I'm founded," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
The West came along and said, "Do you want to see the founder?" and said, "I put my superman hat on my head, because it shows that no one can tell me what to do.
Prove love."
His comments were received at least twice by the spectators and the members of the SNL cast seemed to be embarrassed, Variety reports, where a person told the newspaper, "The whole studio fell silent."
West was called a late replacement instead of Ariana Grande, whose former lover, Reperio Mac Miller, had changed his life a few days earlier.
West surprised many with the interpretation of "I Love It" song, dressed as Perrier's bottle.
West was supported by the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who posted on Twitter: "For one of the bravest souls: the FALEMINDER THAT WERE IN THE TRUTH."
But the moderator Karen Hunter posted on Twitter that the West was just "self and this is extraordinary."
"But I choose MoS to reward someone (by buying music or clothing or by supporting his "art"), for whom I believe he shames you and spreads ideology that is harmful to my community.
And he's free.
That's how we are," she added.
Before the show, the singer declared on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying he was already "the shadow he previously known as Kanye West."
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow Diddy's tracks, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His friend rapper, Snoop Dogg had the name Snoop Lion and also late Prince's musical legends, changed his name to a symbol and then the artist known as Prince.
Accused of attempts to kill with knife at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man is accused of attempted murder after a man was beaten with fists at a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The police said the incident happened in Ballyhackamore.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Court of Belfast's First Level on Monday.
The charges will be examined by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Game of Thrones, Kit Harington, good toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as a savior in the character of Jon Snow, in the violent series of medieval fantasy "Game of Thrones".
But the 31-year-old actor has hit the male hero's stereotype, saying the display of such roles on the screen makes young boys perceive that they should be treated as strong to respect.
Speaking of ‘The Sunday Times Culture’, Kit said he believed that ‘something had gone wrong’ and wondered how the problem of toxic masculinity could be solved in the age of #MeToo movement.
Kit, who recently married his acting colleague at Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, also aged 31, admitted that he felt 'an important enough' to resolve the issue.
'Personally I feel very important this matter for the moment - where we have failed to show masculinity?' he said.
'What have we taught men as they grow up, in relation to the problems we are now facing?'
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for increasing the toxic masculinity due to the excessive male characters displayed there.
He continued, 'What is born, and what is taught?
What is taught on TV and what is taught on the street, which makes young boys believe they have to behave in a certain way to make men feel?
I think this is one of the big questions of our time — how do we change this?
Because obviously something has gone wrong with the young boys.'
During the interview, he also admitted that he would no longer play for "Game of Thrones" after the series ended at the end of the next summer, saying that 'the rifles and horses have reached the top of the nose'.
In November, Kit will take part in a recovery on the scene of 'True West' by Sam Shepard, which is the story of a film producer and his thief brother.
The actor finally showed that meeting with his wife, Rose, is the best thing he's got from the Game of Thrones.
'In this product I found my wife, we can say that this show gave me the next family and determined my life from now on,' he said.
Rose played the role of Ygritte, the sentimental interest of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in the fantastic-scientific winning series of 'Emmy' prizes.
The couple were married in June 2018 in the property of the Leslie family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports an increase of 14% of new cases
China has reported an increase of 14% of the population living with HIV and AIDS.
There are more than 820,000 people affected throughout the country, health authorities say.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
Most of the new cases have been transmitted through sexual relations, showing a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people taking the HIV virus through this way had almost gone zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, a year later, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has grown by 100,000.
The transmission of the HIV virus through sex is an acute issue in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexualism was decriminalized in China in 1997, but it is said that discrimination against LGBT people still prevails.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have measured that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men will eventually marry women.
Most of the transmission of the disease is due to inadequate protective measures during sex in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to medical children for HIV treatment as part of an attempt to address this problem.
Maxine Waters denies that GOP senators' data are spread by staff members, says these are "hazardous lies" and "conspiratory theory"
US representative Maxine Waters reported on Saturday claims that a member of her staff had posted personal information to the three US senators on Wikipedia's legal pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that these claims were being pushed by experts and online "right extremism".
"Flays, lies and just disgusting lies," Waters said in a Twitter statement.
The information is reported to include home addresses and phone numbers of US Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, posted by an unknown person in Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing session for the wrong sexual behavior against the candidate for the High Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
The flow of information came shortly after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Some of the conservative pages, such as 'Gateway Pundit' and 'RedState', reported that IP addresses identifying the source of the publications related to the Waters office and published the data of a Waters staff member, Hill reports.
"This baseless claim is totally false and a great lie," the Waters continued.
"The member of my staff -- the identity, personal information and security of which has been compromised as a result of these false and false claims -- has not been in any way responsible for the outcome of this information.
This base claim is totally false and a big lie."
Waters' statement was immediately confronted with online criticism, including former White House Press Secretary Ari Flescher.
"This denial is made frustratingly," Flescher wrote.
"This means that she does not have the right temper to be a Congressian.
When someone is accused of something they haven't done, he shouldn't be nervous.
It shouldn't be a provocation.
The accused's motives should not be questioned.
He must be calm and peaceful."
Flescher seemed to be comparing Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticisms of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of being very nervous during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is running to take over Waters in the mid-term election, also posted his statements on Twitter.
"That's great, if it's true," he wrote on Twitter.
In her statement, Waters said her office had signaled "the relevant authorities and law enforcement institutions on these false charges.
"We will ensure that authors are discovered," she continued, "and that they take legal responsibility for all their actions, which have destructive and dangerous effects for everyone from my staff."
Review of the film "Johnny English Hits Again" - comedy with unequipped spy with Rowan Atkinson material
It has been the case that in every new British-based film, hidden messages related to Brexit's theme are seen and this finds implementation and in the resumption of comedy-action "Johnny English" - which has its beginnings in 2003 with "Johnny English" and with the return in 2011 with "Johnny English's Recovery".
Would this satirical code bring out how clearly inadequate we are in relation to the new national export opportunities?
In any case, the person with the eye of the country, with his face as a doll, and in the view of Johnny English's guardian, has been given permission to confuse things for the second time -- his name, which shows more than anything else that he is a broad comical creature for non-English-speaking territories, but who are frequenting Chinese.
Of course, he's a missing secret agent, who, despite being curiously claiming to be a magician, has little from Inspector Clouseau, a little from Mr. Bean's character and a portion of that guy who contributed only to the release of a sound in the song 'Chariots of Fire' at the opening ceremony of the London Olympic Games 2012.
It is also based on the mystery man, the traveler and international Atkinson, who used to play on television advertisements that have now been forgotten by ‘Barclaycard’, leaving the country in chaos wherever it was.
There's one or two pleasant moments in this movie's premiere.
I liked it when Johnny English approached the helicopter in a middle parsm, and the helical talk got a little stuck in his helmet.
Here's the favor of the physical comedy that Atkinson is performing, but humor seems like vats and sometimes too much, especially when the 'series' films like 007 and the Immaculate Mission have even put some comedies as an ingredient in their films.
Humor seems to be directed to children more than adults, and Johnny English's crisis events are not as creative and are focused on voiceless movements, the same as what Atkinson does in Bean's character.
The permanent theme as well as in this film is the fact that Britain and the Great are in serious danger.
A cyber hacker is infiltrated into the super-secret network of British agents, discovering the identity of British land agents and has left the agent in duty -- unfortunately a small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last chance for a prime minister who appears as a pumping and willing figure for battle, who is already suffering an extraordinary political non-popularity: Emma Thompson is doing the best to realize the character that looks like Teresa May, but there is not much text on the screen that can be played.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that every active spy is compromised, she will have to rely on someone who has retired.
And that means choosing yourself Johnny English, who was now employed as a school principal in a high-level area, but who was unofficially teaching you how to become a secret agent: here there are beautiful scenes, because English is offering a school of spying in the form of a school of roulette.
English is again called in Whitehall for an urgent meeting and is re-elected with his former assistant, the multi-faceted Bough, who is again played by Ben Miller.
Now Bough is a married man, related to a junior captain, in the role of a high-level girl, where Vicki Pepperdine has used a little mistake for this role.
So Batman and Robin did things completely again in His Majesty's Secret Service, are again in action, fighting with the beautiful fatal woman Ophelia Bulletin played by Olga Curylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is being fooled by the attractive billionaire of technology who claims to be able to solve the difficulties of British computers: evil Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their ridiculous and disgusting outfits: masked as a camera, set the flame a beautiful French restaurant; cause chaos as they enter the luxury yacht of Volta; and English is totally confused as they try to use virtual reality equipment to get acquainted with the interior parts of Volta's house.
All the sequences normally become the final scene, but despite it's fun and noisy, everything seems a little bit like a movie for kids.
It's quite moderate.
As in other Johnny English films, I couldn't imagine: doesn't the British film industry have a role to play for Rowan Atkinson to suit his talent?
The Labour Party denies that there is a plan for British workers to work four days a week, but to pay for five days
The Labour Party led by Jeremy Corby is considering a radical plan that would make the British work four days a week -- but pay for five.
The party is reported to want company leaders to save using artificial intelligence (AI) revolution for employees, giving them an extra day's rest.
We would see that workers would enjoy a three - day weekend — but continuing to take the same route home.
Sources said the idea would be "consistent" with the party's economic agenda and plans to return the country to the favour of employees.
Spending a week for four days at work is an idea that has been embraced by the Union Congress, as a way for employees to benefit from the changing economy.
A high-level source of the Labour Party said 'The Sunday Times': 'a policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
'There isn't to happen immediately, but a four-day work week is an ambition that matches the party's stance to balance the economy in favour of employees and also with the party's overall industrial strategy.'
The Labour Party would not be the first to embrace this idea, where the Green Party has previously pledged a week's work during the general election campaign in 2017.
However, this ambition is currently not supported by the whole Labour Party.
A spokesperson of the Labour Party said: 'A week of work is not a party policy and is not taken into account by the party.'
The chancellor in Hide, John McDonnell, used the last week's conference of the Labour Party to thwart his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to pass the power from 'anonymous directors' and 'winners' to public service firms.
The shadow Chancellor's plans also mean that the current shareholders in the water companies may not take all their shares behind them, because the Labour government can carry out 'debt' with the reasoning of the actions considered to be a breach.
He also confirmed plans to place employees on company boards and to create the Property Integrating Fund to pass to employees 10 percent of the capital of private sector firms, which means a paid dividend per year up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy shows in "60 minutes", if the FBI's investigation on Kavanaugh could change their mind
The FBI's investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his appointment in the High Court for at least a week, and raises questions as to whether the findings of the investigation bureau may affect a republican senator to draw his support.
In an interview that will be broadcast Sunday, the correspondent of the 60-minute show, Scott Pelley, asked Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could discover something that would make them change their mind.
Kennedy appeared more open than his college in South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said that when I was in the hearing session, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I got it on the phone after this happened, so after the claims came out and I said, "Have you done this?"
He was determined and clear."
However, Graham's vote seems to be cut to the ground.
"I've divided my mind to Brett Kavanaugh and the change would only make a bomb charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And anyone she mentioned couldn't verify it.
She's 36 years old.
I don't see anything going to change."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and did anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will organize the Global Citizen Festival, an annual musical show that contains a large and impressive list of stars that interpret and also have a mission as impressive; to end poverty in the world.
Now, in his seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will meet with thousands of people in the Great Lawn in Central Park who not only enjoy the interpretations of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to be aware of the true purpose of the show, to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is a extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international legal group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to benefit from a free ticket for the exhibition (except when you want to pay a VIP ticket), participants should perform a number of tasks, or "actions" as voluntary work, sending an e-mail to a world leader, making a phone call or any other meaningful way that would help raise awareness about their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizen Festival been when it has been 12 years to achieve its goal?
Does the idea of the reward of people with a free concert work a real way to convince people to seek these interventions, or is it just another case of what is known as "click activation" -- people who feel they're making a real change by signing an online petition or sending a message on Twitter?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has reportedly registered more than 19 million "actions" by its supporters, giving them a push for different purposes.
It is said that these actions have helped to encourage world leaders to declare US$37 billion political commitment, which is said to affect lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group quoted 390 promises and statements as a result of the group's actions, where at least 10 billion dollars have already been distributed or secured as funds.
The group estimates that funds that have so far had a direct impact on some 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the main promises include "The Power of Nutrition", a partnership of investors and implementing agencies based in the United Kingdom, committed to "helping children grow up with their full potential," promising them to give Rwanda 35 million dollars to help end the country's mishap, after receiving more than 4700 "citizens" from Global Citizen activists.
"With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and citizens of the world like you, we can turn social injustice into a memory of last year," the Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition told the group at a concert directly in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after taking 5,000 actions to call on the United Kingdom to improve nutrition for children's mothers, the government declared funding for a project, "The Power of Nutrition", which will affect 5 million women and children in need of food intervention.
In an answer to the most frequently asked questions on their website, where I asked, "What makes you believe that we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen replied: "It will be a long and difficult journey - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But as any high civil right and as the movement against the apartheid before us, we shall go forth: for together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are some of the actors who will play this year's show in New York, which will be presented by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US can use the sea for "blocks" to prevent Russian energy exports - Interior Secretary
"If necessary," Washington may rely on his Navy to prevent Russian energy from spreading across the markets, including the Middle East, has discovered US Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, according to Washington Examiner's quote.
Zinke claims that Russia's involvement in Syria - particularly where it is operating at the invitation of the Syrian legitimate government - is a pretext to explore for new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason why they are in the Middle East is that they want to provide it with energy as they do with Eastern Europe, the southern coast of Europe," he said.
And according to this official, there are ways to deal with this problem.
"The United States has the ability, with our Navy, to ensure that sea routes are open and, if necessary, to block them, so as to ensure that energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke was addressing participants in an activity developed by the Energy Consumer Alliance, a non-profit organization that has personalized itself as "the voice of energy consumers" in the US.
He continued to compare Washington's treatment with Iran's Russia, highlighting that these conditions are practically the same.
"Economic option on Iran and Russia is a little bit of the use and replacement of fuel," he said, as he referred to Russia as "a fraud" with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statements come after the Trump administration has undertaken a mission to increase natural gas exports to Europe, thus replacing Russia, a much more free option for European consumers.
To this end, officials of the Trump administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inadequate" project of the North Stream 2 pipeline, which according to Trump, has turned Berlin into a Moscow's "slave."
Moscow has consistently stated that the $11 billion project of the North Stream 2 pipeline, which is supposed to double the capacity of the existing pipeline to bring it to 110 billion cubic meters, is a clean economic project.
Kremlin argues that the project's fierce opposition from Washington is simply for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the same view that energy cannot be a pressure tool and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose the oven," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. stance has challenged Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to this project.
The main industrial organisation in Germany, the German Industry Federation (BDI), has asked the US to stay away from EU energy policy and from bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a lot of problems when a third state intervenes in our supply of energy," said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industrial Federation (BDI) after a meeting a little while ago between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "seriously think" if he will run for president in 2020, Massachusetts Senator says
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday that he would "seriously think" participation in the race for president after the mid-term election.
During a meeting in the city of Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider the candidacy.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and regulate our destroyed government, and this involves putting a woman on top," she said according to The Hill.
"After November 6th, I will take the candidacy for the president seriously."
Warren struck President Donald Trump during the city's gathering, saying he "is taking the country to the wrong direction.
"I'm terribly worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren is known for her criticism of Trump and his candidate for the High Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a poll Friday, Warren said "of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote."
However, a survey released on Thursday showed that much of Warren's voters themselves do not think it should run in 2020.
Fifty-eighth percent of Massachusetts' "possible" voters said the senator should not run, according to the poll conducted by the Suffolk/Boston Globe University Political Research Centre.
Thirty-two percent supported this candidacy.
The poll showed that former Governor Deval Patrick enjoyed the greatest support for running, where 38 percent supported his possible candidacy and 48 percent opposed this candidacy.
Other high profile democracies that have been discussed to race in 2020 include former president Joe Biden and Senator Vermont Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide in January, 'Associated Press' reported.
Sarah Palin quoted Trak Palin's post-traumatic stress disorder at Donald Trump's meeting
Track Palin, 26 years old, spent a year in Iraq after being called to the military in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and accused of an incident of violence in the family
"What my son is going through, what he's experiencing after he's back, can connect with other families that feel the spread of PTSD and some of the wounds that our soldiers return to," she told participants in a gathering for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest as "the elephant in the room," and said that her son and other veterans of war "come a little changed, hardened, come to think if they get the proper respect of the soldiers and other members of the army, for what they have given the country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with family violence after an assault on a woman, after a report of domestic violence and armed conflict while he was drunk, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Police Department in Wasilla.
18 states, D.C. supports opposition to a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the Colombian District are supporting a legal opposition to a new American policy that rejects the asylum of victims who have saved criminal groups or violence in the family.
Representatives from 18 countries and the circuit filed an interpretative document as a court-martial in Washington on Friday, in support of changes in asylum-seekers' policies, NBC News reports.
The full name of the prosecutor in the Grace v. Session issue that the American Civil Liberties Union has deposited in August against federal politics has not been found.
She said her partner "and his violent gang members," abused her, but US officials denied her request for asylum on July 20th.
She was stopped in Texas.
State lawyers supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala as producing a high number of asylum-seekers in the United States because they are countries that have problems with gangs and family violence.
New asylum-seeking policy in the US, a decision, in 2014, came back from the Board of Emigrant Appeals that allowed undocumented immigrants to save family violence and apply for asylum.
Colombia's District Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "is ignoring all decades of state, federal and international law."
"Federal laws require all asylum requirements to be judged according to the particular facts and circumstances of the case, and such a measure is contrary to this principle," the court-martial report stated.
The lawyers further argued in the report that the police's ban on the entry of immigrants damaged the American economy, expressing that their livelihoods are to become entrepreneurs and "furnish the necessary labour force."
The Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered the judges of immigration in June to stop giving asylum to victims of family violence and gang violence.
"Assisi is available to those who leave their country because of fear or persecution based on race, religious belief, nationality or relevance to a certain group of social or political beliefs," the Session said on June 11th, on the day of the political declaration.
Asylum has never been meant to ease all the problems -- even all the serious problems -- with which people are facing every day throughout the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as the balance of death doubled in a race for survival
To the survivors, the situation was very honorable.
"The situation feels quite tense," said 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, while keeping her little and sick son in an evacuation centre in the devastated city of Palau.
"The envelope brings the bodies every minute.
There's no clean water anymore."
And the inhabitants saw that they were returned to their ruined houses, and that they had brought forth their eminence into the water, in order that they might save all that they could find.
Hundreds of people have been injured, and hospitals damaged by an earthquake of 7.5 members, are overcrowded.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Harris, who has broken his hip and shoulder, were placed at the Military Hospital outside of Palusa, where patients are being treated in the external environment because of the still ongoing earthquakes of the earth.
His eyes were filled with tears as he reminisced when he felt the violent earthquake in the hotel room on the fifth floor that he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save yourself.
I think I was pushed under the ruins of the wall," Harris told 'Associated Press', adding that his family had come to the city for a wedding.
"I heard the woman was crying and asking for help, but then quietly.
I don't know what happened to him and my kid.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador Accused China for 'gacmim' with 'propagandistic advertising'
A week after an official newspaper in China posted a four-page advertisement in a daily U.S. commercial advertising campaign, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread its propaganda.
US President Donald Trump, last Wednesday, referred to the supplement paying for 'China Daily' in 'Des Moines Register' - the most sold newspaper in the state of Iowa - after accusing China of attempting to intervene in the US Congress elections held on 6 November, a charge denied by China.
Tromp's allegations that Beijing was trying to interfere in US elections marked what US officials said Reuters was a new phase in Washington's advanced campaign to increase China's pressure.
While it is normal for foreign governments to set up advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently embedded in a growing trade war that has seen the level of prices on each other's imports.
Chinese and American experts have said China's redemption rates in this trade war were set to hit exporters in states like Ioua, who have supported the Trump Republican party.
Terry Branstad, US ambassador to China and former governor for a long time in Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing has hit US workers, farmers and businesses.
In an opinion published in 'Des Moines Register' Sunday, Branstad wrote that, "China is already redoubled by putting propaganda advertisements on our free press."
"By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is being helped by the happy American tradition of the free word and the free press by setting up a paid advertisement in Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In contrast to this, in the newspapers' kiosks on the road here in Beijing, you will find very few votes against and you will not see any real reflection of the different thoughts that Chinese might have on China's worrying economic tractor, because the media is under the strong control of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most prominent newspapers in China, he avoided offering to publish his article," even though he did not say which newspaper it was.
Analysts warn that Republicans are changing voters before elections in the middle of the post-Kavanaugh scandal mandate
The more the main characters of Republicans to solidarity and protect the candidate for the High Court, Brett Kavanaugh, in front of some sexual assault claims, analysts have warned that they will face a severe reaction, especially by women, in future elections in the middle of the mandate.
Emotions on this topic have been very high, and many Republicans have publicly declared that they want to continue to vote on the candidate.
These things can't be gone," Grant Reeher, professor of political science at the University of Siracusa 'Skolla Maksuell said 'The Hill' for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts the last minute of Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s effort to investigate by the FBI and that this would be enough to calm the angry voters.
"Grades won't forget what happened yesterday -- they won't forget it either tomorrow or in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior and national adviser to the progressist group 'MoveOn', according to Washington D.C.
On Friday morning, protestors sang 'Nentor is coming!' while demonstrating in the Senate corridors while Republicans who have control of the Judicial Committee decided to proceed with the candidacy of Kavanaugh, despite witness from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, reported 'Mic'.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will reach the top," news page Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst said.
"People are saying that they have already been at high levels; this is true.
But it may be even higher, especially among unspecified voters women in the area and among young voters, from 18 to 29 years old, who, although they do not like the president, usually do not vote at all."
Even before Ford's public testimony detailing her allegations of sexual assault against the High Court candidate, analysts suggested that there would be a severe reaction if Republicans continued to support this candidacy.
"It has turned into a horrific mess for the GOP," said Michael Steele, former head of the National Committee of Republicans, at the beginning of last week, according to the NBC News.
"There is not only the committee's vote or the final vote, or if Kavanaugh is to be decided or not in the accused's bank, it also has to do with the way the Republicans have dealt with this issue and with the way they have treated that woman," NBC News, Guy Cecil, U.S. Priorities Director, said, a group that assists in the election of the Democrats.
However, Americans seem to be somewhat divided by those who believe in the wake of Ford's and Kavanaugh's testimony, with the latter having a slightly higher support.
A recent survey by 'YouGov' shows that 41 per cent of respondents believe in ford's testimony in doubt or with a lot of possibility, while 35 per cent say they believe in doubt or with a lot of possibility Kavanaugh.
Also, 38 per cent believe that Kavanaugh has probably lied during his testimony, while only 30 per cent say the same about Ford.
After Flake's insistence, the FBI is currently investigating claims submitted by Ford as well as by the other accused, Deborah Ramirez, reports ‘The Guardian’.
Last week, Ford testified before the Senate's Judicial Committee, under oath, that Kavanaugh attacked him at the age of 17 while he was drunk.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the High Court, presented his genital organs before her while they were at a party during the time they studied in Yale, 80's.
World Wide Web Creator plans to start a new internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of the World Wide Web, is creating a company that aims to rival Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, 'Inrupt', is a company built by Berners-Lee's open-source platform called 'Solid'.
"Solid" allows users to choose where their data is stored and who are allowed to have access to a specific information.
In an exclusive interview for 'Fast Company,' Berners-Lee said with a joke that the purpose behind 'Inrupt' is "world domination."
"We need to do it now," he said about this innovation company.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to allow people to create "protection of their personal data on the network" or a POD.
It can contain lists of contacts, lists of things to do, musical lists, and other personal and professional tools.
It's the same as having available on a browser and at the same time Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify.
What is unique for storing personal data on the network is the fact that it remains entirely in the user's hands of what kind of information will be accessed.
The company calls this "personal power through data."
The idea of Inrupt, according to the executive director of the company, John Bruce, is to bring together the necessary resources, processes and capabilities to help Solid be available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some contracted developers to work on this project, and a voluntary coding community.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their decentralised applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team aren't talking to "Facebook and Google if they have to present or not a total change where all their business models overflow completely during the night.
"We're not asking for their permission."
In a "Medium" post published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that the Inrupt mission "is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps to protect the integrity and quality of the new network built in Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Network Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Over the past few months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on network impartiality.
While Inrupt is founded, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Network Consortium, the Network Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am very optimistic about this new era of the network," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: The celebration of the Victorian Cross during the First World War for the clergy
The only clergyman who won a Victorian Crusade during World War I in the qualities of the warrior has been remembered at his birth, 100 years later.
Under Colonel Bernard Vann won the medal on September 29, 1918, in an attack in Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never learned that he had won the highest British military title.
A memorial stone was presented by his two grandchildren in a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of the grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "extremely symbolic" that the reminder would appear exactly 100 years from the heroic act that gave his grandfather the medal.
According to 'London Gazette', on September 29, 1918, Nincoloneli Vann, headed his battalion through the Saint-Quentin channel "through a huge fog and under the bulk of bullets from the fields and machine guns."
He then rushed to the line of fire and with a "great sword" headed the battalion forward and captured one of the weapons in the field and only killed three of them from the opposing forces.
Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 — a little more than a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions "are something he can never achieve but something that really shows modesty."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, were appointed by a choir behind the parade, which was headed by the Brentwood Imperial Youth group.
Michael Vann said he was "very honored that he was part of this parade" and added that "the value of a real hero is being shown by the support that is being given by many people."
MMA fans stayed up all night awake to follow Bellator 206, but instead they saw "Derkucen Pepa"
Imagine, you've been up all night awake to see Bellator 206, and then you're taking off the opportunity to see this major event.
The show by San Jose contained 13 matches, including six matches on the base package and would be displayed in real time during the night at channel 5, at MB.
At 6 a.m., as Gegard Moussa and Rory MacDonald were preparing to fight each other, the viewers in Britain were amazed when the broadcast changed to show Derrkucen Pepa.
Some remained unhappy after staying awake all night until the first hours, especially for this fight.
A fan on Twitter described this passage from the match in a visual film for children as "a bad joke."
"It is the government's rules that determine that at 6 o'clock that content was not suitable for and we should move to a children's programme," said Dave Schwartz, the vice-president of marketing and communication in Bellator, when asked for transmission.
"Pepa Drerkukija," after.
Bellator's president, Scott Coker, said they will work on programming to include visitors from Britain in the future.
"When I think about the retransmission, I think we can solve it," Coker said.
"But there's six o'clock in the morning, Sunday and we won't be able to solve this problem until Sunday with our hour, so Monday with their hour.
But we're working on it.
Trust me, when the program changed, there were many messages that were circulating and none of them were friendly.
We were trying to fix it because we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was a government problem.
I promise you there won't be another time.
We'll do the show with 5 matches instead of six -- as we usually do -- we're trying to give ourselves more for fans and maybe we're overrun.
It's a miserable situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt 'inferior' about his sexuality
The Olympic publisher, Tom Daley, says he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality - but this gave him motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn't understand until he went to school for nine years that "not all were like me."
Speaking of the first programme on Radio 4 of the 'Desert Island Discs' presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he raised the voice for homosexual rights to give "hope" to others.
He also said that after becoming a parent, he thought less about winning Olympic medals.
The permanent chairman of the long-term program, Kirsty Young, has taken a few months off because he is ill.
Showing himself as an outstanding person in the first Laverne program, Daley said that as he grew up, he felt "inferior" to others because "it was not acceptable on the social side to like boys and girls."
He said, "To this day, those feelings of inferiority, and the fact that I felt differently, have been the real elements that gave me the strength and strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove he was worth "something," he said, so that he wouldn't disappoint everyone when they heard about his sexual orientation.
Twice the winner of the bronze Olympic medal is already a high profile LGBT activist and used his participation in the Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to legitimize homosexuality.
He said he came out because he felt lucky that he was able to live openly and without consequences and that he wanted to give others "hope."
Three times the world's champion said the fall in love with a man -- the American film producer Dustin Lance Black, who met in 2013 -- "has caught me unprepared."
Last year, Daley married Oscar's prize winner, who is 20 years older than him, but said the age difference was never a problem.
"When he experiences so many things in such a new age," he went to the first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later -- he said it was hard to find someone at the same age that he had experienced the same low-resurrection.
The couple became parents in June, a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said his "all prospects" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, all I thought was 'I should win a gold medal'," he said.
"You know what, there are more important things than the Olympic gold medals.
My gold Olympic medal is Robbie."
His son bears the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011, at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with head cancer.
Daley said his father didn't admit he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked was if we had ready tickets for London in 2012 - because he wanted to be on the first line.
"I couldn't tell 'you couldn't be in the first row of Dad," he said.
"I held my hand while he was still breathing and only after the rest took his breath and changed his life I accepted for the first time that he was not immortal," he said.
Next year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympic Games and won the bronze medal.
"I knew this was the one I had dreamed of all my life--to dive in front of the local audience in the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired his first musical selection -- Proud by Heather Small -- which accompanied him during the Olympic Games preparations and continues to cause the Navy.
Desert Island Discs is given at BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15, British hour.
Mikkelson, out of shape, left at the table on Saturday at Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson will set a record Sunday when he plays his 47th match at Ryder Cup, but he will have to change his form so that he doesn't turn this historic moment into disappointment.
Mikkelson, for which it is the 12th time that participates in this event, a more self-record, organized every two years, was left on the table by Captain Jim Fury during the two games (fourballs and foursomes).
Instead of being in the middle of the action, as has usually been the case for the United States, the winner of the big titles five times spent the day supporting the team and working with hope that he will leave behind the concerns.
Not among the right-wing players even when he was at the top of his career, the 48-year-old is not a suitable player for the complex Le Golf National field, where the long and difficult fields do not leave room for wrong shootings.
And if it wasn't just the fear of the field, Mikkelson, on Sunday, at the ninth match, will face the British Open champion, Francesco Molinari, who has formed a team with beginner Tommy Fleetwood to win their four matches this week.
If Americans, who have four points less than, before the beginning of the 12 tic matches, are going to start very quickly, Mikkelson's game can be decisive.
Fury expressed confidence in his player, although he cannot say more than that.
"He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a stabbing, threw my hand into my neck and told me it would be almost tomorrow," Fury said.
"He has a lot of faith in himself.
He's in the Fame Hall and he's made a lot of contributions to these teams last week, and this week.
I probably didn't think he'd play two matches.
I had thought more, but eventually it turned out that way, and so we thought it was the solution.
He wants to be in the field, like anyone else."
Sunday, Mikkelson will pass Nick Faldo's record for the player with more performances at Ryder Cup matches.
He can mark the end of his career at Ryder Cup, where he has not been at the height of his individual performances.
Mikkelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven equations, even though Fury said his presence brings value to the team.
"He's gastro-sarcastic, hot, he likes to harass people, and he's a fantastic boy to have in the team room," he explained.
"So, I think the younger players were having fun dealing with him this week, and that was nice to see.
He gives more than just a game."
Europe's Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the Great Leader can soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, Europe's captain, knows from experience that the considerable leadership ahead of the last day of the tech games at Ryder Cup can be turned into an unpleasant factor.
Danesi made his debut in front of 1997 in Valderrama, where the team with Captain Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead against the Americans closed the tournament by winning a very narrow difference, 141 1⁄2-131 1⁄2.
"It reminds ourselves that we had a great lead in Valderrama; we had a great lead in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderrama where we won but with a lot of difficulty," Bjorn, who was photographed after having won 5-3 in 'Class 2018' on Friday and yesterday to lead 10-6 in 'Le Golf National'.
So history tells me and everyone on that team that it's not over.
Tomorrow we'll go with the last march.
We'll go there and do the right thing.
Nothing's finished until we get the points on the table.
We have a goal, try to win this trophy, and here's our focus.
I've said it all the time, I'm focused on the 12 players we've got on the team, but we're aware of who we've got the best players in the world."
Satisfied with the ranking of his players, in a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I don't want to rush this stage.
Tomorrow we will face another 'obedient'.
Tomorrow we see individual performances, and that's something else to do.
It's fantastic when you're in the field with a partner, when things go well, but when you're alone, then you try your full capacity as a golfer.
This is a message you must follow to the players, tomorrow you must give the best of yourself.
Now, forget your partner after and he has to go and give the best of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, opponent Jim Fury would expect his players to perform better individually than with partners, where only Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, alone, would take three out of four possible points.
Fury himself has experienced two cases of major return of the result on the last day, being part of the winning team in Brooklyn before losing out on what is considered "the Miracle in Medina" of the team of Europe.
"Remember every word," when asked how he had motivated his players during the last day, Captain Ben Crenshaw, in 1999.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but we must have a good start, as you saw in Brooklyn and Medina.
When you take the lead in one arm, you put a lot of pressure on the middle of the game.
We set up the training based on this and we're going to get the boys out of the order we believe is better, because you know, we're trying to realize a miracle tomorrow."
Thomas has the task of starting the defeat of the result and will face Rory McIlroy at the main match, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter with European players in the first half of the ranking
"I have chosen this group and in this order I believe that it covers all the road in the match," Bjorn said about his teke elections.
Re-forced production of the new German war
The new German navy ice should have been sent in 2014 to replace Cold War War Wars, but it will not be ready until at least another year due to problem systems and high costs, local media have reported.
"Reinland-Pfalz," the main new freighter 'Baden-Wuerttemberg-class', has been moved to the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper 'Dei Zeit' quoted by a military speaker.
The ship had to join Marine in 2014, but problems after the shipment damaged the fate of the ambitious project.
Four 'Baden-Wuerttemberg-class' ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will serve as substitutes for the old 'Bremen-class' rails.
As it is known, it will contain a powerful ball, a series of anti-aircraft and anti-aircraft missiles and technology against detection, such as reduction of detection from radar, red and red and acoustic waves.
Some of the other important features include longer maintenance periods - it must be possible that new frigates can be moved for more than two years away from the country's ports.
However, continuous delays mean that recent technological struggles - which are said to enable Germany to reflect power abroad - will be obsolete at the time they enter the service, says 'Die Zeit'.
F125 frigate came out on pages last year, when the German Navy officially refused to order this ship and returned it to the Bluhm & Voss maritime office in Hamburg.
This was the first time that Marina returned a ship to her builder after delivery.
There was little information on the reasons for the return, but the media in Germany quoted as a series of "great software and hardware defects" that made the ship useless during a war mission.
The programming problems were particularly important in the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships because they will be operated by a team of 120 sailors - as half the working force of the old ‘Bremen Class’ frigates.
It was also discovered that the ship was too overboard, reducing its efficiency and limiting the Marine’s ability to improve in the future.
"Reineland-Pfalz" of 7,000 tons is believed to be the double weight of similar category ships used by Germans in World War II.
Apart from the physical parts of problems, the whole project -- including team training -- is also becoming a problem.
It is said that it has arrived in a figure to leave without a word of €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) - of €2.2 billion originally predicted.
The problems encountered by the new frigates become particularly important after the latest warnings that the power of the German navy is being reduced.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, admitted that Marines are "end of suitable ships to move to another country."
The official said that the problem had been added over time because the old ships had been removed from use but had not been replaced with new ones.
He said sadly that none of Baden-Wuerttemberg-class's new frigates would be able to join the Navy.
The National Trust Watches the Secret Life of Night’s Larks
A new research carried out by a company in the mountainous areas of Scotland is aimed at discovering how night-stars use land to hunt for food.
New findings are expected to shed new light on the conduct of single flying guitars and help protect activities in the future.
A study by scientists in the National Trust for Scotland will follow the usual nightly larks and those called soprano pipistrelles as well as the long-haired coffee and larks Daubenton in the Inverewe gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment will be placed at key points throughout the area to track nightly activities throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct field studies using hand detectors.
The analysis of the sounds that experts will perform for all recordings will determine the frequency of the night’s scarcity sounds and what each species does.
Then a report and a map of their habitat will be prepared to give a detailed overview of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, the NTS Nature Protection Adviser, hopes that the conclusions will show which habitats are most important to the night skyscrapers and how they are used by each species.
This information would help to determine the property of the local administration, such as the creation of crops and how to maintain the forests for the night skyscrapers and for other species related to them.
The number of nightmares in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom has dropped significantly over the past century.
They are under threat of construction and developmental activities that have an impact on the population and the loss of habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, such as adhesives or chemical components of building materials, as well as domestic animal attacks.
Indeed the night’s darkness is not blind.
However, because of their search habits during the night, their ears are more beneficial than their eyes when it comes to catching the waiter.
They use a sophisticated technique to locate the location through the sounds to accurately determine the insects and obstacles during flight.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, is taken very seriously with nightly larks.
There are ten trained experts who conduct regular studies, speech inspections, and sometimes include in rescue programs.
The organization has even set up the first and only reserve in Scotland dedicated to night-curves in Threa, Dumfries and Galloway, which serves as home for eight out of ten species of night-curves in Scotland.
This reserve administrator, David Thompson, says this country is an ideal territory for them.
"Here in Thraeve we have a great area for the nightmares of the night," he said.
"We have old buildings, many old trees and all the right habitat.
But there are still many things about the dark of the night that remain unknown to the work we do here and in other countries will help us to understand more than they need to be 'develied'."
He emphasises the importance of carrying out checks on hunger at night before carrying out property maintenance work because there is a possibility that the peaceful destruction of a speech can kill up to 400 women and young people at night, thus destroying the entire population of an area.
The nightmares of the night are protected and murder, their harassment and concern, or the destruction of their speech is illegal.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish employee near the Trust for the Conservation of Night’s Lakes, encourages people to become part of the relief team.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our nightmares at night, and for many of our species, we just don't know how their people are moving."
Ronaldo denies charges of rape while lawyers prepare to indict the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo said the charges of rape against him are "false news," saying people "want to promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyers are determined to indict the German news magazine "Der Spiegel", which published these accusations.
Portugal and Juventus attacker has been accused of rape by an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
On Friday, Der Spiegel reported that he was later claimed to have paid that $375 000 to prevent him from talking about the incident.
Speaking in a live video on Instagram, addressed 142 million of his followers, just a few hours after the publication of these claims, Ronaldo, 33, considered reports as "false news."
"No, no, no, no, no.
What he said today, false news," the gold ball winner said in front of the camera five times.
"They want to promote themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but this is part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything's going well," the player added smiling.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to indict "Der Spiegel" for these accusations, which they have called "unacceptable reports of suspicions about private life,".
Advocate Christian Schertz said the player will seek compensation for "the moral damage that corresponds to the seriousness of the breach, which is perhaps one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident is said to have occurred in June 2009, at a Palms Hotel and Casino site in Las Vegas.
According to the documents presented at the Clark Network Court in Nevada, after meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga are said to have gone to the player's room, where he is alleged to have raped him in anus.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell asleep after the alleged incident and said "99 per cent" he is a "good son" left in the mud by "one per cent."
The document says Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had committed sexual intercourse but that it was with the consent of both sides.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that she had photos of her injuries in a hospital, but later agreed on a solution outside the court because she was "barred by revenge" and that she was concerned that she would "suffer publicly."
The 34-year-old says he is now trying to reverse the deal because it continues to be traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was near the union with Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer he passed to the Italian youth giants in a 100m-euro deal.
Brexit: United Kingdom will "repent forever" for losing the status of car manufacturers
The United Kingdom "will repent forever" if it loses the status of world leaders in the production of cars after Brexit," Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "disturbing" Toyota in the United Kingdom had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without an agreement, the company would temporarily stop production at its factory in Burnaston near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of delays on the border, in the event of an agreement-free exit, would cost the loss of jobs.
The factory in Burnston, which produces Toyota Auris and Avensis models, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to other countries of the European Union.
"In my judgment, if Britain comes out of the EU at the end of March, we will stop production in our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's administrative director in Burnaston.
Other car manufacturers in MB, such as Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also expressed fear of leaving the EU without agreement and of how cross-border trade will work.
For example, BMW said after Brexit would close its Mini series factory for a month.
The main concerns relate to what car manufacturers refer to as the risk of the supply chain in the case of a Brexit without agreement.
Toyota's production line works on the basis of "just as soon as ordered," with parts coming every 37 minutes from US and EU suppliers, for ordered cars.
If, on 29 March, MB leaves the EU without an agreement, there may be delays within which this industry may lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep the inventory in her factory in Derbyshire more than one day, the company said, and to produce it would stop.
Mr. Clark said Theresa May's "Checkers" plan for future relations with the EU "has been specially built to avoid these border controls."
"We need an agreement. We want to have the best agreement that will allow us not only to enjoy the success of the moment to also take advantage of this possibility," he said for the Today program at BBC Radio 4.
"The data, not only from Toyota, but also from other producers, shows that we must certainly be able to continue what has been a very successful supply chain."
Toyota could not determine how long the production would be stopped, but in the long term, he warned that the increased costs would lower the factory's competitiveness and consequently lead to the reduction of jobs.
Peter Tsouvalaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and who is the senior official of the United Union trade union in the factory, said that members are becoming increasingly concerned: "According to my experience at the time these jobs are closed, they are no longer returning.
A government spokesman said, "We have set up a precise and reliable plan for our relationship with the future EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein can be pushed again, says the White House
Donald Trump's high-level meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could "be added for a week" after continuing to fight for High Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russia's election interventions, the links between Trump and Russia's assistant staff and the possibility that the president has obstructed justice.
The debate whether Trump will discharge the general procurator-general's duties, thus endangering Mueller's independence, is something that has been created for months in Washington.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein took into consideration the setting up of an audience to record talks with Trump and the possibility of downloading the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein rejected this news.
But last Monday, he went to the White House, among the reports that he was near the surrender.
On Thursday, a meeting with Trump was announced, which was held in the headquarters of the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he "would prefer" not to leave Rosenstein, but then the meeting was moved to avoid a clash with the hearing held by the Senate's judicial committee, where Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford testified, one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation into Kavanaugh's claims, further pushing the full vote in the Senate.
The Trump press secretary, Sarah Sanders, was present today at Fox News Sunday.
When they asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said, "It's not yet a date, it could be this week. I think it could be another week considering anything else that's going on with the High Court.
But let's see, and I always like keeping the press up-to-date."
Some journalists may object to this statement: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since 10 September.
Moderator Chris Wallace raised the question why.
Sanders said the lack of press conferences did not result from the dissatisfaction with the position of TV journalists, even though she said, "I will not deny the fact that they draw attention."
Later, she let it be understood that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
"The President holds a more quality assurance session than any other president before him," she said, adding, without quoting the data: "We have seen these figures."
There will continue to be a press conference, Sanders said, but "if the press is able to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, then it's much better than talking to me.
We're trying to do this often and you've seen that we've done it often over the last few weeks, replacing press conferences in cases where you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump regularly accepts questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in open sessions or at a press conference with important personalities.
Individual press conferences are rare.
The president may have shown the reason for this fact, this week, in New York, where he made a controversial statement and in some strange cases, in front of journalists.
Health Secretary writes to EU workers in NHS Scotland about fear over Brexit
The Secretary of Health has written staff from the EU working in NHS in Scotland to express gratitude for the country's name and the desire to remain behind Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, the Scottish parliament's MP, has sent a letter, when there are less than six months left from the EU's MB removal.
The Scottish government has already taken over the cost of applying for the status of permanent residence for EU citizens working in public services at local level.
In her letter, Mrs. Freeman wrote: "During the summer, the negotiations for the removal of the MB from the EU have continued, drawing near to a decision in autumn.
But the U.S. government has also intensified its preparations in the case of an unagreed scenario.
I know this is a very disturbing time for all of you.
That is why I wanted to stress how much I appreciate the contribution of each member of the staff, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that grow and improve the health service, increasing the benefits of the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we want you to stay here."
Christian Abercrombie undergoes an emergency surgical intervention after head injury
Tennessee's opponent State Tigers Christian Abercrombie was subjected to an immediate surgical intervention after a severe head injury on Saturday, in the 31-27 loss against Vanderbilt Commodores, reported The Tennessee journalist Mike Organ.
Tennessee State Rod Reed's coach told reporters that the damage happened just before the first part.
"He came to the sidewalk and fell there," said Reed.
Trainers and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen on the side line before they put it in the bar and sent it for further examinations.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville that Abercrombie had completed surgery at the Vanderbilt Hospital Centre.
Harris added that "there are still no details on the type/scale of damage" and Tennessee State is trying to understand when the damage occurred.
Abercrombie, a second year student, is in his first season with Tennessee State after he was transferred from Illinois.
He made five interventions on Saturday before leaving the game, bringing the total number of interventions during the season to 18.
Foreign browsers will pay the highest bill when they buy a property in MB
Foreign national browsers will pay the highest bill for purchasing a property in MB and additional money will be used to help clean according to the new Conservative Party's (Tory) plans
This move will neutralize Corby's initiative's success to attract new voters
The bill's tax will apply to those who don't pay taxes in MB
The treasure department expects to gather up to GBP 120m a year to help clean people
Theresa May will announce today that foreign buyers will pay the highest bill for purchasing a property in MB and additional money will be used to help the homeless.
This move will be seen as an effort to neutralize Jeremy Corby's initiative's success to attract new voters with promises to offer more affordable shelter and to "slip" high-income people.
The bill will apply to individuals and firms who do not pay taxes in MB, while additional money will support the government's initiative to combat the lack of shelter.
This extra rate -- which adds the current tax of the bill, including the increase of the tattoo scale presented two years ago for the second houses and for the properties purchased for rent -- can go up to three per cent.
The Thesar Department predicts that this movement will collect up to GBP 120m a year.
About 13 per cent of the last-built properties in London are purchased by non-US residents, which causes price increases and makes it harder to find shelter from buyers for the first time.
Many rich areas of the country - especially in the capitals - have returned to "phantom cities" because of the high number of foreign buyers spending most of their time abroad.
This new policy comes only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a tax reduction to help young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction firms of holding high prices by buying land but not using it, and called on Ms. May to give up quotas for facing houses, in order to regulate the "british turf with property."
Mr. Corbyn has proposed some attractive reforms for shelter, including rental control and removal of "without reason".
He also wants to give more advice on building new homes.
Ms. May said: "Last year I declared that I would dedicate the mandate of the prime minister of the British dream return -- that is, for a better life for every new generation.
And that means fixing the problem market of homes.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is not right for individuals who do not live in the United States and foreign societies to buy homes more easily than British workers.
For many people, the dream of owning a house has made it too difficult to achieve and the injustice of the homeless is more than real."
Jack Ross: 'My biggest ambition is to train Scotland'
Sunderland Coach Jack Ross says his "greatest ambition" is to become Scotland's coach at a certain stage.
Scottish, 42, is enjoying the challenge of raising the North-East Club, which is currently positioned in the third place in League One (third category), three points away from the head.
He came this summer at the Light Stadium after returning St. Mirren to the Prime Minister of the Scottish League last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I was once introduced to representative B and only that," Ross told BBC Scotland Sportsound.
"But as a child I grew up seeing Scotland many times in Hampden with my father, and it's something that's always attracted me.
However, this possibility will only come if I am successful in the management of clubs."
Ross' predecessors to Sunderland include Dick Lawyers, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former coach of Alloa Athletic says he is not concerned that he is following the steps of these great names in such a big club, since he previously refused Barnsley and Ipswich Town bids.
"For now, my success will depend on the fact that 'can I return this team to Prime Minister League?'
Taking into account the structure and environment of this club, there is no doubt that it has the place in the Premier League," he said.
"It's not a simple task to go there, but I'd see myself as successful only if I could get the club back to the League."
Ross is only three years old who started his career as a coach after a period as a coach in Dumbarton and a 15-month period in the hearts staff.
He later helped Alloa to add a higher category to the third round of the Cup, as well as transform St. Mirren from a club near the fall from the category to the winners of the Championship title next season.
And now, Ross says he feels better than he's ever felt during his career as a player in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academy.
"Perhaps it was really a turning point," he says, for taking the direction of Alloa.
"I really believed that training was the right thing for me, more than being a player.
It seemed strange because I played well, made a good life because of this profession, and enjoyed some good accomplishments.
But being a player can be difficult.
You have to experience a lot of things every week.
Seriously, I experience a lot of stress and pressure from work, but training seems to be the right job.
I've always wanted to train and now I've been doing something like this, and I've never been as good as I've been to myself all my life as grown up."
Full interview can be heard on Sunday, in Sportssound, 30 September, in Radio Scotland from 12:00 till 13:00 BST
According to one study, the perfect time for drinking beer is Saturday at 5:30 p.m.
The summer heat wave has increased local income in difficult situations in Britain, but has increased pressure on restaurant chains.
The data show that sales in the local and bar groups increased by 2.7 per cent in July — but purchases in restaurants fell by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin, a business consultant in the CGA, who buried the data, said: "The constant heat of the sun as well as England's participation in the World Cup longer than expected affected the currque to follow the same trend as the mine, where local sales increased by 2.8 per cent, while restaurants recorded even higher falls.
The shift in the restaurant fell by 1.8% in June, and worsened further in July.
Bars and main activities offering drinks recorded the best performance, with higher growth than reducing trade in restaurants.
Locations with main activities offering food also recognized the fall as a result of the sun’s weather, although not as noticeable as restaurants.
Looks like people just want to go out for a drink.
The sales of drinks in bars and locals increased by 6.6 percent that month, while food dropped by three percent."
Paul Newman, a leisure and hospitality analyst at RSM, said: "These results confirm the trend we have seen since the end of April.
When it comes to sales in the retail market, the weather and the impact of important social or sports events remain the main factors.
It is no wonder that restaurant groups continue to face difficulties, although a 4.8 percent drop in sales per year will have a particularly heavy burden considering the constant cost pressure.
The long and hot summer could not come at a more difficult time for food operators, and the time would indicate whether the most average temperatures in August would provide the desired calm."
Total sales growth in local and restaurants, including the newly opened ones, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting slowdown in the launch of markets.
The Coffer Peach Index for the industry sales tracking, for the bar and restaurant sector in MB, collects and analyzes data from 47 companies, with a total turnover of more than 9 billion GBP, and is the industry reference point.
One in five children has a secret account in the social media that they hide from their parents
According to one study, one in five children — some not over 11 years of age — has hidden accounts in the social media that they hide to parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 nine-year-old education students showed an increase in "false Insta" profiles
This news has raised the fear of sexual content posts
Twenty per cent of students said they have a "core" account to show their parents
One in five children — some of whom are not over 11 years of age — is opening the social media account, which is used secretly by adults.
A survey of 20,000 students in nine years of education showed a rapid increase in "false Insta" profiles - related to the photo distribution page, Instagram.
This news has raised the fear of sexual content posts.
Twenty per cent of students said they use a clean "core" account to show their parents, but they also have a private account.
A mother, who accidentally discovered her 13-year-old daughter's hidden account, discovered that a teenager urged others "to rape her."
The study of the UK Digital Awareness and the Directors' Conference ("Headmasters and Headmasters" Conference - HMC) of independent schools revealed that 40 per cent of the 11 to 18-year-old group had two profiles, and half of them admitted that they had hidden accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said, "It's disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create social spaces where parents and teachers can't find them."
Elid Doyle will be the "sing of athletes" on the board of the Athletics in Scotland
Elid Doyle has been elected on the board of Athletics in Scotland, at the post of executive director of this governing body, during the annual meeting of the general assembly.
Doyle is the most decorated Scottish athletes of race and field, and President Ian Beattie described this decision as a great opportunity for all sports leaders to benefit from its extensive international experience over the past decade.
"Eilid enjoys massive respect in the athletic community in Scotland, MB and in the world, and we are sure that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly by doing that part of the board," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I'm excited to serve as an athlete's voice and I hope I will contribute and help in the direction of sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200-metre race and 400-metre race in 1996’s Games, in Atlanta, with four gold Olympic medals in total and who is a regular expert at BBC, lost his ability to walk after a temporary ischemic strike.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago, I suffered a stroke.
I can't walk.
The doctors said that only time would tell me if I was going to be cured and to what extent.
It took a challenging job, but I was able to recover completely, I learned to walk again, and today I am doing terrible exercises!
Thank you for your encouraging messages."
A goat pump advertisement comparing mothers to cows shares public opinion
A society for the production of giraffe pumps has divided public opinion with an advertisement that compares mothers to cattle farmers.
To begin the promotion of what is considered "the first ring pump in the world without noise and which can be dressed," consumer technology products society Elvie showed a gastro-music video to advertise the freedom that this new pump gives to mothers who need to express themselves freely.
Four true mothers dance in a stable of cows filled with bar under the sounds of a song with text like this: "Yes, I'm sorry, but I don't have a fool" and "If you hadn't noticed, these are not like, it's my breast."
Refrene goes on, "Pompome, Pomp, I'm feeding babies, Pomp, Pomp, Pomp, Mistresses."
However, advertising, which has been published on the company's Facebook page, has led to online debates.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received friendly reactions from the viewers, with many of them expressing that it is undervalued by the "warms" of the milk industry.
"The use of cows to advertise this product is a very weak decision.
Just like us, they must remain "born" and "born" to produce milk, only their "children" are taken from them a few days after they were born," said someone.
Elvie Island Pump is placed inside recipes and does not fall into sight (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment: "Alright traumatic for mother and child.
Why don't we use it to advertise a giraffe pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Someone else added, "What kind of unsensitivable advertising."
Others supported the ad, including a woman who admitted that the song seemed "for fun."
"I think this is a brilliant idea.
I'd have bought one if you'd still feed the baby with yellow.
The pump made me feel just like a cow.
Advertising is a little crazy, but I saw what it means.
This is a brilliant product," someone wrote.
Another comment: "This is a gas commercial addressed to mothers who use the pump (often in the workplace or in the toilet) and feel like "lopa."
This is not a advertising that values or judges the milk industry."
At the end of the video, the women's group shows that they all danced with the "white" pump placed in the recipe.
The concept behind this campaign is based on the data that many women who use giraffe pumps say they feel cows.
However, the Elvie pump is soundless, has no thread or tube, is placed inside the recipes and does not fall into the eye, giving women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even get out while they use it.
Ana Balarin, partners and ECD at Mother's Creative Executive commented: "The Elvis pump is a revolutionary product that deserved a bold and provocative promotion.
By making a parallel between women who want to express themselves freely and milk cows, we wanted to highlight the use of the giraffe pump and the challenges they face, also showing in a fun and similar way the extraordinary feeling of freedom that gives the new pump.
This is not the first time that the Elvie pump comes out on the first page.
During the fashion week in London, a mother of two children appeared in the stylistic landscape of Marta Jakobowski using the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children have been quietly moved to a tent camp on the coast of Texas
The number of prohibited migrant children has increased even though the monthly number of border crossings has remained relatively the same, partly as the result of rhetoric and rigorous policies presented by the Trump administration that have made it difficult to send children to their supporters.
Usually, most supporters have also been self - undocumented immigrants, and they have been afraid to risk their position in the country by trying to apply for a child.
The risk was increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential supporters and other adult members of the same family would have to give fingerprints, and these data would also pass on to the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior officer of the Emigration and the Dogan Agency, testified before the Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied to support the undeclared myth.
Later, the agency confirmed that 70 per cent of the arrested had no previous criminal precedent.
"About 80 per cent of the individuals who are supporters or members of the supporters' family remain in the country illegally and a large part of them are foreigners with criminal precedents.
So, we are continuing to follow these individuals," Mr. Albence said.
According to refugee workers, seeking to process the data of children more quickly, officials presented new rules that some of them were required to appear in court within a month of the date of the ban, not after 60 days, as was the previous standard.
Many of them will appear before the judges of emigration through videoconferences, not physically, to argue their claim for legal status.
Those who are not qualified will be deported immediately.
According to the shelter workers and reports received from the system in recent months, the longer the children are stopped, the more likely they are to feel anxious or depressed, which may lead to violent explosions or attempts to escape.
Supporters say these concerns are more serious in view of the larger environment such as Tornillo, where, due to the size, there is more likely to be signs of a child’s difficulties.
They add that moving children to the trendy city without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or to say good-bye to their friends, may cause traumas that are already facing many of them.
Syria seeks US, French and Turkish 'fighting forces' to withdraw immediately
During his speech at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moulem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the country's war has already entered the eighth year.
Moualem, who also holds the post of Deputy Prime Minister, stated that foreign forces remain in the Syrian land illegally, with the pretext that they fight terrorism, and that "will act with them in the right way."
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he said during the assembly.
Moualem insisted that "the fight against terrorism has almost ended" in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have been killed since 2011, and millions more have been expelled from their homes.
He said Damascus will continue "to fight in this holy battle until we have cleansed all Syrian territories" as well as "foreign foreign forces."
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, who mainly train and advise the Kurdish forces and Arab Syrians against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the territory of this country divided by war.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said the conditions are good for them to return, and he blamed "some Western countries" for "disperse irrational fear" that push refugees to stay away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate their return," he said.
"They are politicizing a matter that must be completely humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not provide aid for the reconstruction of Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition is reached to end the war.
UN diplomats say that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a neutral area in the last major fortress of the Idlib rebels has made it possible to move ahead with political discussions.
The Russian-Turkey Agreement avoided a large-scale attack on the Syrian forces supported by Russia in this province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem pointed out that the agreement had "clear instructions" and expressed confidence that military attacks would mark the jihadists, including fighters from the Nusra Front associated with Al-Qaeda, who "will be destroyed."
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to call soon the first meeting of a new committee made up of government and opposition members to prepare a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem presented conditions for government participation in this committee, saying the panel's work should be limited "in revising the current constitution," and warned that there was no intervention.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to this logic, Mr. Trump will be re-established in 2020 except when, as many people hope with liberal views, accusations and scandals put an end to his early presidency.
What it would certainly be, "The most dramatic foundation of a presidency in history!"
So far, there's no sign of eyebrows.
Since 2014, the number of viewers has doubled to 1.05m in CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6m in MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average viewer of 2.4 million during the peak hour, of 1.7 million four years ago, while MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" program has reached the top of the cable channel classification with 3.5 million viewers during the big-time evenings.
"This is a fire, to which people are drawn because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, director of the drama series at ABC "Designed Survival," which tells the story of a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an old comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys," has another theory.
It brings to memory a tax trip to Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver said he would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? She asked her questions.
He answered, "Because it makes me laugh," said Mrs. Scovell.
There are entertainment values in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, the stories coming from Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade if immigrant families can join together and the health of the global economy.
Respect is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can face.
However, if you find yourself in six hours, looking at a panel of experts discussing the use of "pacified information" by Bob Woodward in his book "Fear," Paul Manafort's leather jacket, worth $15,000 ("a clothing filled with arrogance," The Washington Post) said as well as the implications of the living descriptions of Stormy Daniels, for Mr. Trump's anatomy, then it goes beyond being an informed citizen.
At least I'll never see Super Mario in the same way.
"A part of what he does and that makes it look like a 'reality show' is that you are fed with something every night," said Brent Montgomery, executive head of the Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the "Pawn Stars," related to actors circulating and the unexpected daily developments of the Trump program (debate with N.F.L., praise for Kim Jong).
You can't leave an episode without seeing it or stay back.
When I went to Mr. Fleiss this week, the time was bright and the temperature outside was 80 degrees, outside his house on the northern coast of Kauai, but he was hiding inside, watching the MSNBC, while registering the CNN.
He could not leave, not while Brett Kavanaugh would face the Senate's Judicial Committee and the future of the Supreme Court, which depended on the first.
"I remember when we carried out all those crazy programs in the past and the people who said, "This is the last beginning of Western civilization," said Mr. Fleiss.
"I thought it was a joke, but it turned out they were right."

Money from outside the private sector falls into the narrow race for Congress elections
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17 zone is facing a cash drop, as a result of the reorganisation of electoral zones that require two officials to compete for the same post.
This recent reorganisation in Pittsburgh's peripheral areas has appointed Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won the post in another area, in special elections last spring.
Lamb is running against another candidate, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the 12-year-old zone of Pennsylvania, whose new zone has been supplanted 17.
This new division of maps came after the decision of the High Court of Pennsylvania, which, in January, was expressed that the old areas were unresolved and unjust in favor of the Republicans.
This race, in the new area 17, has also encouraged a strong confrontation in the funding of campaigns by key party funding bodies, the Democratic Committee for Congress Campaigns (DCCC) and the National Committee for Campaigns (NCRC).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a close-up victory in the most special elections held in March for the 18th Pennsylvania election area.
For over a decade, that post was held by the Republicans and President Donald Trump won this area with 20 points of difference.
Political experts see Democrats as easy favors.
US considers penalizing El Salvador for supporting China, then withdrawing
Diplomats found that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already met Beijing, with little push from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the Tromp Organization's management team.
State Department officials decided to remove US heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of "the latest elections to no longer know Taiwan," Department spokesperson Heather Nauert said during a statement earlier this month.
But the criminalities were only considered for El Salvador, who received some 140m US assistance in 2017, including for the control of drugs, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, including reductions in financial assistance and specific restrictions on visas, would be severe for Central America and its high levels of unemployment and killings.
As internal meetings progressed, North and Central American officials launched a high-level conference focusing on security and economic well-being to attend a similar meeting last year, an action that was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from moving to the United States.
But in the mid-September, senior officials of the administration made it clear that they wanted the conference to be held, ending any opportunity to impose penalties on El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence has planned to hold a speech at the conference, which was predicted in the middle of October, a signal that shows the importance that the administration attaches to this meeting, the diplomats expressed.
And the three American envoys returned quietly from El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without strong messages or punishment from Washington.
A White House official for Mr. Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to talk about internal discussions, provided their anonymity was preserved.
Their explanations were confirmed by an analyst near the administration, who also spoke, seeking the right of anonymity.
Study History
The next event that is expected to take place may be the report of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller on a possible obstacle by Mr. Trump, for which there is considerable evidence in public data.
It is reported that Mr. Mueller is moving his investigation to confirm that during his campaign, Mr. Trump has co-operated with Russia in the attack on our elections.
If Congress changes its arm, Mr. Trump will have to account for this body, at a time when he is prepared to go back to the voters, and perhaps he may be able to face an independent jury.
These are many if, and I don't want to suggest that Mr. Trump's fall or that of his counterparts in Europe is inevitable.
All of us, from both sides of the Atlantic, have to make choices that will affect how long the conflict will last.
In 1938, German officials were ready to attack Hitler, if the West had resisted and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed, and we lost the opportunity to avoid the following massacre years.
The course of history depends on these turning points, which speed up or delay the path of independent democracy.
Today, Americans are facing some of these turning points.
What will we do if Mr. Trump removes Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls Mr. Mueller's investigations?
Rosenstein has not been in a difficult situation since this newspaper reported, over the past year, that he had suggested listening secretly to the president, and had speculated that he was not fit to remain in office.
Mr. Rosenstein said The Times article is not correct.
"How will we respond if the new investigation requested by the F.B.I. for Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or correct - or if it is confirmed in the High Court despite charges based on sexual assaults and false evidence?
And above all, will we vote in the upcoming elections for a Congress that will consider Mr. Trump's responsibility?
If we fail in these tests, then democracy will face a long winter.
But I don't think we're going to fail because of the teaching I brought to Prague.
My mother was a Jewish woman from Czechoslovakia, who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime who conquered the residence of the ambassadors where I lived.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later, sent me to fire the Chinese Sabbath at the table that contains the symbol of the swastika (broken cross).
Having this legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Ranger's player, Graham Dorrans is optimistic in front of the battle with Rapid Vienna
On Thursday, Rangers expect Rapid Vienna, knowing that a victory against the Austrians, after the impressive equation in Spain against Villarreal, earlier this month, would put them in a favorable position to qualify in the G Group of the League of Europe.
A sleep damage did not allow Mistress Graham Dorrans to make the first presentation of this season's 2-2 equation to Villareal, but he believes that Rangers can use that result as a push to achieve greater things.
"It was an important point for us because Villareal is a good team," 31-year-old said.
"We went into the field believing that we could get something and we went out with a point.
Perhaps we could have noted at the end, but in general, I believe that equality was a good result.
Maybe they were better in the first part as we showed in the second part and were the best team.
Thursday, it will be another great European evening.
I hope we can get three points, but it's gonna be a difficult match because they got a positive result in their last match, but with the fans supporting us, I'm sure we can move forward and get a positive result.
Last year was very difficult, because of the injuries and changes in the club, but now there is a factor of optimism in this team.
The team is good, and the boys are very enjoying it; training is good.
I hope we can move forward, discard the last season behind our arms and succeed."
Women sleep less as a result of fear of pension savings
Even though the study participants had a clear idea of how we would like family members to show care for them, very few spoke to them about it.
About half the individuals in the Nationalwide study said they talked to their husbands about the cost of long - term care.
Only 10 per cent replied that they talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't talk about it," said Holly Snyder, the president of the society for life security, Nationwide.
Here's where we have to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to take care of you if you do not first show your desires.
Work with your counselor and your family and discuss where and how to benefit from the care, as these choices can be an important factor in determining costs.
Take your financial advisor as well: The Counselor can help you find a way to pay the expenses.
Options for financing long-term care include a traditional long-term insurance policy, hybrid insurance policy with savings to help cover these costs or self-insurance through your wealth - as long as you have money.
Prepare legal documents: Avoid legal battles through authorization.
Take a health care kit and appoint a trusted person who will oversee your health care and ensure that experts act in accordance with your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
Also consider taking a prosecution for your finances.
Choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions on your behalf and ensure payment of bills if you cannot do such a thing yourself.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Are you able to answer questions about your allergies and medications?
Prepare a written plan with these details so that you can be ready.
"Not only is the financial aspect of the game, but also who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What medications will be used?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Prepare this plan."
A person gets shot several times with an air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man has been shot several times with an air rifle while going home after spending the night out.
The victim, about 40, was in the Oxford Grove area in Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
Police officers said this was a "adjustable act", which occurred around 02:30 BST.
The victim didn't see the attacker.
The cities taken pose no risk to life, and the police are looking for witnesses.
Tomatoes and cumins in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died as a result of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu Friday, officials have declared while the number of dead is expected to rise.
With out-of-office communication networks, assistance workers have failed to obtain information from the Dongala Regency, a north-eastern area of Palu, which was closer to the magnitude of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people have been evacuated after this disaster.
Below are some facts about Paul and Dongal, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the province of central Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow slope on the western coast of the island of Sulawesi, with a population of about 379,800 inhabitants, in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when it was hit by earthquake and tsunami.
Dodgala is a regency that extends over 300 km (180 miles) along the coastline in the northeastern island of Sulawesi.
Regenca, a smaller administrative region than the province, had a population of about 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fisheries and cod are the main economic activities of the province, especially in the coastal region of Dongala.
Nickel extraction is also important in the province, but is concentrated mainly in Morowal, on the other side of the Sulawesi coast.
According to the Agency for Disaster Reduction in Indonesia, Palu and Dongala have been hit several times by tsunami over the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami took over 200 lives and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dongala.
In 1996, another tsunami hit the western part of Dongala, causing nine victims.
Indonesia is located in the Sysmic Zone of the Ring of Fire in the Pacific Ocean and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Below are some of the largest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: On December 26, a powerful earthquake on the west coast of the province of Aceh in Indonesia, in the northern part of Sumatra, caused a tsunami that struck 14 states, causing 226,000 victims along the Indian Ocean Coast line, of which more than half lived in Aceh.

The great son of Sarah Palin has been arrested with a family charge of violence
Track Palin, the great son of the former governor of Alaska and the candidate for president, Sarah Palin, has been arrested with the charge of aggression.
According to a report submitted on Saturday by Alaska's state police, Pauline, 29 years old, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested as suspected of family violence, prevention of family violence and opposition to arrest.
According to the police report, when a woman known to him tried to call the police to report alleged crimes, he took the phone.
Palin is being held in the Mat-Su pre-trial facility and is holding a guarantee in the form of unsecured bonds worth $500, KTUU reported.
According to reports from this network, he was brought to court on Saturday and when asked about admission of guilt, he declared "it is absolutely innocent".
Palin faces three violations of category A, which means he can be imprisoned up to a year and lost at $250,000.
He is also accused of a Category B violation, which is sentenced to one day in prison and $2,000 in fines.
It's not the first time there's a criminal charge against Paul.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
This issue is currently being considered by the Veterans Court in Alaska.
In January 2016, he was accused of family violence, prevention of reporting violence in families, and armed conflict during the incident.
His girlfriend had claimed that he had hit him with his fists on his face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups after linking her son's violent behavior to PTSD (post-traumatic stress syndrome) as a result of the service in Iraq.

Federal prosecutors are looking for a rare death penalty for suspected terrorist attack in NYC
Federal prosecutors in New York but seek death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people -- a rare punishment that has not been given for a federal crime since 1953.
In October, Saipov, 30 years old, is supposed to have used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out a terrorist attack on a road for motorcycles along the western highway, in the lower Manhattan, crossing pedestrians and bicycles.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov has killed eight victims "with premeditation" and has caused serious bodily "with premeditation" injuries, according to the letter of intent to seek the death penalty, premeditated in the south of New York.
According to a court document, both of these charges can be sentenced to death.
A few weeks after the attack, a major federal jury put Saipov in front of 22 complaints, including eight charges of murder in support of organised crime, often used by prosecutors in cases of organised crime, and a charge of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
This attack has come as a result of "a considerable and predictable planning," the prosecutors said, describing the manner of execution of the crime by Saipov as "degradable, cruel and moral."
"Sayfullo Habibulaevic Saipov caused damage, damage and loss to Diego Enrique Angelini's family and friends, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," writes in the purpose letter.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the New York South District was prosecuted for a death penalty case.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was sentenced to the murder of two drug suppliers but was finally sentenced to eternal imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was used in a federal case in New York, it was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after being sentenced to conspiracy and spying for the benefit of the Soviet Union, two years before the Cold War.
Both of them were executed in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to the court documents, Saipov, with the Uzbek nation, did not show suspension during the days and months after the attack.
He has told the investigators that he feels good about what he's done, the police have announced.
According to the survey, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after having no ISIS video on his cell phone.
Police said he had also asked to place the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
He said he's innocent for 22 days.
David Patton, one of the public lawyers representing Saipov, said they are "very disappointed with the prosecutor's decision.
"We think that the decision to seek the death penalty and not the acceptance of the guilt associated with eternal imprisonment without the possibility of appeal will increase the trauma caused by these events to all the persons involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek death sentences.
Conservative Party MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be put at the top of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage today promised, during a protest at the Conservatives' conference, that he would 'mobilize the army of the people'.
The former UKIP leader said politicians should feel Eurosceptic pressure - after one of Theresa May's MPs suggested he should be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
In March, Deputy Conservative Peter Bone said in Birmingham that MB would be out if Brexit's secretary was Mr. Farage.
But the challenge that Mrs. May faces in bringing her group together is highlighted by the EU's conservatives, who joined another protest in the city against Brexit.
The prime minister is facing difficulties in implementing the compromise plan reached in Chequers, among the attacks that come from those who want to stand or withdraw from the European Union, as well as from the EU itself.
The Allies insist that it will try to reach an agreement with Brussels in spite of harsh reactions - and will force Eurosceptics and laborers to choose between its package and chaos.
During the journey Fargim means Fargim, Mr. Bone said he wanted to abandon the Chequers agreement.
He suggested that Mr. Farage should be taken over and given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
'If he were in charge, now we would be out,' he said.
Wellingborough's deputy added, 'I will support Brexit, but we must abandon the Chequers agreement.'
Expressing his attitude against the EU, he said: 'We did not fight in world wars to be subdued.
We want to draw up our laws in our country.'
Mr. Bone has rejected the suggestions that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: 'The idea that British have changed their minds and want to stay in the EU is absolutely false.'
Conservative Andrea, who supports Brexit, was also in March and expressed himself to journalists: 'I just want to say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
'The Chequers Agreement is not supported by the general public, the opposition will not vote, is not supported within our party and by activists who fill the streets and vote for us.
Please leave Chequers and start listening.'
In a message addressed to Mrs. May, she added: 'The prime ministers hold the job in cases where they keep their promises.'
Mr. Farage said during the march that politicians should feel pressure if they are thinking of abandoning the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
'Now, this is a matter of faith between us -- the people -- and our political class,' he said.
'They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to say, 'We won't let you do such a thing.'
During a message addressed to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: 'I want you to force our political class, which is near the departure of Brexit, to feel pressure.
'We are mobilizing the army of the people of this country who gave us the victory in Brexit and will not stop until the United Kingdom is independent, proud and self-government.'
Meanwhile, the protests marched to Birmingham, before holding a two-hour meeting in the center of the city.
A small group of activists held a banner where Conservatives were written against Brexit, after this group’s appearance at the weekend.
The supporters of Lord Adonis' laborers ironed with the conservatives about the security problems they had with a "social application" at the start of the conference.
'These are the people who tell us that they can prepare TI systems and the technology needed for "Canada plus plus", for open borders, for free trade without borders with Ireland,' he added.
'It's totally a farce.
There's no such thing as good Brexit,' he said.
Warren plans to "carefully examine" the candidacy opportunity for the president
US Senator Elizabeth Warren has stated that he will "carefully consider the possibility of candidacy as president" after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Democratic Senator of Massachusetts spoke about her future during a meeting in the community, held on Saturday in Western Massachusetts.
Warren, a continuing critic of President Donald Trump, is running for a re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was co-director of the Trump campaign in 2016 in Massachusetts.
It has been in the centre of speculation that it can run in front of Trump in 2020.
The meeting organised on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was its 36th meeting with voters according to the municipal format, since Trump came to the forefront.
One of the participants asked if he had planned to run for the president.
Warren replied that the time has come for "women to go to Washington and regulate the corrupt government, and that includes the setting of a woman at the top."
A person is arrested for killing the LSU team player, Wade Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, La., reported Saturday that he arrested a suspect for the murder of basketball player Wade Sims on Friday.
Diteo Simpson, 20 years old, was arrested around 11 o'clock in the morning, police department in Baton Rouge announced through a media conference.
The police had published a video of the shooting on Friday, where they were looking for help to identify the person who appeared there.
Sims, 20 years old, was shot with firearms and killed near the campus at the University of the South during Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims changed his life as a result of gun wounds caused by fire in his head," police chief Murphy J. Paul said on Saturday for 247 sports.
Wade intervened to protect his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson questioned and admitted that he was on the scene, held a gun, and had shot Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incidents and sent to a parachutes in the police department in the eastern area of Baton Rouge.
Sims, 6'6'' long, played 32 matches, of which 10 as titler, last season, with an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 balls in the match table.
Russia’s Grand Prize: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world title after team’s instructions give victory to Sebastian Vettel
As soon as Walter Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the instructions of the Mercedes team" would play a significant role in this race.
Bottas left the country first and almost "punished" Hamilton after defending his position in the first two shifts and invited Vettel to attack his team's friend.
Vettel was the first to make a stop and left Hamilton to guarantee "traffic" at the end of the car group, something that must have been decisive.
Mercedes stopped a spin later and settled behind Vettel, but Hamilton came out after some maneuvers that forced Ferrari's pilot to leave space inside after a double move to protect himself in the third round.
Max Verstappen started the race from the last line and at the end of the first consecutive round of the seventh, on the day of his 21st birthday.
Then he was in charge of a large part of the race after not changing the tires to achieve a quick finish and passed Kimi Raikkonen by ranking the fourth.
Eventually, he stopped in the 44th round but failed to improve the pace in the remaining eight rounds by releasing the fourth place to Raikkonen.
It is a difficult day because Valteri did a fantastic job all weekend and showed me a real gentleman who let me through.
The team has done an extraordinary job with these positions," Hamilton said.
Very weak use of the body language
President Donald Trump ironied Senator Diane Feinstein during a Saturday's gathering, regarding her insistence, that it was not the person who "entered" Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing the candidate for the High Court, Brett Kavanaugh, of sexual assault.
During a talk at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not refer directly to the testimony given by Ford before the Senate's Judicial Committee, but said what was happening in the Senate shows that people are "the law, the wrong and the right."
"The only thing that can happen and the beautiful thing that's going on in the Senate over the last few days is when you look at the insanity, when you see people who are angry, wicked, bad and righteous," he said.
"When you look at the publications I brought out secretly and then the people who say, "Oh, I didn't.
I didn't do it."
Do You Remember?
Diane Feinstein, were you the one who put the letter on the table?
You remember her answer... did you pull out the document-- "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't get it out."
Wait a minute.
We didn't take him out... No, we didn't take him out," he said, imitating the senator.
In July, Feinstein was sent a letter with details of charges against Kavanaugh from Ford, and the document came out earlier in September — but Feinstein denied that the information had come out of her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't put her story on the table," Feinstein told the commission, reported The Hill.
"She asked me to keep her secret and I kept her as she asked."
As it seemed, her denial was not acceptable to the president, who commented during the debate on Saturday night: "In my opinion, the guests really left to wish.
Maybe he didn't, but I've never seen any weaker guests before."
Taking the candidate for the High Court, which has been charged by three women for immoral sexual conduct, the president said that the Democrats are using alleged accusations to achieve their purposes.
"They are determined to regain power on any condition.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to break to get power and control," the media reported as saying by the president.

Air traffic controller lost his life by ensuring that hundreds of people on an airplane escape the earthquake
An air traffic controller, in Indonesia, is honored as a hero after losing his life by ensuring that a plane that held hundreds of people is safely down.
Over 800 people have lost their lives, and many others have been declared lost after a major earthquake hit the island of Sulawes on Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong waves continue to disturb the area, and many have been trapped in the graves in the city of Palu.
But despite the fact that his colleagues fled to rescue him, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post at the control tower that he was running violently at the Palus airport "Mutira Sis Al Jufri Airport".
He stood to ensure that the Batik 6321 aircraft, which was on the runway at that time, could start safe.
Then he got kicked out of the traffic control tower when he thought she was watching.
He lost his life later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirat said the decision could have saved hundreds of people's lives, Australia's ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balykpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Sadly, he lost his life this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
"This news broke our soul," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the number of deaths may reach thousands themselves, while the local disaster relief agency says that entry into the cities of Dongala, Sigi, and Boutong is limited.
"It is believed that this number will continue to grow, since there are still many bodies under the background, while others have not been able to," Agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said.
The valleys that reached up to six meters have destroyed Palu, where a mass funeral will be held on Friday.
Military and commercial planes are bringing supplies and help.
Rissa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, said about Sky News: "Every minute the ambulance brings the troops.
There's no clean water.
Mini-markets have been robbed everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: "The Red Cross is accelerating to help survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get worse."
Indonesia's president, Joko Widodo, arrived in Palo on Sunday and addressed the country's army, "I ask you to work day and night to perform all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia was hit by earthquakes earlier in Lombok, where more than 550 people lost their lives.
A plane crash in Micronesia: "Air Niugini" now says a person has lost after a plane crashed into the pond
The air line leading a plane that crashed into the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia now declared a missing person, having previously declared that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the plane that was sinking into the water.
In a press statement, "Air Niugini" said Saturday afternoon they were not finding a passenger.
The airline expressed itself co-operating with local authorities, hospitals, and investigators in an effort to find the person.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for further information on the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
The local ship helped to rescue passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
On Friday, officials said that seven people had been escorted to the hospital.
The airline said that six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday and that they were all in a stable position.
The cause of the crash, and the consequences of the events themselves, remain unclear.
The U.S. airline and the Navy said the plane landed in the pond after not reaching the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane was over the track.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane landed very low.
"This is an extremely good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that through the water that reached the air level, he and others managed to reach the emergency exits of the plane.
He said that the stewards were panicking, shouting, while he suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy stated that marines working on the reform of a nearby ladder helped to save them, using an airship to transport people to the shore before the plane sinks to about 30 metres (100 feet) below the water.
The data from the Aviation Security Network show that 111 people have lost their lives in the collision of the lines registered in PNG in the last two decades, but "Air Niugini" was not involved in any of them.
An analyst builds night chronology when a woman died alive
On Saturday, the prosecutor presented her arguments in a person's review, which is accused of burning alive a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
American Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as an expert in the field of data analysis.
He explained to the jury how he had used phone records to rebuild the movement of the defendant, the 29-year-old Quinton Tellis, and the victim, 19-year-old Jessica Chambers, the night that this last one changed his life.
According to reports by The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett stated that he has received location data from some cell phones showing that Tellis was with Chambers on the afternoon of her death, the fact that he rejects his previous claims.
When the data revealed that his cell phone was in the same place as that of Chambers during the time he said it was with his friend Michael Sanford, then the police went to talk to this last one.
Sanford appeared in court on Saturday and testified that that day he was not in the city.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said that that night was on Sanford's truck, the last one said, "He's lying because my truck was in Nashville."
Another disagreement is Tellis' statement, which said he had known Chambers about two weeks before she died.
Phone tables showed that they had only one week to know each other.
Rowlett said that shortly after Chambers died, Tellis had deleted messages, calls, and contact data from his phone.
"He hid it from his life," said Hale.
Without protection, it is foreseen to give the supporting arguments on Sunday.
The judge declared that the jury would take the decision that day.
The High Breed: What is a very conscious hip?
A group of many hips with three members wants to challenge the negative views of this time by filling their music with positive messages.

They want to return to the original and make it known again to the conscious hip.
In MB, a review of artists such as The Fugees and Commons has been observed different from artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another man in color?
Dad from New York accused the couple of getting away from work after receiving a "racist" message.
A New York father has indicted a couple for discrimination in the removal of work, after having received a wrong message sent by a mother, who complains that she was "a different man with a color."
The couple have denied that they are racist, considering the charge as "debt."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed her concern when she discovered that the new father, Giselle Maurice, was a colored woman at the time she presented her first day of work in 2016.
"JOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO, A THIRD ONE WITH A WHITE," wrote Ms. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a message.
However, instead of sending her husband, she sent Mrs. Maurice twice.
According to the New York Post, after understanding her pocket, Plasco-Flaxman, "felt ashamed," she fired Mrs. Maurice, reasoning that their current father, who was African-American, had done a weak job and that instead of her, she wanted a Filipino.
Ms. Maurice was paid for her only day of work and was then sent home with a "cuckoo in the pocket".
Now, Maurice is indicting the couple for compensation for dismissal from work, and she is seeking compensation of $350 a day for a six-month period for which she was hired, though without contract.
"I want to tell them that you shouldn't do such things," she said on Friday for The Post, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple rejected claims that they were racist, saying that Maurice's expulsion was the right act, because they were afraid they could not trust him after they had offended him.
"My wife sent her something she didn't want to say.
She's not racist.
We're not racist," said partner Joel Plasco for The Post.
"But would you leave the children in the hands of a person to whom you have proved unreasonable, even though wrong?
Your newborn child?
Tell me."
Considering the indictment as "department," Plasco said that he and his wife had brought a child to life two months ago and were in a "very difficult situation."
"Can you avenge anyone in this situation?
It's not something positive to do," Plasco, investment banker added.
While the matter has gone to court, the public opinion quickly denounced the couple in social media, criticizing them for their conduct and logic.
A new letter shows that Paddington’s publishers were afraid that readers would not create a link to a gold speaker
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was admitted, said about this letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the place of a person who reads it for the first time before it was published.
We feel great pleasure now that we have seen the extraordinary success of Paddington."
She said her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC, before being inspired by a little pregnant bear to write the book for children, would be upset if his work would be refused, adding that 60 years of publishing the book, last year after his death, contained "trouble and happiness".
As for Paddington, which she described as a "very important member of our family," she added that her father was very proud of success.
"He was a quiet person and did not boast," she said.
"Paddington was so true that it was the same as having a successful child: you feel proud of him even though it's not exactly your success.
I think that's how he saw Paddington's success.
Although it was his creation and imagination, he always gave credit to Paddington's character."
My daughter was changing her life, and I was forced to say goodbye to her on the phone.
Upon arrival, her daughter was rushed to Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nyya, where doctors were trying to save her life but without a result.
"Nad called me regularly to tell me that it was too heavy, that he didn't believe it would come out," said Mrs. Ednan-Laperous.
"I got a phone call from Nad that said she would die in two minutes and that I had to say goodbye.
And that's what I did.
I said, "Now, I love you so much.
We'll be together soon.
We'll be together.
The medications that doctors had given her to keep her heart at work were losing her effect and moving slowly away from her system.
She had died a few years ago, and now everything was "doin'".
I was forced to sit down and wait, knowing that this was happening.
I couldn’t wake up or scream because I was surrounded by family and people.
I had to be strong."
With the passing of time, Mrs. Ednan-Laperous, sailing for the loss of her daughter, flew on a plane alongside other passengers - who were not aware of what she was experiencing.
"No one knew," she said.
"I kept my head down and all the time I was running a lot.
It is difficult to explain, but during that flight, I felt a great regret for Nad.
I felt that he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Women who shed tears post letters to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones as a result of suicide are working to prevent others from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted letters with inspiring messages, on a bridge in Wells as well as numbers of people who can call for support.
Ms. Davis was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and killed himself at the age of 18.
"I don't want no parent to feel like I feel every day," she said.
Ms. Davis, 45 years old, resident in Lydney, said her son was a promising cook with a "legit" smile.
"Everyone knew him for his smile.
People always said that his smile lights every room."
However, he gave up his job before he changed his life, after it was "at a real dark moment."
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, then 11 years old, was the person who found his brother after he had committed suicide.
Mrs. Davis said, "I'm constantly worried that there will be a domino effect."
Ms. Davis created the letters, "that people know there are people who can help them and with whom they can talk, even with a friend.
Don't sit alone - you need to talk."
Ms. Humphreys, who has been Mrs. Davies' friend for many years, lost Mark, her 15-year-old partner, not long after his mother died.
"He did not say he felt upset, depressed or anything else," she said.
"Some days before Christmas, there was a change in behavior.
He was extremely upset on Christmas day - when the children opened their presents, he saw them and did no action."
She said that his death was a great trauma to them, but that they had to overcome, "It's something that destroys the whole family.
We've been ruined.
But we all have to move forward and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future depends on the beginning of the FBI investigation
"I thought if we could give him something similar to what he was looking for -- a limited investigation in time and in object -- maybe we could bring some harmony," said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that there was fear that the committee "was breaking" between the many obstacles of the opponents.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Their excitement comes as a result of time.
The elections for Congress are only 5 weeks away, on November 6th -- if the Republicans go wrong, as is expected, they will be very weak in their efforts to choose the person they want in the country's highest court.
George W. Bush has called the senators, lobbying for them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who has worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and through him I met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI issues her report?
It will be voted in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear if Mr. Kavanaugh could gather at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice-President Mike Pence to put an end to this situation and confirm it at the High Court.
Number of deserters in North Korea under Kim's leadership
The number of deserters in North Korea has fallen since Kim Jong came into power seven years ago, has declared a South Korean legislator.
Park Byeong-sug, quoting data from the Union Ministry in South Korea, has stated that there were about 1127 deserts last year - compared to 2706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said the main factors were the strictest controls between North Korea and China and the highest rates requested by human beings traffickers.
Penion has not made public comments.
Most deserters from North Korea are subjugated from South Korea.
Seoul has declared that more than 30,000 people from North Korea have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most of them go to China, which is the largest of the border with North Korea, and there can be more easily crossed compared to the DMZ between the two Koreas, which is protected by a lot of forces.
China views illegal and illegal migrant deserters, not as refugees, and often re-enters them with strength.
Relations between North Korea and South -- which are technically still in war -- have improved significantly over the past few months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Penian and their talks focused on late negotiations for denuclearization.
This meeting came after the historic meeting of June, between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong, in Singapore, where they agreed, in general terms, to work for a Korean army without nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed US sanctions for the lack of progress so far.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and in these circumstances, there is no chance that we will disarm the first," Mr. New during a talk at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "histerik," and says he's not worthy of serving at the High Court
The minority leader in the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called High Court Judge Brett Kavanaugh "histerik" and said that because of his temper, he was unable to serve in the High Court.
Pelos made these comments on Saturday during an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't believe that if a woman would ever be brought like this, people would say 'histories'," said Pelosi for her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate's Judicial Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh categorically denied the charges that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his presentation, Kavanaugh was very concerned and at some moments almost horrified or "getting his mouth" when he spoke about his family and the years of high school.
He accused the democrats explicitly in front of the committee, calling them charges against him as "a grotesque and coordinated attack on his figure", organised by liberals angry with Hillary Clinton's loss in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelos expressed her opinion that Kavanaugh's testimony was proof that he could not serve in the High Court, since she showed his prejudice against the Democrats.
"I think he penalized himself with those statements and the way he attacked Clinton and the Democrats," she said.
Pelos hesitated to answer the question whether he would try to give Kavanaugh a motion of disbelief in the event of his appointment, and if the Democrats win most of the countries in the House of Representatives.
"Let me tell you -- if he's not telling the truth before Congress or the FBI, then he's ineligible not only for the High Court, but also for the court where he is now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Court of Appeal in Washington.
Pelos added that, as a democrat, he was concerned about Kavanaugh's decisions against the Anti-Terrorism Act or the Roe anti-Wade case, since he was considered a conservative court.
At the sessions for his appointment, Kavanaugh avoided questions as to whether he would enforce certain decisions of the High Court.
"It is not the time for a hysterical and unanimous person to become a member of the court and wait for us to say "Oh, how good!" said Pelosi.
And women should use it.
This is a right verbal attack, months and years of heart rate that explodes, and it cannot lead to the end without tears.
"We cry when we get angry," Mrs. Steinem said 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual.
She continued, "A woman who worked in a leading position helped me a lot, who said she also wept when she was angry, but had shown a style that whenever she was angry and started to cry, she would tell the co-rapporteur, "You can think I'm upset and therefore I'm crying.
But I'm actually angry."
And then she kept talking.
And I thought that was a brilliant idea."
Lots are a way to express anger, partly because they are totally misunderstood.
One of my most vivid memories of an old job, in an office that dominated men and where at one point I found myself crying out of an inconsistency, was the moment when a larger woman caught me face - a cold manager I have always had a bit of fear - pushed me toward the stairs.
"Never let others see you crying," she said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're upset and they'll be glad to see you get upset."
Patricia Schroeder, a Democratic Congress member from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential nominations.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was found in the middle of an extramarriage relationship on board a boat named "Monkey Business" and got out of the race, Mrs. Schroeder, very angry, realized there was no reason why he didn't think of running for the president himself.
"This wasn't a good-weighted decision," she said to me laughing, 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was a more candidate.
Someone called it "Borrybardha and Seven Jewels".
Since the campaign was in its final stages, it had remained after the fund meeting, I swore it wouldn't be a guarantee if it couldn't get $2 million.
But it was a stupid war.
She found that some of her supporters, who gave $1,000 to men, gave her only $250.
"Don't you think I'm making a fall?" she asked herself.
During his speech that he said he would not develop an official campaign, it was so crowded with emotion – gratitude for the people who supported him, the anger with the system that made it so difficult to collect money and the marking of voters instead of delegates, and the hearts with sexism – that they were killed.
"It seemed as if I had suffered a nervous crisis," recalled Mrs. Schroeder about how the press reacted to it.
"It seemed as if Kleinex was my sponsoring corporation.
I remember thinking what would people write on my gravestone?
"She's crying?"
US-China Trade War Advantages for Beijing
The first trade wars between the US and China were deafening, and as the war is far from over, a gap between the two countries could have an advantage for Beijing in the long term, experts say.
US President Donald Trump issued the first warning early this year, setting taxes on the main Chinese export goods, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most sensitive step was the one that happened this week, when the new tariffs touched goods worth $200 billion (150 billion pounds), effectively taxing half of the goods entering the United States from China.
Beijing has been "in nature" every time, finally setting tariffs from five to ten per cent above US$60 billion.
China has pledged to return the US with the same coin, and the second largest economic power in the world is unlikely to surrender soon.
The removal of measures from Washington means surrendering yourself to their demands, but for China's President Xi Jinping, it would be very embarrassing to submit publicly to the US.
However, experts said that if China correctly plays its cards, the pressures coming from the US trade war could positively support China in the long term, to reduce the interdependence of these two economies.
"The fact that political decisions, quickly taken both in Washington and Beijing, can cause economic decline in each of these countries, is something much more dangerous than what has been seen from the outside," said Abigail Grace, an associate researcher at the research centre for new American security, which focuses on the Asian continent.
Syria is 'prepared' for the return of refugees, Foreign Minister says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is calling for help to rebuild the country destroyed by a war that has lasted more than seven years.
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country are improving.
"Today, the situation in the country is much more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate destroyed areas by terrorists, to restore normality.
Already, there are all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to their country, from which you have to leave due to terrorism and the united economic measures that have affected their daily lives and their well-being.
The UN estimates that some 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
About six million others still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome help to rebuild the destroyed state.
However, he stressed that the country would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from the countries sponsoring the formation.
Europe wins the "Ryder Cup" trophy in Paris
The European team has won Ryder Cup 2018 trophies after defeating the US team with a final score 16.5 with 10.5, in Le Golf National, off Paris, France.
The US has already lost 6 major matches in European territory and has won this trophies in Europe since 1993.
Europe removed the crown after the Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team got 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States.
American star, Phil Mickelson, who was the player who faced more difficulty during the tournament, took the first hit in the water and closed the 16th with 3 more shots than the specified level, losing the match against Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golf player, Molinari, shined on all his rounds, becoming 1 of the 4 players who scored 5-0-0, since the current format began to apply in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was defeated 5&4 by the player with the lowest ranking on the European team, Danish Thorbjorn Olesen.
The number one player in the world ranking, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to Englishman Ian Poulter, who may have played at his last final Ryder Cup.
Spanish veteran Sergio Garcia, who played at eight Ryder Cup, became the most successful European player of all times in this tournament, with 25.5 points in career.
"Normally, I don't cry but today I can't keep myself.
It's been a tough year.
I'm very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm very, very happy to take the cup back.
Success is the team, and I'm happy to have the opportunity to help them," Garcia said quite excited after the European team won.
He passed the word to his fellow countryman John Ram, who won the 2&1 American golf legend Tiger Woods in direct challenges on Sunday.
"I feel an extraordinary pride that beat Tiger Woods. I'm growing up to see that player," 23-year-old Rahm said.
Woods lost all his matches in France and now has statistics 13-21-3, during his career in Ryder Cup.
A strange statistics from one of the biggest players of all time, who has won 14 important titles, ranked second after Jack Nicklus.
The US team faces difficulties all weekend to take the ball to the right place, except Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-calibre golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Fury, spoke after the disappointing appearance of his team, "I'm proud of these guys. They fought hard.
There were moments during this paradise when we put pressure on the European team.
We fought hard.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
His 12 players played pretty well.
We'll regroup, work with PGA in America and with our Ryder Cup committee and we'll move forward.
I love these 12 boys, and I'm proud to be the captain.
We have to take the hat off.
They played better than us."
