In the afternoon a surprise awaits our candidates again: they will not fight the romantic Candlelight shooting before MY SOLARIS alone, but on the side of Male-Model Fabian!
Hvar - Flirting, cooking, seduce - no simple tasks for our girls.
Especially when a friend is waiting in Germany.
Nevertheless, the nine "Schöne Münchnerin" candidates for the shooting with People's Photographer Tuan and despite wind, rain and rain as a real profession.
The romantic shooting is in the video:
DFB-Chief Grindel does not see any basis for Özil-Comeback
Berlin DFB President Reinhard Grindel currently does not see any basis for a return from Mesut Özil to the national team.
"That's a question, of course, that depends on you getting into the conversation once, that you're also talking to him about why he felt it as clearly as he did in his status," said Grindel in the football podcast "Phrasenmährer" of the "Phairen-Maier" of the "Pild-Zietung.
Despite the current month's debate on the photos of Özil with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he regretted the retreat of the 92-fold national player Özil.
"I would have been pleased if Mesut Özil had continued to play for Germany.
I have also come to a certain point that this would be the case," Grindel said.
The 29-year-old had declared his resignation from the DFB team in July and also justified that he had not been defended against racist enemies during the WM.
The DFB chief reiterated his criticism of Özil that he was not prepared for a conversation with Bundestrainer Joachim Löw and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He doesn't want to build any pressure, but he knows it from the football, so that if "you're leaving a team or changing a association, you're talking to his coach, and I'm sorry that this conversation hasn't happened so far."
Linz: Garden hut burnt in Schrebergartensidung
At 14.13 a.m., the firearm Linz was alarmed to a fire in the mountain yard.
Because a high voltage led directly through the Schreberg species settlement, there was a risk of delay.
The firefight went out and found the cabin in full fire at the meeting.
The roof had to be practically removed and firefighted to the extent necessary.
According to the owner of the burning garden hut, he had poured an battery to the store in the middle of the afternoon.
That could be the fire thing.
In any case, the charging device was based on firearms in the area of the greatest fire intensity.
The damage caused by the fire still needs to be detected - as well as the fire thing.
However, he must have been considerable, for the owner had many pieces in his garden cabin.
Angry mother resists: Lindsay Lohan attacks refugee family on the open street
What has Lindsay Lohan only driven to this extremely remarkable action?
She wanted to bring the children into an alleged refugee family.
Lindsay Lohan (32, "Herbie: Fullly Loaded") himself has streamed live as she wants to enter a family in Moscow.
This reports the US portal "TMZ" and publishes a partial average of the stream.
Here you can see "Fucked" with Lindsay Lohan
In the clip, see how Lohan comes out of a car and goes to a possibly homeless family that she wants to have grown up as a refugee family from Syria.
When the family flees right in front of the actor, Lohan persecutes the parents and their children.
It oversees adult child trafficking.
For all of this, she doesn't provide any evidence in the clip.
"The whole world sees this," is Lohan in the video, as she continues to follow the family along the road.
Apparently she's trying to separate the children from her parents.
Sometimes, however, it seems to be enough for the manifestly angry mother.
It looks like she's turning around and Lohan's missing a earring.
Under the tears, the actor admires how shocked she is - and she keeps the wave.
What Lohan has moved to this action is now completely unclear.
Landing on Ryugu: This task has "Mascot" on the asteroids
The "Hayabusa2" probe started in December 2014 in Japan.
It should get so close to the Asteroid Ryugu that it can look out material from its surface and bring it to the ground.
The lander "Mascot" will remain in Ryugu.
Foreign tickers: Number of deaths on Sulavesi rises to more than 400
After the severe earthquake of the Strength 7,5 and subsequent tsunamis on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, at least 420 deaths were reported.
The number of victims could continue to rise.
The rescue teams have not yet been moved to the devastated and cut off areas of the outside world.
Elon Musk acts as Tesla Supervisory Board Chief Back
At first it was a tweet.
Tesla-Chief Elon Musk took care of the stock markets at the beginning of August when he announced a withdrawal from the car manufacturer.
The U.S. stock exchange supervisor accused him of fraud, but now both have agreed.
Tesla and Musk have to pay, and the Chief of Tesla withdraws from the Supervisory Board, but he may remain the Chairman.
Party day of British Conservatives
Sharp Watch - the party day of the Tories
Birmingham will be the stage of a power struggle.
On the day of the party, it will be about foreign policy, trade and development policy, but the four-day conference will be overestimated by the dispute between Prime Minister Theresa May and the Brexit Hardliners, at the front of former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson.
Reference for a new name
The Foreign Ministers of Macedonia (right) and Greece have already agreed
Macedonia is a state in the Balkans, but Macedonia is also a province in northern Greece.
Skopje and Athens have been fighting over these name-dopings for years.
Now they're united.
The state of Macedonia is going to be called North Macedonia in the future, and on this Sunday the population agrees - is it good?
Protests in Brazil against law-enforcement Bolsonaro.
"El Nao" ("Don't") - is Jair Bolsonaro.
A week before the presidential election in Brazil, the mood was split in the country.
Thousands went on the street in several cities to protest against law-makers, Jair Bolsonaro.
The "Trump Brasiliens" is an anti-system candidate and thus lies in the front of the polls.
His strongest competitor is Fernando Haddad of the Left Workers' Party.
Audi: Dieselgate processing takes longer than planned
"The Diesel Taskforce still exists," said development board Peter Mertens in the automotive week.
In December 2017, the arrested and detained Audi-Chief Rupert Stadler announced that the task force would be dissolved soon.
"In the first quarter of 2018, all motor/engine combinations were expected to be tested," he had said at that time.
Mertens now said: "At the beginning of July we have achieved an important goal in the development of the diesel crisis.
We have completed the internal technical analyses of our VTDI engines.
The Taskforce was founded in September 2015 after the discovery of the Diesel Canal at the Audi-Mother Volkswagen.
Mertens stressed that the autobuilder has made "graving organizational changes" so that such a scandal never occurs again.
The VW Supervisory Board had a decision on the future of Stadler on Friday and would like to discuss further on this Tuesday.
The investigating authorities have proposed to the Head of the Audi to authorise the sale of diesel cars with wrong gas values, after the authorities have announced that they have sold them.
He knew of the manipulations or ignored them.
The company is currently headed by the sales board Bram Schot as the Head of the Board of Directors.
Due to the conversion to the new gas and consumption testing standard WLTP, there are production accidents in Audi, said the impact of the "heilbronner voice".
Basically, he sees a decreasing demand for limousines such as the Audi models A6, A7 and A8 produced in Neckarsulm.
"The segment is difficult," he said.
Shot's on electromobility.
For the e-tron, the first Audi-Electro car, there are already 15,000 reservations.
Grindel strives to re-select - Lahm should be in the DFB Presidium
Mainz (dpa) - Reinhard Grindel, despite the criticism of his person after the WM-aus and the Özil-affaire, wants to re-as President DFB again for the office next year.
"I do my work and try to make it as good as it is," Grindel said as a guest in the ZDF's "Current Sports Studio" on Sunday morning.
You have to try again and again for a re-election, I'll do it.
And then you have to see if the support is there.
According to his own words, it was "remarkable" if, after the award for the football-EM 2024, he didn't have the opportunity to work on the future project.
Grindel has been the leader of the band since April 2016 as a successor to Wolfgang Niersbach, who has been a member of the Sommermarchen affair.
In autumn 2016 he was elected for a first complete term of office of three years.
The next vote will take place at the DFB-Bundesday on 27 September 2019.
According to Grindel, the future EM chief organizer Philipp Lahm is to work in the DFB Presidium.
"I would be pleased if my colleagues in the Bureau agreed that in this role he was also in the Bureau with advice and then, of course, was warmly invited to make his experience available on sporting matters," Grindel said.
In speculations, if Lahm could become his successor as DFB chief, he did not want to participate.
As a consequence of the deal about the photos of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan with the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan expressed the wish that in the future a national player should become integration ambassadors of the DFB without the support of migration.
Currently, this office of the native Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic has family roots in Cameroon.
"If a person with no migration grounds clearly affects society and football and says, "the topic is important, we need to take care of ourselves," it would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our associations on the site where integration needs to work," Grindel said.
Directly drop with semi-circular weighing

A weight that not only measures my weight, but also the body fat portion.
Muscle and bone mass can also display it.
The body mass index also calculates the thing, but it's more for the desires.

Erdoğan Opens Mosque in Cologne
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan officially opened the Ditib Mosque in Cologne on Saturday.
Erdoğan had previously met with Chancellor Angela Merkel and Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier at his three-day visit to the state.
Criticism in Germany
In his opening speech Erdoğan called on the German government to issue supporters of the Golden Movement living in Germany and to take action against Kurdish separatists.
We will protect our citizens - no matter where they live.
We are not going to allow the sympathies of the PKK or the yellow movement to destroy our citizens and damage the German-Turkish friendship," he said.
For the opening of the Ditib mosque, the Cologne city of central was partially closed.
Several thousand policemen were in use - among them sharp shields.
The Islamic Association Ditib is in criticism because it is considered as an extended arm of the Turkish government.
"Global Citizen Festival": Music against Poverty: Stars, Buhrupe and Fear seconds
Musicers such as Janet Jackson, John Legend, Shawn Mendes and Cardi B have spent more time in the struggle against poverty and disease at a joint concert in New York Central Park.
"You are committed, wherever you can always only," Mendes said at the festival on the night of Sunday in front of about 60.0000 spectators.
Thanks for coming here, it's a dream.
Cardi B appeared in a red outfit with French and golden microphone.
I'm nervous, I switch, but it's okay, because I'm here and ready to change the world.
Actors such as Hugh Jackman and Forest Whitaker, as well as representatives of governments, the United Nations and relief organizations, also showed themselves at the stage in the multi-hour show.
Meanwhile, however, there was a seconds of horror when many spectators kept the sound of a striking metal shield for shots, got scared and tried to flee.
A brief panic arose, people ran through each other.
Seven spectators were easily injured, said the organizer Hugh Evans.
However, the New York police and the musician Chris Martin calmed the people out of the stage.
"No one tries to hurt anyone," said Martin.
You're all safe.
Tickets for the "Global Citizen Festival" concert there was as free every year on the Internet.
Anyone who wanted to read and distribute texts, photos and videos on the Internet about the global fight against poverty and disease.
For the numerous musicians and actors, there was the audience of Jubilee and Applaus - Buhrufe, on the other hand, for the Republican Senator Jeff Flake.
He spoke with his democratic colleague Chris Coons on the stage for greater equality between men and women.
On Friday, however, Flake spoke on behalf of the U.S. Senate's Justice Committee for the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh as a judge at the Supreme Court, and this led many women to give way to the head.
At least three women have raised abuses to try rape against Kavanaugh, who rejects it.
Flake called for an FBI investigation of the proposals after he was confronted with two women who, according to their own data, experienced sexual abuses on the way to the committee meeting in an elevator.
"You can meet me at any time in a lift," Flake now said at the concert in New York.
Press freedom: Federal government defends the journalist's draft
Governor Steffen Seibert defended the draft of a journalist from the press conference of Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
In the office, the Turkish journalist who lived in Hamburg had taken over a T-shirt with the Turkish and German inscription "Freedom for Journalists" and had gone into the first row.
The T-shirt, if it wasn't the problem, Seibert said the picture on Sunday.
It was an interruption of the outcome of the press conference.
The actions of the journalist caused a severe disturbance, which was not acceptable.
That's why he's caused personal shooters to drive the man out.
Seibert said it was not allowed to demonstrate political concerns at press conferences in the Federal Office.
This is entirely independent of whether or not it is a legitimate matter.
The rules are the rules.
In Turkey, numerous journalists are in prison.
Many of them are suspected espionage activities or support or membership in prohibited parties or the Fethullah Yellow Movement.
The Turkish leadership is responsible for the attempted coup on 15 July 2016.
Some of the accused journalists threaten several decades of prison.
Also foreign journalists are not safe before the Turkish authorities: At the beginning of September, the Austrian journalist Max Zirgast was arrested.
Last time, the cases of the arrested journalists Meșale Tolu and Deniz Yücel had taken care of.
Although they were free and could return to Germany, there were still proceedings against both of them in Turkey.
Munich: Florian David Fitz completely drunk with Ina Müller
So fresh and well-known he is usually known by his fans: Florian David Fitz.
So you have to look twice: yes, that's really Florian David Fitz.
The popular actor was in Hamburg - and experienced a wild night!
Hamburg - The talk show "Inas Night" produced by the NDR is known for a warm conversation on the theme of the Hamburg Hafenkneipe "Shellfishposts".
Moderator Ina Müller resists with her guests on some beer, some wine or even high-percent drink to unlock the mood and tongue.
Not few promises are also used for the mandatory singing arrangements.
Another result of the popular talk show was recorded on Friday.
This time: The actor Florian David Fitz is known from films such as "Men's Hearts", "Terror - Your Judgment" or "The Day of God".
The Munich was not well received in the high north.
On Saturday he posted a selfie - his face is completely enchanted, the eyes only two small cuts.
The bed-selfie shows a completely exhausted Florian David Fitz.
But he's not sick, he's only got a powerful cat.
Towards his fans he posted some - probably not very serious - findings he has now won: "Rule One: NOT goes to Inas Night.
Rule two: never drink the black sauce.
And Spritz.
And the round egg liqueur, which is half-breeding ina, also leaves.
The alcohol consumption is really written in the face of the 43-year-old.
His fans just posted a few tips to fight the riots.
They range from instant bread, fish bread or - probably the most targeted - headache tablets.
Others simply amused themselves over the view of the normally attractive kinostar.
As Ina Müller has survived the nightfall, he is still unknown.
Since she has moderated the TV play at the Theke since 2007, the 53-year-old seems to be much more experienced...
On a beer with Ina Müller.
Treysa has to fight vandalism and disorder
The entrance to the 36 km long railway road in the Red Käpchenland in Treysa is difficult to find and wash.
Recipes against the grammatical vandalism are sought, but solutions are hardly clear.
Scherben, cigarettes, dust and dirt, demolished mills and now demounted signposts - thus has been present since long the entrance with seat group to the wheelway on the Haaße hill in Treysa.
For the preview object railway road in the Red Käpchenland there is a more than unimaginable view.
The topic has been occupied by members of the ADFC local group Schwalmstadt, but also by others for a long time, so the wheel traffic officer of the city of Ulrich Wüstenhagen.
The problem has already been addressed in the bicycles council.
A solution does not exist so far.
The proposals range from the layout of the seat group to the regular discharge of the waste containers and the cleaning of the surfaces at the entry point.
"I think the last one would be the order of the hour - regardless of possible other activities," says Wüstenhagen.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reports that the topic has also been introduced into the local council.
Not only does the mill drive bikers and residents - the seat group is at the weekly meeting point for the celebration.
It is not only often heard, but also destroyed in the layers: scrapes from the ground, demolished mussels, painted paintings, damaged seats.
Volunteers have already cleaned up more often, says ADFC member Susanne Klippert.
The actions, however, were only the verbal drops on the hot stone.
They are angry that the rust place on the bike in Treysa meeting point is for storage.
"During the entire cycle path, there is a clear focus on the Haaße hill," confirms the wheel traffic officer, who is now also taking care of the new railway station in Ziegenhain, which is being opened today.
"If she suffers the same fate, it will be quite expensive."
Another idea was a video surveillance at the hill: "Perhaps this makes the threshold significantly higher to get into the community.
However, this would require a police check to be carried out in time.
In principle, desert hagen wishes to develop the Haaße hill.
It should be more attractive.
The frequency of the cycle so far could be very satisfying.
The tourist market is still inexhaustible.
Our bike route is very high in comparison with others in Germany," the ADFC members said.
As an extremely critical danger point, ADFC member Susanne Klippert assesses the situation in the Ascherøder Straße in Treysa.
There's no rungs on the Haate hill.
In the case of rear transport, it may happen that bicycle drivers have to wait in the middle of the road between side traffic flows," she explains.
This is not a problem for sports drivers, but perhaps for older ones and especially for children.
Music-Contest at the Cultural Station: the "Kö von Hiltrup" and the lake
The first call to the music contest was a success, creative and intertwined.
"D to present a song for Hiltrup" is the appeal of the district offensive Hiltrup, in the "Music Contest for Large and Small, Young and Experienced Music".
A contest "with eye gain in the sympathetic helptroper family", as Karl Franke formulated.
In fact, it was soon a family meeting with coffee and cakes from the honorary officials of the cultural railway station.
Seven formations took place, from the one-man band to the large ensemble: Alvin Jasic with Pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf Ihmig, a long-lived albachtener in Hiltrup, the nine of the "helpup star colours", three members and three generations of the families Trenkamp and Claus, a ensemble from the children's garden Lummerland and finally Rick Weßling and the Schwarties.
This contest, said District Mayor Joachim Schmidt, was a novelty.
We have not yet experienced this in other parts of the city.
Where did the texts come from?
At the sites, the Hiltruper Lake and the Marketallee found particular mention.
Rolf Ihmig shorted the Alle in his battle-like song to "Kö von Hiltrup".
The cultural station was also appreciated.
It was always about the experience of each other in these places, especially Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke experienced the short conversions with short interviews with the interpreters or references to their creation.
This is how Humberg learned that he actually studied chemistry, but now he also teaches guitar.
Tontechniker Stefan Schemmelmann told Franke that he had recently arrived in Ludwigshafen - at a large event of the BASF with Barclay James Harvest in the program.
And in the meantime Alvin Jasic has placed everything on youtube.
"It's not about winning," Frank said.
In fact, all participants received a gift from the helptuper gastronomy.
However, for the jury's favorites there was something special - so that others could hear their songs.
An entire CD can be played by Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untimed with sound technician Shemmelmann.
Other musicians can record a song: Ihmig with his Hiltrup-slagger, who impressed Frank with his musicality, and the "Lummerland-Rudel": "a very beautiful performance" with ten children and two educators at guitar and Cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle.
Like everyone else, the children went to the finals again - and even sang without electronic support "very good," as Frank said.
Leading the jury was the originality of the aspects, reference to helprup, access to the melodies and recognition value.
The jury included Gisbert Keller from the Westfälische School of Music, Andreas Klomfaß from the KvG gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers from the Economics Association, as well as Jan Kaven, chairman of the city party offensive.
The city-wide offensive had caused the event of its ten-year existence to come to life.
She valued the event as a complete success.
All are "very satisfied", and "the atmosphere was good" in the very soon full cultural station.
The word game: "Decrypto" in the game test
The players form two teams that meet each other.
For each side there is a screen, where four cards with key words can only be deciphered when inserted - the old trick with the red foil.
Thus, it is ensured that the opposite side can also read from memory.
For example, on the map you can read from left to right: "1. Renaissance.
2. Window.
3. Würfel.
"Fest."
These are the terms used to encrypt it for the first time.
Because the terms are not to be discussed here, but codes.
By contrast, a player per team is the cipher.
He gets a code card on which he might be " 3.4.2".
They are to be found in "Decrypto" not the terms behind the secret film, but their encryption codes.
His task in this case: He should, in this order and in this example, describe the terms "Wurfel", "Fest" and "Window" - and so that his own team recognizes the correct order and the enemy team is not possible; for this wins the party, when it succeeds in breaking the code.
So the cipher notes and reads it out loud: "Throw" for the cubes, "Lose" as a contrast to the party; here, of course, it would also be possible to do something like "Party" and "Prag" because he's gone to school and knows the window hole there.
That's how it goes for rounds, team for team.
Although you do not know the terms of the opposite side - it can be better combined with any indication that the cipher is there.
Perhaps mysterious, but not too twisted, the inscriptions should be so, otherwise it makes it unnecessary for his team.
Unfortunately, the cryptostist on "Decrypto" is the rule firm.
The players are likely to have to study it for quite a long and detailed time until they can finally play.
The explanation video under decrypto.info in the network makes it easier.
But whoever has just released will be fascinated by how much feeling is in this invisible game.
Overall, however, "Decrypto" is not as clever as predecessors and genre-primus "codenames", which also puts an agent's theme on a game of less words, but it is much better to play in small groups.
And who is just about advice and not about winning points, which can also easily find a version for two.
Kullbach: Man shows police Hitler's big and embarrassing guests in the button
A 48-year-old man had twice the night of Saturday on Sunday at the police inspection Kulbach.
He first showed the Hitler size in the Upper City of a passing police force, and later he also fell into a button in the Upper City when he harassed other guests.
After he did not follow the clearly alcoholized reference given by the police, he had to spend the night at the police inspection Kulbach in the prison cell.
In a more lenient state, he must then be held accountable in criminal law for the use of signs of constitutional opposition.
Operational work Pressig was home to the school block
The railway operation in Pressig was the turning disc in Frankenwald for decades.
In 1991 a piece of railway history ended.
"When buffers broke down on buffers, it was heard in the press," recalls Georg Dinkel, who records the history of the place and the railway station.
It didn't work out for anyone.
There were also the brakes and the Waggons were slammed.
That was just the railway.
Statements that make sense for thoughts at home press.
Nowhere in Frankenwald was such a place marked by the railway.
Here was the starting point of the Stilerampen-Bergsträcke to the north, which, after an increase of about 220 meters, has its lowest point in Steinbach am Forest.
In order to handle this, early train and school blocks were needed, which in Pressig had their home.
In 1901, the Bavarian Landtag approved the construction of a railway station with 21 lokscupen, teaching workshop, driving and train mastering.
"Herzstück was the turning disc, which had a diameter of 18 meters after a reconstruction in 1899," says Norbert Heidrich from Hirschaid, railway historians and 47 years of professional sea railways.
In 1968 Bamberg was subjected to pressure from the railway plant (BW) and were also operated by Loks for the suburbs Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehesten, Stockheim - Sonneberg and Kronach - Nordhalben.
On July 15, 1950, the "Volksblatt" reported on a staff of 160 men; 13 steam and eight Elloks were then stationed in pressig.
The electrification of the 1939 route has already minimized the need for train and school blocks.
From 1977 they were used only in freight trains.
By 1991, at least 10,000 roads were still ranked in the month.
In 1982 parts of the work were cut off, 1991 the rest.
Heidrich: "It is regrettable that you have not made better use of the site, even in the point of freight transport, in the eyes of the eyes."
Even at Pfingsten 1989, the Nuremberg Railway Directorate celebrated the anniversary of "50 years of electrification Nuremberg - Saalfeld" in Pressig.
"There were 10,000 enthusiastic spectators here," recalls Georg Dinkel.
A little later.
On 1 June 1991 the last 30 men were removed, the Rangierbahnhof Pressig was history.
"The Rangers and hemschulers did the most difficult work on the train," recalls Dinkel.
Any mistake would have had fatal consequences.
Why the Pressig-Rothenkirchen station has led to the conversion of the hierarchy of both places and many other historical and current images are found here in the infranchised Plus article.
Kerber with success in China Open
Peking (dpa) - Wimbledon Sieger Angelique Kerber and Laura Siegemund have reached the second round in the tennis tournament in Beijing as before Julia Görges.
Kerber defeated the Chinese Open 6:2, 6:2 against the Frenchman Kristina Mladenovic.
The next opponent of the world rankings is either Julia Putinzewa from Kasachsten or Spanish counterpart Carla Suárez Navarro.
Siegemund conducted 6:3, 4:2 against Darja Kassatkina, when the Russian assigned in number 13.
The swwebin is now getting to do with Anett Kontaveit from Estonia.
During the series "Art and Joys" a special exhibition was opened in Mittehrenbach on the weekend.
With great relief, the organizers and visitors looked at the ideal weather when the special Vernissage "Windspiel-Performance" was opened in the free country of the property Dahlmann-Schmidt.
It takes place under the roof of the tourism association "Circums Walberla" in the "Art and Pleasure" series.
She opened her wallets in the 15th year.
A great visitor's speech showed the fascination of the exhibition.
21 copies of 20 artists are now to be visited in Mittehrenbach.
Hausherr Ernst Jürgen Dahlmann welcomed the artists to open the Vernissage.
He's been on his own since the first hour.
Like Volker Hahn, who made himself the main organizer and artist of the same name.
A bit surprising, however, Hahn announced his resignation a few days ago.
With Tania Engelke and Kurt Neubauer, he put his task in proven, young hands with a good perspective for the future.
Both have already been active in the past in selecting artists and in designing flyers.
This year, too, there is once again a 70-cent special letter brand designed by Kunst & Genuss, available at each art station.
There, this year's poster "Betzn Austanzen" can also be designed by Volker Hahn, to be purchased for eight euros.
Hahn was pleased with the high commitment of the special exhibition.
Max Marcus Stadler from Nuremberg was able to be won for the musical frame.
On the way through the generous garden, it will quickly become clear to the visitor that the title "Windspiel-Performance" formally challenges the artistic imagination and ultimately expresses it.
Art works are made of metal or ceramics, often provided with colourful accents.
Already at the entrance of the property, visitors are expected on the right side of the "happy tree" by the artist Werner Baur, Eschenau.
It is a cotton, colourful, playful with 20 windmills, 24 hoods and 24 alu tubes as soundpieces.
With the sun flashing through the bushwork in the background, the object functions gently and invites to rest.
From Eckental, Barbara Washneck, who prefers to be in three dimensional letters dedicated to the event 15 years K&G.
There are many parts in the wind moving.
On a half-way Siegrid Frey from Eckental has exhibited her work "The Wind The Heavenly Child".
And at the end of the area, the folk show Hahn his colorful fantasy image of sound, cement and stainless steel.
The theme "Windspiel-Performance" is to fade through the diverse art exhibition.
The special exhibition can be visited by 31 December 2018.
50 years MGV 68 Nights: Singer celebrates 50th birthday festive
1968 - that was the time of the protest and the student movement.
And also the Albakhts at that time made their foolish air.
At least five of them.
They didn't want to find out everywhere that after the church's dissolution "Cácilia" there should be no more singing life in the district.
It has now become a legend: At a bank in Tinnenbusch they raised the MGV 68 albums out of the baptism.
That was 50 years ago.

About her marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband
On the dream ship, Heide Keller became the star.
Now she's open about the fact that the series might have been guilty of a co-existence with Hans von Borsody.
Her role as Chefostest Beatrice of Ledebur on the "traum ship" made Heide Keller (76) famous, but on January 1, 2018 she went on board forever.
The series she was given to the star could be responsible for her divorced marriage to Hans von Borsody (1929 - 2013), with which she had been married for ten years.
"That could also have been a reason.
As I grew up with this work, I traveled alone with a suitcase around the world, and many of my amazed colleagues took me for granted," Keller tells us in the conversation with the "Picture on Sunday".
First of all, she was always only "the wife of Hans von Borsody", but this changed with the dream ship.
For now the journalists only called at Heide Keller's.
"If he liked it so well, I don't know."
She considers it possible that her husband at that time might have been totally naive, but "how many men also shot Hans' talk about problems and feelings".
Keller has always tried for Hans von Borsody "to be the only right person and he wanted to know my fears, not my weaknesses.
That means good German: I understood," as she further explained.
She's always felt like "not good enough for him.
He saw in me an emancipated woman who I was never really, even though I appeared on stage sometimes often and courageously.
I wanted our love to be forever."
After a previously failed marriage to Thomas Härtner, Keller once again said yes, "although I was afraid it might be a second time too."
On the day before the permanent mourning, I sat in the wardrobe and wanted to give up everything.
The marriage to Borsody also broke out.
Why'd it ever stick with the men?
Because I wanted too much.
Keller had the love at the time "as shown in the film.
Unfortunately, this vision is not daily.
I'm too naive to get into love."
The nightfaller who regularly explores the city's nightlife in the NZZ resort Zurich has this time moved to the ZFF opening party.
Our fold is not a motto, but a little light.
And the green gloss, in which a green carpet is carved on the sixth floor, blinds it over the fee.
But it is still film festival, where more or less celebrities want to shine in the light of light.
So on this late Thursday evening, he will dry up over the place to relax in the Aquaclean-WC-Oase.
This is called the public toilet facility sponsored by a large sanitary company, which celebrates its premiere at the festival: The necessary event in the partnership of a new pavilion has a lot of work to do to provide a luxurious atmosphere.
At this evening, however, it stinks in the Lord-Oase for any reason to heaven.
So out here, on the other side of the street: Loaded guests who have just attended the "Green Book" opening film in the cinema at the best level, celebrate the start of the festival with a party in the three-story shopping house each year.
His name fits perfectly to this film festival: The works shown are known from all the earthballs.
What does not have to do with an article about this festival in order not to fall into fraud for its 190 partner companies?
The traper binds himself with a belt around the felters who have attached a good fairie to him, and two bullish doorkeepers actually swung him in.
In the morning, the loads force, they dance long after midnight to live music or can be dictated by DJ rhythms to which they climb each other, and spit down with Cülipi exquisite hippies.
In the subterranean delicacy shop, oysters are waiting for slender coins, next to the unparalleled Rohschinken Culatello di Zibello is freshly cut off, a chocolate fountain is spread.
And the hammer is: All the sales rules are completely exclusive products have not been cleared for the occasion.
This has been so for years, so it seems to work without great losses.
You must love this country for it!
The foldr studies the sign at the roll-step: "Take a long dress, please be careful on the roll-step".
If the two separate instructions were to be, he would have been in the dress code.
But it is a conditional construction, and it has certainly saved lives.
In the department of household goods at the top of the hill, the bird buys a cocktail prepared with Espresso called "Golden Eye", suitable for the Festival Award.
The price for the best drink is not compulsory for this mix, with which a capsule manufacturer presents itself.
And George Clooney, who has been throwing on the brand for years, is not here at night either.
However, between local prominence, cascentian and kitchen articles, there is a face over which appears to be known to the observer: Peter Farrelly, the director of the opening film.
It should not be far from his main contractor.
And really: Viggo Mortensen, with almost sixty acting like a dormitory, by the amount.
He's not dressed, he's not dressed, he's got a lot of stealing.
Especially for this detention, like to misunderstand as a custodiality, international stars love this film festival.

"But then suddenly a dress has gone through the team," said Bielecki the second quarter hour.
For the break, the rest consisted of only two doors.
In particular, the best of sending, Marius Hintze, met in the phase about another time.
After the change, it was even better from the visitor's point of view.
After 33 minutes, David Ernst appeared at 15:15, followed by the staff changer almost continuous.
Four minutes before the siren, the lead still seemed to be relaxing three hits (29:26).
And then?
Take the unparties into the events.
Bieletzki tends to be concerned about finding fault with others.
But: The 120-second time penalty, the Steffen Mühloff cashed, "was a joke".
LIT had a good laugh and met up to the end four more times - while the tenth U.S. also escaped in the last attack.
The boys fought great, also against seven men standing well and always throwing on the empty gate.
Only they can buy little for the compliments.
"Now you have to win a damn victory," says the restless running Bielecki.
U.S. Tower: Hintze (9), Ernst (6), Schläkl (4), Kretschmer (3), Kümper (2), Mühloff (2), of the Pol (2).

Elon Musk, founder of the Tesla electric car manufacturer, has been removed as head of the billion-dollar company.
He and the U.S. stock exchange supervisor SEC were extrajudicially involved in a dispute over misleading Twitter news, in which muscle could have lost the license to run listed companies.

Tesla would have been assessed in total with 72 billion dollars.
Later, the muscle ran back: Tesla stayed at the stock exchange.

Inquiries: 46 percent want Merkel not up to 2021 as chancellor
After the polls last week, the GroKo will cancel several survey reports.
The SPD falls in a questioning behind the AFD - Angela Merkel is seen critical.
Berlin - The AfD has taken over the SPD in the Emnid Sunday trend for the picture on Sunday throughout the country for the first time.
In the weekly survey by the Institute of Opinions, the AFD adds a figure of 17 percent, the SPD gives a point in comparison to the previous week and lands at 16 percent.
Also CDU and CSU lose a numerator and only get 27 percent.
This is the deepest value for the Union so far in Sunday's trend.
Greens reach 15 percent, left 11 and FDP 10 percent.
If the Federal elections were on Sunday, the government parties would receive only 43 percent of the votes, according to Emnid.
As a result, the large coalition of all major research institutes - with the exception of Allensbach - has now lost the majority in the Sunday question.
The government parties reach 43% to 45% of the votes (Allensbach: 51%).
At the 2017 federal election, they received 53.4 percent together.
For the other parties, the bandwidth is also large: the AFD, in several surveys the second-strength party, is 15 to 18 percent.
The vote will reach 12.5 to 17 percent.
The left is on average 10 percent, FDP at 9 percent.
For statistical reasons, such inquiries have an uncertainty of 2 to 3 per cent up and down depending on the vote.
But also the retention for Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in the population has been significantly reduced since the 2017 Federal Election Day.
Currently, only 48 percent of the citizens find that Merkel is the right person in the office, as the Emnid inquiry on behalf of the BamS.
Only every second (50 per cent) the survey today wishes that the large coalition will hold up to the next regular federal election in three years, 41 per cent for a new election.
Also in a further survey published on Saturday, there were significant popularity benefits for Merkel.
The Germans also assess whether Merkel should again apply for the CDU presidency in December.
47 percent are according to Emnid, 44 percent on the other hand.
64% do not want a candidate, 35% do not want to join the Union.
Extensive to Aldi: Reduced to Love's Happiness
Is Aldi going to Tinder 2.0?
Who says that in times of Tinder, there are no more romantic acquaintance stories - that should be discussed at Aldi's time about potted meat.
Munich - In times of digital fast food dating through Tinder and Co., the supermarket broadcasts almost an anachronistic romance as a place of knowledge for the great love.
Yes, right, a conversation about reduced pouch meat, boxer shorts on the wharf or the favorite pudding is in doubt still a better story for the later single children than a simple right-hand swap.
The app Tinder is called to be less a contact, but rather a sloppy stock exchange.
We've been waiting for the test: How do women react, but in the first message, they don't go around the hot breeze for long?
Here's the amazing result.
Normal Hollywood Lovestory potential has it then, if the love luck is ahead of an out-of-eye loss and re-founded plot.
If the type is also reported under the e-mail address bio-putenfleisch@gmx.de at its offers, then it sounds very good to Meg Ryan, Hugh Grant and consorts - Romantic Comedy at it's best.
So it is the author of this ad in an unknown Aldi branch that she will also wish to find her dreamer, with whom she has dealt briefly with the "30 percent reduced bio-puten meat".
For the faith in the magic of the analogous know-how, she earned her Happy End à la Hollywood anyway.

Football: District League: Researcher's appearance of the VfL Wolbeck against the SC Altenrheine makes courage
There were moments in this still young season, as Alois Fetsch went to court with his heart.
He gave himself the coach of the football-bezirkslist VfL Wolbeck, only to go back (in-house) to smile about the lack of performance on the green.
All history.
In the meantime, it's going around the brandhove road again.
The 1:1 on Sunday against the SC age-rehein, in the past play time, is only harrowing on the rise.
Yeah, I'm very pleased with the performance.
"We made the rooms tight and put pressure on the ball.
This could be seen," Fetsch praised his boys and sought out each individual after the party to simply say "thank you" for so much opposition against the ambitious guests.
The coach had to perform a system change after 26 minutes.
After the injury of Nico Frerichs (muscular problems) - for him came Luca Rehberg - it went from the 4-4-2 almost seamlessly across into a 4-2--3-1, where Niklas Thewes waited in front of the ball.
Wolbeck had significantly more play parts in the first section.
And chances.
But Frerichs before his aus (17th), the changed Luca Rehberg (26th) and Jan Schroer (38th) missed the leadership.
Almost this would have been the case when the SCA in minutes 41 twice in person by Kevin Vollrath and Chris Naberbämmer had been put in danger before the Wolbecker caste - Tormann Damian Hallas proved to be the master of his class.
After the break, the VfL took full control.
Thewes of 18 meters barely escaped.
Schroer also came too late after 58 minutes at a thewes entrance.
With the exchange of Miles Geske, Fetsch of the left-hand side again missed a fresh cell course.
When the 70th minute Robin Westhues fell to the old house of Chris Naberbämmer, there was an indirect freefall 18 meters before the guest house.
The Foulte came on and demonstrated its danger to standards.
Westhues" thing with the right sleep hit down from the left from the point of view of protection - 1:0 (71.).
20 minutes to be damn long.
And then this: VfL-Captain Florian Quabeck fled in the 80s.
Shüseiin Sahin (Hamm) immediately pointed to the point.
Jannis Schneider did not leave the gift (79.).
Bange had to pass Wolbeck in the final phase before the Geske in the 87th minute of 12 meters but still had the victory match on the rifle.
Maybe it would have been too much of the good.
VfL: Hallas - N. Rehberg, Quabeck, Bodin, J. Schroer - Klemke (75th Seidel), Bensmann - Frerichs (26th L. Rehberg), Westhouses, Vielmeyer (66th Geske) - Thewes

Report of the Allbright Foundation: Women remain a rare figure in corporate offices
As a result, only 8 per cent of the heads of staff were female on 1 September, as stated in the report "The Power of Monoculture", officially presented by the Allbright Foundation on this Monday and presented to the German Press Agency.
"The companies will have to stand up differently, otherwise the international competitors will move over to them," said the founder-in-chief Wiebke Anchorsen.
In the United States, the United Kingdom or Sweden, purely male-occupied leadership teams - with few exceptions - are no longer possible.
The balance makes German competitors less diverse, innovative and future-oriented.
It's another company culture.
In addition, the small increase in the female share among German stock exchange companies was due to positive incentives for the companies of the medium-sized value index (MDax).
Although according to Allbright data, only 6.8 percent of the managers are female.
However, in the previous year, the value was still 3.8 percent.
In the 30 Dax companies - in the past years, the female share has stagnated.
Last, 26 women worked in the offices.
"I am sure that the Dax companies will be recruiting consistent women again in the coming year - in their own interest," Anchorsen said.
Only RWE and Heidelberg Cement had signaled that no self-obligation would continue to increase the share of "null percent" to date.
Another picture is shown in the supervisory boards: On 1 September, the female share was 30.5 percent - 45 women more and 68 men less than one year ago.
"In 2023, many women were recruited annually as well, and a 40 per cent share would have been reached," the report says.
Some even make misses: luxury socks: Which manufacturer deserves most per car?
The best deserves Ferrari.
The Italians take 280,000 Euros with each Ferrari sold and make 69,000 Euros operating profits.
Large cars, large profits: This slogan still applies - in most cases.
Who makes most of the prizes per cart.
Munich - Ferrari, Maserati, Bentley: How much are the luxury manufacturers per car that they sell?
With this question, "Autopapst" and Economic Professor Ferdinand Dudenhöffer have been involved.
His study shows: The differences are massive.
Ferrari made in the first half of the year with every car sold 69,000 Euros operating profit - Jaguar Land Rover, on the other hand, only about 800 Euros, Tesla and Bentley are able to put up with every car.
Mercedes, BMW and Audi are well in the race with prices ranging from 33,000 to 38,000 euros per car and about 3,000 euros before interest and taxes EBIT.

The wine Princess Lisa II later came symbolically with the guests from the stage.
"It's nice that so many have found the way to us again." Later, "The Troglauer" provided for the mood.
On Sunday, on which the Abtswinder Kirchweih was also celebrated, the anniversary association had set the drinks prices as 60 years ago in the afternoon.
A summer evening at the 60th wine festival takes place on Friday, October 5th, in the guest's house, before one day later in the festival goes into the second round.
In Bonn: Notarzta auto force in Taxi
A notary car is heavily damaged next to a road.
In the collision of the vehicle with a taxi, a 27-year-old passantine was fatally damaged.
When notaries are called, they should help - save the best even human life.
Such a rescue trip took a deadly end in Bonn for a 26-year-old.
Bonn - A 26-year-old pedestrian was killed in Bonn when a car crashed with a taxi.
The taxi driver, the notary and their drivers were severely injured, as the police reported.
The 46-year-old driver of the notarztauto had passed a red lamp on Saturday afternoon with Blaulicht and Martinshorn.
He was then on a crossroads with the taxi that drove to Green.
After the collision, the car slammed into a lamp mass and a tree.
He recorded the passantine who died in the accident.
Motor vehicle driver and taxi driver seriously injured
The 62-year-old taxi driver and the driver of the user car were severely injured in their vehicles and had to be released from the use forces.
The also severely injured 29-year-old notary was able to free herself, but the pedestrian could no longer help her.
Another former user tried this, however, without success.
The three serious injuries were taken to hospitals.
The police, in close consultation with the Bonner Public Prosecutor, determine who is responsible for the accident.
Manchester United loses again, for Maurinho we uneasy it
After the blamble out in the Ligacup, Manchester United is also lost in the 7th round of the Premier League.
Against West Ham United is subject to ManU 1:3. The manner of defeat may still be discussed.
The scene was impressive in the 74th minute, when Marko Arnautovic for West Ham shot the 3:1; only three minutes after Marcus Rashford had probably brought the Red Devils back into the game.
Since they suspected an offside during Mark Nobel's pass, all of Manchester's opponents remained, and Arnautovic left all the time in the world, the ball at the helpless David de Gea.
This was the negative height of an already far-reaching power.
It's quite different at the United City Hall of Manchester City.
The citizens trained by Mourinhos great competitors Pep Guardiola came against Brighton & Howe Albion to a nearby 2:0 victory.
After half an hour, Raheem Sterling, for the first time, crossed the barrier line of the outsider for the home team.
Sergio Agüero took care of a good hour and a double pass with the former torguard to secure the sixth victory in the seventh game, thus also for the jump to the table top.
Liverpool no longer a table leader
Three days after the 1:2 defeat in the Ligacup, Xherdan Shaqiri fought with Liverpool in the Premier League a 1:1 against Chelsea.
As with the Cup-aus, the Belgian Eden Hazard was the best man in the Londoners.
The 27-year-old hit in the 25th minute remained until the final phase of the only hit of the game.
Shaqiri, who came to the field in the 66th minute for Mohamed Salah, missed the compensation shortly after 70 minutes.
It was better with Daniel Sturridge in the 89th minute with his slender.
After the reds with a smooth balance started in the week, Chelsea was not to be struck for the second time.
At first, the Londoners eliminated the team of Jürgen Klopp in the Cup, through the Remis in the League, the Blues Liverpool was still broken from the table top.
Like City, the two London City Clubs tottenham (in Huddersfield) and Arsenal (against Watford) also celebrated 2:0 wins.
The fans of the Gunners, in which Granite Xhaka played, however, had to face the surprise team from the Hertfordshire County until the 81th minute of success.
Nine minutes before the conclusion, Watford-defender Craig Cathcart posted an entry from Alex Iwobi unhappyly into his own door, only two minutes later, Messut Özil took care of his third season meeting for the decision.
Arsenal, thanks to the fifth victory in the wake of Watford and is again behind the great rival Tottenham on Rank 5. A strong impression continues to be left under his Portuguese coach Espirito Santo.
At 2:0 against Southampton in the League, the wolves remained unarmed for the fifth time and placed the 8th place.
VW core brand missing: Pariser car salon in the sign of the Diesel debate
The Pariser Automobile Salon takes place every two years in exchange with the IAA in Frankfurt.
Paris - Officially no topic and yet all-present: The Diesel Canal and the ring for driving bans and replacements should not leave the German Auto Group even when meeting the industry in Paris.
At the 2018 Automobile Salon, they will show their new features, along with the competition from all over the world in the French capital.
The diesel does not actually play a big role anymore.
However, the possible exchange and replacement offers for diesel owners in Germany, which are still to be negotiated with the government in Berlin, should at least be an important subject behind the glowing scenes of the trade fairs.
A great name is missing in Paris: the Volkswagen Group is with Audi, Porsche and other daughters, but not with the VW brand itself.
Audi and Mercedes-Benz are there and have, among other things, their first pure electric models: the e-tron of the Ingol city will come to the market at the end of the year, the EQC of the Stuttgart 2019.
Both were officially presented.
The next one of BMW is due to start in 2021.
The new 3rd is centrally located in Paris.
In total, more than 250 exhibitors are represented this year from 4 to 14 October.
In addition to car groups, motorcyclists as well as numerous mobility and software providers are present in their own halls.
The fair, which this year celebrates its 120th birthday, takes place every two years in exchange with the IAA in Frankfurt.
In 2016 a million visitors were well received.
In the severe earthquakes and the following tsunamis, at least 380 people died on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Tens of them are still missing.
In addition, there are more than 500 injured persons.
On Friday, the island was bombed by two earthquakes.
The first leg had the strength 5,9, the second one had the strength 7,4.
Communication and transport connections have been damaged, there has been enormous damage to trade.
After the bees, the tsunami broke down over the west coast of Sulawesi.
In the coastal city of Palu, hundreds had gathered on the beach for a feast.
It is feared that the numbers of victims will continue to rise significantly.
So far, the figures are only from Palu.
However, many other municipalities are also affected - along the Sulawesi West Coast.
Some 150 bikers celebrate God’s service in Verdahl
Motorcycle Pastor Frank Schröder (right) from Herne celebrated the final service for the motorcyclists in the church of Peace in Eveking on Sunday.
Verdohl - The place before the Peace Church in Eveking belonged to the motorcyclists on Sunday.
However, the final Goddess service for the biker was on the program.
Frank Schröder is the motor-pastor within the Evangelical Church of Westfalen and thus responsible for the soul-surgical interests of the PS-strong two-wheeler.
Between April and September there will always be a month of traditional motorcycle service (MoGo) at the house Nordhelle.
The end of the season is traditionally celebrated by the bikers in the church of peace in Eveking.
There, on Sunday, about 150 bikers gathered to do anything other than regular service to God.
From 10 a.m., the bolides were held in front of the entrance gate of the church.
At first, the biker breakfasts were on the program and it could be strengthened with coffee and cakes or even with a strong currywurst.
In addition to the MoGo team, the Holy Riders, a Christian motorcycle group from Gummersbach, were also present.
The sermon was held during the biker Goddess service Pfarrer Dirk Grzegorek.
The Singer-Songwriter Valerie Lill provided for the musical underwriting.
"Although the biker prefers the Blues Rock, Valerie Lill rather beats poetic-silent sounds," said Fr. Frank Schröder.
This too was certainly a novel in the history of the motorcycle service yesterday.
Carrots Home Association celebrates a great feast: After the apple comes the milk
And even on the actual day of action, Borisch was active.
She provided her hungry guests with freshly prepared apple pancakes.
Georg Hartmann-Nieerg also had a great interest.
He had his apple press in his pocket and demonstrated his stunning spectators step by step the process from mature apple to apple juice.
Then and when Hartmann-Niemerg left the children the field and let them fill the apples in the large trunks.
With a little muscle strength, the apples became a finely trimmed mass.
Still, many of the children were not able to imagine how they would once have a delicious drink.
However, this important step was also possible at this late Friday afternoon.
Packed in shapes and covered by nets, Georg Hartmann-Nieerg stacked the little pieces of apple that look like heckling good layer for layer.
Thanks to some technical support, the last step of work was not so difficult.
The freshly pressed juice ran into a large vessel.
However, the horticultural farmer also had already completed specialties.
So he opened his "Schatzkiste" and presented the oldest visitors with the latest feder whites.
The demand for the good drop "Made in Fuchtorf" was accordingly large.
In a cozy atmosphere, the parents came to the conversation, while the children could not only follow the apple press process, but also discover the built-in Hüpfburg for themselves.
Also active in the horrid comradeship of former soldiers engaged in the festival and invited to some stations to play for a short time.
In the coming year, the home association will also offer a day of action.
Then, as Gregor Krützkamp stressed, the home will not be in the heart of the spargel village of the place of the event.
Instead, a farm will be visited.
This is also because of the topic: finally it will go around the milk.
1:4 against Frankfurt: Hanover with the fourth season square: "Descend situation"
Frankfurt/Main After the fourth federal league, coach André Breitenreiter gathered his disappointed professional from Hanover 96 and spoke up to them.
However, many positives were previously shown at 1:4 (0:2) of the last table at Entrach Frankfurt.
"It's a fucked-up situation, but you have to get out of there as a team," said 96-footballprofi Primer Schwegler and said, "This is of course disappointing, because you always take a lot of care."
The other Sieglos Lower Saxonys, for which only Florent Muslija (86.) was joined, are standing down with two figures and are in their current constitution a descending candidate.
Guided by the outstanding Ante Rebic, Frankfurt celebrated the first season victory.
Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th minute, Rebic (45.+1), Jonathan de Guzmán (59) and Luka Jovic (89) reached the door for the DFB Pocal Sieger in front of 46,300 spectators, who, following the successful general test for the Europa League game against Lazio Rome with seven points in the middle field of the table.
Croatia's Vice-World Master Rebecca was involved in almost every dangerous offensive of the Hess and never received from Hanover's defense.
The shock caused by the WM for a long time showed why it is so valuable for the invasion.
In addition to Rebic, the Brazilian Allan, borrowed from FC Liverpool, was the first time in the initial formation of the Frankfurters, who began to move.
One of Lucas Torró's headballs on the tornnet (17th) was at risk for the first time.
Six minutes later, Sébastien Haller was arrested in a search-rich position at the last moment of the 96-war on the Brazilian Felipe, who replaced the short-term Kevin Wimmer (Rücken).
The leadership for the household owners fell almost compulsorily and fully earned.
Filip Kostic picked up the ball after a rejected corner in the courtroom, Haller extended by head before the door where Ndicka only needed to stop the foot.
It was the first German league match for the French second-legged AJ Auxerre in the summer.
And Frankfurt left before the break.
This time Haller fit in with his storm partner Rebecca, who was able to think through and 96-Torwart Michael Esser left no chance.
In the half-time Hanover-Coach responded to the weak image of his eleven and brought two new offensive forces to Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt.
However, the Lower Saxonys now played a bit more courageous forward-looking, closing ideas remained to the end than the connection meeting still reached.
The Hessens were much more efficient.
After a few hours, Rebic started a solo and then placed around De Guzmán, which had only to slide the ball into the empty door.
The rest was for the Frankfurter against the overloaded guests only stairs up, and Jovic also met a minute before the end.
Morlaix Square Becomes Party Mill
In spite of the cold temperatures, the city's party was in a good mood.
The Munich Mayor Dieter Reiter created it before a million audience at the opening of 185.
Munich Wies'n in the last week with two blows.
Geisingen: Geisinger Christen celebrates Holy Cross-Fest
The Geisinger Catholics celebrate the Holy Cross Festival on September 14th or Sunday.
The festival service takes place in the city church, then a procession to the Holy Cross church with the final sign.
The Holy Cross Church is home to the shot Christ, who comes out of the war of the 30th year and who should have shot the legend after a Swedish soldier.
Then blood comes out of the gunshot.
From this, a great walk to the shot Christ, which then led to the construction of the Holy Cross church, developed.
This is not completed until today, only the old room stands, the missing long house is indicated by the trees.
In his sermon, Pastor Adolf Buhl reminds us that the cross is a sign of hope, comfort and life.
In spite of the importance of the Geisinger Pfarrey, the ministry was badly visited.
After the service of God, the procession took place to the Holy Cross Church and, with the conclusion, the church part of the Crossfest ended.
For many years the Catholic Church has been inviting the world part of the festival to the Catholic parish.
The members of the choir provided the visitors with hearty food as well as a large selection of cooks and the weather, farmhouse.
In the afternoon, the parish community also offered guided tours around the city church, Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmid-Veger informed the visitors on behalf of the parish about the damage to Fassade, roof, sandstone works and windows, as well as the upcoming construction measures that will continue until next year.
After some time, the damage could be detected more accurately and the individual tenders would be prepared more specifically.
It is certain that the renovation is more expensive than planned, because the damage already present a few years ago has become greater, but more has been found, which was only possible by the appearance of the eye through noise.
Sockel casting works are completed, before winter they are to be started with natural stone work and we hope that half of these works will be completed this year.
Convenient: New residence in the New Ulmer Münsterbigsträße
Donau-Iller's life aid opens a new residence for disabled people in Münsterbigstraße.
That "a very special house" will now be handed over in the Münsterblikstraße - all present agreed at the time of accession.
Finally, the twelve wheelchair drivers who have been living in Donau-Iller's residence for some time have been pointing to the special architecture of the new building.
Wider corridors, floors and doors, larger rooms and accessible access for all areas, Architect Rudolf Bader has taken into account in his concept.
The first plans began about eight years ago when the former U.S. Army official building was put to the test stand for the inhabitants with the phonecap: "The house had come in the years and no longer in time in the equipment," Bader said in a look.
In 2016, the bakers turned on to tear down the house.
The new building should be as friendly and bright as possible so that the inhabitants can feel comfortable there, so the architect.
Life support Donau-Iller opens new residence
Around 4.6 million euros invested in the construction of life aid.
The Frestatat was EUR 2.4 million, the district of Schwaben 450000.
According to Architect Bader, the construction works remain in the planned framework - time and financial.
He also thanked the managing director of life aid, Jürgen Heinz.
The spagat between a barrier-free and at the same time fire-proof construction has not always been easy.
However, the planners and crafts had built a home with the many regulations that allowed the inhabitants to experience freedom to move without any help.
Similarly, the head of the social administration of the district of Schwaben, Gertrud Kreutmayer, expressed himself: "The house is oriented towards the special needs of its inhabitants, who need the means to be mobile."
The habit and functionality were well combined, Kreutmayer said.
And further: "The property in this situation is a real coincidence, because it is no longer to be acquired in the present situation."
Overall, the new residence in Münsterbigstraße offers nearly 1500 square meters of space for 30 people with disabilities divided into three categories of dwellings.
Stolz is Heinz's life aid manager to the eleven full-time staff who are all employed at the rate.
Germany: Swiss accused Differences between East and West
Berlin - Prior to the day of the unity, the vice-president of the SPD, Manuela Schwesig, has appealed to all the people of the country, not to meet with the defeat of East Germans.
There are differences that hurt unity after almost 30 years.
With these differences, we cannot satisfy ourselves," said the Prime Minister of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern on Sunday.
The goal should remain to create equal living conditions throughout the country.
It is unacceptable that East Germans worked on the average longer than the people in West Germany, but that 15 percent less.
"I can't explain that to anyone almost 30 years after the German unit," said Swiss.
North Korea: End of this dirty dog the Korean conflict?
The one-year Pungsan-Jagdhund is to smooth the roads between the two Koreans.
In an effort to relax the relationship with Seoul, Pjöngang has made South Korean President Moon Jae a gift in two North Korean Pungsan-Jagdhunde.
As Moons' Office announced on Sunday, the two dogs reached their recipient for about a year already on Thursday.
They then crossed the border of Panmunijom along with three kilograms of dog feed to make the animals "enlighten the apartment".
The dogs with the thick white fur, sharp ears and brown eyes are considered loyal and intelligent.
They are part of the national cultural heritage of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
The friendly gift had announced to the North at the third summit this year between Moon and the North Korean mighty Kim Jong Un in mid-September in Pjöngang.
Both countries also agreed to join in international sports competitions such as the 2020 Olympics and jointly apply for the issuance of the 2032 Olympics.
In the course of the mutual approach Kim also agreed to include the Tongchang Ri test facility for rocket engines.
Austria's moved history in mirror of 99 documents
What is Austria?
For the 100-year anniversary of the Republic, which has been celebrated for almost ten months since this year, numerous new books have been published, which most often answer this question in the light of the past hundred years.
On the other hand, Wolfgang Maderthaner, historian and Director General of the Austrian State Archives, in the magnificent "Image Book" Austria, which will appear on 1 October.
New week, new opportunity for the government
Back to professional work - this is the informal motto for today's Great Coalition working week.
Almost an interview, hardly a speech in which the chancellor and his ministers from CDU, SPD and also from CSU did not last have the "back to the work" mantraally.
This may have led so many handicrafts, doctors, cashiers and other commercial citizens in this country to the right question, which is what the difference is between work and work, but be that way.
If the Federal Government is now so much to devote itself to its task again - to the government - then it should not be stopped with the concept debate.
If the Union and the SPD can actually bring something else together after the provocations and blasts of the last few weeks, it may already be shown on Monday.
In the evening, the Heads of Government will meet with the Coalition Committee.
Chancellor Angela Merkel now wants to call this round regularly to remove conflicts early; a lesson from all the struggle.
First of all, however, there are conflicting issues on the agenda with diesel equipment and the immigration law.
CSU Minister of Transport Scheuer wishes to allow the car companies with exchange premiums to come forward, SPD and CDU see the manufacturers in the obligation to refurbish older diesel technology.
While an approach has been drawn up over the weekend in the diesel crisis, the Union and the SPD are still far apart from the proposed immigration law.
The SPD calls for a sustainable perspective for rejected asylum seekers who work or do training.
The Union is strictly against the "striking" of the asylum system in the labour market.
So there will again be a dispute among the coalition partners - and how should it be different?
Not the same and the same has joined the Groko, but three partners with partly very different company figures and priorities.
The fight is good.
Without a dispute, a society that is so diverse and among its conflicting interests does not advance.
However, in order to be constructive, the dispute must not be brought up again for partial reasons on the question of his or her own.
It's still about politics, not theater.
The Union and the SPD are going to fight - but they always have the reality of people's lives in view.
What is makeable and benefits many?
With this guide, both the diesel and the trace exchange question can be clarified pragmatically - and thus regain confidence.
This is why the parties must now fight.
Pilz checks working hours at Hartinger
Minister in Visier
Does the Minister of Labour break the law in force?
Daniela Holzinger wants to take a closer look at this.
"A real day and night" had worked on their legislators on social security reform, a super-violent social minister reported at the presentation two weeks ago.
In the case of Liste-Pilz-Mandatarin Daniela Holzinger, the statement of Beate Hartinger-Small (FPÖ) is a surprise - it now brings the matter to Parliament through a request.
She said, "that the Minister would only express her enthusiasm for the use of his team and would not, in any case, declare violations against the applicable service law in front of current cameras".
Nevertheless, she now has questions to be able to free Har tenger from any suspicion.
Police are looking for women's bodies on a road
Marxgrün - Lange didn't want the police to express themselves.
Now there's a confirmation.
Since early Saturday morning, the state street between Naila and Bad Steben has been buried.
The route is still closed in the Marx green area until Monday.
It was predicted that the investigators had previously used an archaeology dog.
The dog, specially trained for the smell of old human bones, together with its leader, could finally limit the relevant place to a few meters.
In addition, a soil anomaly was discovered with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the Upper Bavarian Mental Protection Authority in the area of the said street.
For more than a year now, the Court of Justice and the Criminal Police have been working on a missing case.
Again and again, at Marxgrün, a bike route was blocked and a sonar device was investigated, because the investigators suspected that Heike's body could have been blocked here on the train of the state road 30 years ago.
Colour powder and eggs: Krawale in Barcelona before Catalonia-year-old
On Monday, the controversial independence referendum in Catalonia is held for the first time.
But before that, it's coming to Krawalen.
The separatists have not forgotten the police use since autumn 2017.
Barcelona - Shortly before the anniversary of the Catalan independence referendum of 1 October 2017, there were clashes between separatists and the police in the centre of Barcelona.
Catalan security forces were attacked by the independence officers, among other things with color powder, when they wanted to prevent them from approaching a demonstration of the National Police and the Civil Guard.
About 3,000 police officers from the police station, the National Police and the Guard Civil, wanted to honor their colleagues, who were in use last year as an illegal referendum in the lobby halls.
In an attempt to prevent citizens from voting, there was violence at the time.
The Catalan police had formed a chain to keep the demonstrations of the separatists and the central security forces separate, reported Spanish media.
Some of the 6000 separatists, however, had attempted to break through the police lines, and the officers had, among other things, thrown paints and eggs.
Six persons were arrested, 24 others were easily injured, it was called to the authorities.
The independence referendum is the first time on Monday.
Following the vote and a subsequent decision to split Spain's prosperous region, the central government in Madrid had placed Catalonia under forced administration in autumn 2017.
The then Regional President Carles Puigdemont fled to exile to Belgium.
Other politicians also moved abroad.
On the other hand, several ministers of the then regional government and other activists of the separatist movement are still in U-Haft.
New elections were held in December in the region.
After the entry into office of the new Catalan government in May, the compulsory administration was terminated.
But also the new Regional President Quim Torra is on the "right to self-determination" of the Catalans.
Football: Upper Westfalls: Collected wirelessness: FC Gütersloh and RW Ahlen separate torlos
Red-White Ahlen continues to take place.
Also at FC Gütersloh it was only a 0:0 undecided.
The final light and the third was released in front of 438 spectators at the Heidewald Stadium as a collection of advicelessness.
The first half was horrified by the entertainment factor.
Therefore, anyone who wanted to get a beer or a brat could do this without concern.
There was no danger of missing a torchance because there was virtually no.
First shot after half an hour
Nick Flock was responsible for the first (unarmed) torscouse of the whole party in the 28th minute.
The best - and in principle also only true - the ahleners had the opportunity when Cihan Yilmaz FCG-Torwart Frederic Westergerling forced to a parade after 32 minutes with a shot from the parade border.
Even more harmless were the hosts.
Their most effective action was in an early shift.
Storm Lars Schröder had to be replaced with a condition of injury, for him came Sinan Aygün.
After the change, both teams decided to do something against the growing length of time.
In the 48th minute, Sebastian Mützel aimed almost 18 meters above the house and after an hour, the goods were also released for the first time.
After a ballerover by Matthew Wieckowicz it went fixed.
The newly submitted counter about Sinan Aygün "krönte" Nick Flock (62.) with a shot in the arms of RWA-Torwart Bernd Schipmann.
They also played with a headball by Wieckowicz (66.) after an Eckball of the ex-Alenner Tim Manstein.
RWA Intermtrainer Angelo Daut reacted, first brought Marko Onucka to Martin Fuhsy (60th) and a little later Enes Güney to Sebastian Mützel (70th).
It worked - nothing.
More than optical superiority thanks to its own initiative, the Ahlenians did not stand.
Just in the 91st minute, Cihan Yilmaz had the last chance, but they also didn't bring in anything.
Angelo Daut continued to try to get the positive out: "I like that we played at zero". But unfortunately, the zero also stood in front.
"We were not as dangerous this time as we were against woodwives and even though our opponent had no desire to play here," noted RW Ahlen's Interim trainer.
Offensive "placing everything like this" against a team, "that just wanted to defend.
I certainly didn't feel like we could get a opponent," said Daut.
However, as an observer of his suffering, he did not feel as if his team could shoot a door.
The idea was too clever for this.
Reckonfelder Erdedankmarkt: Good luck there are plenty of creamers
The happy Brigitte Ransmann, Petra Gronemann and Elke Fritzler from the spreadsheet table editions for which these donations are intended.
The Honorary Officers assure: "These donations also remain in Reckenfeld".
At the opening, the sky appeared bright blue, the space was still empty, but this should change during the day.
For, "Here it is, so nice to meet you, so we are here today," said one visitor.
Organiser of the festival Franz Josef Holthaus welcomed the guests in Kiepenkerl-Outfit as always with a regular price humor.
For the couple Brockmann, which should actually be weighed against food, Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer are in a short time.
Verena (daughter of Ferdi Kreimer) has become ill.
But there are plenty of Kreimers.
And the "resurrection" was not allowed to take place, by means of musically entertaining the growing visitors.
This was so good that a few members of the people were accompanied in a few hours later.
"Simply great," Marcel Kreimer rejoiced.
Mayor Peter Vennemeyer was able to spend the opening time this time in his timetable.
He is pleased with the many assets with their stands, including mainly associations.
"In fact, there should not be something like a table," he thanked himself for the action of the man's body.
Andreas Hajek praised the use of all those who were in use at the stands and also closed the other festivals held in September and the "Clean up" action.
Our garden town has a colorful stretch - here's something.
Then the maikranz was removed from Georg Knorr and Gerd Klück with the help of the firefight and brought to the winter quarter.
In many villages it was worked for the physical well-being.
From sweet to heart, everything was to have.
Stefan Hagemeyer, who has only lived in Reckenfeld for a year, has been creative at his discovery.
Furnier work, beer lid with spreadsheets motivated and a few more he had in offer.
A specialty was offered three rack fields: "Reckenfelder Honig", accompanied by Maria-Theresia Smolka, Christian Wedershoven and Helen Roth-Buchschlütter.
The last name has another specialty in it.
Honigkuchen in glass, of course with honey from my own production.
Then the little Elsa had to go back to her, so the kitchen tasted good.
Sociality is the one that allowed visitors to stay for long to the evening hours, even without a stage program that doesn't exist during the autumn festival.
Drainage with local policy message: No successful advertising for tax facility
In Lengerich, strangers have spent hardly any support for the construction of a tax facility.
In several places, there are corresponding sewers, says Jürgen Kohne from the city administration at the request of the WN.
At least one case has been reported to the police for damages.
In large letters, the three words "Scatepark für Lengerich" are drawn on paintings, including at the Gempt Hall and at the Old Rathaus.
Michael Rottmann, manager of the Hall, reports that after the Job Election Fair on September 19th, a corresponding sign on the billboard was discovered at the step-up to the Gempt-Bistro.
Since the short message was apparently left "only" with an Edding, they can be removed without problems.
"Just a few days later, however, this time it was blown up again," said Rottmann.
He assumes that the corresponding advertising charge must be replaced.
A special note is given in this case by calling on the table several large companies from Langerich.
If the tax facility is built, it will also be made possible by sponsors.
Promises already exist, Jörg Hesselmann explains from the urban area of the school, sport and culture, without names.
But it is possible that one or more of the sponsors are identical to those companies on the damaged table.
For years local policy and administration have been working on the subject of taxation.
After the old LWL clinic was demolished, after some time the search for an alternative location began.
Finally, the Council spoke mostly about the firearms park.
This sense was not translated into itself - too many factors apparently spoke against a building in this place.
At the end of June, a turning point followed.
The members of the Main and Financial Committee now voted unanimously for the Gutenberg School area.
Jürgen Kohne says about the state of affairs that the administration is currently in the middle of the concrete planning process.
The last word is the City Council.
He left this year with a decision so that a positive vote could be built in 2019.
Engpass when a flight is safe is getting worse
Frankfurt/Hamburg After the European air traffic show in the summer, the German fleets do not see any signs of improvement in the coming year.
"In this year we had wind, 2019 we will have strong wind and then the storm will come," said the head of the aviation insurance trade union, Matthias Maas, the German Press Agency before the airport summit on 5 October in Hamburg.
An important reason for the numerous delays and delays in flights has been the long-known staff note on European aviation security, for which there is no quick solution.
"The airlines and airports can achieve rapid improvements for the coming year, but the training of new lots takes four to five years," the trade unionists said.
The market for pre-trained lots has been emptied across Europe.
Only in the centre of Karlsruhe to monitor the upper German airspace were about one hundred people missing.
Maas again criticised the fact that various air transport unions were not invited to the summit.
In Hansestadt, on Friday, representatives of the federation, countries, aviation security, airlines and airports come together to address the causes of delays.
"If you want to talk about additional work coverage and overtime, it will not go without us," said the Head of the GdF, who has many members at the German air insurance agency.
Maas again made the EU commission responsible for the fate missions.
The traffic forecasts for the current regulatory period until 2019 have been too low.
The cost estimates and staff savings resulting from this in the national aviation insurance sector are now fully involved in the operational business.
Maas appealed to Federal Minister of Transport Andreas Scheuer (CSU) to apply to Brussels for regulations that "do not cut the air off".
At present, the EU challenges would be matched by 2024 and there would be further aggravation.
The EU has been constantly exposed to lobby printing from the airlines.
"Ryanair Chief Michael O'Leary and his colleagues are now reaping exactly what they have been sitting on in the last few years," Maas said.
He hopes that the high latent costs of airlines led to a rethink.
The GdF will only contribute to improving the situation if the German Aviation Insurance (DFS) offers a "vomit training and future pact", Maas said.
The year-to-year recording of 120 lottery students over the next five years is just enough to offset the old-age departures.
The necessary staffing is not yet connected.
Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board for Group Construction
The members of the Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board voted unanimously for the plans to rebuild the Group.
Following the will of Thyssenkrupp-Interim Chief Guido Kerkhoff, who was appointed Chairman at the meeting on Sunday, the crisis group will be divided into two independent companies.
Both companies are supposed to have their seat in food and be listed at the stock exchange.
An additional reduction in staff over the already known reductions in the administration should not be allowed.
After two retreats, the control body on the capital side only counts eight heads.
Ten of the employees are facing it.
However, the final decision is expected to take a major meeting in 2020.
The new Thyssenkrupp Materials AG will include, among other things, the 50 percent share of the merged steel business with the Indian partner Tata.
In the second company Thyssenkrupp Industrials AG, the business is to be mixed with lifts and supplies.
Barcelona: Violence in demos by policemen and Catalan independence officers.
In two simultaneous demonstrations by Spanish policemen and Catalan independence advocates in Barcelona, there have been violent clashes with numerous injured people.
According to the city administration, some 3,000 police officers from all over Spain gathered on Saturday, as well as some 6,000 independence officers.
The Catalan police tried to keep the two protests away from each other with a big offer.
According to the use forces, however, independence advocates repeatedly attempted to break the security suspension.
They had attacked the officers with color and shooting.
Ranges were also reported among participants in the various protests.
According to rescue forces, 24 people were injured.
The police reported that there were six arrests.
Improved salaries and recognition of colleagues
The police, with their demonstration, wanted to honour the colleagues who had been holding an independence referendum in Catalonia almost a year ago against the Spanish central government.
At the same time, they demanded better wages.
Members of the Spanish police and the Guardia Civil feel that Catalan and Basque police officers are much more worthy than they are.
The demonstrators were told as a provocation that the Spanish policemen calculated in Barcelona demonstrated.
"Why did they come here to protest?" asked the 55-year-old Catalan Protestant Manel Perez of the news agency AFP.
Just to provoke and celebrate the fact that they had poisoned us a year ago.
A 31-year-old police officer from the Balearic Islands, who wanted to mention his name only with Daniel, returned the proposal.
"Of course we want to support our comrades, who have only done their duty last year: to defend the law," he said.
But the demonstration is to exercise our rights and we do it in Barcelona because this is a great European city and there is more echo here.
But he and his colleagues were "not coming to provoke," the policeman assured.

Football: Juve Trainer Praises to Top Party: Ronaldos Best Game
The Portuguese Star stormer "played the best game this evening together with the half hour of Valencia", praised Juve-Coach Massimiliano Allegri after the 3:1 (1:1) - Victory of the record champion against the SSC Naples.
For the coach, the expensive Star was also bought without its own gate of the decisive man in the important party against the persecutors.
"Ronaldo had a lot of fun and was doing well," said Allegri.
Even if we started with tactical errors, Ronaldo was very good at our first door - and we have grown from the moment.
Thanks to the three tortoises of Ronaldo, Juve turned the game after the early retreat through the hit of Dries Mertens (10 minutes) and hung the worst pursuer first.
The Torjäger, who was taken up by Real Madrid, first introduced the former Bundesliga-Profi Mario Mandzukic, who took care of the leadership with a double pack (26/49.).
And Ronaldo also carried out the preparations for the meeting of the rebel leader Leonardo Bonucci (76), who had to move just before the torso.
"There are many templates," said the coach.
But of course, Allegri also wants to see doors from the attacker, who is both in the Champions League and in the Portuguese national team of record-tors.
"We need to be even better there to serve him," asked the coach.
The best Juve-Torschütze is currently Mandzukic with four hits - Ronaldo has three on the account.
With the purchase of Ronaldo for more than EUR 100 million, the power of youth seems to become even more pressing.
Seven wins in seven games is the smooth series in the series A. At 21 points, the master of the remaining seven years has already six numerals ahead of Naples.
The scale of the table, trained by former Bayer-Coach Carlo Ancelotti, was not without a chance against Turin.
But not later than the place reference of the already heated Mario Rui (58.) the top party was decided.
The Portuguese had to go too hard against Paulo Dybala with yellow red from the square.
"We played well against a good Neapel," commented the Turin Coach.
Imre Can was also able to feel challenged.
The German national player went through with Juve.
The professional from the FC Liverpool was used in all seven league parties.
The middle-field editor also played in the Champions League party against Valencia, which Allegri meant with the "half hour": Ronaldo was fled from the place at 2:0 tournaments and was blocked for the home game on Tuesday against Young Boys Bern.
Kanye West changes his name
With a particularly short appearance, Rapper Kanye West has taken care of the "Saturday Night Live" show at the weekend.
Among other things, his joint performance with Lil Pump provided a mineral water suit for Stirnrunzels and Question Marks in the audience.
The 41-year-old also announced a name change on time to publish his new album.
Then you can only call him "Ye", so the musician.
"The Being, which was known earlier than Kanye West," he tweeted at the deceased singer Prince, when he declared his artist names.
However, the pseudonym is not a novelty.
The tenth album already appeared under this name.
In an interview with the broadcaster KRL, the artist had explained that "Yes" had a religious meaning for him.
"I believe "Ye" is the most commonly used word in the Bible and there it means "du"," said the rapper.
Football: Circle A1 Pattern: Final!
Done!
Hoetmars Trainer Averhage did not make a hero out of his disappointment.
It was a weak game of us today.
The opponent was just more aggressive, we put him as well as never before in the face of problems.
Grade once two torchance in 90 minutes, so that only rare games can be formed positive.
Football Kreisliga A1: SC Hotmar is subject to SG Send Horst with 0:2 (0:1) Photo: Heinz Schwackenberg
The SG also had only two options in the first passage, the first but used Mike Krause from the point of view to the early leadership (7).
In the 43th minute, he could have increased the steps of Uphus, but after great preparation of Krause he distributed freely.
The hosts had only a double opportunity as the first Moritz Höne on Torsteher Jos Schuhmacher escaped and found his master at the Jan Blome Subschus in the Sendhorster Keeper.
After the break, the guests became even more dominant and had a number of good chances.
But Uphus (49), Julian Turl (61), and Heinz Linnemann (69).
A treatment meter - Louis Kortenjann had saved with his hand on the torline and saw red for it - Niklas Eilmann was also unable to use it for the guests (75.).
Only when Nils Berheide held the ball over the line, the party was decided (81).
"We had been criticising ourselves hard before, which was different today than in the last few weeks," said Florian Kraus.
Sendenhorst: J. Schomacher - Linnemann, Scholz, Eilmann, Mey, Kraus, Krause (77 Berheide), L. Hartleif, Uphus, Abu Dalal (90 Leibig), Turl.

Football: Circle A2 Patterns: Spectacular football in Albacht: GW Albersloh is subject to Concordia with 3:4
"I don't even know what to hold on to," he said.
"We didn't even have access to it." With which he necessarily meant the wings with Colby McGill and Janis Kröger, but perhaps also all the other green-whites that attack with collective offensive force.
Nevertheless, he was able to laugh: "A dirty victory," he said still, bungled out and pulled his players on the other hand, the relief was to note that they had taken three points out of the deal.
Well noted, after a duel of two teams, one of which, namely albatross, plays for the championship and the other, Albersloh, fight for the classroom.
With understandable mixed feelings, GWA coach Sven Lewandowski looked back at the 90 minutes behind him.
"That was our best season performance at a distance," he says.
"As we return after the 0:2, as we've been keeping up with one of the top teams of the league, this was already really phenomenal."
Even worse, you have to drive home with empty hands now.
Top-Torjäger Lars Zymner led the hosts with his 12th season meeting (24th).
He needed exactly two ball contacts in this game for this door.
The 2:0 he placed on the left side a pattern for Fabian Fröhning (39.).
We knew it, but such a player can't hold out completely.
"That was crazy already what he had done," Lewandowski admitted to the opponent's quality without hesitation.
Shortly before the change of the side, his own eleven made the compensation: McGill's left-hand freestout sealed between Hövelmann and Concordia-Torhüter Hinkerohe through to the long tower (45.).
After the change of page it was again McGill, who obtained the compensation (59.).
Then it went on and on.
It was a stupid, action-loaded game.
Nübel shook the albatross again (64.), only five minutes later looking Patrick Horstmann (69.).
Despite too many, Albersloh was no longer able to trace the last Concordia hit (80.) again.
We now have to focus our full attention on Wednesday.
"The game against sheep, that's what we need to win now," Lewandowski said.
Albersloh: Spangenberg - Hecker, Strohbücker, Adolph, Zur Mühlen - Kröger (87th Diallo), P. Horstmann, Thale, McGill - Hövelmann, Bonse (87th Bareksai).
Doors: 1:0 Zimner (24.), 2:0 Frying (39.), 2:1 McGill (45.), 2:2 McGill (59.), 3:2 Clouds (64.), 3:3 P. Horstmann (69.), 4:3 Julkenbeck (80.).
Yellow-Red: Atalan (74./Albachten).
Football: TSV Straßberg fighting point against Primus
There was no winner in the Landesliga duell between the TSV Straßberg and the FV Biberach.

Media: The total presidency of Dynamo Dresden retreated
The entire presidency of the football-secondist Dynamo Dresden has returned to media reports.
Several media agreed on a joint letter from the congregation of Saxony in the evening.
A confirmation of the association was not before.
The reason for the withdrawal should be internal power struggles with the former federalists.
Erdogan in Germany: Politics instead of pump
Good thing he's gone again.
There are only a few public guests whose departure in Germany provides as much relief as those of Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Three days was the Turkish President in Berlin and Cologne, and many thought he should not have been invited.
Evangelical Academy Tutzing: prominent guests and new offers
The Evangelical Academy Tutzing offers some 80 meetings until the middle of next year.
As a result, France's President Emmanuel Macron has signaled that he will want to collect the tolerance price personally in Tutzing.
For Christian Wulff, the term of office was too short: he was not a German president at Tutzing's Evangelical Academy.
But before and after, Wulff was there for guests.
So he was taken to the Academy Director Udo Hahn, when he proudly said, "All the presidents and chancellors were already with us." That at the Academy in Tutzing Castle, there was still a prominent feature, but at the presentation of the annual program, there was also a theme.
At the end of October, singer Konstantin Wecker took part in a meeting on spiritual experience in a philosophical perspective, on 29 September, the writer Frido Mann is at a meeting on his grandfather Thomas Mann.
Meanwhile, France's President Emmanuel Macron has also promised: He wants to receive the "tolerance price" awarded to him by the Academy personally in Tutzing, which also receives television moderator Dunja Hayali in another category (we reported).
The approximately 80 meetings until mid 2019 have been held.
"The rent is not safe!" is in a meeting title.
"SOS at the borders of Europe" - the Academy describes the "risk and deadly route across the Mediterranean".
"And to a meeting about Syria: "Barbarai without limit."
Weapons, destruction, torture, death - the war hinders every human idea."
From structural racism in society to radical change of work through digitalization, the spectrum is sufficient.
The Academy Director Hahn was convinced that "a free democracy needs places where a civil society can meet to look for solutions or at least partial solutions".
At a meeting to 200.
The birthday of Karl Marx soon awaits a more visitor to the direction of capitalism-critics, the others rather a trend "from left-handed to middle".
What does it look like with neutrality?
"We are, indeed, 100 percent of a daughter of the Evangelical Church," said the study director Dr. Ulrike Haertel, "so we are not 100 percent neutral".
Music Cabaret: Gender understanding with Heart - Wolbeck - Westfälische News
"Both for adults and for men" was the musical cabaret with Tina Teubner on Friday evening in the hall of the Christian Church in Wolbeck.
As a Cabaretstine, Teubner presented the gender understanding, not only with humor and warmth of the heart for the (sympathetic) woman and (sympathetic) man and what else there may be, but also with music.
The mini guitar put her in and also mastered her violin.
On the wing, Ben was beaten.
He is one of the male sparring partners, who, amongst them, comes to the conclusion of the sentence, to the other a true pianist: So congenial harmoniously accompanied by Suvrup Teubner, that some may wish a solo.
It was also, with Beethoven and Chopin, but otherwise, just as it fit the red thread of the evening.
There, Teubner had put in a paradox: the satisfaction of the man comes, if he has a partner, but it does not open the door.
A closed door without a partner does not bring any benefits.
The piano solo now demonstrates itself: What would come out of the composition of Mozart, would "the Nannerl" open the door unexpectedly?
This is how suffrage moves in improvisations, from Bachs "O main full of blood and wounds" to the "song of death", and from Mozart g-moll symphony into a playful dance.
There was great applause and "Bravo" from the full hall.
The flowers were presented by Karlheinz Kleintje, the treasurer of the association, the chancenette.
However, the president of Heidemarie Markenbeck did not take any additional thanks.
She had the idea that the Duo, next to the events in Stuttgart and Frankfurt, would also enjoy one in Wolbeck.

Handball: Women's Landsliga: Ahlener SG keeps against TV Wattenscheid near the white West
The Ahlen girls had problems, especially with third-party player Caroline Stallmann, who only marked ten hits.
"In fact, I was well satisfied with the defense, only one player made too many doors.
We didn't get them in the grip," says ASG Coach Dogan Ayodogdu.
However, he was more upset about the many opportunities he had left behind.
The concentration finally left his team missing this time.
The ASG was therefore almost to the end of a retreat behind, was at the break at 11:12 and later at 15:18 (45.).
By the end, the wider bank of the guesthouses was crucially remarkable.
In addition, Ayodogdu laid back Merle Clement on the left, which then made "extreme clever the decisive door" (Aidogdu).
ASG: Buschkötter, Bolte - Bruland (2), Pump, Exner, Clement (5), Colbatzky (5/3), Drewes (1), Schlautmann (1), Deventer (6), Baer (1), C. Fitzzek, Ruschhaupt (4), S. Fitzzek.

At the second-higher VC Allbau Food, the blue-whites said with 3:1.
"That was a huge step for a cool season.
It makes Lenz play in the top third of the league.
We have now worked this out," Coach Dominik Münch was pleased to see his team's almost taboo-free performance as a dissatisfaction tablekeeper.
The first passage dominated the guests almost by love.
Over 4:1, 16:10 and 22:12 he went to the Visemiers of the previous year with 25:15.
Food has been accepted in the double line, but has not come into the game.
We did a good job.
Our opponent has been at high risk, but also produced several road maps.
In the second sentence, the BSV led with 12.8. "The food has turned the adoption into a three-line line.
We couldn't keep the shock pressure.
Eating has taken a turn, and we've let ourselves in a little bit," said Münch.
At 18:17 the volleyballers had the nose for the first time.
Although east-east was turned off at 19:24 and four belts, the fifth attempt found its purpose.
"The game was now a better class," the exercise leader was at the rising level.
Mike Rüdingloh and finally Wiebke Silge contributed significantly to the fact that the BSV turned the sheet in the third section from 14:16 to 25:21.
Munich: "That's where we played consistently and quietly."
Over 7:3 and 15:13 the blue-white passes four with 25:22 on their side.

International: Turkish municipality: Moscow opening as a missed opportunity
The Turkish municipality in Germany (TGD) has criticised the way in which the great Ditib mosque in Cologne was approved by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
"The Moscow opening in Cologne has left behind in the German-Turkish relationship a scrap heap, which can only be returned to a difficult time," said the president of the TGD, Gökay Sofuoglu, the German editing network.
Both the Turkish and the German sides had missed the chance of a common, comparative appearance.
"On the side with German top politicians to stress the membership of the Muslims to Germany, Erdogan has used the term for its purposes," Sofuoglu complained.
The extensive exclusion of the German public has "strengthened many reservations".
Heimatverein Nottuln: Offer has already been established
After the long summer break, it is again a folk meeting time.
On 18 October at 7.30 p.m., the Heimatverein Nottuln already held its fifth Nottuln Folk Meeting in the fireplace of the Old Amtmannei.
Almost on the day it is then a year that we have made a public meeting for the first time.
In the meantime, this event has become a solid part of the musical calendar of events in Nottuln," says Hans Moormann, president of the Nottulner Home Association.
I wouldn't have thought that our people met so quickly in Nottuln eta.
Regardless of the stormy Friederike in January or the heat wave in July, the fireplace of the Amtmannei was always fully occupied.
"The program is always a colourful mix of German folk, hiking and sailing songs, folk songs, Evergreens and old slogans," says Karl-Heinz Stevermüer, who is always invited by friends to nottuln.
Klaus Spellmeyer promised his accordion for the first folk "Birth Day".
He has been a member of Gaitling for many years, a group from the nearby district of Steinfurt, who played music with flat German texts.
Now he's on his way with an Irish folk band.
The authors of the People's Meeting remember the last event in the summer when Christoph Schulz from the Emsdetten People's Meeting with his international version of the song "Froes in the Night" thrilled the audience and sent them home with a earworm.

From pure fruit cultivation to ecology
With a gala in the Dr. Stamberger Hall, the 125-year-old constitution of the Association for Garden Construction and Land Care was celebrated.
On September 29, 1893, with a fruit show in Kullbacher Association, the last foundation impulse for the Kulbach Association for Garden Construction and Land Care was set up, and just 125 years later he celebrated a great anniversary in the Kullbacher Town Hall on Saturday.
At the time, he was free to say otherwise: "As Bezirksobostbverein Kulbach City and Land" he was raised from baptism by Mayor Wilhelm Flessa in 1893.
Also, the purpose of the fruit building was different from today's work - it actually went clean around the fruit building, about flowers and gardening at that time no one thought about it.
"At that time, in the epoch of enlightenment, the fruit tree was a favorite child of the elites," explained circuit overseer Günter Dippold in his performance.
Fruit trees should be planted on remote roads, so-called industrial gardens were established in schools.
The construction of the dam is still a task of the 55 gardens in the Kulbach district, which includes almost 7,000 members.
But this does not make the spectrum far-reaching.
A natural garden building, biological plant protection, village decoration and food play a large role as well as the means of knowledge, healthy nutrition and youth work.
As diverse as the task areas of a garden building association are, the members of Hutschdorf's youth group "Maulpurfe" showed entertainment at the stage.
"The youth work is particularly urgent in the digital age," said the circuit president Günter Reif, and also OB Henry Schramm stressed how important experiences in nature are for life.
The Kastanien collection was a huge thing for us children, I doubt that you can collect similar joy with smartphone & co..
Schramm promised to plant two trees together with Landrat Klaus Peter Söllner for the anniversary.
"Where to stand, the Association of Circles decides," Landrat Söllner added, and highlighted the special importance of gardening associations for the villages.
The circle association stands for ecology, beauty of the garden and green areas in the village.
The fact that this is a real concern of the many gardening associations in the rural district also left no doubt about it.
He conducted the many visitors with a presentation through the long history of the circle and reported, among other things, the need for self-care after the war.
Previously, everything came out of the garden for the winter.
At the end of the 50s, however, the garden turned into a garden of land and habitat.
"The nature has existed, it was already before us and we have to focus on it," said the expert for fruit and nut trees.
Therefore, it is necessary not to leave behind for the gardens to keep our home beautiful and vital.
This includes welcoming the new citizens of our associations, the president of the Bavarian Association, Wolfram Vaitl, added.
"We have to stop the exquisite decline in insects, which we owe our children and grandchildren," Günter Reif concluded the successful feast, which was celebrated by the muzzlers of the music association Thurnau.

Priority to Nafta talks: Canadian Foreign Minister is a UN spokesperson
Mexico's government wants clarity in Nafta: they put both trading partners an ultimatum for an agreement.
The Foreign Minister of Canada now gives the Trade Agreement an absolute priority - and shifts its speech to the United Nations.
Because of the pressure on the ring to renew the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) with the United States and Mexico, Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland has moved her speech to New York's UN General Assembly.
Instead of today's Saturday, the minister will speak only on Monday before the United Nations plenary meeting, her speaker, Adam Austen, told her.
In the meantime, they focus on the renegotiation of Nafta.
Mexican Economic Minister Ildefonso Guajardo had stated on Friday that the negotiators of Canada and the United States would have agreed 48 hours of time if Canada actually wanted to join the trade agreement that had already been reached between his country and the United States.
In August, the United States and Mexico agreed to a recast of the Regional Free Trade Agreement with Nafta.
US President Donald Trump pointed out that Canada could be excluded from Nafta in the future.
The talks on a new layout have been going on for over a year.
Until Sunday evening (place time) they are to be brought to the conclusion, Trump's government wants to present the agreement to the US Senate before 1 October.
In the case of a failure of negotiations, Mexico's appointed president, Andres Manuel López Obrador, announced on Friday that he would try to reach a bilateral agreement with Canada.

Protests against Presidential Candidates Bolsonaro
The Brazilian presidential candidate, Jair Bolsonaro, who was injured in a mass attack, left the hospital.
The right-wing ex-military wanted to fly to Río de Janeiro, where he lives, after a report in the daily newspaper "O Globo".
After his resignation, it is still unclear whether the 63-year-old will be performing public performances in the South American country in the last week before the presidential elections.
At the beginning of September, the politician was attacked on the open road during an election event in southern Brazil.
Meanwhile, thousands of people went to the streets in several Brazilian cities to demonstrate against Bolsonaro.
Under the title "Ele no" (in German: "The Not"), women's associations had, above all, called for protests against the former military.
Also in the social networks, the associations made racist and women-regarding statements mobile against Bolsonaro.
A number of thousands of demonstrators were expected in the São Paulo Economist Metropolis.
In the capital of Brazil, the protests mixed with the announcement of the presidential candidate of the Brazilian Workers' Party (PT), Fernando Haddad.
He joined the post of former President Inácio Lula da Silva, who had been sentenced to 12 years in prison because of corruption and therefore cannot apply.
The presidential election in Brazil was held on 7 October.
As the former mayor of the millionth city of São Paulo, Haddad was in the districts until far behind the right-wing candidate Bolsonaro.
Although the "Trump of Brazil" has long been involved in politics, it presents itself as an anti-system candidate.
If none of the candidates reach the absolute majority in the first round of elections, there will be a single vote on 28 October.
Observers assume that Bolsonaro will not be successful out of this - no matter who he is against.
Bolsonaro is known for his hostility to homosexuals and blacks and for his conquest of the military dictatorship (1964-1985).
He's always shocked with verbal dissipation.
Another time he said the followers of Lula's left working party should be shot.

After a long illness: Danish rock legend died
The Danish rock icon Kim Larsen is dead.
The singer died on Sunday at the age of 72 after a long illness, his producer Jörn Jeppesen shared on Larsen's website.
On the deathbed, Larsen was surrounded by his wife and six children.
The musician has been treated since the beginning of the year because of prostate cancer.
Larsen was known to the band Gasolin', which was extremely successful in the 1970s in Scandinavia.
Their songs were influenced by international music sizes such as Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan and the Beatles.
After the dissolution of the band in 1978 Larsen was successful as solo artist.
He sold about three million plates in Denmark.
His album "Midt om natten" from 1983 is the most-selved album in Denmark.
The Danish Prime Minister Lars Lökke Rasmussen praised Larsen on Sunday as "the street boys", who was "against everything, but in all hearts".
The Chief of Government recalled that the monarchy-gender Larsen was born in 2010 on the 70th day of the Danish Queen Margrethe II.
Rock night in the shoe factory: volume on the air pressure level
"Here we stand, we take the bones and burn a concert evening with the strength of a tiger." Only the band names of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" lay such a recrimination of rock live music experience on Saturday evening in the Chamber of the Citizens Centre shoe factory close: Hardrock pur with three other friendly bands.
After the sound check and shortly before the start of the concert, the musicians even take time for a group photo.
There's no sign of lamp fever.
Then the rock protagonists from Ahlen and the surrounding area, all in association with the Booking Agency "Mosquito" from Olde, are thrilled to see the approximately 120 visitors of the "Mint Mosquito" rock night with their bands.
The Quartet "Tiger Bonesaw" with Frontmann and guitarist Dennis Hadrika also knows how to start the concert evening with the latest, unknown pieces from their own feet and the CD that will soon appear.
In front of the stage, the band is danced at the appearance for the vocal and pressful interaction of the band.
Although "Zugabe" calls are not to be heard, "Tiger Bonesaw" then leave the stage to the Trio "Here We Stand".
The hard print is not the same hardrock, while guitarist Sascha Bregenhorn, Golo Meierhenrich at the bass and drummer Kai Hölscher with her alternative, sometimes in the classic rock of the 1970s.
After the "High Energy Rock" of the "Tigers" the "Here We Stand" also comes to the guitar rock, which is also a synthesiser.
Not only is the seductive, just a lot of ballad-like "Take Me Home" exist through the exchange of melodic passages to the guitar-loaded rock riffs of the multi-layered songs.
The Quartet "The Ignition" from Tonnish Houses has since its founding in 2005 played a special level of awareness.
Full agility the band presents its hard print on Saturday.
The fact that "The Ignition" with its performances before a very large audience - recently documented in a film by Max Meis on the tour in China from 2017 - has special stage experience is obvious and unheard of.
Singer and guitarist Tim Jungmann in conjunction with the band also puts his own accents on the only night covered song, "Word Up" by Cameo from the 80s.
At the same time, guitarist Norbert Brinkmann provides a wonderful solo, while running through the audience.
Of course, a certain volume of sound is part of this hardrock concert: At the "Mint Mosquito" rock night, the sound discovery of the mixed team at the trier concert of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" is at about 98 decibels.
This is, for example, at the press air level, but it is still clearly under the control of the Wacken-Fesitvals, pointing to the "The Ignition" on its website.
Earwashing 120 decibels in dusene power as usual for the annual metal steel dichin in the north of the Republic, the ahlen audience does not need this rock night.
After almost four hours, the three bands of the tougher rock gangs have long convinced with their sovereign, virtuoso game and their own compositions.
"Here we stand, we have taken the bones and sealed a concert evening with the strength of a tiger," all three groups, freely in the transferred sense, can say at the end.
And above all, enjoy the great appeal of visitors.

A fatal accident at Essen/Mülheim Airport
There was a fatal accident at Mülheim/Essen Airport.
On a parking lot at Mülheim/Essen Airport, a sailplane was crashed on Sunday.
The pilot died in the accident.
A fatal accident occurred near Mülheim/Essen Airport on Sunday.
As the "West German General Newspaper" reports, a sailplane was crashed at the airport's fair parking lot.
The pilot had come to life.
As the "WAZ" continues, if the student had been on board alone - the pilot should have been an intruder.
The aircraft has already been on the ground flight for the time being.
The stop is only close to a stop at the airport.
But since this weekend, an October party will take place.
Mülheim/Essen Airport is located at the border of the city of the two Ruhr districts and directly on the road to motorway 52.
From the parking lot there is a park&Ride offer at large events in the dining table or the Gruga hall in Essen.
Trump goes up to Kim: "And then we fell in love"
The fact that the US President North Korea's power is completely well-founded Kim despite the nuclear crisis is not a secret.
Now Trump has made his colleague a legitimate declaration of love.
It also has to do with Kim's "wonderful letters".
At the age of 72, the married U.S. president became known as a new flame.
Tragic: It is a remote relationship.
In all public, Donald Trump made an unusual declaration of love on Saturday to the North Korean Emperor Kim Jong Un.
In front of supporters in the U.S. state of West Virginia, Trump found almost kind words for the half-old spruce of the ruling dynasty from Pjöngang, although in the ring around North Korea, he proved to be quite close to breaking.
"I was stupid, he was, too, and between us it went and here," Trump reported.
And then we fell in love.
Okay?
No, really.
And not only the conversations with Kim had made his heart melt.
He wrote me beautiful letters, it was great letters.
Your personal connection has also brought political fruit: Trump referred to the stop of all nuclear and rocket tests announced by Kim, even though critics have so far seen little more than lip recognitions.
That the affection for the "Rocket Man" - so Trump's nickname for Kim - should not be everyone's memory, seemed to be fully aware of the U.S. president.
In any case, he took the criticism to be expected when he appeared in a large sports hall in the city of Wheeling just ahead: "Donald Trump says they've fallen in love."
How terrible, how terrible is that?
It's so unpresidiumal.
But he cared a little bit about it, Trump explained and directed his signs to the multitude of people: "I have always told you it's so easy to be president."
But then there would not be 10,000 people out there to force the full Arena, but we would have only 200 people out there.
October Festival attracts many guests to Baesweiler
Baesweiler is best visited, emotionally and downcast by the sun: very varied and with a good shot of Octoberfestflair, Baesweiler's city center was released on Sunday.

Refugees thanks to video from Libyan prison saved
Nigerian refugees have pointed to their catastrophic prison conditions in Libya by means of a mobile video and thus enabled them to be saved.
The group had turned into their cell in the coastal city of Savija in July under threat of life and spread online.
"They refuse to send us back," said one man in the video message.
We suffer here, we die here.
The recording was posted on the website "France 24 Observers", whose editors alarmed the International Organization for Migration (IOM).
The refugees finally fled to Nigeria at the end of August.
"Without the video, we might not have been able to return to Nigeria," said Eféf Onyeka, who had recorded the video, the news agency AFP.
The 25-year-old was arrested in Libya in an attempt to get across the Mediterranean to Europe.
With the video, he was in danger of being killed by his own statement.
One of his fellow soldiers was nearly beaten by the guards to death, Oneyeka said.
In general, the prison conditions were catastrophic: "They beat us all with pipes and sticks."
They gave us nothing to eat, we had to drink from the latrine.
The IOM organises the voluntary return of refugees who are injured in Libya.
About 2,700 migrants from Nigeria were sent back to their homes this year using the program, IOM spokesperson in the West African country, Jorge Galindo.
The case of the Nigerians who are now in custody is not exceptional in view of the bad prison conditions in Libya.
But he hasn't heard from a phone video help.
International organizations have been criticising the state of the Libyan refugee camps for a long time.
The North African state, which is dominated to a large extent by militias, is the main country of migration on the way from Africa to Europe.
When a teacher went to the People’s School on Sunday afternoon to prepare her Monday class, she surprised a breakup.
At 4:50 p.m., the teacher entered the building over the main entrance.
In the front house of the 1st floor, she saw a man who ran immediately.
Just through a door, then over the roof terrace and from there over a ladder into the ground or the front seat.

Laschet encourages the rule of law in Turkey
Cologne NRW Prime Minister Armin Laschet (CDU) called on Turkey's state of law, according to his own statement, in a conversation with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
The relations between the two countries were currently "overestimated", Laschet said on Saturday after a meeting with Erdogan at Cologne Airport.
This concerns, in particular, the wave of arrests, the freedom of the press and religion.
He therefore made it clear at Erdogan that if relations are to be normalized in the future, if economic relations are to be deepened, that the rule of law is a very important prerequisite for this.
Laschet also reportedly spoke about the cases of Germans who are in prison in Turkey.
He has formulated the expectation that freedom of opinion will be respected.
Erdogan again stressed the independence of Turkish justice.
The conversation of Laschet and Erdogan was held in a short-term building of the Federal Ministry of Defence in Cologne Airport.
Originally, it was supposed to take place at the Wahn Castle, which the prisoners had rejected from political convictions against Erdogan.
Erdogan went on to open the Ditib Mosque in Cologne after the talk.
Laschet had lost a common appearance in the building.
But he said, "The Muslims who go to this mosque are also citizens of our country."
And we are also their contact partners - and not the Turkish President.
Lack of confidence in the United States: North Korea calls for disarmament
While US President Trump is not tired of stressing the success of North Korea's negotiations on nuclearization, the Eastern regime is a more nuisance.
Foreign Minister Ri is calling for a welcome to Washington.
North Korea Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has proposed to block negotiations for a nuclear-weapon-free Korean peninsula with its continued sanctions.
"The latest stop is therefore that the United States is building on forced measures that are deadly to confidence-building," Ri said in New York.
Disposal for North Korea under these circumstances is inevitable.
"Without any trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances there is no way that we can disarm ourselves as the first one," the North Korean diplomat said.
The fact that North Korea's criminal actions could be "a dream of people who don't know us".
In order to build trust, however, his country has stopped its nuclear and rocket tests and destroyed an nuclear test plant, which took Ri out.
On the US side, however, there has been no "response", the Minister criticised.
Because of North Korea's nuclear and missile programme, the UN Security Council decided three times last year on sanctions against the international isolated country.
US President Donald Trump and his Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo have in the past days urged the United Nations to comply strictly with the sanctions.
At the same time, the U.S. government is working on an approach.
In June Trump had first met North Korea's powerman Kim Jong Un.
After the first summit in Singapore, the US President seeks a second summit with Kim.
In October, Pompeo will again travel to talks about the end of the North Korean nuclear programme to Pjöngang.
Hot served: New kitchen with donations from the community
That they were actually in a youth meeting, of which the many visitors of the house of the open door Hot got nothing with: White blankets and flower jewelry on the tables and a large buffet waiting for the guests after the Erteddansk Goddess Service.
The young people of the HoT had a wonderful buffet with deliciouss from different countries in the new kitchen.
The institution was financed by donations from the municipality, for which the young people wanted to thank themselves for the food.
The start with the new facility was not easy, as Henriette Westbuer, the head of the HoT, recalls.
We had already filled our refrigerators before the summer break with food and ingredients and were well prepared on the big day.
But then the first day after the summer break came the evil surprise: a power drop had put the huge, two-part refrigerator out of operation, the food was wasted and had to be taken away.
"Now we had to start again from the front: we got very much support from friends and neighbors, but the children and young people wanted to create it on their own," said Westbuer.
And that's how they all packed up.
The result could be seen, the guests were thrilled.
"It can't even cook," praised a visitor, while Hokkaido basket soup was served or guests were allowed to serve Quiche, liver cheese or cakes.
"It's really great what the children and young people have put on their legs," said Pfarr Frank Beckmann, while Zaubererer Stephan Lamen with cartoons and other pieces of art for surprises.
Jürgen Sator leaves the NRW national board of the table
From hunger on criticism from his own ranks, the chef of the Esseneser Table, Jörg Sartor, has given up his posts in the country association.
Sartor had become widely known because the Essen table had introduced an arrest stop for foreigners.
He had already retired in July as Vice-Chief of the NRW tables, Sartor of the World on Sunday said.
There's too many of us in the back.
The head of the NRW, Wolfgang Weilerswist, expressed his understanding of the decision of his long-term representative.
The sharp criticism has taken Sartor.
"I can follow his step - there have been people who did not know exactly why the dining table does this."
But Sartor was still active for the Essen table - "six days a week, there's nothing going on," said Weilerswist.
Sartor again criticized colleagues from other tables in the "World on Sunday".
You must not pursue the approach, "without hungering the people in the city".
It is the task of the State to ensure that people are not hungry.
At a convention of the tables on Friday in Berlin, the Essenes did not participate.
"That's when I'm told too much sweet schmus," he said.
There are all of these social vulnerabilities that have criticized me at the time.

The VfB Stuttgart also won the first victory.
Against the yellow-red map against Milos Veljkovic already decelerated worth of Bremen before the break, the Stuttgarters had to be afraid at the same time.
Borna Sosa and the unmistakable Goalia Ron-Robert Zelier produced a kind of design owner that helped to compensate the guests in the 68th minute.
Seven minutes later, Gonzalo Castro led the VfB to the first victory.
In Wolfsburg, Michael Lang did not experience a completely happy but also a failed debut for Borussia Mönchengladbach.
The gladbachers who attended with the Swiss Quartet Yann Sommer, Nico Elvedi, Denis Zakaria and Lang twice gave a lead out of hand, finally played 2:2 and are still waiting for an outside victory in the VW city since 2003.
For Wolfsburg's compensation to 1:1, Renato Steffen was responsible with his second federal legislator.
On a 20-metre flat show of the Aargauer, Yann Sommer was powerless, as was the second match after an hour.
However, the trends at Gladbach are quite heated.
Alassane Pléa appears in the storm of the foals as a goalgetter.

Macedonians agree on new national names
In Macedonia, about 1.8 million citizens today agree on whether to change the name of their country in northern Macedonia.
With one yes, the overwhelming conflict with neighbor Greece could be resolved for almost three decades.
Athens had remained on a name change because of its so-called northern province and blocked every approach of Macedonia to the west.
The voters therefore also decide on future West integration.
The US had announced that the country could become a fast nato member at a positive outcome of the referendum.

SPD politicians: Johannes Kahrs married his friend
Almost a year after the marriage entered into force for all, SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his long-term friend Christoph Rohde.
On Saturday in Hamburg, the two gave their word.
A registered life partnership had not been questioned for them, Kahrs had previously said the "image" section.
He's been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is a resident political speaker of the SPD Federal Party and one of the speakers of the Seeheim County, the conservative SPD wing.
In the Federal Day debate on the opening of a marriage for homosexuals, Kahrs had performed an external review on 30 June 2017.
So he had proposed to the Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to have "stopped" on the subject.
"That was your Schabowski moment," he said in an adjournment to the random announcement of the DDR boundary opening by Günter Schabowski.
Since 1 October 2017, homosexual couples have been able to marry just like Heterosexuals.
In the past, they had been able to enter their lifelong partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with the marriage, for example in the right of adoption.
Day of garden: 400 meters of heck cut
There was a lot of work ahead of the members of the Children's Association and the Leprakunde Society.

Supported by the inhabitants, it went to work for about twelve supporters.
"We are doing this to reduce the costs," said the president of the civil society Walter Schröer.
And so did some of them.
Because of the hot summer, we're late this time, but luckily it's just a form.

Luckily, the workers failed.
The days will be shorter - this is what breakers want to make use of again.
So the police inspection Gauting mentioned yesterday the first attempt to break up this autumn.
The fact that it was left at the home of the family on the Kingswei Street is due to the alarm system.
This went off when the workers put their hand on Friday just 20 hours ago.
The rebels realized that the residents were not at home.
However, the alarm alarm was apparently surprised that they took the escape without delay.

Pleite at Hertha: Taken from the reality: Bayern v. Ajax requested
The predicate is unbeatable: The defeat in Berlin wants the FC Bayern "not to fall".
The next two classics against Ajax and Gladbach now determine the first phase for Niko Kovac's term of office.
The first small part of the new Coach Niko Kovac is not intended to increase to the greater spring depth for the Munich.
"One week ago you had the impression that we were invincible.
Now we've got a bit of reality," noted Thomas Müller after the winning 0:2 downside at Hertha BSC and asked for a reaction for the Champions League duell with Ajax Amsterdam.
Who knows us, who knows that we're really upset and that's why we're giving gas to Tuesday.
For the first time since more than a year outside, there have been no own gates, as at the same time in the preseason, two non-victims in series, lost the table lead in the football league first to Borussia Dortmund.
However, the overall situation is not as dramatic as the final phase of the failed Carlo Ancelotti at the end of September 2017, yet the record master must be warned.
The FC Augsburg at 1:1 with its running man-to-man tactics and the Berliners, through their playful needle stick over the outside, have delivered in three days two blue noises, like the last ones that appear to be overpowering.
"Those who know the FC Bayern know that we don't like it and we'll do everything we can to make us succeed again," Kovac said.
On the other hand, he and his losers in his hometown, however, were surprised to see his first defeat as Munich Coach, only at the once again incapacitated treatment with chances.
A victory against Amsterdam and against Borussia Mönchengladbach on Saturday would make the first interim phase of his term of office seem positive - otherwise the tone may be intensified.
So Kovac did not take any exceptional measures before the second class of the season after 2:0 at Benfica Lisbon.
After the free day on Sunday begins as planned the short preparation for the second pre-war game against Ajax, which also had sovereign ties to AEK Athens.
"Now it has caught us in two games, but we will also make our doors again," announced Captain Manuel Neuer.
As with the lost pocal finale against Entrach Frankfurt at the same place, Joshua Kimich Luduxt spoke in particular.
The lawyer acted as a mahner.
"I don't think that's all bad, we need to work it out again, because we don't make a lot of chances and make mistakes," said the 23-year-old shortly before he left the Olympic Stadium.
On the seventh day of the previous playtime, even the Bayers were behind Dortmund with five figures, which now took over again with a point of preference.
And so Kimich valued with an eyebrower at least positive that the public debate on the allegedly unbeatable Bavarians has now ended.
"Yes, that's good," said the national player.
It's good for the league.
DFB-Boss in Schussline: Özil-Cousa: Sharp Attack of Erdogan on Grindel
With heavy proposals, Turkish President Erdogan launched a ban on Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan in Germany.
Although DFB President Grindel sees mistakes, he defends the line of association.
Now a new post is to be created.
Berlin - On different stages, Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel fought about the height of dedication in the permanent battle theme Mesut Özil.
After the Turkish President strongly criticised the deal with the former World Cup in Cologne for opening the big Ditib mosque in Cologne, the DFB Chief of Staff defended the alliance line.
On the early Sunday morning, Özil personally announced the consequences of the case in the Mainzer ZDF "Sport Studio".
"In the future, we have to draw very accurate conclusions, because we also have many players with migration support in the U teams, so that something does not happen again," said the 57-year-old and wants to win a national player without migration support as other integration officers.
At the same time, Grindel reiterated that Erdogan was not for the values of football and DFB.
With sharp words, he had urged racism against Özil and Ilkay Gündogan.
Our birthplace in Germany and our Ilkay.
They have excluded them from this society because they were taking pictures with me in England," Erdogan said on Saturday in the city of Dom.
I could not honestly say that, as her president, our two young men, who have gone up to the German national team, were excluded.
Grindel referred to Gündogan's statement that he felt "appreciatively treated by the DFB" by the WM affair that had taken photos of the two of them with Erdogan.
At the same time, he announced that he would want to face players in the future.
That someone says, "If I win, I'm German, if I lose, I'm Migrant - that's not happening.
"That he has such an impression, I am very sorry," said Grindel.
We should have defended more at once, I've always said that.
However, he does not see a basis for a return of Özils to the national team.
As a follow-up to the Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic, who have family roots in Cameroon, will now be called an additional integration officer.
"If a person who has no migration grounds has a clear impact on society and football and says, "The issue is important, we need to take care of ourselves," it would also be an initiative to provide a better basis for our associations on the site where integration needs to work," Grindel said.
Despite criticism from his person after the WM-aus and the Özil-Afère, he wants to re-as President DFB again for the office next year.
"I do my job and try to make it as good as it is," Grindel said.
Yearly builds three accidents within three hours
Coburg/Rödental - As reported by the police, the 75-year-old caused the accident on Friday between 10 a.m. and 13 p.m.
The 75-year-old driver was first addressed by a lady on the red lamp in the area of Lauter's height.
He told the tenant he was driving against her car.
However, there was no staff exchange, as the 75-year-old could no longer find the lady on the parking lot.
A short time later, a telephone message went to the police about a driver who was coming down from the street and running against a driver.
In response, the man did not want the police on the spot and then ran away from it.
After that, the Rødtaler went home.
However, the renter has been in his place of residence, where he has lived for decades, procedures and when he turns a vehicle.
Finally, the police were able to find him and stop him.
His car showed significant accident damage.
The 75-year-old made a wrong impression and couldn't get away with much.
The damage is around 1300 euros.
Moorbrand in Meppen: Still almost 1,000 use forces in use.

This was shared by the German defence on Sunday.
As the situation continues to be stable, 70 honorary helpers have been removed.
Another reduction in the number of deployment forces has been planned, that is.
On the night of the Sunday, an overland fire was discovered and destroyed.

SPD politicians: Johannes Kahrs married his friend
Johannes Kahrs (SPD, r) and his husband Christoph Rohde left after her wedding the main church of St. Katharinen in Hamburg.
Almost a year after the marriage entered into force for all, the politician married his long-term friend in Hamburg.
They've been a couple for 25 years.
Hamburg - Almost a year after the marriage entered into force for all, SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his long-term friend Christoph Rohde.
On Saturday in Hamburg, the two gave their word.
A registered life partnership had not been questioned for them, Kahrs had previously said the "image" section.
If we're married, that's right.
He's been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is a resident political speaker of the SPD Federal Party and one of the speakers of the Seeheim County, the conservative SPD wing.
In the Federal Day debate on the opening of a marriage for homosexuals, Kahrs had performed an external review on 30 June 2017.
So he had proposed to the Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to have "stopped" on the subject.
"That was your Schabowski moment," he said in an adjournment to the random announcement of the DDR boundary opening by Günter Schabowski.
Since 1 October 2017, homosexual couples have been able to marry just like Heterosexuals.
In the past, they had been able to enter their lifelong partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with the marriage, for example in the right of adoption.
The referendum in Macedonia began on new national names
In Macedonia, the expected referendum began with a new name for this small Balkan state.
About 1.8 million voters are expected to decide whether their state will be called North Macedonia in the future.
This is because of its so-called northern province of neighboring Greece.
As a means of printing, Athens had blocked every approach from Skopje to the EU and the Nato for almost three decades.
If citizens vote with yes, they will also give the start committee for the West Integration of their country.

Switzerland launches electronic register for organ donors
The registry will facilitate organ donation and relieve the members of the family in stress situations.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs may continue to be taken only with express consent, notes Swisstransplant.
(dpa) On this Monday Switzerland will start an electronic register for organ donors.
This is intended to facilitate organ donation and to relieve members of the family in stress situations.
People who want to make their bodies available in the event of death can register there.
Your wishes can then be obtained in the case of Swiss transplantation.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs may continue to be taken with express consent, as in Germany, and only Swiss transplants.
It is estimated that 15 percent of Switzerland has a donation certificate, says Franz Immer, Director of the Swiss Transplant Foundation.
But only in five percent of the cases will a map be found at the crucial moment when possible donors.
In more than 60 percent of the talks, the people do not know the desire of the deceased.
"They must then decide in the sense of the deceased, which is often very burdensome," he said.
A similar registration system exists already in Great Britain.
In Germany, there are reviews to store information on the possible organ donation on the health card, as the spokesperson of the Federal Health Intelligence Centre, Marita Völker-Albert, says.
"There is no register in which people can record their wishes - per or counter organ donation," she says.
Federal Minister of Health Jens Spahn has spoken of a reorganisation of organ donation.
According to his proposal, everyone would first be considered an organ donor unless he or she objected.
Among other things, the Catholic Church rejects it.
14-year-old student is world champion in head fear
The 14-year-old student Tomohiro Iseda from Japan is the world champion in fear.
He spent the weekend in Wolfsburg against 39 soldiers.
This was shared by Martina Flame-Jasper of the Phaeno Science Museum, the place of the competition, on Sunday.
The 16-year-old Wenzel Grüß from Germany placed the third place.
The youngest WM participant was a twelve-year-old Japanese student, the oldest 74-year-old pensioner in France, as said chief manager Ralf Laue.
The IT professor from Zwickau (Sachsen) organises the competition every two years.
For example: 14.130 214 x 17.981.822 or 57.809.355 + 28 x 16.448.333.
Since viewers were not allowed, there was a show on Saturday afternoon, when participants came to the audience with a pocket computer.
Wenzel Grüß from Lastrup demonstrated how he holds a ball with his head in the air when calculating.
He is one of seven Germans in competition.
A total of 82 candidates from more than 20 countries tried to qualify for competition.
Welcome to Bielefeld two years ago as a 14-year-old.
With concepts such as superhero, genius or miracle child, organizer Laue can start little.
"He can train himself," he said.
Many participants spent several hours a day.
In India or Singapore there are even competitions targeted at stadiums.
The disciplines include, for example, the square root of six-digit numbers.
In terms of diversity, candidates are given the surprising tasks for which they must quickly find a solution strategy.
Here the Germans also had good chances, the chief judge said.
Otherwise, Asians are often in advantage because they are already more intensive in early childhood and with other effective methods.

Farmers may start on Monday with annual knee care
Schleswig-Holstein farmers are allowed to start with the annual Knickcare on Monday.
The unique "green valleys" in Germany have been marked for about 200 years by the landscape of the forested federal state.
The up to five meters wide tree and rupees are the "walderset" and for many animals and plants the last retreats.
Knicks connects, as Corridore spreads, living spaces, over which the exchange of organisms can still work, as said the managing director of the German Natural Protection Association (NABU) in Schleswig-Holstein, Ingo Ludwichowski.
Knicks are living columns
The Knicks were captured on the basis of a command of the Danish King Christian VI in 1766, who ruled over Schleswig-Holstein.
The "living columns" were not only field limitations and pastures, they also provided the farmers with fuel wood and bars for their trade houses.
His name "Knick" is still from that time: The dense, falsified boundaries could be developed through "Knick" of the essays.
Today, between the North and the Baltic Sea, about 45,000 kilometres of the Hectics are extending the image of a woody, multi-structured landscape.
According to NABU, about 7,000 species are currently used as replacement living space.
In a kilometer of knife, up to 1800 different species could live and up to 30 pairs of birds could be bred.
Its ecologically important function, however, can only be fulfilled if it is maintained in winter.
In other words, he cares for a light series of trees that also absorbs wind protection, Ludwichowski said.
According to the Ministry of Agriculture, the Knickcare may be operated only outside the Brit-time period from October to March.
After Tsunami on Sulawesi Indonesia, talk about the situation on site
The local Radika Pinto describes in the interview with the editing network Germany (RND) the situation on site on the island of Sulawesi after the earthquake and tsunami:
Were you on your own during the Tsunamis?
No, at the time I was just in Jakarta on the island of Java.
When the earthquakes were, my wife called me, she was in Palu.
When I learned about the tsunami, I immediately made my way back to Sulawesi.
I arrived on Sunday morning because after a flight I had to drive more than 20 hours since the airport was closed to Palu at the time.
How is the situation on the island now?
The national government has reopened the airport so that aid can also be entered.
When I arrived, I saw the houses on the coast, all completely destroyed.
Our office of "World Vision" is destroyed too, but we have temporarily set up something where we have kept other people.
Where are the people who live on Sulawesi now?
Many are led to surrounding hills, where they are still afraid of another tsunami and earthquakes, and where they have no access to water and food.
Some are standing in front of their houses, there are still remains.
Because many food businesses and also the tanks are completely closed, people partly clutter food and gasoline.
The public service is completely undermined, which helps the national government.
Even a prison was destroyed, the prisoners were partially free and the search for them was difficult.
There are still many bodies around, many people have not yet been found and are lost.
How does communication and information work on the island?
At the moment we received a phone call, however, it did not work and we only got information on the radio.
Many people are still searching for their children, neighbors and other people, from whom they do not know whether they live and where they stop because people were not at home during the earthquake, but for example on the road to work.
The Tsunami warning system did not work properly.
Do you have information about this?
We don't know the reasons for this, but when the alarm came, many thought, "Okay, no Tsunami" - and then he came.
In other regions that were not affected by the tsunami, there was the lack of information that a tsunami hit the region and they were called to the surrounding mountains.
Is not an island like Sulawesi on the Pacific Fire ring prepared for earthquakes?
But there are earthquakes every day, but this was the worst.
We normally know how we react to earthquakes and also train evacuations.
But the complete infrastructure is broken down, the earthquake has hit a lot of people.

A muscle blender riss usually heals within six to eight weeks, a muscle fiber riss usually heals somewhat faster.

Julian Eberhard's Biathelet The WM-Medaille
Place four at Olympia was Biathlet Julian Eberhard long in the stomach.
In the coming winter, the Saalfeldener wants to trace the missing precious metal at the WM in Östersund.
The last shot cost the 31-year-old in the Olympia-Sprint of Pyeongchang the next medal to be taken.
Seven tenths were missing at the end of the Bronze.
"I have allowed myself time to process this," Eberhard says at the opening of the MyGym fitness studio in his home city of Saalfelden.
A medal was the goal, I was in top shape, but it just didn't want to be.
More motivated is the pinzgauer to discover the missing precious metal in the new season: "The goal can only be to win something again with the constitution to come back to a major event.
Sometimes you have to hit it too.
The WM-loipe in Östersund (SWE) is located in Eberhard: "I have already closed the line," he recalls with joy at his fourth World Cup in the previous year's single race.

With the staff, he lived in Oslo (NOR) on rank two.
Board Kavanaugh: FBI investigation in Turbotempo
The time is extremely short and the number of planned acquisitions is greatly limited.
With an FBI investigation at the Turbotempo, the Republicans in the US Senate want to secure the high-end majority for the contestant Brett Kavanaugh, who is opposed to the need.
President Donald Trump has set a deadline for the investigators to explain the necessary events over 30 years.
The latest turn in the drama about the calling of Kavanaughs accompanied by a cultural struggle was triggered on Friday.
After an eight-hour hearing of Kavanaugh and the first prosecutor, Christine Blasey Ford, in which, in the course of the trial, angry Tirads against the opposition democracies, the Senate's judicial committee should open the way for the final confirmation of the jury's conservative judge at the U.S. Supreme Court.
The majority of Republicans seemed secure when Senator Jeff Flake suddenly declared against his original announcement that he would agree, but demanded an FBI investigation.
After stunning scenes, his party friends were allowed to enter.
President Trump, who had referred to the heavy maintenances on Thursday as "beschiss", first came up with further attacks on women and said, on the contrary, "luck in the accident".
In this way, the last doubts could be resolved, he said.
Later, Trump attacked the Democrats in an election campaign because they denied Kavanaugh: "They are trying to block and destroy."
Trump arranged an FBI investigation in the case of Kavanaugh
The White House has also severely restricted the powers of the investigators.
A government representative told the "Wall Street Journal": "They don't go on a fishing trip."
According to the New York Times, only four witnesses should be heard.
The mobile radar device installed in a "civil vehicle" of the town municipality of Ried for monitoring the Tempolimitis is stationed on the garden road, according to the city municipality from Monday, October 1.
There is also the Federal School Centre.
The municipality also operates several fixed radar boxes.
FC Schalke 04 after victory against Mainz: You felt the fear
Trainer Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 celebrated the first season against Mainz.
The relief on Schalke is great after the first season.
Nevertheless, against Mainz also played a role in the factor time.
Kelsenkirchen - In the meantime it is well known that Christian Heidel is a huge pessimist in football games.
This was no different in the home game against Mainz 05.
"I've seen every ball in there.
And there were many corners and many balls in our trap," said the sports director of Schalke 04 - and breathed.
Finally, however, it was still the king's blues to bring the barely 1:0 against the Rhines over the time and thus bring the first season victory under the roof and the field.
It could have been different.
After the leadership by Alessandro Creepf 11. the team of Chief Coach Domenico Tedesco had given security to Tedesco: "In sum, the first half was good, both playful and by pressing here," he apparently played a role with increasing playing time.
Create no header memory actually
"The last ten minutes have felt like two hours for me," Heidel said, "if the team was only half as nervous as I was at the bank, I can understand that."
The boys were afraid to give it out of their hands, so they kept retreating.
And defends the man and the mouse against the Mainz.
To save the first three figures of the season.
"We all have fallen a huge stone from the heart," said the creature, who had no significant share with his headball match: "I am actually the worst headball player in man".
But in the end, it's only the victory.
The relief was felt throughout the arena, of course also at Tedesco.
"We wanted to start in the beginning and make a fireworks," said Schalkes Chefcoach.
The victory was important.
Finally, we can enjoy a few hours.
I'm very, very happy for the team and the fans.
We have played intelligently, quietly and courageously, so we have to go to parties in 90 minutes
This is probably the biggest failure of the afternoon: King's Blue missed it rather for clearer conditions to worry about.
The possibilities for this were finally there, for example through the strong Yevhen Konpplyanka, which twice met the latte 59./72. or Amine Harit 62.
"Then it wouldn't have become a victory," said Tedesco: "I've already felt a bit of fear."
That's why I'm glad we won.
So he wasn't the only switch.
Fishbachau: smoke column in Leitzachtal 2 km visible
The smoke wasn't to be overlooked.
From about two kilometers away, a hiker in Leitzachtal observed a fire on Sunday at 13.30 a.m.
Now, the police are investigating.
Fishbachau - The cause found police and firefighting soon out: an unknown person had set a large area on a two-square-meter plane at Gschwänner Berg Müll.
According to the police, it seemed as if he had been watching the fire for a long time, but then left the mud unattended.
And that's near the forest.
30 Fishbachauer firefighters were involved in the alienation and destruction.
The police are now finding out about the fire foundation.
Prof. Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani discussed Integration: A discussion on eye height
In front of them is the author, Professor Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani.
He is followed for the repeated invitation of Ernst Reiling and Lore Hauschild.
"I've been tasked with bringing interesting people to Greven for many years," explains the founder and president of the "Court Field Meeting" - the association that cooperates in the direction of the evening with the association "Cultural Policy".
El-Mafaalani goes up very slowly in reading, describes the writing process of the book, talks about how difficult it was to explain the subject clearly.
With a lot of gestures, hand-held numbers and some or some joke, he brings the audience one of the most controversial themes: migration and integration.
Why do conflicts arise in spite of successful integration?
The Syrian author is responsible for answering the question of a metaphor.
The German society sits on a table, the migrants of the first generation on the cat table.
Their children grow up in Germany and want to go to the table.
The third generation of migrants was born in Germany, they have always sat on the big table and want to agree.
That leads to conflict.
Therefore, it is not decisive whether to agree politically on the right or on the left, but rather, "Am I for or against an open society?" he stresses.
First of all, then the round of discussions is on the agenda.
And there's a need to talk.
A Afghan refugee reports from his perspective, telling two teachers how they see successful or uneducated integration among students.
El-Mafaalani stands for, not on stage, a picture of the discussion: it is on eye height.
The sociology professor does not insist on his opinion, stresses that he speaks from the average, not from individual fate halls.
He is pleased that there is interest in the subject, because "first, if we understand what the problem is, we can find solutions," says El-Mafaalani.
During the next hour, he also had an open ear for the questions of the guests and also in Foyer, in preparing Kurdish specialities, to continue an intensive discussion.

Construction in Landsham: 100 applications for 20 plots
The need is obvious: over 100 interested people have applied for the purchase of one of the property in Landsham-South.
The municipality of Plining sold the first plots in the newly built area of Landsham-South on the free market.
This is shared by Mayor Roland Frick.
In addition, the application phase is completed for those 20 plots that offer the municipality more favourable conditions or prices - similar to the previous domestic model.
Good 100 applications have been received, so Frick.
"The documents are currently being examined" with regard to the application criteria, completeness and correctness.
According to the Plininger Mayor, it was the goal to have the candidate rankings for the 20 plots by the end of the year and to present them to the municipality.
Then the award could be made.
In total, 50 plots are created for single and double houses in the southern area of Landsham and four areas for multi-family houses with an estimated eight housing units each.
In the meantime, the solution is as good as finished, and the roads and roads will soon be asphalted.
One single floor and two of the multi-family houses belong to a private person, the rest of the municipality of Plining.
It sells most on the free market, 20 plots in the social-consistency model.
According to Frick, the two multi-family homes of the municipality are to be built as a affordable living room.
With a total of 16 apartments supported by the Free State.
Place for 200 people
Grob is estimated to create a living room for about 200 people on the area of the New Building Landsham-South area.
Not only is this: Now, at the beginning of October, it is said that Frick is starting to build a child’s day-care centre.
There are three child parks and three crippling groups, as well as a multi-purpose space.
The opening is scheduled for September 2019 at the beginning of the next year's children's garden.
So did Schalkes Naldo "great sport" also on the bank
For the third time not in the starter: Nevertheless, Naldo thanks to Schalke-trainer Domenico Tedesco.
Gelsenkirchen - After Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues for the third time, not in the Schalker Startelf, but in the exchange bank, the understanding would have been great for many people if the almost two-metre Brazilians had spoken so correctly of the hunger of the soul.
But when the Schalker players gathered after the 1:0 victory over the FSV Mainz 05 as usual in the Middle Circle and thanked Chief Trainer Domenico Tedesco at all his profession, the 36-year-old, named all the easers Naldo, said, "We have to thank Coach!"
"That was very emotional, that was a great sport," Tedesco later said about the reaction of his vice-capitán, who, despite his renewed reservist design, did not hold any bulk.
Probably Naldo, who was celebrated as the best switch in the past season, knows that he has actually not been on his training course - but has been given a break for good reasons.
A reason called load control.
It wasn't easy to tell him.
"It wasn't easy to tell him what I'm telling you honestly," said Tedesco from the moment he told Naldo that he wasn't in the beginning.
He's an important player, he's an important person.
But it's always about the thing, it's about the association," Tedsco reasoned on the step.
Naldo played against Bayern and Porto 90 minutes.
He's 36 years old.
It is important that everyone can get through right now.
And that we all keep on the boat," Tedesco explained the rotation that has recently also acquired Naldo.
And the Brazilians reacted to the wisdom of his advanced age, by also becoming a provocative champion at the bank.
The mood in Austria's industry has accelerated its speech in August compared to the Eurozone.
The purchase manager index (PMI) was 46.7 points on a 37-month step.
However, Austria, behind Ireland and the Netherlands, still has the third best mood, the Market Institute reported on Monday to its survey of more than 3,000 companies.
Unlike in Austria, the euro area SMEs increased by 1.1 to 45.1 points, thus the index is still under the 50-counter brand of growth on the 13th month.
In August, Ireland's only industry hit this threshold with 50.9 points.
Finally, the Greeks (42.1 points).
In Germany, France and Spain, the mood barometer fell, however, slower than in the months before.
In Spain, the index reached the highest level with 44.0 points since March.
"The slightly weakened speech could mean that the worst is overcome," said Market Econom Rob Dobson.
However, the industry remains one - in the third quarter anyway - growth brake number.
A rapid return to the growth zone is not in sight: the export orders in the Eurozone have fallen as strongly as since November 2011.
The companies therefore completed the seventh month in subsequent positions.
Also in China, industrial production fell stronger in August than at first.
The mood barometer dropped from 49.3 points in the previous month to 47.6 points.
Experts had expected 47.8 points first.
The purchase manager index is based on representative surveys of 3,000 European industry companies.
These include developments in turnover, employment, stockpiles and prices.
