The remains of UKIP who refuse those living with HIV are a perfect example.
You are talking about when Nigel Farage said that NHS should not be used to pay for those coming to the United Kingdom to make health tourism, and when, with that in mind, he answers yes when the interviewer specifically asks him whether people living with HIV are included in the unwanted.
First, you use specific arguments, and then you discredit them by a random homophobia.
Every time I and my family need NHS, we have to make the tail behind the intolerants to chronic hypocondria who think they're all due.
I think you're the one who's using specific arguments.
Health tourism, as defined by the right-wings, does not exist in any way.
I think that's what democracy is called.
So no one would be affected by UKIP measures against health tourism, so there is no problem.
There is only in the parallel universe of UKIP that Carswell can appear as a revolutionary.
A quote from a torch does not constitute evidence.
Yeah, so pull on the messenger.
The Mail didn't write the report, it just made him comment.
Those who control the majority of the media in this country should be shot to promote such populist propaganda as if it were the reality.
I don't think you know what a special argument is.
You don't know anything about my personal situation or my identity, so you should be careful when you try to kill the debate with homophobia charges.
Farage's phrase is very surprising, but only because we are so rarely talking about this problem.
He didn't make any homophobe remarks at all.
You're gonna have to make it back.
I'm not sure where you want to come from, but I don't think you like it when the media talk about what you don't like.
It is so rare that unlike Farage and his single disciples of Thatcher who think AIDS and floods are a sign of God and not a reflection of their own inability to understand that the complexities of humanity are something of good, then not.
Finally, the situation is as bad as in Ireland as in Spain.
With the new crisis that reaches the austerity period, nothing will be set up.
Expecting almost 5% growth in 2015 is a great pleasure.
Ireland was the 'Tiger of Europe' we enjoyed a few years ago.
We've met the suite!
That begins reading the article.
It is sought to believe that Ireland is a veritable country and that a '' NEW MIRACLE ECONOMIC'' is happening.
With the Brussels agreement, taxed on the lowest companies in Europe, a three-fold job march, a continuing emigration.
With these ingredients not of what '' pavoiser'' is for the time being with the arrival of the Polish.
In the 1980s, irlation was one of the poorest countries in the European Union, with Portugal Considering it a constant perimeter, without the new countries, the situation is always better than it was.
Greece was in front.
That their development has not been a long calm river, it is in view of recent events.
The lowest tax rates in Europe?
It's wrong!
Latvia has a tax rate of 0% on companies.
Now there is a real hypocrisy in France on the part of the tax policies actually paid by multinationals.
If a report is believed to come out in 2008 or 2009, they pay less than 5% in France as a whole.
Only SMEs pay full money can.
Now I confirm that road traffic has returned enormously, and there are new (and expensive) cars all over the street, just like before the 2008 crisis.
I've been living in Dublin for 14 years, the resumption is obvious in everyday noises since the arrival.
Is it supposed to be economic?
Don't worry, I'm sure the comments will soon get hot.
In another article that they are writing, 2 Vauxhaul Astra are involved in an accrual on the A140.
Does Ryanair now have to transfer passengers from one flight to another in this way?
I believe that Mr O'Leary will soon buy a whole new fleet of devices, so some bosses and scratches on the elders will be quickly forgotten.
That says I'm flying with him next week, so I hope it won't be on one of these two once.
So that would be entirely the fault of the other pilot.
Did Ryanair make an extra payment to passengers for the additional fear that we wanted to provide them?
But without this kind of Irish company, you couldn't afford to go on vacation, young man
I never took Ryanair, and the last three times I took the plane was with BA.
I prefer when the airline offers a quality service.
No, but it's Ryanair, so they can give themselves to the heart of joy.
Any article on Ryanair triggers dozens of comments from people who would never take Ryanair instead of those who like to take Ryanair and think that those who pay other than the basic rate have to take it on themselves, etc.
It's pretty transparent.
Ryanair will not be satisfied with the additional costs resulting from this incident.
I wonder what the delays will be and whether it will be necessary to compensate passengers and, if so, whether Ryanair will be able to avoid paying by saying that it was an error for airport air controllers.
Passengers have been put on another plane in less than an hour, they are not entitled to any compensation.
I'm sorry to disappoint you and your dreams of compensation.
Welcome aboard this British Airways flight that takes the English ISIS to Syria, not true as you say.
Good trip
Last Sunday in Paris, Frances-Bourgeois Street: Marais is mostly pedestrian, and literally grows from the world.
People don't come in bulk for the quality of restaurants (anywhere, for most) or for the White-Manteaux Review Room (hyper-intellectual and slightly dusty).
The reason for this crowd is that shops are all open and the neighborhood is incredibly alive and lively.
With a lot of foreigners who spend..
Do you think Sunday's opening will create jobs?
Go to Paris Rue des Francs Bourgeois where shops are open on Sunday, with 50% of tourists.
@aloes Faux!
The only argument that seemed acceptable to me is that of areas that receive an important number of foreign tourists and it is struck by the fact that they buy at a discount.
The tourist areas lose a considerable volume of business per year for the same reasons .
It remains the industry where expensive equipment, operated on Sundays, enables prices to be reduced.
Dominical rest is a right which, with the exception of the employees.
That is why it is planned and regulated by the Labour Code.
Neither the Minister in charge of the economy, nor the rest, the Minister in charge of foreign affairs, have the least competence to reform the labour code.
When they're beating her.
What's the law for?
Satisfying a part of the population and businesses who want to work on Sunday .
In Montreal on Sunday I take my little children to the municipal library.
In my City of 30,000 inhabitants where I live in France the municipal library is open 4 days a week but not the we!
This is access to culture ...
And that is also the regulation of working time.
the way of life he has defended with tenacity against fascism
the way of life he has defended with tenacity against fascism and Bolshevism
What if the inheritance of his daughter was, contrary to his will, to use to pay the inheritance costs?
There are paintings.
Some are good, others are not terrible.
No doubt his legacy would want his share of the castle if you pass me the expression.
his preference for a victory of nationalists/Franco in the Spanish Civil War...
And his hostility to the independence of places such as Ireland and India and his fascist ideas as a whole and also add his well-known hatred of the Jews.
Churchill wasn't perfect.
Not much anymore.
But for 5 years, and only for five years, it was perfect.
In 1940 he took the lead in other aristos of the government who wanted to discuss a "agreement" with the Nazis and he won very well.
Thanks to its magnificent rhetoric and its energy, it united the country in the idea that fighting fascists was the only way to win.
The inhabitants of the United Kingdom, France, and Belgium and, ultimately, the whole world can thank God for having had these five years, just these five years, Churchill at the bar and no other.
Churchill's size has nothing to do with this discussion.
If his descendants sold their paintings on the free market to collect the money of inheritance costs, they could even make a profit.
If the public wants to be able to admire one in a museum, they gather the money to buy it.
It's as simple as that.
But we could use the tax money.
No one can deny that when it was “the time of the truth, ” Churchill’s personality was a positive advantage for his country during World War II.
A resumption of the internal market by public works will only favour large companies, which will increase their dividends by avoiding hiring, infrastructure buildings being by little renewable.
With regard to the social reforms recommended by the Minister, they well reflect the real French misconception:
Return to Princes' values.
A reform of unemployment insurance is not contradictory.
May the least of us not be in need!
It is only in solidarity that we come to his assistance, that is, he has the right to exchange services that he makes or has made to a minimum of resources.
The SM40H that I prefer to smile corresponds to this vision.
There is also the dancer who lives on income from his property.
There is a difference between the one who invests for a return at the time of his retirement and the one who lives from his income.
A property to rent or two for a couple on top, it's vice
Finance's little genius lacks particular imagination.
The new deal was a policy of great work, but at a time of lack of infrastructure.
Today, in Europe and France, that is not the case.
Developed countries are overequipped.
The need for infrastructure is marginal, so in nothing a new deal could be a solution.
Especially at a time when the issue of decay emerges in response to a recession that is only a wild decline, therefore brutal
You were right 30 years ago: more need (or possibilities) of dams, coal mines, highways...
But if you want to make the future climate-energy shock less difficult, then the need for investment is creating: isolation, renewal of the railway network, urban transport, transport and storage of energy, etc.
A tax that promotes high income and income.
Who's in power?
Obsessed by smartphones.
Charles Arthur is really a gallopin.
Samsung's benefits are damaged by iPhone 6 and its competitors of the same range
The introduction by AppleTM of larger screens for iPhone 6 and 6 Plus may have seduced buyers who would have otherwise purchased a Galaxy
I tested all these phones and I decided for LG G3.
So Samsung lost me as a client, but not for Apple's sake.
I think it's essential that we have an alternative.
When Microsoft introduced this philosophy, we met a decade of stagnation that was finally broken by Google, Apple and the open source community.
We must have a number of dynamic platforms to stimulate competition and development.
In addition, we all have different needs and they cannot be satisfied by only one manufacturer, because they are not compatible.
For me, I tend to buy Apple because I love their underlying philosophy and I appreciate the design.
Some people do not attach any value to the design, for them the options, functionality and the prize.
There's nothing wrong with that.
Let's stop looking for a better platform.
Is there a "better car builder", not really, they are different, but similar.
I would like to see a flourishing portable industry, with radically different approaches for different people and markets.
It's healthier and must be encouraged.
That's what's of our interest to all of us.
I am happy that you have found exactly what you are looking for and that this is not an Apple product, even if I made a different choice.
Most people I know have iPhones.
Our friends umpfrontists who, according to one, fight ideas and not men (on the contrary, rather on Parisian bobos) could tell us which author(s) they fight ideas on the genre and tell us what works they are right to fight.
Or are they just attacking the kind as described in Le Figaro, Minute or Current Values?
Is it Judith Butler or Eric Zemmour?
All right, Jean, I love you, and you're someone smart and cultivated.
I said this about Judith in the vein of Furusato, which is called Holopherne, which had not come to me (I did not have his mind's vitality).
Otherwise, in the background, since you're going back, I don't care, and I honestly don't see where the problem is: I was hoping that you and your friends could get me out of my back, because I'm slow, but I understand well...
@ Jean: Recognize that, culturally, refer Judith to Holopherne, that's what he did.
Who's afraid to ask the World?
But what are we afraid of those who are afraid?
Furasato and @ provide us with answers.
The first by calling on Judith of the Bible, the second by qualifying Judith Butler as a very symbolic gorilla.
We see how close these studies are to their home.
We are obviously no longer in the debate.
It's another thing, much deeper.
@ Have you read, John, that the World has published an article on the necessity of theology?
@: As for an idea debate, I thought it was appropriate to go to the sources.
I don't think it's very strict to pretend to fight ideas from the only exposure that their detractors do ( Cardinal Ratzinger, the inventor of the Genre theory or X Lacroix, theologian).
But, as I explained to our Umpfrontist friend, it is all the difference between having a clear opinion and a simple opinion.
I'm not sure he understands the nuance.
I didn't read Judith, the very symbolic gorilla, I was pleased with the "Second Sex" (it was more than my time) that I believe the source of "the source" according to Lo's wishes.
While I was looking at the eclipse from Melbourne, I saw red lights when the moon briefly showed when the clouds opened.
This sudden appearance of the red moon had its charm and made up for a bit the disappointment of sometimes having the sight blocked by the clouds.
It was fabulous here at the FNQ.
Yes, the clouds of the last night would really include the coast of Victoria and NSW, while most of the rest of Australia had a clear time.
Special flash moon of blood.
Tony Abbott / Joe Hockey makes Labor responsible.
But if the Labour Party accepts our unjust budget, we will make it its true color as soon as possible.
You're obsessed with it, aren't you?
I was in Melbourne then, of course, I saw only clouds.
Melbourne has also managed to cover for the whole week of the rain of the Persian Meteorists and for practically all major astronomical phenomena in recent years.
I'm beginning to think that there's a bad genius whose only purpose is to prevent the people of Melbourne from seeing what is in the sky.
Melbourne is really not the best place for an observatory, even though things are greatly improving on the other side of the Cordillare.
There were periods between 10 and 20 minutes where I could not see the eclipse due to the clouds above the Melbourne bay.
I'm going to put a TAXE on this eclipse.
WHAT looks at this eclipse should pay a TAXE.
I bet your first thought of the day is for Abbott, just like the last one before you go to bed.
Who or what will happen to you when it ends (forcely) by disappearing?
It seems that you spent a lot of time reading the discussions looking for messages in which people criticize the Abbott government and then accuse them of being obsessed with EUX.
Super photo of the moon above the Harbour Bridge of Sydney.
It's like Mars's going into a collision with the Earth!
Nothing on stock and real estate speculation.
Nothing about inequality between labour and capital income.
Nothing about tax fraud.
The other liberalism is about to kill Europe.
Nothing on the gardens of Babylon...
The article says too much or not enough.
The details and arguments of these recommendations are not given.
There is no hypertext link to the original documents so that an opinion can be made.
Let's see today Tuesday, October 15, the results of the miracle revenues: in Spain, exports have been low for at least five years.
Greece's stock market is falling apart.
However, these were the examples to be followed.
The reform of the notaries would generate a claim for compensation of EUR 8 billion.
The Ministry of Economic Affairs states that these claims for compensation are not based.
What if the Ministry of the Economy went wrong?
Will the decision-makers who have taken the political advantage of the courageous attack of the notaries have the same courage when submitting the bill to the state budget?
The suite in its time.
Okay, thanks, JYL...
@llol No State is not comparable to households with respect to the management of its budget because the state's time horizon is theoretically final when the household's life span is cut short.
In addition, unless public expenditure is considered to be unproductive, it contributes to financing material and intangible investment in tomorrow's growth and therefore future revenues.
Some elements of response.
A regretful decision.
But remember the sacred promise of Hippocrate: the health of the benefits of global pharmaceutical companies must be preserved first and foremost.
Nice plot theory.
Unfortunately, the truth does not match your fantasy.
Medical personnel would like to be able to use it, but they have the hands linked by law as written by politicians.
This is the same situation as for the product that causes medical abortions rather than having dangerous surgical interventions, safe shooting rooms for drug addicts rather than having them in the streets, etc.
On these issues, politicians want to please the innocent masses.
In fact, doctors don't earn money with drugs.
That's why there are pharmacists.
Doctors don't earn money with drugs Since the Liberals want our health system to look like that in the United States, you should learn how it works.
Doctors everywhere in the world are cut short in the same way, but it is more or less visible.
It may have been wrong to make a mistake about the tubibs, but the reality is that many countries, including Australia, give priority to the profits of businesses and to "search".
Therefore, read the few rare reports on our pharmaceutical benefits scheme and negotiations with pharmaceutical companies in relation to other countries.
Compare the global prices of medicines everywhere, as well as the differences from one country to another on what is in free sale or only on order.
This is reinforced by a political and economic process, not a medical or scientific process, directly or indirectly.
In fact, at the same time, some companies are testing marijuana inhales against oncological pain, despite the laws that restrict them and allow them to be honest.
Although manufacturers of certain medicines may not be happy unless alternatives such as marijuana are used, those who come to a version offering good quality products at known doses will benefit greatly.
I'm sorry to tell you, ma'am, but you're mistaken, there's a lot going on in the medical and pharmacies.
As for this hospital, they were happy to use it until someone put a bullet in the ears of a hospital manager.
We can't keep patents on the grass...
If "scientists" in social sciences were doing research instead of doing politics and networking, their "work" could be used.
One researcher does not compare one fact to another.
Compare it's not looking.
Comparing it is not the teaching of research.
We can't say "search is done" and then in a single jet "you have to experiment at all times".
If your search is complete, why experiment?
If your search is not complete, why do you ask for application?
Can I explain how a "researcher" can deduce that a student who cannot assimilate mathematics alone could assimilate mathematics and other materials more easily?
The new technologies allow you to learn from the condition that students learn to use new technologies, but how could they learn new technologies if they did not learn?
The pia tests are only an indicator that allows us to find indicators that are satisfying.
What is the purpose of building an indicator that informs you of what you are going to do, a will of self-promotion, a deception?
One way to train teachers is to get away from training sophists and ideologists and that practitioners teach practitioners.
factory release the paragraph on internships (which is not very argumented) and you will see that your conclusion moves us to the most ineffective conservativeism: "It is a device that leads first and foremost to the reproduction of the practices in force, and does not allow the system to progress ".
In view of the general consensus on the state of the French system, it is not possible to wish that only practitioners teach practitioners, even if they have all their place in modern teacher training.
Education theorists must have no place.
Practitioners must have one.
Would you like to be operated by a surgeon whose training is purely theoretical, and who never put his foot in an operating block before?
There is no consensus on the causes of the educational system's problems.
Giving more weight to education theorists would eventually destroy it.
Your analogy is completely unfair: if I don't want to be operated by a practitioner who has only a theoretical training, I would rather be operated by a surgeon who has no theoretical training and who has learned about the bag.
Mike Weatherley, Conservative member responsible for combating copyright violations by David Cameron
Why doesn't he just tell Cameron to stop?
Someone should do a popular arrest.
MDR examiers thank you.
If one day I start to feel guilty of violating the copyright, I will just read an article like this.
In an information economy, the violation of copyright = flight.
That is the same thing as they have to quote their sources correctly.
Often, getting a license doesn't cost anything.
No, it's a violation of copyright.
Not the same thing.
By using the content without having the appropriate license, you deprive the artists of their bread.
You can always discuss the assumptions - but it's the flight.
And you can repeat it as much as you want, it won't become so true.
It's a violation of copyright.
Come on, repeat it again.
If one day I'm starting to feel guilty about violating copyright
Obviously, this does not bother you to deprive artists of their income.
If they think that they should receive money for images used in school duties, a almost perfect definition of what should be reasonable use, then I am happy to deprive them of this fictitious income.
Lesson No. 1 should show how, if children themselves create anything and publish it on their preferred social networks, they leave any intellectual property on the site under the general conditions they have made a click.
Perhaps if they share the listeners of their mp3 ballader with a couple on the school bus, they should be expelled for violating the law in this way.
Ah if we could export this resource that we care about, the trigger that says everything's wrong....
If it is a PS Member who affirms it, then we must believe it.
I have two children and when they're old enough to choose, I'd advise them to leave France if nothing changed from here.
France takes people to the bottom in the assistants constantly.
I do not want my children to bear the debt that this policy will have created.
What pulls France down, these are speeches like yours.
@gus I've been working in private business ever since.
I've had the chance to have worked in companies run by excellent company managers: it exists in France, but it's rare.
I'm paid because I know I don't have the skills to run a business, and this choice allows me to shoot red bullets on the zero patterns I meet often.
At ease in my basketball, I totally share Jean-Pierre Bernajuzan's post: he says the terrible truth!
@gus, if compared with German companies that French business leaders constantly quote to ask for reforms in France, in Germany companies have their industrial fabric structured to make it competitive, in particular by ensuring the link between large and medium-sized enterprises - what are the French patterns waiting for to do so?
What's the state holding their hand?
What state do they charge with?
@ Jacques L.
Still this anti-business couple on your part!
Remember, what did you create as a job, as an added value, to be as severe?
@ Pat I understand your reaction.
In fact, France is facing an unresolved problem: the incompetence of French business leaders who are unable to create jobs and who build and run by waiting for the permanent assistance of the State!
That's terrible!
But they have solutions: removal of the Labour Code, employer charges, taxes, work 45h/week paid 35, and some, walking on eggs, refuse to claim the reduction of wages or their removal!
I look forward to seeing all the "negative" comments on this subject.
What is ironic is the way people always complain about First Group.
According to what I see from where I am, Last wasn't really an investment for us taxpayers.
They tried to keep up rather than transform themselves.
This does not mean that the Scottish railways have not improved since the Last took care of them.
But they also improved with their predecessors, including British Rail.
Unfortunately, we don't have the power to do that, helas.
I tried to have them recently, but I didn't make it.
But, well, the Labour will take us away, isn't it...
It's an international branch.
They are already operating trains in Germany.
Nothing prevents people in the United Kingdom from creating a more moral enterprise and from taking part in the calls for tenders.
But it seems that we are not very good in management, most of our privatized services end up being managed by a foreign operator.
I still remember the scandal and criticism when First won the Virgin contract, all so that the decision was finally cancelled.
And there is better: MTR, a Hong Kong company won Crossrail's operating contract for 8 years.
Well the Labour, as they have repeated during the referendum campaign, is entirely for sharing and sharing and thinks that workers must all go beyond borders.
It can therefore be assumed that they will be happy with this decision;)
This may be because the Dutch administration is on good track while the British one is not.
What ScottRail needs is not just a change of ownership but, above all, new ideas.
Abellio may be the least bad choice possible, but the real problem is the ridiculous system of franchises, not the franchisor.
"He was a beating girl."
Sir, I do, but I really do have this kind of expression.
Suppose that being "beating" is a higher quality than many others, the concern of others, intelligence, listening, for example, being "beating" has nothing to do with surviving a disease: "beating" cancers, which are not less dead, I know of pancakes.
Getting out of a disease has nothing to do with merit.
Come on, let's start again.
I'm not telling you it's the condition to manage, I'm telling you that this is AIDE.
Nothing to see with someone deserves...!
When it comes to the examples of your life, there's only you to judge them.
I'm starting again.
Insinating, it would be only a moment, that one can have the merit of getting out of a disease or that one can be afraid not to get out of it, is simply monstrous.
The body follows or does not follow.
A body that launches, everywhere, despite the will, despite trust in medicine, do you have a vague idea of what C?
In order to think the contrary, if having a strong morale makes it easier to accept and prepare heavy treatments, to try experimental treatments as did this woman and not to refuse them in fear.
Someone who's fighting in medicine is first of all someone who trusts in medicine.
But if we prefer to give it back to the "Lord" it's another thing.
Neither merit nor courage.
These considerations are for the moralists.
When you catch a dirt, a real one, you're making you feel like you're just a zombie.
Personally, I have caught two, salads, big ones, and if I'm "battu" as these psychologists say, it completely failed me.
Unless this fight is just to close your teeth, to suffer from hell, and to trap your teeth.
I thought the charge against Milosevic had been decided and concluded a decade ago.
I haven't seen that name in the papers since at least that time.
What's going on?
It's an anniversary.
A forgotten anniversary.
His trial was carried out "fast" and then rolled under the carpet.
Is this the story we told at the time?
The communist nationalist who launched three wars in the Balkans in the last decade?
The Communist President of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia?
Please ask what we have voluntarily left aside: 1.
How could NATO's bombings be legal under the World Rule of International Law?
Which country has Serbia attacked?
With regard to RTS (Radio-Television-Serbia), why not mention that NATO destroyed the same building by killing civilians, then considered it a valid target.
Milosevic had no way out of it: if he did not defend his country against NATO attacks, he would be crucified as a traitor.
And if he were to defend it, he would be swallowed by the Western compressor roller.
The West used a smoke screen to detach a part of a sovereign State that then unilaterally proclaimed its independence and was soon recognized by the Western States, who then ended up lying on the ground.
The Serbian population has now completely disappeared (ethnic cleansing).
Vojislav Kostunica, who is mentioned here, died politically after his first term of office in order not to understand the situation that had developed.
Zoran Djindjic was one of the most controversial figures in the political world of the time.
Finally, the Guardian should not qualify Milosevic as tyrant (even if we don't like him).
In my knowledge, there is only one method of predicting seismic events in Greece goes a little near, measuring the level of piezoelectricity in the quartz.
This kind of study is unquestionably useful and thanks for making us share the results.
A hope, therefore, but caution is that this water has nothing to do with that of the exoplanet named HAT-P-11b, located about 124 light years of Earth in the Cygnus constellation, which would be "the smallest and coldest planet to present detectable water molecules", according to a study conducted by the Drake Deming and Jonathan Fraine team at the University of Maryland.
Method to be followed.
Like those who involve animals that feel a threat to come.
Thank you Father of Science to us, often, for these experimental efforts that are carried out in the world.
How would animals (In advance) know?
There is no doubt about the perception of other elements whose rate is changing in the case of seismic events.
Like the radon, for example.
A gas has an inodorous priority for man but may be detectable by animals.
All these methods are undetectable for man, but not for the measuring instruments it has.
But we don't have a reliable result on these tracks...
It has often been observed (and for centuries) that some animals have been acting strangely for a few hours with a seismic disease, including chickens, cows, dogs, but especially fish and snakes.
I had seen a report on art telling the fight of two scientific teams, one Californian, the other Japanese, to recognize the validity of their work, which included animal sensitivity to terrestrial magnetic fields, and especially their modification before a earthquake.
Well, I'm not a scientist, but their assumptions convinced me!
Or are we on these research?
Why so much contempt for this track?
We should relearn to listen to nature...
If we look at things calmly and rigorously, we publish it in a serious journal, and no one despises it.
As soon as we talk about the "signs" given by the animals, we get together in the same way: everyone will remember that 5 minutes before a seismic red fish came off in a strange round.
I don't understand that we can think that Boris would make a good leader for the Conservatives.
He's done too much as mayor of London.
When you listen to the LBC program you can't stop yourself from thinking that this man doesn't know anything and that he's always trying to make fun with a joke.
He never responds directly to anything.
He also said that he agreed with Farage, and then Nick Ferrari asked him about what.
He couldn't name one point.
He made so many promises to be elected mayor, and he didn't keep it alone.
This only emphasizes how much the rest of the Conservative Party is just a piece of shit, right?
Because he's popular.
Because he's funny.
He was in "Have I Got News For You".
Because it's a celebration and people have been accused of celebrating.
The Londoners voted for him and it will be the same for the rest of the country.
When (and not if) he takes the direction of the party, the popularity rate of the Tories will increase the ceiling I am sure of.
May God help us.
I'm not so sure: people like the jokes, but they don't want their prime minister to be one.
That's exactly what the Londoners were saying.
He should have brought his friend the parpage with him, smarter than him.
Anyway, I think he's trying to copy R Branson.
The Americans had one as President.
The French have really and always been disinterested in the history of the Pacific War.
For all those who have given themselves the penalty of reading a few books (there exists, including a French and excellent B.
Millot), the "Solomon" and the "railway" speak, unfortunately, as well as the dead who remained there.
It is understood that Australians who know (one of their heavy cruisers, Australia, must always be in the background since the Battle of Savo) did not want to return to it.
We actually passed before the island of Savo, in the "Iron Bottom Sound".
Even if the mission reaches its end.
It's the little ones.
But the Ecolo coast is a total swelling.
Calculate the kerosene consumed in order to achieve the objective that completely decrements the concept.
It's enough to go through the list of sponsors like philanthrops.
An operation like no more or no.
The cow, it gives too much desire!!!
I'm waiting for the website with impatience!
Your story tells me again, identifying me a little at the passage (I also learned to sail with the Crocos de L'Elorn at Moulin Blanc near Brest!).
Head also for the ecological message, even though some criticize the impact of the move.
The end justifies the means.
Keep telling us again, and show with pride that the Bretons are great travelers!

Bonsoir I think the good red who has shown against taxes is happy to know that this trip is sponsored by the British Region and the City of Brest.
More seriously, it seems to me that local communities and public bodies of any kind should not spend a sum of our taxes on financing the dreams of some as nice adventurers as they do!
Is there any players in the current Serbian training that is of Kosovo origin?
I know that Dusan Bajejic in Lyon and Milos Krasic, once in Youth and now in Fenerbahçe, are from Mitrovica, but I don't know if they're still in the team
It's Bisevac, Lyon's defender, not Bajejic.
Bajejic was the middle of the field or earlier in the 1970s and 80s and has led many teams in Greece, but I don't know where he is from.
Bajejic is from Mostar, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and has played as an attacker in the large Velez team, who, under the leadership of legendary Suleman Rebac, finished twice in the Yugoslav league (and also had scores like Vahid Hallilhodzic and Arsène Wenger's faithful team, Boro Primorac).
Well, thank Mole!
Of course I know Hallhodzic and Primorac.
Just by curiosity, what happened to Krasic?
It was said that he was going to become a big player when he was in Juve, he is currently in Turkey, but the last time he appeared on my radar screen he was linked to Blackburn *frisson*
There, I can't help you.
I know that he lost his place when Account came, then he went to Fender and as far as I know he's not the owner.
Maybe he can do something else, maybe in the Indian Super League?
Seriously, Serbia.
Seriously, Albania, don't be afraid.
You should love Albania because you're neighbors.
The thing is that the flag of this drone is not the flag of the true Albania today.
Apparently it was the flag of the Great Albania, which covers all regions where there is an important Albanian presence.
A little excessive nationalism, in fact.
Fortunately, there was not too much damage (I know).
In fact, it was an Albanian flag with the map not what is called Great Albania, but Albania before 1913, when the great European powers decided to give shots from the country to neighbouring countries.
How could we have felt "an explosion of joy" seeing two turns crashing knowing that women, men and no doubt children are inside?
How???
What fills me with in this "witness" is that the only thing that has ever been able to, is that once, spontaneously rejoice in the terrible death of thousands of people, it is in my eyes a "broadline" personality, which all "witnesses" should be taken with the greatest circumstance.
Without a doubt, in the short time of joy, there will be no thought of the dead or of the reality of the inflamed horror.
It would have just been thought, one moment, that for once, Muslims had succeeded in truly and apocalyptic harm to the great evil Satan in his own heart.
Make qqch powerful.
Great.
It would seem that this feeling was shared by thousands of Muslims who were consumed by their sense of humiliation.
With witnesses filmed in Palestine.
Classic damage joy.
There was a bit of doubt.
The "Christian/white/gaulois" West cannot measure the degree of frustration, anger, hatred of the Muslim when it contemplates the general misery, the social and cultural underdevelopment of the Arab Muslim world today.
I'm talking about Cari or Alger Faubourgs, not Dubai Tours.
The past splendor, certainly magnificent, is not a consolation, on the contrary.
How to get the Muslim world out of this diabolical storm?
All in all, 2 major poisons irrigated the Arab world: the bigot conservation of power in place and the fascinating nihilism.
The common point, the ice of thought and the excommunication (sweet or armed) of its critical expression.
What we've understood before, it's not supposed to get Muslims back.
It's the only way.
Did Edwy Plenel read this article?
I suppose it's true in many countries.
But in Britain, the fall marks the beginning of six long dark, wet and depressed months that affect the well-being and humor of many people.
Besides, everyone's getting sick.
Seasonal depression.
I'm suffering for myself.
When the light goes, it becomes hell for me and those like me.
A dose of vitamin D should help a little for humor and well-being.
The autumn is beautiful in Great Britain, with or without rain.
In particular, the campaign is to cut the suffrage in autumn.
Not so much to cut the breath as the summer green when everything is living instead of being on the point of death.
In Great Britain, if you're lucky, summer falls a week-end.
We've had a great summer this year, don't make your grins that cut the clichés!
Not everyone.
I rarely fall ill in winter.
But now I'm retired and I don't develop immunity to germs outside, it can change, I suppose.
It's not about to die, it's just a step in a cycle...
A wonderful stage full of invigorating smells, with a febrile that culminates with festivals such as Halloween, Guy Fawks, Christmas, the risk of poisoning and full of other wonderful words.
Just don't stop doing things!
Here's my recommendations for the parties for you.
Yes, these dark and gray months actually make me much happier and more relaxed.
For the control of the majority of children , this is the amount covered by the State that comes mainly from deciles 8 to 10 .
But with regard to the number of households that have seen their tax increase as a result of this measure , these are mainly the 4 and 5 deciles that are concerned ( median income ) according to Figure 2 .
The elimination of half of all widows is not in the article, or its impact is fully assessed: 230M euros is a pleasure that does not take account of the impact in 2012 and 2013 and under which it is indolorable.
And it's not ready to get set up.
Well, we're not on the floor right, but we're dreamers.
For once the PS makes a policy instead of the left, we won't cry...
It is clear that those who are among the richest 20% must bear much more than 75% of the increase in taxes, why not 90%?
Let us continue this way and you will encourage these 20% less to work or to leave.
Well, I know that's not politically correct, but I'm still telling you.
Live the Trots and OICs recycled in the PS: they understood everything.
Adam, you can't see what you're looking at.
The proportion is still the same here or in Bahrain: 20% of the population owns 80% of the wealth.
A fair tax, that's when it prohibits anyone from eating as much as he can.
Beyond a certain limit, the money loses all its usefulness.
And once the usefulness of money is exceeded, money is only used to make money, that is to say to make the greatest number of misfortunes.
We're among the richest 20%.
There is no doubt that 20% of households that work the most (and create the wealth of which a party is logically redistributed).
A fair tax must enable these households to benefit from some of their efforts.
Or so much as lowering your arms and living a minimum social life, especially if you have a social housing.
The utopia of the head cutters at the red Khmer have lived happily.
I've done two AirBnBs in Norway recently.
No problem.
In one of the two, we had things that we wouldn't have had in a 5 star hotel and we didn't have to introduce ourselves to the reception or deal with the least anxiety.
It's enough to go to someone's house, to sleep in it, to sort it out, and to leave.
In the meantime, this will be my first choice when I'm traveling.
The logo has changed, people...
Check your insurance before renting your house.
In most cases you will need a kind of owner insurance.
Make sure to use a service with the good logo!
Ah, 6h too late.
I love Airbnb.
"It's very dangerous and highly dangerous" No, it's not true.
You've just really missed a chance.
According to the link provided in the article:
At its discharge, Airbnb's response to Teman was fast, almost absurdly fast.
In 24 hours, following an e-mail from Gawker by Teman, Airbnb had sent a locker to change the locks, made arrangements for him to spend a week at the hotel and transferred $23,817 (for which Airbnb is insured, but still).
So why does this article quote Teman complaining that he has not received any support from Airbnb?
I ADORE AIRBNB, to receive as to travel
Hello I'm looking for people who have already used bnb air just to reassure me.
I plan to pay an account and a month to rent at once, but I'm a little afraid to send $1,600 to a site that I've never really heard of.
Where are you going?
"Support the troops," sang the Bu$herie on all tones...
So, you're invincible.
I'm sure it'll make the families and close to thousands of dead Kurds in the halabja to learn that their parents and friends have failed to do anything other than the chemical bombings of Saddam Husseen.
Unless the content of the article has been radically modified by the author, your comment is inappropriate (to remain policing).
Furthermore, in what way would this mass crime committed in 1988 prove that chemical weapons discovered almost 20 years later were still usable?
It is not hyper clear the author's style: "to search for weapons of mass destruction.
We agree.
You think it's time to weaken the army to strengthen education
This is never the time to strengthen education, because we are still at war.
Alternative: IS IT ALL the time to strengthen education, because we are still at war?
Education would already be much strengthened if "they" were to work 35 hours instead of 17.
At the moment, our teachers are now gaining more than engineers.
And we don't believe that teachers spend 18 hours a week preparing their program.
But this is not so because the National Education does not have the means to provide an office to the college/lycée to its professors, so they stay at home.
A kind of total forced telework, except that the employer does not pay the computer, Internet connection, or supplies.
Besides, it's so much the plank at 5:00 a.m. and 4 months of vacation that we can't fill the math CAPES, come on, we're waiting for you.
How come you don't want to get caught up in poorly-educated chains that your parents are treating you as a frog?
I think the priority in this area is to disarm the jihadites so that the khurde population can get better out of the way.
Where it is seen that the Bush administration has absolutely everything going through.
My first job graduated was to sell in London to earn three times nothing and yet it was a job for which a diploma was needed.
A year later, I saw an ad to work for the London Metro, it was paid £5,000 more per year and we didn't even ask for the patent.
I've never regretted it.
In this regard, do not do so if you do not find a graduate job, try to find something either that pays well or that you like to do.
If I had stayed in my job, I'd still have to pay my student loan.
I don't like business so much, so I hope to spend both in the public service and in the university world.
LOL LOL LOL This article is very late!
Exactly, when I got my degree in 2011 there was a three-year-old behind.
The best way to reduce the number of unemployed graduates?
To get rid of bisexual yarns such as art / letters / theatre / media / philosophy / political sciences, that is to say what we call the diplomas of unemployed people.
I've got one of those diplomas and I've finished the production director.
It turned out that the important thing was not the degree but, as the above article said, a good career course, starting at school and throughout the university.
Of course the starting salary was lower, but we quickly go up the ladders because in the real world what counts is the results more than knowledge.
This debate has lasted for years.
Scientists can't solve all the problems, it's more important to be able to get up in the morning, get to work at the time and interact with people in a way that brings results.
Do letters, philosophy and art are bisounor yarns?
That's ridiculous.
I suppose you're talking about diplomas like a media study or whatever the wireless line you're going to.
Letters, philosophy, political sciences and art are real threads.
We need people who can explain the big questions to the lyceans, who understand the importance of the foundations of culture such as literature, art, etc., and who appreciate them.
Wouldn't this be better a real territorial policy to disengage Paris and dynamise the rest of France?
Personally, I don't see the inhabitants of the final end of the Essonne and the Val-d'Oise doing 80km away every day on bicycle to come to work in Paris.
The intra-muros and small belts already have many other practical means of transport in common (metro, bus, tramway).
> Several secure and key-closed parks, as they already exist in the cities of northern Europe, in Dijon or Lyon, will be installed on the road.
Good idea.
On the surface, the space is cannibalized by the 2RM.
It is hoped that the City of Paris will work with professionals from the Netherlands and Denmark.
To the extent that they have great experience in the field.
Well, we haven't found room for a SEUL bike coupling device.
The motivation seems stronger when it comes to finding an office for Bertrand Delanoë....
Well, that's not going to work.
When discussing with pedestrians and other users of transport in common for reasons why they do not pedal, it seems to me that the main reasons that arise are: 1/ it is highly dangerous with all these bathrooms, these trucks, these scooters that run super fast and get rid of the survival of the bikes 2/ you take full pollution in my head The cyclable tracks are going floors, you have to reduce the car traffic (urban foot type congestion load), reduce speed (Paris = zone 30), keep the road code systematically talking (even the bikes before you need to adapt the road code written for the bathrooms 100 years ago to the bikes), generalize the buffer areas after the passing of the bicycles, and do not tires.
The cyclable tracks are part of apartheid, it is necessary to co-habit but rebalance the occupation of urban space.
Nothing on the bike in the big Paris?
Not a word on the place of the bike in common transport?
EELV is right.
The goal of 15% of velo movements is ridiculous.
I'm beginning to think that Anne Hidalgo rolled the greens in the flour.
In addition to the OR report, the EELV agents appear to be skeptical.
I prefer to be optimistic.
Before the racket starts, you better find out who's really hiding behind this massacre.
Index: it's not Russia.
I'm not sure how the world evolves.
That's awful.
My children are not a financial asset.
A lawyer expressed his intention to bring the case before the CEDH, but I did not hear that a complaint had actually been filed.
In addition, they should file complaints first in Germany or Ukraine.
I also expect these cases to be settled pending the outcome of the investigation report on the incident and the resulting criminal investigation.
Yeah, but Libya didn't explode Pan Am 103 anymore.
Malaysia Airlines is not wrong, the fault lies with the authority responsible for the security of the airspace, in which case the Ukrainian government.
Was the accident predictable?
Other aircraft had been killed earlier, Ukraine launched in the area of air attacks against rebels, and any aircraft could of course be considered a possible and immediate threat.
Did the Ukrainian government take reasonable precautions in view of a clear threat or have it chosen to play with the lives of innocents so that air companies would pay for the rights of overcrowding in the territory?
Where are all the pro-Kiev trolls that defend their Usurpator government / the ultranationalists of Western Ukraine - and who want to demonstrate in large that Putin hit the MH17 flight.
As far as I know, there is already a complaint against the Kiev government because they are responsible for what is happening in their heavens.
The previous: a 1986 judgment of the International Court of Justice, which concluded that the provision of weapons by the CIA to the rebel forces of the Contra in Nicaragua did not mean that the United States was responsible for their actions.
No chance that Russia will let this case go to the IGC.
It's funny what Abbott means to Putin that Australians have been murdered by Russian-supported rebels.
I hope he can provide evidence to support his allegations.
The investigators haven't said anything like that.
Calling Ricardo and being such an eco-butter, it's embarrassing!
Calling Polare is losing the north is exciting.
The only question is that the poor today is poorer than the poor yesterday?
I can't help but notice that those who are most virulently criticizing Piketty's book didn't read it!
It's easy to read, I've spent a few days.
It shows the statistical evolution of income-production, income-capital, inequality-concentration, inequality of work income, ownership of capital, merit and inheritance in the term log..
He shows that the concentration of the capital today coincides with that of the beginning of the 20th before 1914, he shows that it is the 2 world wars that have reduced the concentration of the capital from 1914 to 1945, and then how the concentration resumes after...
Bernajuzan: You're not saying what.
I ask you how long it took you to read this pope knowing that the ability to concentrate an individual has a few limits.
Then the question is not whether it is easy to read.
The question is whether the summary of the central thesis given by the press is fair or not.
If it is right, we can discuss it without having read the book, which is essential to argue in a unique way in favour of it.
No, it's easy to read...
Bernajuzan: how long have you been reading it?
Is the central thesis of his pope summarized by the press false?
I haven't read it and I won't read it.
So I believe in the summary of her central thesis, and that's the one that looks like I'm just smoking.
The notion of a gap between rich and poor is subsidiary.
Has humanity not been completely enriched?
And this added wealth to an increase in the population is the real political issue today.
Malala Yousafzai is an impressive personality and deserves the price without a doubt.
But remember, she's only 17 years old.
An age at which most people just start to find their place in the world.
I hope that this price will not be a burden for the young girl and that she will find her way to live a happy life.
The problem is not the price but the political capital of Western governments that want to prove the old adage that the colored perverts are the incarnation of evil.
All my wishes for happiness in Malala, but she must realize that it is used and that nothing will be done to educate girls in Pakistan or elsewhere - even in the popular quarters of Great Britain!
Someone thought his speech was a little weird.
She thanked her father for giving her a lot of freedom, but said that if she wasn't where she was now, she would have been married to 14 years.
Is Malala herself not part of these "colored perverts"?
You should not have any "antenna time" on this site.
You're a terrible pervert yourself.
It's absolutely revolting.
No, his father didn't marry her at the age of 14.
She was 15 when she was shot.
His father runs a school where girls are educated and he is in favour of equal rights for women.
It is, and has always been, for her to receive higher education and she has the right to decide for herself about her marriage.
However, it is some unusual in Pakistan, as he thinks women are equal to men.
What she said was that an average Pakistani girl often has to marry at 14 years of age, without having her word to say.
I'm sorry she didn't tell you enough.
This may seem contradictory, but perhaps she means that, if her father had not given her freedom, she would have been married to 14 years old
Rather disappointed by this entry for season 4 and especially by Jessica Lange, who apparently has a little bit of trouble finding her social character by Marlene Dietrich.
I've just looked at the last two seasons that are quite different, but I have to admit that it's one of the best horror series, one of the most elaborate!
A fascinating first episode.
The realization is close to the perfection and Jessica Lange's show singing the Anachronic Life on Mars in Bowie is simply turning around.
I have not yet looked at this new season (which will be the last for me, without Lange bof bof).
In the case of American Horror Story, I'd rather have a look at 13 episodes of 3 to 4 months.
But one thing is, outside Jessica Lange, it's especially the risks of setting scenes and mountings that sat down at me.
In AHS there is an avalanche of original plans that does not unduly ridicule the acceptance of today's productions.
That I'm a little out of sight to see you push forward for the next season without even waiting to be able to digest the quality.
Jessica Lange is certainly a pillar of this series, but, you say so, there are many other things.
It's not just for me that Jessica Lange (and especially her way and the way she uses it) is really one of the pillars of the series outside of technical qualities.
And good bath I look a lot at her.
Then I find that the series is writing, she wants to do too much at the same time.
The season 3 was slightly below, in the 2 it was too scattered despite some excellent episodes.
I don't see them doing 10 seasons of American Horror Story or it's gonna end like 24 hours of chronos what.
But good everyone does what they want!
That's what I'm saying, "I won't look any more" that everyone is forced to do the same!
I just share my view of nothing more, nothing less.
The loss of Jessica Lange, I think she'll be fatal to him.
But then, here's my opinion.
Let's talk less about tax increases, please - let's cut in the state's spending.
No, let's increase the cost, please.
Those who wanted to know about the expenses failed.
Decluding policy on relatively small expenditures, such as development assistance
The problem is that this represents less than the margin of error in government spending in the United Kingdom.
The truth is that we are all talking about nuances rather than the direction change that voters seem to call for their wishes and for all this time, in each camp, they seem to be much more important and substantial than they are - and the electors see clearly in their game and find them of poor faith.
Less than 1% of expenditure.
The "debt" is assets held primarily by financial institutions in that country.
The "debt" is nothing to worry about.
I would see no problem with the government getting a third of my income (before even talking about taxes on consumption) if I thought it was going to be useful.
But that is not the case, and many taxpayers feel the same way.
It is said that Nigel Farage has not been quite honest about how to reduce taxes, but good, if you add our net contribution to the EU, development aid, High Speed 2, subsidies to near-use windmills and nuclear power plants that cost twice what they should, you arrive at a figure that makes labour and Lib-Dem tax very ridiculous on the most luxurious residences.
Your first 10,000 pounds are not taxable.
This means that someone who earns £35,000 per annum about £5,000 (a seventh of their salary), someone with £50 000 would pay around £10 000 (a fifth), etc., and someone with £200,000 pays about £70 000 (a little more than a third).
What about social contributions?
The more social contributions, the more local taxes, the more parking costs and the car vignette, and it is before VAT.
Almost 30 per cent of my money is collected from the source before local taxes and the car vineyard.
I'm paid in a decent way, but not in an extraordinary way.
Not a problem, of course, I'm happy to pay my taxes.
But we don't seem to believe that money falls from the sky, or that it's not important to know where billions of tax books pass.
How can a unemployed person who is looking for work at the door prove it?
Even though 20% of the unemployed are not looking, that means 80% are looking and not finding.
Since I'm a unemployed person, do I have more interest in what others are looking for or not?
Whether a potential recruiter receives 10 or 20 CVs, it increases my chances of doing so.
I haven't actually had any news from Póle Employ for months, which means that agents are more involved in control operations than really making job ads come back?
I don't see the interest.
Because it's not the state to provide work.
If Pole Employ does not provide enough jobs, then you need to move from Pole Employ.
What is this about a sensitive subject?
We all have rights and duties, in the present case, we make sure that the unemployed do their duties well in return for their rights.
As a controller, they demand their title of transport to users by means of a means of transport, a service manager, or they are employees of their work, etc.
No one screams at the scandal in these cases, right?
It is good to recall that the unemployed have rights: the only time I had a case at Póle Emploi, my rights at the ARE had been poorly established, and on one of the files, amputated by 40%, it had to fight hard.
It takes time!
I'm not an expert in law.
The fixation and control is currently taking over, while Statutory Póle Employ is close to being, in fact, an insurance company.
I would add that the subject of compensation should concern only employees, who pay the costs.
Non-Salary politicians and French people are granted rights they do not have!
It's not normal.
I would add that decent unemployment insurance is part of the value of paid work.
More than waiting for killer tweets in Arabic...
In fact, there must be a direct military response in Iraq/Syria that will stop Isis so that this virus does not reach this conflict zone.
The situation would then be similar to the spread of the black plague in 1348/9 in connection with the war and displacements of the people at that time.
The Saudis had the mind to ban the Hadj in Mecca this year to the Muslim pilgrims from the three affected countries.
The country reported that 7,400 had seen their visa application refused because of their country of origin or their recent travels.
In fact, there has been the case of a pilgrim who came from Bosnia who contracted the vulnerabilities in Mecca during the '80s, probably contaminated by a pilgrim who came from Somalia, where the disease still exists.
I hope the rest of the world will have the same spirit.
Is it heartless to propose to prevent Ebola's disease from taking a plane for Europe?
I thought it was just good sense, but apparently those "who know" decided that we could risk the lives of tens of thousands of people...
These West African countries where Ebola is out of control should be placed in strict quarantine.
No one's lucky.
Only health personnel can enter.
21 days of waiting after treating patients before they can leave.
If they contract the Ebola virus while they are there, they stay there until they are cured.
These are not draconian measures.
Nothing that last week, people were contaminated after having had contact with people in West Africa, although they took “all the necessary precautions”.
We can stop the progression of this disease.
It is mainly spread by airlines.
Let us forbid them to offer to fly to these countries.
In addition, customs officers at airports should be trained to identify people with typical Ebola symptoms so that they can be immediately placed in quarantine.
May the message of the first individual and the second group (including religious) be passed and the Nobel Peace Prize will be won.
I doubt that it is able to raise in dogma the image of God characterized by the total cortex of the planet in operation.
It's still far from that concept here.
This has only been 20 years since the information appeared as the given prize of humanity, while religion, from the brain, has perhaps led our actions since Lucy.
What is the interest of becoming a single Protestant church?
For those who have not noticed it, Catholicism is widely minority in France today, no one is forced to join it.
Those who criticize would not in any way put their feet in the Church, there is only a small number of Protestants in France.
What is the next step, we take away the notion of sin, too "anxiogenic"?
@louise: Sorry the church has no vision limited to France.
And in the world, it can be that it's going to make you touch more people...
@Martine E, to be honest (as usual) the respect of others as you think it was pre-existing in Christ.
Hillel a century before he was already saying, "Don't do what you don't want to be done, that's all the Torah and the rest is just commenting: go and study!".
Christianity goes well beyond a simple reciprocity but introduces the agape.
Your "makes progress to justice, peace, brotherhood" but without God?
Is this a return to communism? :-)
Next step: Incarnation and resurrection are removed.
Jesus will remain this hero who has upset the moral laws by redefining respect for others.
Christians will then be ready to take their role in the ethical debates of our societies and to advance justice, peace, brotherhood.
Not very Catholic?
I remember that the low number of Protestants in France is mainly due to the fact that their ancestors were eliminated and then became forced and forced into immigration a few centuries ago.
I hesitate too much to buy this, the new Alien game, or Wasteland 2.
And the new Elite game comes out soon.
It's not making up.
I personally would choose SoM.
I love Wasteland 2 (I even participated in his fund raising campaign) but I don't think it's worth £30.
If it is the PC version that interests you, Green Man Gaming currently sells SoM at £30 and also offers a 20% discount.
Green Man Gaming currently sells SoM at £30 and also offers a 20% discount.
I'll take a look.
Of course not at work.
The fun discounts in the computer department block all the nice sites.
Hello, is it 30 £ and then 20 % reduction, or does the 30 £ include 20 % reduction?
Attention, however: PC version is only for DX11.
It surprised me, I bought it, but I can't play it.
Besides, I bought it on Steam, so no refund, it's zero.
It's time to buy a new video card * make the neck*
It's a Brazilian site, but you get a valid Steam ID, I think.
I didn't use it myself.
Amazon 30 £ for PC, 35 £ for Xbox 360 and PS3, 44 £ for Xbox and PS4
Thank you, I'd be afraid one day they'd make it out of your library if they decided to move against the people who bought it there while they're out of the planned area.
So join the beta version of Elite : Dangerous.
So, in 1940, was France a "poor land"?
So you say, this Nobel prize seemed to me like a poisoned gift.
Do you have to love France of 40, the "strange missing"?
When we see who gets the Literature Nobel, we wonder if Proust or Dostoïevsky would have it today.
Nobel is not even an event, we don't even want to read the awarded authors.
Are Brazilians, Chinese or Australians going to read Modiano who is already difficult to read in French and who describes a universe so limited and self-centered?
I hope the other Nobles are more credible, but I honestly doubt it.
Modiano, Levy, Musso only have a long relationship with literature.
Did you at least read it?
Or another Nobel prize?
It would be better to judge.
As for the Chinese, the Brazilians and others, don't worry about them.
Foreigners are very sensitive to French literature and culture.
They will appreciate Mr.
Modiano at its fair value, if they don't know him already!
On your side, continue to attend Lévy and Musso.
I share your opinion.
Marc Levy and Guillaume Musso preserve all their chances.
So let's see who got the Literature Nobel: H.
Pinter in 2005, D.
Say hello to the angry ones.
Since I took one in Iceland, I haven't stopped seeing Kia Sports everywhere.
I think this thing has followed me so far.
Maybe she wants to crush me?
Or do I look like Superman III's horrible computer?
Hello Dantra, always hate her?
Hello DQ - no, not today, I took my doctors.
It's Wednesday!
I had a few days of rest.
It was cool.
Last week I went to Nottingham's beer and cider party.
It was brothel.
I managed to taste 19 different beers, Wobbly Weasel being one of my favorites.
I was pleasantly surprised by the mix of people there, there were only CAMRA fans (not to be confused with camera fans).
Driving on the return Sunday was really hard.
On Monday night we went to the grandfather of a pot to play the nine card brag.
Thanks to a real chance of a beginner, I was able to deal with several decent positions.
I hope that if I get to 95, I'll be as alive as he is.
Last night I went to a chic cocktail bar in Farringdon.
One of my drinks came up with a hot coat on it.
I admire M.
Read some Buddha and you will understand how wrong you are, dear Christian.
That says, without wanting to contradict you, I think you're getting a little far from the subject.
This famous totality, it prohibits searches for the dissidents at the exit of the mosques.
She's signaling weapons traffic without delay.
Either we have big eyes open like Meddeb and Taia or Boubaker or we have big eyes closed.
You have to choose.
It's not keeping your eyes closed that you can access the light.
Forgive me, dear Christian, but once again, you make a monumental counter-sense: all the authorities, organizations or representative associations, whether Muslims or not, having formally condemned the EI and its crimes, the French, Muslims or not, have nothing to add to these unanimous official convictions.
Who doesn't say anything consensual.
The problem is that people like you first see them as Muslims, Arabs or Africans.
Not like French.
Unfortunately, dear Kentoc'h Marvel, the doubt exists for everyone.
As I have said a thousand times, some doubt the approval by the Jewish French of the Israeli massacres in Gaza, but it would be foolish and indecisive to accuse them of priori and to demand that they publicly prove to the rest of the French society that it is wrong to doubt it.
This principle is in my view the negation of the republic and can only contribute to the delicacy of French society.
If there's no doubt, just say it.
Who doesn't say a word consensus, but consents to what?
Agrees to a closeness with the EI or the conviction of the EI.
Silence is very practical, it is the main weapon of those who want to house the goat and the goat.
Your position is intellectually honest but pragmatically intelligible.
Alex Salmond predicted that, during the elections, Scotland could "revenge" the parties represented in Westminster because a huge gap had grown between their decentralization proposals and what they promised to watch the referendum on independence.
Cameron must be petrified to lose all these seats in Westminster...
Cameron must be laughing.
What are these threats?
The Conservatives are completely out of Scotland because they have no seats.
They can do what they want in any electoral impunity.
I don't think even Cameron is stupid enough to believe that the Labor losing seats in Westminster for the benefit of the SNP is a good long-term thing for him and the Conservatives.
Who's going to cry for the Labour Party.
They will be completely eliminated in Scotland by the SNP and UKIP, which will cut their heads in the north.
Ed Miliband joined the "PROMESS" thinking he was saving his party but not realizing that he was signing the death sentence of his Scottish MPs.
Not surprisingly, some Labourers ask their leader for accounts.
If the SNP receives 20-25 seats and there is no majority in Parliament, even if the seats do not come from the Conservatives, then they will be in a very good position to negotiate any coalition and they will be able to force both the Conservatives and the Labour to do what they promised for maximum decentralization.
I think that's important.
Not if the Labour or Conservatives want to be re-elected one day in England.
To pump 8% to 85%, this is not a super electoral strategy.
In addition, once the Scottish MPs are no longer able to vote on issues relating to England, the Conservatives will win all the votes.
Oh, I think he is.
Cameron may not have much to lose, but Miliband does.
Maggie did it with Ulster's unionists and it made him very successful.
However, he is still in high school to be prime minister in 2015 and since he won the leadership of the Labour Party.
So, in large, these boxes will be virtually behind each reader to look over his shoulder and see what he reads, how he reads, and to the end.
It is the "Life of the Others" of East Germany or the KGB applied to the world of FRIC...
Always the same fascination for surveillance techniques.
Finally, this will have at least a sterilizing effect.
I'm waiting for the next ticket: Amazon manufactures you free depending on your profile and this automatically thanks to an algorithm of your secret!

Thank you for the article.
As with this system, DRMs management is not implemented, I still read pirated files, public domain books or purchased from some publishers who have the intelligence to propose files without flies.
I see the price I paid for Kobo, it's no regret.
I am aware of the widespread abdication of users against the generalized ownership of their private lives.
In your large public library, you will systematically notice that everyone gives their loyalty card (name*c, d**itre, ...).
There are also demanding bosses whose opening and closing rates are undoubtedly boring.
For example, James Joyce’s “Finnegans Wake. ”
@Thomas: In the age of Big Data, the data does not really need to be personal to be relevant.
Attention not to put all the literature in the same bay.
The collection of anonymous data when there is a profile....
The harvest is not anonymous.
These are the data published by Kobo that are, not to identify the readers or the authors.
But Kobo has all this information, he.
There have been so many exaggerated, misleading and contradictory statements on the part of the Turkish government in recent days that the country seems to be headed by a mother class full of schizophrenic boys under acid.
It's even worse than taking Erdogan's religious fundamentalism into account.
It is interesting that some Erdogan supporters think Islamist is such an insult that they delete your comment, but not mine. ;-)
Well seen:-P But Turkey doesn't want to throw a ball in the foot, unless there's something to win.
If she attacks ISIS, ISIS will respond, so it's actually getting a bullet in the foot.
A retired diplomat wrote on his blog: "The AP reports that Iran has warned the United States that it would be a mistake to seek to reverse Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad's law because it would endanger Israel's security.
It is not clear in the article whether Iran sent a serious warning of reprisals there or whether it simply advised caution.
This second option is more likely and, in all cases, what is really surprising is that today the Iranian and American diplomatic commitment concerns Syria, Israel and the security of the region."
The reading of Indian Punchline is to strongly recommend anyone who pays attention to the details rather than to the c*news balanced by traditional media. The short article you give the link is important and should be read in mind by keeping in mind the realistic / previous warnings from Iran proposed by Afghanistan around 1979 - 1980.
Who are these "moderate" who are seriously fighting the terrible Laic Assad and at the same time the evils of ISIS?
The policy of pipelines moves the world towards the abyss and I would suggest that those who refer to "moderate" non-existent ones pay more attention to the facts and alternatives before sending the children of others to battle in the Third World War.
"It's even worse than taking into account Erdogan's religious fundamentalism" Is there any other religious fundamentalists in the Middle East?
I've got one in my head.
A Nuremberg trial for the Armenian genocide committed by the Turks would be needed.
Should I?
Do you realize that neither the criminals nor the victims have the least chance of being alive yet?
A little late for that, my brother...
Wouldn't the criminals be barely old now, 120 years old?
It's a little late for that, isn't it?
Especially with regard to the CUP triumph that planned and directed the genocide, Talat and Djemaal killed just after the 1st World War by revenge by the Armenians, and Enver killed by Bolsheviks in a peaceful place in Central Asia near the same time, when he went there dreaming of setting up a Turkish empire there.
What a waste!
An impressive master of the sophistication of the fatal penis, but besides that, we are looking for in vain the contact with the reality.
That of clichés without argument.
The fetus will always hear a heart that beats even in the belly of a pregnant mother.
Lesbian couples can simply be a child’s desire and not a desire to be accepted.
Sterile hetero couples too.
How about the kids!
What a shame to name them as future psychological imbalances.
One day, they will have the age to defend themselves, to say they are happy to live, to earn their lives and to pay the pension of this woman (?)
The GPA is undoubtedly a temporary "solution" in the evolution of the medicine that our world knew.
She doesn't date today.
Many women brought and placed in the world children who were not their husbands.
It's still like this, we're done like this...
The important thing in this regard is that this practice is framed so that the "marchandization" of the body is limited.
But aesthetic surgery, cosmetics aren't they also body marketing? !
Anachronic unit ...
It's easier to grow a good in distant countries via the Internet and Pay Pal than to encumber his responsibilities and or to avoid scandal in another century near his home without shouting him at this time on all roofs! ...
These practices were no longer done on behalf of the church! ...
There are only Christians and believers who refuse these practices ...
There is nothing less than the operation of the bodies is a real problem.
Oh, shut up, this man is passionate about something.
At the end of the 1970s in the Midlands, I saw it from far away.
I had to go there every day because I didn't have the right to go there at night!
But if you like it and you listen to music - this music today it always touches you so much.
I don't know why there are so many shocking comments here about what Paul Mason says, maybe they're posted by people who've never been cool, even for a few years!
I think in the sports section there is an article on the foot that awaits your comments.
Super article, very true.
Since Tony Parson's film, there has been a shortage of reports that really reflect the reality of North England's culture.
Nothing surprising about what Paul Mason has done well in the social and political context, he understands things very well.
The Northern soul still lives, but it has been vampireized by capitalism, and today it is essentially a surface phenomenon.
That says, you can throw an ear there if you are in the region of London in November: 99psoul will again pass sun vinyls, including full of Northern sun, on Saturday, November 15 at Betsey Trotwood in Farringdon.
I also thought "always the same story", but here's a little article well written and well thought.
your critics really need to be more constructive.
Super article.
I loved your documentary.
I suppose you're happy to have escaped from Newsnight.
Last train for Wigan from Victoria/Exchange and down to Wallgate.
They're eating pills.
What the train before Wigan was Ince, 15 min walk from Wigan after buying a ticket for the arrest after Victoria!
The beginnings of the Northern Soul scene are described in an excellent episode of the George Gently Police Series entitled Gently Northern Soul, which takes place in Newcastle in 1968.
Cases are becoming more and more poisonous.
Palestinians have no partner for peace.
Unfortunately, Netanyahou never misses an opportunity to miss an opportunity to negotiate peace.
@Jonathan: Netanyahou does not seek peace because he wants to continue to occupy-coloniser (also, Rabin's case).
It is clear that Rabin, Netanyahou and their electors all preferred occupation-colonization to peace.
He wore his clothes, put them on the rock and entered the water.
An Israeli had stolen them.
The Israeli representative was angry and shouted: "What are you talking about?
The Israelites were not even there at the time!".
The Palestinian Representative (UN) added and added: and now that things are clearly established
Israel and the majority of its population have no confidence in the bipolar government of the Palestinian authority and will not diminish the guard ...
To move it to the anti-Israeli peoples is an evidence, it's not the intended purpose ...
Antisionist: But I answered, I translate: the global geopolitical report ...
And it's always like this since the Policy is globalized...
Avoid, avoid...
In the Israeli-colonialist conflict, for the creation of the Palestinian state, it is certain, it loses!
You are not responding to the creation of Israel.
What force report has allowed the creation of Israel?
Antisionist: the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is still a force report today!
You doubt it?!!! ...
Besides, this isn't just about Russell Brand, but the Guardian journalists seem to have trouble going beyond anything else he didn't have to say.
Many of what he says are just pseudo-chomskystic billaves written by others.
That proves you don't understand what Russell Brand says, or what Noam Chomsky says.
It's just a result of personal attacks and insinuations (my 13-year-old daughter likes it well, which means it's a matter of immaturity).
A really vicious charge, with just a suspicion of taking consciousness that Russell Brand says certain truths, maybe the truths that we prefer not to think about.
You know, that feeling is going to be more and more widespread!
I can understand why Brand horrors some: sometimes he speaks pretensely and after all the absurdities of the tabloids he actually gives the impression that he is a populist, but all this history of not voting has been completely misunderstood by me.
The general consensus seems to be that it just tells people not to vote and rather to cross their arms and ignore the entire political process - but if you look at Paxman's interview and other articles/videos that he has posted, he says that voting once every 5 years only for Labour or Conservatives (or Lib Dems I suppose) and limiting the democratic commitment to this is completely useless, both parties (at slightly different levels) ruling primarily in favour of particular interests, multinationals and rich, he does not at any time simply ignore politics because these parties do not rule in our name: he insists that rather than just voting and disengage during five years of political and rich, multi-sexistenceditional, political, political, political, political, political, political, political, political, political, political, political, political, political, political, political, political, political, political, political, political, political, political, political, political, political, political, political, political, political, political, political, political, political, political, political, political, political, political, political, and political, political, political, political, political, and political.s.s.s.s.s.s.s.s, political.s, political, political, political.s, political.s to the themselves. themselves. themselves. themselves.
I do not say that I am necessarily in agreement with his solution (because I think that being politically active by presenting his requests can go away with the fact that politicians are going to change their mind if they are really at risk of losing the election), but it is a shame to see all these condensing answers that say that this foolish one who makes Jesus tell young people not to take the penalty to vote and just hope that everything will be better because it is really distorting his arguments.
His solution is extremely controversial and it would be good if people discussed what he really said rather than simply label him as irresponsible and deal with his concerns and a large number of people left behind.
Yes, thank you.
The item on the vote was totally deformed.
The point is that I am very angry with the fact that my vote does not really count for anything.
I want more referendums, the electronic vote, direct democracy and Members who report locally to their electors.
In addition, I answer the idea that Russell Brand's words are not hiss (written by others).
It is smart enough to have its own ideas and ideas, even though they are strongly influenced by the kind of anti-establishment thinkers and universities from the counter-culture that Suzanne would want to group under the label "seudo-chomskyste pseudo-billies".
I am convinced that in a debate he would succeed in convincing Suzanne.
Maybe that's what the Guardian could do, let Suzanne do like Polly Toynbee and interview Russell on a veranda, with even the head coaches ravaged to the assembly!
Like Max Keiser, who at first attacked Russell but ended up becoming one of his fans and inviting him to his show, it's too easy to attack him without really understanding where he wants to come from.
It is in a political discourse that has existed since generations, but which has been marginalized by traditional media - including the Guardian - since generations.
This "fronde" is particularly apparent in my eyes that the intellectual debate has long since been held in the RDV of the History where trade historians have become minority and the trades of specialists have contributed to the benefit of thinking of condensed type Sciences Po for press files.
For me, I had seen in Pierre Boudrieu's intellectual attitude as well as Michel Foucault's, a need to take it to a guilty, emissary loop.
They develop each other's very rational reasoning, but this rationality is based on these emission holes that are the key to their thinking.
Rather, I believe that for Foucault the State was indispensable as a criminal.
This is a very archaic thought, the sacrificial thought, which is also the magical thought.
The problem of the report to the other was solved by eliminating it.
There is an anarchist, neo-lib and/or /libertarian pente ( of the two terms the second mark is a hardening desire to eradicate the state , the first to go to seek State support for its markets ) within the meaning of the least state / not all state in Foucault .
The old dream of the base that auto-organizes beautifully.
Its thought is built on the guilt of the State: without that guilt it does not stand.
Who says guilty, says elimination, murder, sacrifice.
This is not a position against the three intellectuals quoted here .
Not any other support.
The totalitarian left remembers the good old time, the one of his god then, Stalin, the little father of the peoples.
Oulala, you have probably read a chouya too quickly if you have taken the texts of Foucault on the Iranian revolution for an apology of Khomeiny.
Today, even Pierre Manent would no longer have fun attacking Michel by this way...
Gauchet puts a profound thought on the contemporary individual and the collective, on the difficulty of the accession mechanism in our advanced liberal societies.
Whether we agree with him or not, he is an original and respectable thinker.
See this horse orchestrated by researchers in human sciences on the hard left who do not support the fact that we pass allegation on to their mantras, it is quite manageable.
Narcissism and the authoritarianism of these people is boundless.
An important point to add seems to me to be the post of these "rebels", which is only intellectual and theoretical.
The treatment of Chinese and other "yellows" I have witnessed in Russia is absolutely incredible.
You didn't have the pleasure of hearing our Australian friends about this, then.
And where was it in Russia, that a Russian could meet a Chinese and have a personal opinion?
I don't remember when I saw a Chinese for the last time.
In London and they were nice to me when they learned that I was Russian.
In Russia here - the last time in the 1990s, in a market.
The Chinese feel the same way about the Whites!
My family lives in Australia after having come from Hong Kong and Guangzhou long ago, in the middle of the 20th century, and I still hear some of them have violent anti-Blanc talks.
My father's not happy that his old daughter went out with a White.
I also believe that the attitudes have changed in Russia since the 1990s, and especially in recent years: they are increasingly rich, prosperity spread beyond the big cities, and thanks to this prosperity, people travel abroad and see how others live.
What I have been told is that the Russians are particularly prejudiced against temporary workers without qualification from the Caucasus and Central Asia, who work in occupations and in areas where they are very likely to be exploited by their employers or confronted with high crime and violence.
Although I lived on the banks of the Ienesi River in Siberia.
Unfortunately, I have heard the views of Australians on Chinese and Aboriginal people.
It's really weird that a stranger tells me that I don't support Chinese, while I met two in my life (one abroad), I haven't kept bad memories of them, all the people are able and, in fact, those in London were very nice, that's the only reason I remembered that they were Chinese.
Otherwise you don't remember who you're meeting, all people are doing well, how you remember who you were.
You know what's weird?
May you and the other Russians here speak of Chinese as a unique kind of fascination, as if they were an attraction in a zoo.
And yet you always go out with this White guy.
How many Chinese men are with Blanches, by comparison?
No one, because there is a lot of chance that parents of these Blanches would assault them PHYSICALly.
No measure of impartiality of justice.
However, it is the mother of all battles and justice in France is still manipulated by groups strongly marked on the left as the union of the judiciary...
@Maraabout: I'm sorry, but the judicial environments are clearly marked to the right.
When it comes to the judiciary's union, it represents only 25% of the judges.
If a measure of its partiality can be taken from the relativity of the application of the laws in courts, it is ordered to remove two obstacles.
The political vision of the observer as the actual interpretation of the magistrate.
The law's mandatory tool for refocusing the evaluation on fundamentals remains.
The measure of its non-compliance with all the judicial acts of magistrates, including prosecutors, requires a distinction between the error and the partiality of the magistrates.
It should be claimed that the acts of justice do not divide between these three groups.
Claims and ignorance are not covered by objective analysis.
And so if all of this is not analysed, then how can it be said that justice is improving in France?
If it's only by statistics that implicitly reveal that it's very low.
The previous preamble enables you to record correctly what follows in the third ratio.
The man of corruption* of the judiciary.
A sensitive subject in proportion to the power of nuisance* that is conferred on the judicial institution capable of such a heresy.
The area concerned is that of the spoil* of heresies made up of the means of excruciating the proceedings* by successive genologists sent by notaries.
This profession is well received in 150 million euros a year, while receiving coverage* provided by the French notary's quasi-impunity*.
For the understanding of their mechanism, a part was reported in the comments following the first publication.
Where this is accompanied by the statistical improvement*, as measured by the previous comment, the judicial institution has produced, in many disputes between genologist and heretics who are reluctant to do so, a whole set of case-laws that are contrary to all laws that favour heirs.
The presentation of European statistics that ignores this kind of rational criteria is not then a developed form of lie?
Probably totally prohibitive prices.
Still equipment to destroy people with disabilities.
It can be said that, but my brother has one of these tricycles all over the ground, built to the extent of his size and weight, and this really allowed him to enjoy the full air as never a normal wheelchair, with wheels and tires covered, could not.
As we say, the tastes and colors...
The Tankchairi looks like Jeremy Clarkson could invent a challenge in Top Gear.
The tankchair is EPIQUE.
I think Will's inventor never had to clean a dog crotch on a chenille.
I'm sure my sister would love the tricycle all over the country, but it's just too expensive.
The long-range ultra wheelchair would be perfect for a disabled person with a pen for the longboard.
Here are some hills they'd like.
The prices actually seem high, but there are really people who put this kind of price in a bike, so "you see".
The tricycle of all the land seems particularly useful to me.
Not all people with disabilities are poor, however.
Many of them have insurance at their disposal of a reasonable amount.
Only if they have become disabled.
The thing is that the wheelchair market is a niche, so they can afford to practice high prices for things they know we need.
We can't really say that Wheel is minimalist.
This is an example of excessive design.
Unfortunately, it's just a draw, it's not planned to make it.
I'M CONTINUED that the wheelchair "long distance" does not reach the market, because obviously there is no way to drive this trick.
Nearly 20,000 houses were destroyed by the Israeli army in Gaza during intensive bombings of densely populated residential areas.
Two million human beings have been prisoners of the Israeli blockade of Gaza since 2007 (Israel is the occupying power of the Palestinian territory, not Egypt).
Half are children and young people under 18 years of age.
Eight-year-olds have lived their whole life under Israeli blocs!
The world's unique situation, unacceptable situation, illegal situation, as this block imposes a "collective penalty" on all the civilians in Gaza.
" Entrepreneurs working on their projects turn a little from their cement to the black market " ...
Oh, that's not the language of wood, it's concrete, it's the lady's army.
The references are there to support an argument or a fact.
Antisionist...
The good cement goes into the tunnels!
The black market is certain, and recognized.
Two million human beings have been prisoners of the Israeli blockade of Gaza since 2007.
A unique situation in the world, an unacceptable situation for anyone who has a heart and a moral sense.
The United States has a well-maintained ground: Saudi Arabia.
Morsi didn't have the time to govern because the dictatorship (supported by whom you know) excluded it!
Don't forget that after I lifted it, Morsi had restored the block!!!
And I'm a Western, so I approve...
Jonathan...
The Block is Israel-Egyptian ...
The children of Gaza live on a underground fortress, built against the people who chose their masters!
Having a boat, it's a lot of work, Alex.
I hope you've thought it through.
Couchsurfing is much cooler than Airbnb.
It is the very definition of the sharing economy, without profit.
Many are only looking for one night on Couchsurfing.
So it is to be paid (or at least to expect it) in another way.
It's always much less expensive than a hotel, if you need to find the right addresses.
In addition, owners and tenants who are trusted often stop using Airbnb and deal directly in cash, thus turning Airbnb.
Where is the community in all this.
"What does she put in a rental?"
No problem with the verb, what's the problem with your grammar?
The verb "to let" is not used in the United States.
The author simply used an American expression.
It's an international newspaper now, in case you didn't notice.
It would be better to have the good insurance for the ship, make sure it is 100% in accordance with all the safety rules and ask those managing channels and rivers to allow it to do a commercial activity (which they will certainly refuse). I have a boat and I have tried to see how to rent it (in all honesty) on Airbnb, in short, it is really a nightmare...
Have you thought that ships can be moved, stolen and repeated, painted, etc.?
The penises are so slow that if someone tried to steal it, it would always be close to where you left it.
Or distracted by pirates...
All these Somali immigrants who come here and attack our penitentiaries...
Where are you going to take it?
No Marine Le Pen is right!
Popularism?
There is no truth but the one who exposes the facts!
Poverty is increasing in France.
More than 150,000 young people leave school without training.
The increase in wealth among the richest is a reality.
Who defends who?
Who's defending what?
In 2017 the Mass will be said!
Capitalism won't get out of the way!
The high funding, speculative, plays with our businesses, thus our jobs, our raw materials, our purchases, our food, our health care structures, our institutions.
They are a threat in our daily lives by the same and our money they hold..
All of this is for the benefit of some hyper-mega-obesess of the frieze.
To the contrary, FH said, "My enemy has no name, my enemy has no face, my enemy is the financial."
It was in 2012.
In 2014, he appointed Minister of the Economy an elder of the Rothschild Bank, a history of better defending the interests of the bankers, only responsible for the 2007 crisis.
Was there anyone else in the race?
You call it how to get his dress back, lower his pants?
Primary and populist response
In fact, we don't know much about what Marine Le Thinks.
Where'd you see that?
Because the Germans refused to help the survivors.
I'm not sure that Spee has really "refused" to help the survivors.
One aspect of this battle was that none of the parties seemed certain of the exact force of the enemy.
Robert Massie in his book "Castles of Steel" suggests that Spee quickly left the area because he had received a report indicating a British kiln in the area.
The sea was clumsy at the beginning of the day; I don't know if it was still the case at the end of the battle?
Similarly, the battle ended after the sun was set, making any rescue operation more difficult.
Compare this with the next battle, that of the Maloons, where, on the photos showing survivors as they are safe, we see a calm and full day sea.
In addition, the rescuers knew that there were no more German fighters in the area at this point.
Hmm, that doesn't really correspond to what I remember reading about this battle, so I did a quick search on Wikipedia:
"A certain confusion reigned among the German ships as to the fate of the two furthest cruisers, who had disappeared in the black after they had stopped shooting, and a race-track began.
The Leipzig saw something in fire, but as he approached it, it was only a sword.
Nürnberg, slower than the other German ships, joins the battle late and lives Monmouth, sinned and seriously damaged but still in motion.
After placing its projectors on the flag of the ship, the proposal to become a ship was rejected and it opened the fire, finally running the ship.
Without reliable information, von Spee judged that the Good Hope had to escape and stop the search at 2215 hours.
Concern of reports indicating a British karate in the vicinity, he headed north. ”
So, if that's true, the Germans, in the dark before the radar invention, didn't know that a ship had fallen, and could not find survivors.
They also thought that there was a more important cowardice of the Royal Navy in the area that could have seriously damaged them, so in confusion they failed to benefit from their advance.
They were far from their base and Spee was well aware that they should break a path through many of the Royal Navy ships.
Cradock's sacrifice had already caused them harm and cost them about half of their ammunition, thus condemning them when they were finally taken.
Several votes are before the UMP to request that it be registered in the law that a finally convicted electorate be ultimately ineligible.
This is a courageous position, which would also touch left-wing electors well on.
But noon, it's a joke.
FOR THIS idea I PROPOSED A INCRITION TO THE MURDER OF THE MAJISTRATS
When is the ban on trade unions in the already protected sectors?
How long will you tolerate this distortion of equality among citizens?
As a result of political leaders whose vision of society is limited to these sectors, they are always quick to correct those who will benefit from their inviolability to prevent the actions of real politicians, who are really trying to move things, not the beautiful ones whose real estate is to the extent of their adequacy.
I met them in the subway at noon with their little benches" from the bottom for justice" they came from the province and did not make the difference between Bercy and the POPB.
It supports the existence of politicized unions whose members place the enormous power they hold in the service of their party.
It would not defend the same thesis if right-wing unions, or extreme-rights unions, were to target the personalities of its side and to wage a legal and media war against them.
Your statements are absolutely free.
If, at the moment, the right is detracting from the judicial situation, it has simply done some of the facts!
There is no example of a left-handed person who had so much to do with justice, but all those who had taken care of him have not been treated with favor.
On the other hand, it should be recalled that the trade union of the judiciary that is left is not the only trade union of magistrates and that it is minority.
That a supportive minister with so much commitment the unions show how useful they can be.
@MCR The union you quote may be minority among the magistrates, but its influence is great in Chankelerie, it is not a secret.
The question now arises whether the "mission" of some judges is not more than instructing.
@ sag - You should be satisfied, the SM is minority.
What are you complaining about?
@Pivoine: You forget that the magistrates are not officials like the others: they are the only ones to have the power to accuse and incarcerate everyone.
Jade Goody?
What if none of the participants ever came back?
Hello, Katie Waissel.
I believe that even the weakestest of glory realizes that X-Factor can only mean the end of a career, so I would be surprised that someone accepts their offer.
Many have served as a tramplin to start a successful career.
The One Direction fills the world's stages.
Others then sold lots of discs or went to West End.
Popstars, the precursor of all these programs, launched Chreyl Cole, who is actually part of the jury.
Even ABBA, Olivia Newton-John, Céline Dion, Cliff Richard, have all won the Eurovision competition, as well as so many others.
While others like Frank Sinatra and everyone else participated in competitions in the United States.
In the 1970s and 1980s, New Faces and Opportunity Knocks launched most of the light entertainment stars of British television.
Of course, some have fallen into oblivion.
But that's what happens anyway to most stars that don't participate in the competition.
Rare are those who, after a tube, succeed in doing so to others.
In any case, most of the singers/groups can best expect three albums and one best of.
Yes, but now Cole, or whatever his name is, has only fans in the United Kingdom.
His celebrity comes partly from his marriage with a footballer who breathes through his mouth.
Most Americans know who Jeremy Clarkson is.
can only mean the end of a career
In fact, it's more likely to start on a career than the typical rock walk, even if in your dreams you think that all guitar coolers who smoke from the grass in their father's garage and balance three agreements on a stage primary school level will certainly become stars and that the only question is how much they want to touch before they even get out of an album.
And worse than ridicule: it establishes a completely artificial distance between the Western public and the studied peoples – a distance that turns pretty quickly to racism, because the Sacralist ethnologists present us these distant people as infinitely superstitious and petriage ritual, while most of their ways of doing so are strictly equivalent to ours and inspired, like ours, of practical considerations every day.
Unless you implicitly interpret in reverse sense.
But rather than saying that the drum is devoid of a sacred character, is it not better to admit that our Marianne and our Moliers do not also have a somewhat sacred character?
Our way is as recalled to see the sacred as a kind of well-defined object and circumscribed to the religious sphere.
Article very interesting whatever it is.
It's from the ephemer deco to build the vacuum.
No more.
Great article, thank you.
The recent Pantheonization of illustrative figures of the Republic is an illustration that the feeling of sacred still lives.
Who still believes in the interpretations of archaeologists!
Any other discipline would throw into the ears of the interpretations of not any scientist who lived the life of a mandarin, rarely less.
When did a critic compare disciplines to a little bit of regulation?
Because what's worth for archaeology is also worth the interpretations that other disciplines give.
This would provide a dose of healthy modesty.
Your contempt for archaeologists is totally unjustified!
It is thanks to them that we constantly discover treasures, valuable evidence to restore history, understand societies, and the example here of comparative archaeology is passionate.
This method is not very old, and before the archaeologists relied on their "instinct" and their knowledge, and they could be deceived.
Today, technical and scientific means are available so powerful that the interpretation of the papers is better but can always be challenged by other discoveries!
We are here in full (and old) polemic on chamanism advanced by prehistoric Jean Clottes (cf. his book "The Chaplains of Prehistory", particularly the increased re-issue of the scientific controversy, published by the editions La Maison des Roches).
Thank you for this highly instructive article
Heteros men love anal sex?
For you, Mike, I could put myself in there.
So it's over between us?
I don't really understand why can't we go on to three?
This journal is supposed to be serious, made for adults.
Do you really need to fall into the cavalry?
No, but we're not against a playroom over there.
We couldn't watch a musical comedy over there on the other hand, that would be too gay!
We could expect to have this kind of comment on your part.
It looks like Mary Whitehouse came back from the dead.
Since your test offer is almost finished, then I suggest you move to the Catholic Times.
I'm sure you'll feel more at home.
He prefers mikedow.
I can suggest that we all look for a newspaper that pays for real, courageous journalists to write about the Middle East, Ebola, etc. at their risks and dangers.
Instead of getting rid of these dirty ass jokes.
Not too bad.
Go on, then.
If these "poor ass jokes" shock you so much, you're not forced to participate, are you?
Do you also know that this newspaper also covers the Middle East and Ebola and that it is absolutely possible to do both and publish an article on anal sex?
Is it the subject that shocks you, or is it the fact that people are messing with it?
However, we find the amateur video of the crash on the net...
amateur video of the crash on the net... ?
If the FOM chose not to show these images, it is only to protect its interests in no case those of the pilot.
If the FOM wanted to protect the pilots, it would have released safety because at the moment or another vehicle (e.g., a trailer) entered the circuit.
But it had to end quickly before the typhoon that we knew was coming, but for which the FOM did not think it was good to advance the time of departure (telephone, pub, silver...).
But besides that, they protect the pilots well.
Well, see, I'm also sharing that opinion.
But there is also that if the very British FOM has entered the SC, it will allow Nico Rosberg to have a chance at restarting to beat the English that was then...
You're throwing my dear Dayrton on this blog.
But it's not serious, I've got a little time to figure out all your c****s.
No, just not.
There have been a lot of conspiracy in F1, but one who never puts commissioners at risk of death for a long history of a pilot's chance to win at the expense of another.
It's not the FOM that gets out of safety because it's the FIA.
Size nuance.
In the light of amateur images, the absence of image allows the FIA to avoid the type-related issues: How does the Commissioner shake a green flag in full intervention and continue to do so after the accident (see the full video after the accident)
No, it's not because the video is considered too violent that the FIA blocks the images of the accident, but because one of the Commissioners clearly acts as a green flag, it signes that the race can normally be resumed and is more under the yellow flag regime.
Some comments show a dark ignorance of F1.
Yes, dear Etienne, the race is no longer under the yellow flag as soon as the site of the accident, from which the green flag is agitated.
It's the usual procedure.
The station of commissioners just below the accident (if any, it can be 10 metres as 100 metres after the accident) shakes the green to tell the pilots to resume a normal alleviation.
Sensationalism makes the pub sell.
I used to think that the media were an integral part of the government's "patriotic" propaganda offensive, but I was very afraid that, in the end, it was just for money.
And sex, let's not forget sex, fear of not having sex, the pub and the media are good for selling things that are supposed to improve our sexual life.
The information does exactly the same thing.
Making the buzz with information that we really don't need to worry about is just to continue to scare people so that they can continue to control them.
"When tabloids twist about Ebola, we all catch fear" This should be "dragling", not "tossing".
In view of the medical reference, “tossing ” is much better said in this context than “tossing. ”
I wonder if all the people who complain that Ebola could get on the airway realize that they now believe in evolution?
You're making them too honored.
They probably think that this is the end of the world and that Ebola is just one of the signs of the approaching apocalypse.
Ebola is the Antichrist!
You're confusing Ebola and Murdoch...
Super article, thank you!
A short and concisual article that ridicules this pseudo-journalism in a ridiculous and solid way.
It made me feel good.
It saddens me that the media are talking about most things with this optimism on the other hand.
The goal is once again to keep us sufficiently frustrated and anxious (without getting to the hysteria) for the government can get us out when it needs it.
I think it is perfectly logical that, if we have to face a budgetary emergency in the absence of any crisis, a terrorist emergency in the absence of any attention, why not have an Ebola crisis in the absence of any incident?
It seems that this government is trying to save us from crises that he has invented himself.
Isn't there something fundamentally problematic with the idea of ruling by fear?
Congratulations on this post, and to be still from this world almost 35 years later.
In addition, it had to be horrible at the beginning, given the context of the 1980s-90s.
I'm bluffing, living with the certainty of spending years in it...
Perfectly useless testimony.
As always when we talk about science.
Not only do the evidence serve nothing: taken alone, it cannot serve as scientific material.
But they have a negative influence on the objective assessment of facts.
@trafic: The evidence cannot serve as scientific material.
This may be why questions are not raised to patients in psychiatry when there are reliable observations from close relatives.
My psychiatric record says that my mother's psychiatrist explains that I was educated telepathically by her mother-in-law.
This is therefore an objective symptom.
When I say it's a mistake, it's a subjective testimony of no importance.
Ah, because the certification of a fact (= here this testimony, which testifies to the pollution and effectiveness of new treatments) is nothing to do with a scientific approach?
What are you looking for, then?
On ghosts?
Do you put at the same level fantasy theories and facts (= giving rise to verifiable evidence)?
"Resilience": the word "bidon" by the grandparents, fans of J-L Delarue, who take themselves for great psychologists after having read D'sembourg.
@Jim: There are full of buzzwords empty in the Psys.
Cyrilik has struck us with the "resistance".
As a great scientist, Cyrulnik, I hope he'll bluff us with a reliable scale of measurement to quantify it, this famous resilience.
I wonder if the Air Sentinels could all save us from Farage and company?
Doesn't that make you think of Team America?
Seriously, it's not a good idea to highlight the Sentinels of the air...
So why?
It was a great series and it seems that those who see it are aware of it!
So let us leave our salvation to the Almighty who can do miracles.
But how are they going to make children grow up?
The only solution that comes to mind is the humour of pipi-caca, which would kill the series.
It was already a children's show.
The kids were hanging out.
Oh, because it's a children's show?
UKIP is working for the Mysterys.
So keep your team America.
Always in Supermarionation?
It won't be the same if you don't see the sons and that the animation is well done. :-)
I'm looking forward to seeing this (even as an adult), but I hope it will give the idea of a channel redefining the old ones.
The series has almost never stopped being broadcast here in Australia; at least 40 years ago we have episodes from one hour on Saturday and Sunday at 06.
Since the arrival of free digital television a few years ago, it is on one of the second-order commercial channels and can always be seen at these times.
And in addition, the episodes of one and a half hours pass now at 5:30 p.m. from Monday to Friday!
Okay, I'm probably a 60-year-old sad guy, but I don't watch this series every day!
There is no "Mount of the Temple" in or under the planks mosque!!!
The radical Zionists invented this to give themselves political legitimacy to colonize Jerusalem.
Moreover, all the Israeli fossils below and around the plane mosque have been unable to find anything for decades.
The mountain of the temple if it exists it is elsewhere.
Could it be Argentina?
This mountain is not sought for the simple reason that it is the hill on which the plan of the mosques has been built.
Its top, or the dome of the Rock, makes sail in the middle of the Omar mosque.
For Muslims, Mahomet is mounted in Paradise from this rock.
For the Jews, this is Mount Moriah, where Abraham weakens and sacrifices his son Isaac.
Since it was taken and contextualized, there is no propaganda, but information, dear K1K1.
Israel also counts its extremists, it is good to remind him regularly, and they are unfortunately relayed to the government (Naftali Bennet, Avigdor Liebermann, and even Netanyahou, the latter had accepted the plan to 2 states, and it has been suffused continuously!).
It is also good to show the extent to which Jerusalem's annexation is not a peaceful fact.
Can God recognize his people?
The shortest of Jewish lies: "God be praised!"
To boast tourism in Israel, we are often seen as young people who are half naked, lying on the beach.
The reality is, as usual, very different from what advertising shows us, as can be seen on the picture that illustrates the article.
It's a little scary, though.
And this photo is a wonderful propaganda work!
Regrettably, the photographer of Reuters did not take photos of the hundreds of Palestinians allowed to return to the Mount of Temple and who preferred to call the faithful Jews on opposite sides, praying at the Wall of Lamentations.
@Mat, If this photo bothers you, it's right, it's not the newspaper, it's the photographer, but this woman and the ideology that she transmits that you have to condemn.
This system is not tenacious and will end in tears.
The only way to end this system is the revolution.
Since the economy seems to go wrong, large businesses have greatly benefited from their employees.
They managed to convince their employees that they had a chance to have a job and that they could not afford to increase their wages, while at the same time and without hiding, they gave even more important rewards to the small elite at the summit.
You are right, it is not tenacious, but it will only change in this country when the workers really talk about one voice.
Instead of tearing and chewing when someone else does the strike, support them, show some solidarity and understand that their strike is not only about their problems, but also shows your employer that people are not taxed.
Unless we abandon democracy, in which case, it's tenacious.
I totally agree.
The only thing you have forgotten is that British and American companies have sold our industry and now our services to countries where social and environmental conditions are the worst.
Like China and India.
All this can't end well.
It's because we're in democracy that it's held.
Did you vote for the PTCI?
The Transatlantic Partnership for Trade and Investment (PTCI) aims to increase the profits of companies held by these people in the short run by national governments by secret courts.
This seems incredible, but that is exactly what the agreement proposed for the dispute settlement mechanism between investors and States (ISDS).
The Greens are against this project and are trying to alert people about the unimaginable damage that this agreement will have on our lives.
It's just recently we're starting to talk about it in the media: Independent Guardian World Development Movement So look at these links and you'll understand what's being negotiated in your back.
Did Churchill not say "blood, sweat and tears"?
That's what makes a lot of difference, while the digital money has no reason to fall and even less to push on the trees.
The next low mailbox will no doubt be the car market.
This gentleman is right, at XVIII there were trade unions in all regimes
In the very French Catholic army, there is a sacrificial dimension.
Let it (in the end, its officers, the others, no one knows anything) believe in the strength of the eternal values of France, and it will fight and close its neck.
And then with the decline of the country, globalization, Europe, the crisis of values, in short: the dissolution of the nation's idea, having this small remnant, it is comforting.
Even if for her, it's getting more and more uncomfortable...
They still miss the union of married men, singles, married women, singles, lost dogs and I don't know what yet
If you don't write the French correctly, I'll be syndicated.
You've been warned, it'll be your fault.
For the defence of the categorical interests, there is already enough protection of trade unions, which has created a breakdown of equality with other citizens.
We are asked not to laugh about the fear of the risk on the part of a staff member.
We can very well imagine a system that ensures freedom of expression without unions, or then without the right to strike as in Germany, contrary to the protection they enjoy.
Or an insured disaster.
And with the charts that are being prepared, the government welcomes it.
What security are you talking about?
I don't know. I don't know.
Ignore for Sybile's ignorance I alluded to military and other officials, as this is the subject commented here...
Let us delete "by means of his delegates" in article 8 of the 1946 preamble of the Constitution.
It will become: "8.
Every worker participates in the collective determination of working conditions and in business management."
This is absolutely essential with the collapse of the information power.
And yet you have opened, probably read and then commented on an article specifically entitled "The Great British Bake Off Review".?????
Wait, the section was here, empty.
I thought the conversation had to be started.
Anyway, it's Joffrey's marriage that I've been looking at, and I can tell you that some of them have been very trained.
In Joffrey's wedding episode, we have one of the best moments (because it was the wine) in television history.
Also, of the mmm tart...
Game of Thrones!
I love GBBO!
It's the second time that the show ends with a win of the worst bum; no one has done the kind "boom, here's my bitch now buff her and bow to your master"!
Maybe the extra pressure from friends and parents outside finally had an effect on them?
The previous weeks, all these outside persons were kept away.
And there's also this idea to "play security, there's always the next week" that disappears last week.
I like cooking, but I don't think I'm gonna get involved with it.
I am grateful to those who do it and thus offer us a super fun and motivate us to try new things.
Forward for GBBO 2015!
I agree, last year's challenge, the wedding party, was absurd.
Professionals usually set out days to do them, and they had to brittle one in 3-4 hours.
The three challenges were really hard to leave, I don't know how they could choose a winner.
At Luis, the only real defect they could find was the base a little dry (even though I agree with Hollywood to say that the green ice on Richard's mill was not willing, in any way Richard had already lost at that time).
I must admit that several challenges in this series seem a little artificial due to the time given.
There's also the cancer that's looking at, with the beats of the sun.
Definitely, all of us succeed at this time.
A bad time for humanity, we hope.
You confuse solar wind and ultraviolet rays.
UV is mainly blocked by the ozone layer, which is formed precisely by the impact of residual solar wind particles and UV.
So even if the magnetic field was weakened, there would not be enough solar wind to "hunt" the stratosphere ozone.
There would be even more, so less HIV and cancer.
Fortunately, the ozone layer does not block UV.
They have a lot of useful functions you don't suspect.
If we limit ourselves to man they are interested in allowing us to have bones (vitamin D synthesis), to heat us (less than infrareds), to modulate our immune system and, it seems, to improve our morals.
The ozone layer blocks the carcinogenic UVCs and allows the UVAs and most UVBs to pass.
Do you know that you are not obliged to be condescending and to view your interlocutor as a resident when you post a comment?
Especially for a minor precision that was understood in the comment, which itself intends to prove pedagogy.
Without saying that I'm a melanome habit, UV does only accelerate its development.
They're not provocative.
For proof: all bronzed persons do not necessarily have melanomas.
So when a tube tells you to avoid the sun and live in the bottom of a cave, it's better not to listen because UV is necessary for all humans.
The excess, on the other hand, is like everything: he kills.
But for other reasons.
UV directly causes melanoma.
Can we get it?
And more importantly, can we get it to the mixer?
or pass it to the mixer...
I believe that the majority of those interested in it have found that everything can be folded if it is applied with sufficient strength and the robustness of the iPhone 6 is fully acceptable, for the use to which it is intended.
I think the army would need something more resistant and has not yet adopted iPhone6 as first-line communication equipment.
But for us others,
There's still a good choice.
the majority of those interested in it have found that everything can be folded if a sufficient force is applied.
Save and Nokia 3310.
More specifically, is he already stuck?
We make this joke in every discussion.
I decided to count them.
This is the fourth blog on the fold I have read in the comments today.
It's hard to understand how a prototype can be distributed like this.
Before you install specific software, you can imagine that the phone has been removed from the main production chain and you can see how it could come back.
So, hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm...................................................
Most likely this is a production unit on which the iOS has not been properly installed and which is therefore associated with the installed factory test code.
I don't know how they do these things.
But would they put test software on everyone?
The photographs on Ebay clearly show the absence of a FCC or EC logo and the presence of a red prototype connector.
ah the article for bobo by excellence.
We want low-cost products and we're surprised that the industrials produce in » industrials' We put forward super you but all the teaching and trade fairs are concerned How good buffer, bio avac 1650€ (average wage in France)?
But to respond to your post, if it is possible to eat properly with a small wage.
After each one is free to put his priorities where he understands it.
For me, food is one.
Go without resentment, I'll kiss you.
They are called bobos, or better boboécols, people who see the world through an ideological software that leads them to disconnect realities.
It's the total thinking-reason breakdown.
They are gesticulating experts, for example, claiming to save the planet because they have avoided taking a shower.
They are also experts in turtles, joining the left-caviar, which they are sometimes released, for example by condemning CO2 emissions while spending their holidays in Maldives.
The vast majority of our citizens do not support this mixture of heavy ideologies and torture, nor are you surprised to encounter often criticisms about them.
Waoh, thank you for this complete and comprehensive theory as well as for all the associated details (air, shower...).
I'd like to be part of it, but I can't find myself.
The concept is not so complicated.
The boboécoles are monobloc.
Did you understand the concept of the left-caviar?
And yet you are able to understand the concept of boboécolo.
It's the perfect copy with just an ideological nuance.
The classification would be more complicated if we were interested in schools all the time.
The boboécolo is part of it but represents only the most visible fragment of the schools because it is the one that infects the media.
Here's a nice giraffe.
Apparently, no one wants to look at this giraffe in front of them.
She's so badly hurt that she looks like a woman's nose.
Chut, you're next to the plate.
It is necessary to be part of the microcosm of art to understand the dazzling beauty of the truth of this work.
But you just don't have any legitimacy to make a comment because you haven't spent countless decades studying and flirting with great artists.
The important thing is not that Emin doesn't know how to draw and seems always obsessed with the same subject.
The important thing is that she has really managed to become fabulously rich and famous by having no artistic ability.
That's the art.
No, it's cochon.
The fact that Emin doesn't know how to draw
That's not really a fact.
This is rather an opinion.
Unless the only thing you could appreciate is real dog reproductions that smoke by playing billiards.
To judge art can be problematic, but not in this case.
Draw, it's much more than simply representing the reality.
If you're not looking for that, a camera will do the thing.
The author also speaks of Emin's expressionism.
Look again and let the image talk about itself, without comparing it to the kind of drawing you might prefer.
If it's so easy, why don't you do it yourself?
There are also savings: riding activities, the number of horses of the Republican Guard or the status of generals who are no longer active....
L(honestness must say that France decreases its workforce, but as all countries have done, sometimes in a more drastic way, to begin with Britain.
It's just half encouraging...
Operational without support, it quickly finds its limits!
A unique approach, at a time when we observe weaknesses, the shortcomings of our defense tool, especially in Sahel.
A bad blow to the local communities concerned, which lose a dimension of their activities, or a part of their history.
Where is the promised sanctification?
@edmond: That's what I was saying, look at where to make savings, but especially not at my house, it's really not possible at my house...
That's exactly what you're proposing to do, look elsewhere where the baggie is.
That all those who have taken little or enough of the military thing dare come here to say, the eyes in the eyes that there is no spent money in this perimeter, and this without letting them laugh...
The same is applied to the entire public service and public finances will be a little better.
And for Josi: really cool: look at the inflation of public jobs in other departments and you will understand why Defense can be a little charged!
Well, the economies that everyone agrees to say they need to be done, it's better to see it somewhere, isn't it?
Lack of pot, those who fall on it are laughing at the murder when it comes to them, the poor dear.
It should be done, but above all, it doesn't fall on me because, in this case, it's a crime and not an economy.
Giugnols, go!
How to close the Grace Valley will weaken our defense tool in Sahel?
With regard to local communities, history repeats each post closure, maternity, hospital, homelessness.
But everyone is for the economies of course.
It is strange that a UMP mayor wants compensation and does not enjoy savings made in public spending.
This article is really the coolest thing I've ever read!
This moment is embarrassing where the first three people who comment make the same bad joke.
It is the depression of defiling his son Facebook and seeing that 80% of his friends began their status by the phrase "This moment embarrassing".
I think they're gonna make a movie.
It will surely be based on hilaring scenes where someone accidentally falls on his ex in the bus by going to work and realizes only that his jacket is back in his cage.
It's not embarrassing, it's completely con.
Not really, according to me, the author adopts the role of the typical British man to whom we have always learned to get his emotions and to close his teeth.
I'm sure if you're a Kate Bush fan, the announcement of his return on stage after 25 years of absence was something strong.
Do you realize that your comment is now at the heart of a battle to know who will have the rights?
I don't have the Internet.
So I don't think I can comment.
They don't have a computer.
Oh, my God, I have to watch this movie before I die!
I can't believe to what extent this article is the most incredible thing I've ever read!
Charlie has just shown that he is at the top of the cosmic universe that is satirical journalism!
I'm falling at the back!
I absolutely need to share with all my friends on Facebook and Twitter so that they finally have the enlightenment and discover the incredible glamour and the insurmountable genius that cheered Mr. Brooker's keyboard as a divine light.
Oh, my God, it was really nothing.
Especially if they're not women or transversals.
I'm a parasite.
This shows a positive trend in democracy: the rise of effective regional policies and associative initiatives.
Until the new order we have the right to save our planet by States that play truffles at each meeting to save the planet.
We therefore, citizens, decide to take matters into our own hands.
With the Commissioner that they planted in energy, all these beautiful recommendations were in motion ....
Translate : Sunflowers and sunflowers are the Round points tomorrow.
All financed by the con- t- t- t.
Please stop this pro-nuclear speech.
Pollution is not limited to CO2.
Radioactivity is much more harmful at the level of its waste and in the event of an accident.
As long as the thread is not fully controlled, it is better to limit itself to laboratories.
Renewable energy is our only health, on condition that our consumption is drastically reduced.
Electricity by the renewable to fight CO2 emissions?
France has nothing to do with it.
Nuclear electricity is zero CO2 emissions to production and epsilon for other stages.
Electricity by the renewable wind or PV is already more GES on the other stages and above all of the gas, or worse of coal as in Germany, to compensate for the intermittent.
The replacement of the nuclear fuel by the renewable wind or PV would go against the fight against CO2.
Christian I'm not insulting you I'm a Doctor of State in Physical Sciences 1981 and more I did nuclear physics research I challenge you to prove otherwise than I said.
What I didn't say is you who lend me ideas I didn't say anything about Germany in fact you didn't answer what I was saying and how all the people on the right to demolish the interlocutor I never do.
I also mention the conclusion of experts commissioned by the German Government: the current programme of Germany on renewable energy is a non-profit and inefficient way to reduce GHG emissions and should be stopped.
0 emissions if you don't count the extraction of uranium and construction and if you don't have the greenhouse gas vapour less effective than the Co2 it really remembers the two thirds of the energy produced by a nuclear power plant part of water vapour and a little in the water of the rivers.
I stopped reading when you spoke of Pakistan as a "judgment of South Asia" ... !!!
Last time, Pakistan won against India.
I am not surprised, most Indians who post comments do not want to read and comment on articles against Pakistan.
In fact, it's a good sign of your mental state.
It would have been the same if they had qualified South Asia giant India...
I have nothing against the fact that some Pakistani players participate, but having a Pakistani version would be unacceptable.
It would simply open a box of Pandore full of corruption and mafios.
With regard to the ISL, today's opening match was amazingly interesting, the Kolkata Athletico imposing 3-0 against Mumbai.
Pakistan still has a lot of ways to go.
Compared to the billions and billions that India devotes to the IPL cricket and now to football, how could we one day compete with our "breathing neighbors"...
The low cost racer pays cash.
Damage for such a beautiful project.
For the incident, the lack of possible design is only shown with a too cold helium.
So maybe we're not in a lack of design, but we're implementing...
contrary to arian space which is a private society, it seems well that soyuz belongs to the Russian state...
And if the rule is the same as here the state is its own insurer..
They may pay the satellites in frigates who know..
This is so much easier that many media record the only titles of articles - and many readers only hold those titles.
In total, this creates a wrong impression contrary to the content of the article itself.
All in agreement with you, the title is not appropriate, it unfairly challenges the project, whereas it is only a launcher problem.
