Fire removed in French chemical work
The Great Fire in a particularly dangerous chemical plant in the northern French city of Rouen has been removed. It shared the prefecture of Normandy on Friday. The fire broke out at night on Thursday. No one was injured in the event. The firefight was in use with about 200 extinguishers.
The contents of the buffer could not be displayed
The plant is part of Lubrizol of US billion Warren Buffett and is subject to the so-called EU Seveso Directive, which sets out particularly strict safety requirements.
In the work, about 400 people are working. In the past, the chemical factory has already made sure that the gas methanthil was developed in 2013 through a leak and the environment was largely in the hands of faulee eggs. In 2015, after a operation, about 2,000 litres of mineral oil flow into the city's water system.
Woman announces her job to look for her missing dog for 57 days
For two months, a woman from Washington was looking for her missing dog - and announced her job extra. The seven-year-old Border Collie was taken away from the hotel room during a short vacation in Montana. 57 days lacked any trace from the dog - but Carole King did not quit.
"It was terrible. I was hurt," said Carole King to the "Daily Inter Lake". She and her husband had left Hündin Katie in the hotel room while they went to dinner. When they then returned to the hotel, Katie was gone. They were looking for the animal, but without success.
Donner had a dog in panic
In the hope that Katie could stay somewhere else in the hotel, Carole King went to the reception. "The employee says: "She's gone about four and a half hours ago," recalls Carole King to "Daily Inter Lake". When the automatic entrance door opened, Katie was immediately released. Probably a loud dog had moved to panic.
With flyers and calls in Facebook groups, the Kings were looking for their favorite dog. But from days to days they were weeks. "I never gave up. I never lost hope," said Carole King to the "Daily Inter Lake", who announced her job as a postman to continue her search for Katie.
"The tears flow"
57 days after Katies disappeared, Carole King received a call: a man reported that Katie was in his court. But when the king arrived there, Katie was already gone again. She looked for the neighborhood and suddenly her dog stood under a tree. "I only had her covered. I didn't want to let her go," King recalled according to "Daily Inter Lake". "The tears flowed. The people kept on in their vehicles, rising up and humming us. I thought the whole neighborhood knew that we had found them."
Losses in the Federal Defence: Machine gun missing traceless
Friday, September 27, 2019
Six MG3 machine guns are still missing.
In recent years, the German defence has lost many weapons and tens of thousands of ammunition. Among them are three machine guns. The remainder is unclear in most cases. The opposition speaks of a "fearing" extent.
In the Federal War, weapons and ammunition are disappearing again and again - many of them have been undetected. Since the beginning of 2014, the troops have covered the loss of 39 weapons, 39 weapons and nearly 20,000 ammunition. This is reflected in a list of the German Federal Defence Ministry, which reports on the editing network.
According to the paper from the Office of Defence Secretary Peter Tauber of the CDU, two weapons, one gun and 3474 gun ammunition have been reappeared. The remaining weapons and weapons are six MG3 types of machine guns, eleven G3 types of weapons, four G36 types of weapons, six signal guns and two P8 type guns. In addition, 30 weapons pipes for MG3 type of machine guns are missing.
The extent of weapons and ammunition losses in the federal defence was "fearsome", said Left-Abandastage Officer Martina Renner. This is all the more true, since in the course of investigations, there was hardly anything new. The Left Politician spoke of a "strong balance". Renner criticised that the list was not recognizable, whether it was under the missing ammunition that was found in connection with the investigations against the Federal Defence Officer Franco A. who was suspected. "And although this was recently condemned by a supporter of Franco A. because of the possession of this ammunition," Renner said.
Ancient tanker "Stena Impero" left Iranian port
More than two months after its establishment by the Iranian authorities, the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" left the port of Bandar Abbas on Friday. As observed by Refinitiv, the tanker moved and left the Iranian port. Port Rashid was named as the target port in the United Arab Emirates.
The tanker had actually been released on Monday from the Iranian government, but first he remained in Iranian waters. From the shipyard it was said that he wanted to wait for an official decision from Tehran.
On 19 July, the "Stena Impero" was launched by the Iranian Revolution Guards in the Hormuz Sea Street under the proposal to have violated security regulations. However, it was suspected that Iran would react to the controversial, temporary establishment of an Iranian oil tanker before the Gibraltar of Great Britain.
The road of Hormuz is one of the world's most important sea routes. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. A large part of global oil exports are being shipped by the seamen. The tensions in the region have intensified in the past months. Trade shipping has been brought into conflict between the US and Iran.
Merkel values the courage of people in the peaceful revolution
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel appreciated the commitment of the people in the DDR who went on the road 30 years ago during the peaceful revolution. In the fall of 1989 courageous citizens had brought the then DDR regime into custody, Merkel said at a feast of the Thuringia CDU group to the upcoming day of the German Unity in Erfurt. The Chancellor recalled, among other things, the occupation of the Stasi Centre. "The state security was taken away by the terror," she said.
Musk seeks delivery record
Teslas Quartal may be keeping record. Despite delivery boom, there was last loss in the electric auto group.
New York.Tesla-Chief Elon Musk has given his Auto Auto Group a strong boost to the stock exchange with the view of new record numbers. "We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries," Musk wrote an e-mail to Tesla employees published by the industry blog "Electrek".
The demand was strong, so that Tesla could book 110,000 orders, it continued in Musks Rundschrifben. The challenge was to bring the cars to the knowledge quickly. Tesla had to offer as many resources as possible for the quarter end.
Founders liked this: Tesla shares went with a plus of six percent out of trade. The course has been so strong for almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered well 95,000 cars and thus reached its previous best value.
Musk needs a record to achieve his high goals. 2019 he wants to deliver a total of 360000 to 400000 cars. This requires six-digit numbers in the current and coming quarter year. Especially the most affordable Tesla Model 3 is asked, but here are the few winnings. Despite the boom, there was last loss.
Solved: That's why we can't kill ourselves.
A kind of brake in the big brain prevents people from killing themselves. This was found by scientists at Humboldt University in Berlin with the help of experiments on rats, as they reported on Thursday evening. Progress was also made on the question why children are so strongly opposed to the killing only to demand more.
Finally, it has also shown why the approach of a kicking hand has already triggered laughs before the touch. This is at a deep layer in the big brain, which already triggers the laugh in the expectation of the kicking.
According to the data, previous research showed that rats with "Laughter" in the ultrasonic area react when they are killed by humans. This "Laughter" is mediated by the part of the large brain that serves the central processing of the haptic perception.
Laughing is suppressed during self-inflicted
Until now, it has been suggested that the brain between self-absorbing and contact through others may be different - so that people can not self-absorb. However, in the experiments at the Rats, Berlin researchers found that the laugh as well as the activity of the relevant area of the Great Brain during a self-absorbing process. This is also true when living beings wash themselves. During the alien-absorbing and the whale by the scientists, however, the activity in the brain and impulses has been reinforced.
But pass through the self-injury and touch through others at the same time, the laugh is also suppressed. This indicates that the brain of the Council could not even be between the self-injury and the touch through other different ones. The new findings made it almost impossible for people to kill themselves because the self-injury activates a brake in the big brain.
The rats were also trained to kill themselves. In this way, they dropped this initiative in the experiment sometimes early, showed flight behaviour or horror star. This ambiance is equal to the behavior of the children. The ambiance of the kitzel is a behavioral reaction that is equal to rats and humans.
Catastrophe removed: Large fire in French chemistry deleted
The Great Fire in a particularly dangerous chemical plant in the northern French city of Rouen was deleted. This was shared by the prefecture of the Normandy of the AFP News Agency on Friday. The fire was broken up at night on Thursday.
According to the authorities, there should be no health-threatening substances. The samples taken give no cause for concern, as Prefect Pierre-André Durand said at a press conference on Friday morning. No one was injured in the event. The firearm was in use with about 200 extinguishers.
Schools and kindergartens were closed
Residents were called up not to leave their homes. Buildings around 500 meters were evacuated, schools and kindergartens were closed on Thursday.
Factory belongs to the company Lubrizol from the US billionaire Warren Buffett
In the chemical plant at the shore of the river, additives are produced for lubricants. The factory is one of the company Lubrizol of the US billionaire Warren Buffett and is subject to the so-called EU Seveso Directive, which prescribes particularly strict safety tasks.
The chemical factory already provided in the past for cutting lines - for example, as in 2013 through a leak the gas methanthil developed and the environment was widely used to smoke on faulen eggs. In 2015, after an operation accident of about 2000 litres of mineral oil flowed into the city's sewage system.
Brexit: Johnson criticised his own sister
The Prime Minister's sister commented on Boris Johnson's speech at Parliament's first meeting after the break-off on Wednesday night. The Prime Minister threatens to lead the country without an EU agreement on 31 October, but Brussels should not rely on its demands for amendments to the Brexit Agreement.
About Cox, who used to spend the rest of Britain in the European Union, the Prime Minister said: "The best way to honor Jo Cox's memory and to reunite this country would be to complete the EU's exit." Cox was murdered in 2016 during the referendum election by a law extremist.
Adhesive times of Oslo and Utöya are revealed
More than eight years after the attacks in Oslo and Utöya with 77 deaths, a monument to honor the victims is revealed on Saturday in Norway. The monument "Jernrosene" (German: the Iron Roses) consists of about 1,000 iron roses. They remember the roses that were laid down by thousands of people in the days and weeks after the attacks before the Dom in Oslo.
At the same place, the project of artists Tobbe Malm and Tone Karlsrud is now to be revealed - the roses were spared by people from all over the world, including survivors and survivors of the victims. They are expected to open up among other Crown Princess Haakon and Crown Princess Mette-Marit.
On July 22, 2011, law terrorist Anders Behring Breivik had first shot a car bomb in Oslo's government district and, following up on the island of Utöya, dozens of participants in a holiday camp of the youth organization of the social-democratic working party. 77 people were killed in the attacks.
Iran Frees British Tankers
The UN General debate did not bring a solution to the Iran conflict, but there is a smaller problem. The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" in Iran was able to reintroduce into the sea. There could be a puzzle in the peace plan of Iranian President Ruhani.
The British oil tank "Stena Impero", which has been on the road to Hormus in Iran since mid-July, is back in international waters. After the release by Iranian authorities, the ship is on its way to Dubai, as reported by the Reederei Stena Bulk.
The "Stena Impero" has left the port of Bandar Abbas and the Crew is now going for medical examinations to Dubai, said Riederichef Erik Hånell. On Wednesday, the ship left the Iranian waters. "It's nice that it's over," he told the Swedish TV SVT.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in London referred to the establishment of the ship as illegal. "This is part of a pattern of attempts to affect the freedom of the sea. We work with our international partners to maintain ship travel and international law," it said in a statement on Friday.
The Iranian Revolutionary Guards had set the tanker under the pretext of failing to comply with the rules of sea law in the Persian Gulf on 19 July. Seven of the 23 crew members had already been released early in September. The remaining 16 crew members were doing well according to the circumstances, Hånell said. They had acted professionally in view of the difficult and challenging situation in the past ten weeks. The crew now works to bring them together with their families as soon as possible.
The British government suspected a reaction to a similar incident in the British Gibraltar: at the beginning of July a super tanker with oil from Iran, which was intended to have been placed on the chain for Syria, was placed on the chain. The delivery was sent to the authorities according to EU sanctions against the country of war in Syria.
Iran spoke of "Piraterie" and threatened with consequences. In mid-August, the "Adrian Darya-1" was finally released. Mutments, it has been an exchange business to get the "Stena Impero" released, was very much back in London.
The road of Hormus is one of the world's most important sea routes. It connects the Persian Gulf with the Indian Ocean. Most of the world's oil exports are shipped by the seamen. The tensions in the region have intensified immensely in the past months. The commercial shipping has been brought into conflict between the US and Iran.
Behind the tensions between Tehran and Washington is the nuclear struggle between the two countries. The Americans have launched the Iranian leadership to want to build nuclear weapons. Iran knows this back. The United States was alone in 2018 from the International Atomic Agreement, which should prevent Iran from building an atom bomb and at the same time end its political and economic isolation. Since then, the US government has put the leadership in Tehran with massive economic sanctions against the country under pressure to force a more stringent and extended agreement on other areas. Iran still resists the pressure.
Due to the struggle about the "Stena Impero" and other incidents with tanks in the Persian Gulf and oil plants in Saudi Arabia, the United States is working on a coalition for military protection of commercial ships in the region.
Iranian President Hassan Ruhani presented a plan for security and peace on the road to Hormus at the UN General Assembly in New York. With the initiative "Coalition of Hope" for the Persian Gulf, Iran wants to ensure the security of the Persian Gulf along with the Arab Gulf States and without foreign defence forces.
India is building a better future with its protectionist economic policy.
In view of the criminal charges imposed by President Donald Trump against Chinese producers, foreign producers in the People's Republic are forced to re-dispose themselves. Financial heads of Asian companies who consider putting their production from China into another country call India in a survey of the UBS as one of the preferred alternatives. This is free not only to do with the inconsistencies of the Chinese-American trade war. With a giant pool of young workers as well as a single market of 1.3 billion consumers, India seems to have created a more important role in the globalised production chain.
But now India itself has become a focus in Trump's. From Haudegen in the Weissen House to the "Kingdom of the Zolles", America has removed the commercial benefits for 2000 products in the beginning of June. The United States oversees India's prohibitive high Zolles and calls for better market access for agricultural goods, mobile phones, spirits, motorcycles and more.
On the world map of trade wars, the tires with India are freely a sideshow. In addition, America considers the world's largest democracy also through the security policy glasses. Delhi and Washington connects concern about China's power claims in the South Ocean. Against this background, a Salve of American fines against India is unlikely. India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has just arrived at a second five-year term, must therefore move safely.
The problem lies elsewhere: The empirically hardened thesis that open markets accelerate economic development has a severe situation in the Socialist Republic of India. Its reformer is also focused on the bureaucratic irritancy that has long been stifled by any entrepreneurship in the country. Companies now receive faster building permits for construction. They benefit from a better energy and transport infrastructure, and a more aggressive insolvency and competition law creates conditions to settle high debt companies.
The success of these efforts can be seen and measured in the relevant rankings. From economic perspective in India has become much better in the first five fashion years. However, in trade policy this is not true. It is not the case. It ordered to protect internationally less competitive companies from foreign suppliers, the national conservative government even created new barriers.
In the West, the mode of the energy reformer's nimbus, which has been radically renewed in his country. This impression is not recently due to the fact that the charismatic prime minister knows only too well what the western Vocabulary managers like. In the core, however, the "India First" lawyer never deviated from a protectionist economic policy, which prevents Indian companies from being forced to escape anachronist courses and thus to become fit for global competition. Businessmen who survive due to the abolition of their industries are among the tribal voters of the mode nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party and stress this short-term policy.
Installation of Jacques Chirac on Monday in Paris
The former French President Jacques Chirac was to present a report in Paris next week. On Monday at the Friedhof Montparnasse in the south of the French capital, the news agency AFP reported on the Chiracs. The order will take place in the close family circle. On Sunday a public mourning party was set up in Paris's invalidity, as media reported.
The competitors are brought to the goal: Dabo is the first secret hero of Light Athletics-WM
The world’s tip was already in the goal of playing hot-heated scenes in the below-cooled Khalifa International Stadium. In the first run of the men over 5000 meters, Jonathan Busby began to move dangerously from Aruba. He could hardly stay on his legs 300 metres before the goal, when Braima Suncar Dabo from the West African country of Guinea-Bissau suddenly stopped him and supported him with the last half of the stadium round. However, after the finish, the forces managed to stop the passing of the race. As the scene would not have been enough.
"I just wanted to help him. Everyone in this situation would have done the same thing," said Dabo after the race in Mixed Zone, when he was completely unexpected the attention of the assembled journalists on him. Fearers he only wanted to talk about his heroship at all. Finally, he wanted to set up his personal best-time and when he noticed that this would be difficult, he only wanted to help a patient. And without that, he would only be proud to represent his country which was invited to the World Federation. Under normal circumstances, he would not have been allowed to start. "I'm proud to run here for my country," he said.
He did this on the evening with repression - and much more intense when he would have thought so. Because this hero's day will remain in memory. When Dabo's rival busby even took the lead in the goal and voluntarily took over the last place - well five minutes after Ethiopier Selemon Barega, who won this race. He enjoyed it at the end of everything, because the busby only came to the goal with a lot of help was therefore downgraded at the end of the world's light athletics association.
Dabo, who lives in Portugal and is studying there in Lisbon, was there to set up a personal best time at the WM in Doha. According to official data, with 18:10,87 minutes, he himself was disappointed: "I wanted to run 17:55 minutes. In 18 minutes I was already once." However, only in training, there are no best times.
Millions of masks: Egypt settles for wild protest days
In Egypt, security measures have been reinforced in advance of possible government critical protests. In the center of Cairo there was an increased police presence on Friday. Several railway stations were closed, roads around the central Tahrir Square were blocked.
Already in the last few days, the police had strengthened their street controls and the mobiles of pedestrians were partially searching for news and photos in connection with the protests. Hundreds of non-governmental organizations were arrested, according to them.
Opponent of Al-Sisi
Last weekend it came to protests with hundreds of participants in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura. They turned against the government of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, the critic of corruption and mismanagement. Such an open protest against political leadership had not occurred in Egypt for years. The Egyptian builder and actor Mohammed Ali, who brought the demonstrations with video messages on Facebook, has called for this Friday to be a "million march" to central places in the country. Ali calls for a "global revolution". The man is also not a "gooder for most young Egyptians, because he as a subcontractor for the armies, but for all his enemies.
The number of arrests related to the protests continued to rise by two observation groups. The Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms (ECRF) included more than 1,570 arrests until Friday. The Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights (ECESS) and the Human Rights Watch (HRW) spoke of more than 2,000 arrests.
Voluntary arrests
Many people were "willfully arrested", "only because they were "false at the wrong place at the wrong time", HRW reported on the arrester's appeals to lawyers. The allegations against the detainees range from "dissemination of false information" to membership in a "terrorist association". In Cairo, Alexandria and other cities, security forces were interrogated and searched in uniform, but also in civilian clothing, as well as in HRW agents, willing passengers.
HRW also criticised the censorship in the North African country. The government is blocking Cairo websites and online services to stop further protests against Sisi.
Online Dealer: Dealers should be able to make return payments easier
For online dealers, many returned packages are lost. Around 20 million returns land on the mill. However, there is an alternative.
The Ministry of Finance has shown online dealers such as Amazon and Zalando a way they can spend returned products instead of destroying them.
Although companies could not be exempt from the tax on turnover on sales, the Ministry stated on a question of the Green Federation, which reported on the news of the radio media group on Friday, but the traders could use the market value of non-commercial returns so low that they would not have to pay any or only a small amount of turnover tax.
Scientists at the University of Bamberg had found that the federal citizens would send back every six packages at orders on the Internet. About four percent of the goods - about 20 million products - then landed in the mill. They would also cost the companies after the current legal situation, because the financial authorities estimate the tax on sales.
Green Group leader Katrin Göring-Eckardt called on Finance Minister Olaf Scholz (SPD) to clarify with a view that companies could not evaluate commercial products in accordance with the criteria and provide free of charge to non-profit organisations. The companies had to be able to rely on this, not to be punished for donations. This applies not only to online trade, but also to other business from the model to the construction market.
Banksy art for auction: There was never a better time to sell this painting
The well-known work of Streetart-Star Banksy, "Devolved Parliament", will soon be expanded.
For industry, Banksy's work underlines "the return of the world's oldest parliamentary democracy to the basic maintenance of animals and tribes". From Saturday, Sotheby's painting will be exhibited in the UK capital until it is increased on 3 October. It will be estimated at 1.5 to two million euros.
The work was first exhibited in the Museum of Bristol in the southwestern United Kingdom, where Banksy lives. This year, the artist had reissued the painting - at the same time as the original Brexit date on March 29th. On this occasion the work, which was called "Frageshour" earlier, was renamed "Devolved Parliament" ("Delegated Parliament").
The image could change the owner for a million.
Last Wednesday, at the first meeting of the Sub-House following the abolition of a suspension by the Supreme Court, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had offered himself a hard deal with the opposition. Johnson wanted to complete the already moved Brexit on 31 October without any agreement with the EU.
It is not the first time that Banksy, whose identity is still unknown, is involved in the Brexit debate. In Dover in the southeast of England, he painted an image that represents a man who deals with a mist with a star of the European flag. The work sees thousands of Lkw passengers and other visitors every day when they enter the United Kingdom.
Brexit debate is like a "walk in the park"
The fierce verbal attacks by British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Brexit-Gegner in Parliament do not contribute to a climate of hatred, according to his top advisor. Compared to the battle ahead of the Brexit referendum 2016, the current controversy is a "walk in the park", said Dominic Cummings on Friday at a book presentation. "We will enjoy it. We will (from the EU) get out and we will win".
In the past few days, Brexit-Gegener in Parliament has been severely attacked and accused, among other things, of the people, of charges that he could put the Members in danger, because they could become a target of murder, he turned down as a "humbug".
Cummings said that the only way to restore peace was if the Members would finally respect the British's decision to withdraw from the EU, and it was not surprising that the people were concerned that Britain was still not coming from the EU three years after the referendum.
In view of the above-mentioned mood, even on Friday the bishops of the Anglican Church called for restraint. "We should speak with respect," said a statement. "And we should also listen."
Pakistan's Prime Minister Khan calls for uno-registrations in Kashmir
With an emotional appeal, Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan again called on the United Nations to intervene in the Kashmir conflict in his first appearance before the UN Assembly.
Otherwise, a renewed war between the nuclear powers of Pakistan and India is likely, Khan said on Friday at the UN General Debate in New York. "If this is going wrong, hope for the best, but be prepared for the worst." The United Nations had a responsibility for Kashmir. "You should have prevented it."
Since its independence from British colonial rule in 1947, India and Pakistan have led three wars, two of which have been divided around the Kashmir region. Both nuclear powers have ruled a part of Kashmir, another part of China. At the beginning of August, India had removed the Indian Kashmir region's autonomy status and thereby significantly increased tensions in relation to Pakistan.
Not even a bottle of water
The demonstrators in Cairo are calling for the coup of the Egyptian President al-Sisi.
Against the current protests in Egypt, the government reacts with hard hands. It can shoot with sharp ammunition against the population, over 2000 prisoners join in prisons to the 60,000 political prisoners who are already sitting there. Protesting in Egypt has never been safe. But since the takeover of General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi in 2013, the state apparatus has done everything to avoid a scenario as at the time of the Arab Spring.
But one of the triggers for the protests in 2011 was the bad economic situation. Poverty, lack of perspective and the feeling of being beaten by their own government driven millions on the road. And that is a problem that also does not get the regime of el-Sisi in the grip, no matter how hard it is against opponents. The situation has even worsened.
Today, every third in Egypt lives below the poverty line. Since 2016, the currency has lost more than half its value, the inflation rate is ten percent. Anyone who wants to buy a bottle of water in the supermarket must decide who he is financed: Nestlé, Coca-Cola or the military. The latter is not only responsible for the oppression but also the largest economic actor. The military builds streets, houses, football stadiums, produces food and much more. This was before the El-Sisi. With authoritarian regimes the Egyptian people has much experience, even the dilemma in the supermarket is an old one. Critically, it will always be if a large part of the population have difficulty to swallow a bottle.
Tuv tests in terminal: BER-Chief: No more "showstopper" for main city airports
Two months have been examined whether the complex system body works in the BER fire protection in conjunction. Operators are satisfied with the course. However, the tube is not finished at BER.
Following major tyv tests in the terminal of the future main city airport, the operators confirmed the planned opening in October next year. This is certain, Supervisory Board Chief Rainer Bretschneider said after a meeting of the Control Board.
Airport chief Engelbert Lütke Daldrup spoke of a successful completion of the test, but also said that there are still shortcomings in the terminal. "We have a lot of detailed themes, but we don't have a real show stopper." He assured that the schedule until the start of the operation contains a buffer.
However, there is evidence that the time reserve should no longer be too large. The construction notice should now be submitted during the first quarter of 2020 at the construction site, this was scheduled for this autumn at the beginning of the year.
Hundreds of gaps in power cables are still to be resolved; the tuv wants to examine them until February. "In order to create the conditions for taking up the flight operation, it is still necessary to work intensively on the processing of deficiencies," said a written statement.
Lütke Daldrup said that in many cases it is about missing evidence, less about new cables. There is also no release for all of the doubles to which the cables hang. The airport manager expects it to be available by the end of the year.
In addition, fire protection at the crossing to the railway station under the terminal is not yet satisfactory. The problems had led the project to another crisis three years ago. This time it is about smoke cuts that go down in a fire like a canvas so that the smoke does not spread. They go too far down. 36 engines therefore have to be replaced. Then there will be new attempts with hot gas at the beginning of the year.
Problems with fire protection and other trees as well as planning errors have delayed the opening of the airport for years. Originally, it was due to go into operation in 2011. Costs have increased from two billion since the beginning of 2006 to around 6.5 billion euros expected to be opened next year.
Since the number of passengers in Berlin has increased significantly since then, the managers plan to expand the airport. That is why it will take place at a special meeting of the Supervisory Board on 18 October, as announced by President Bretschneider.
The airport company is now looking for two new managers. Financier Heike Fölster changes the end of the year to Deutsche Bahn, Chief of Staff Manfred Bobke-Von Camen goes to Rente next year, as Bretschneider said. He thanked Fölster. She put the airport finances on steady feet.
Chemnitz: Automated for Drugs - Police take men fast
He needed money for drugs - and hunted several machines in the Chemnitz city area into the air! Now the killer is finally in jail!
Over the past two years, the number of compressed cigarette and parking cars in Chemnitz and the region has increased greatly. There has been a million damage!
After two detonations at the end of May, the police arrested a 33-year-old German in Chemnitz on the civil road and the Further Street.
Police spokesman Andrzej Rydzik: "In the course of the investigations, due to the conduct of explosives explosions in the Tatheane unit with a particularly severe case of theft carried out by the Chemnitzer Criminal Police, not only confirmed this suspicion against the 33-year-olds".
Faced with the new evidence, the 33-year-old Chemnitzer was now a total of eight works.
The police spokesman said, "With the bet, he obviously financed his depressive addiction." Only four times the bomber had pushed car park cars on the citizens' street between 20 August 2018 and 31 May 2019.
The total damage occurred is at least EUR 60,000!
The automatic bomb is now under investigation. Police investigations against it continue.
He was also considered responsible for further automatic voltages in Chemnitz and adjacent districts.
AUA takes Eurowings flights from Vienna
The Lufthansa Group is reviving its strategy for Vienna Airport. In the middle of the price struggle with cheap flights such as Lauda, Wizz Air, EasyJet and Level, the Lufthansa daughter of AUA "the commercial control of all Eurowings flights from Vienna", confirmed on Friday a press speaker from the Austrian Airlines against the APA. Previously, "AviationNetOnline" reported on this.
The Vienna base of the Lufthansa ticket Eurowings is de facto dissolved. Four of the current seven Eurowings aircraft remain in Vienna. It takes over the AUA from January 2020 in the "Wetlea", including Eurowings staff. In Salzburg three Eurowings jets will be stationed to fly from Salzburg and Innsbruck as chartering machines for holiday destinations. Routes from Vienna to Germany will be taken over by Eurowings Germany.
The Eurowings base in Vienna will be integrated into the AUA circuit and network planning, the speaker explained. The flight times are intended to be matched to connecting flights. The aim is to strengthen the Vienna circuit and, on the other hand, to expand the decentralized transport from the federal countries.
As AviationNetOnline writes, Eurowings in Vienna only serves as "Production Company" for the AUA Group Sisters. This would include Barcelona and Rome with AUA flight number, but mainly with Eurowings devices. The board product is to be adapted to those of Austrian Airlines, but the pilots and airlines are from Eurowings. Eurowings flights starting under AUA flight number are no longer reported in Terminal 1, but as the AUA in Terminal 3.
At the airport of Vienna, a price struggle broke out after Niki Square. The Ryanair daughter Laudamotion announced only on Thursday that the fleet in Vienna would be on 16 planes next summer. The Irish airline sends four Ryanair machines as well as Crews to Vienna, also in the so-called "Wetlea", which the trade union criticised as an environmental structure for the collective agreement.
The campaign by Ryanair-Chief Michael O'Leary that Lauda will have taken over the AUA in five years, discovered on Friday AUA presentation Andreas Otto: "We remain the number one in the place, in five, six or ten years".
Queen-One Princess Beatrice is engaged
Beatrice, Eugenie, William and Harry: As children, the cousins were the best friends. Now the last of the four is married. Beatrice is married!
Wonderful news from the British Royals: At the beginning of the month, Edwardo Mapelli Mozzi (34) held the hand of his friend Princess Beatrice (31). This was announced by the Palace on Thursday.
"We are extremely pleased to be able to announce our commitment. We are both so happy to start this adventure together and can hardly expect to be married," the couple, according to British media reports since October 2018, shared in the official communication.
And further: "We share so many similar interests and values and we know that in the coming years, love and happiness will help us very much."
Sister Eugenie cut the pictures
The official commitment photos have been published by her sister, Princess Eugenie (29), and also on her Instagram account.
A royal feast
The wedding will take place in 2020. Further information on date, place and everything else will be announced in the coming months.
However, it is certain that the announcement of the number nine of the British thrones and the real estate mogul will be a similar great festival as the mourning of Eugenie on 12 October 2018 with Jack Brooksbank (33).
Study on the causes of heart disease
Smoking, overweight, unhealthy nutrition - there are risk factors for cardiovascular disorders. But what really solves a heart failure or an infection? Hamburg researchers now want to see the heritage of 9,000 healthy and sick people.
Through the analysis of the heritage of 9000 people, Hamburger and Swiss scientists want to find out more about the causes of heart disease.
The research project was the largest of this kind in the German-speaking area, the University Clinic Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) shared on Friday. The Kühne Foundation supports the project with 12.5 million euros. From Switzerland are the Davos University Clinic, which belongs to the Foundation, and participates in the University Hospital Zurich.
Overweight, smoking and unhealthy nutrition are among the essential risk factors for heart crisis disorders. Genetic factors determine the risk. The interaction between genes and external influences is only known, it was said. Now the scientists want to compare the complete harvest of 8000 healthy people with the 1000-old patients of the University of Heart and Gas Centre at the UKE.
Currently, in more than 4000 of the approximately 20,000 relevant human genes, possible disease-induced changes in the DNA - called mutations - were known, it was called from the clinic.
The aim of the five-year project is to develop new options for the prevention, detection and treatment of heart disease, heart failure and heart disease. The data could also be useful in researching other folk diseases, so Stefan Blankenberg, head of the University of Heart and Fat Center. New findings for the interaction between heart and brain, heart and kidney as well as cancer are possible.
The chairman of the Kühne Foundation, Klaus-Michael Kühne (82), also stressed that there is a strong will to use the data to investigate other diseases. The Foundation’s clinic in Davos deals mainly with allergies. Now a center for Cardiovascular Precision Medicine should be created and a professor of bioinformatics created. For the sake of his commitment, the logistics contractor in Switzerland said that he was operated in the open heart three years ago in Hamburg and was very grateful.
The bio samples of healthy participants are derived from Hamburgers, who also participate in the "Hamburg City Health Study". With 45,000 samples, according to the clinic, this is the world's largest local health study. In terms of heredity, strict attention is paid to the protection of anonymous data, the scientists assured. There is a petabyte (1000 terabyte) of data, Holger Moch from the University Hospital Zurich said.
The heritage of a person can be ruled out within 24 hours, according to UKE. The pure costs of the survey are at EUR 1300. The first gene sequence, which was published worldwide in 2001, has still cost hundreds of millions of euros. The study will start on 1 October, at the end of 2020, all 9000 samples will be analysed. This year the first results will be expected.
Nigerian Police Frees Hundreds of Untreated Boys
In Nigeria, the police released more than 300 tortured and abused boys from a Korean school. According to residents, security forces searched the school in the Nordic city of Kaduna and discovered the victims, as police spoke of Yakubu Sabo. "The victims were abused. Some of them admitted to being raped by their teachers," said Sabo.
The boys were held under the pretext of being taught in the Koran and "accompanied". In fact, the shields of their teachers were held under "the most reprehensible and inhuman conditions", said Sabo. About a hundred students, including children of the age of nine, were placed in a small room.
The Koran School has been according to the data for about ten years. Residents would have paid attention to repeated irregularities in the institution. The parents would have been shocked when they were informed about the conditions in the Koran school, said Sabo. They had nothing to do with the suffering of their children. Operators and six employees were arrested according to the police.
In the predominantly Muslim northern Nigeria, there are many private Koran schools. They often replace the missing state institutions. People in the region suffer from frequent attacks of armed gangs. According to the UN refugee aid work, over the past ten months, more than 40,000 people have fled across the border in the neighboring state of Niger.
Embedded and tortured: Nigerian Police Free 400 Children from School
In a school in northern Nigeria, policemen released almost 400 students from sexual relations. "Many of them were harassed and some had visible injuries that resulted in torture," police spokesman Yakubu Sabo said in the city of Kaduna.
The children were discovered there on Thursday after a notice in an Islamic-based school. The conditions there were "human" and the officers took the school leader and six teachers after the liberation action.
The children, all boys, were held at their school like slaves and placed on chains. Some were sexually abused. TV images showed disabled and injured students in a clearly poor health condition.
World football selection: Further projections by Messis and Klopps Kür
Signature is valid
Jürgen Klopp, Lionel Mesi and Megan Rapinoe outstanding
With a gala in Milan, the World Football Association Fifa marks the best player, the best players and the best coach of the year. For Lionel Mesi it is the sixth honour and thus record.
After Nicaragua’s captain declared that he had never voted for the World Football Election, in other countries proposals to the Fifa come from. Egypt was not even valued - with a curious reason.
In the past few years, Fifa has proved to be a proponent: the WM grants, the dubious plans of its President Gianni Infantino, the general behaviour of various corrupt officials. The Fifa World footballer election has so far not been in doubt - if one turns away from the fact that the qualified national trainers and national team members of the Member States often vote for sympathy rather than for objective consideration.
But after Nicaragua’s captain had already complained that he had not voted in favour of it, there are now other unresolved concerns: Egypt complains that the votes of national coach Hosam El-Badry and Captain Mohamed Salah have not been taken into account. In fact, they do not appear in the official and publicly unanimous vote review.
The Fifa apologizes for the fact that "the signatures on the ballot forms have been given in capital letters and therefore have not been valid". The Egyptian association has been contacted several times to clarify the situation - without an answer.
Sudan Trainer also surprised
There is also a cry about the choice of the Sudan. While the case in the case of Egypt is clear, the Sudanese association points out that Trainer Zdravko Lugarisic did not agree as it was finally evaluated: with Lionel Mesi on place one, Virgil van Dijk on two and Sadio Mané on three. According to Fifa, however, the vote has just been taken, with signatures and official stamp of the Sudanese association.
Nicaraguas Capitán Juan Barrera also wrote: "Have not voted for the #TheBest2019 Awards. All the details of my vote are wrong, thank you," he wrote. In his case it was assumed that the Nicaraguan Football Association had just voted in his name.
The announcement came on Friday, but of course it was not intentional. The completed election papers were "exclusively" with the name and signature of Juan Barrera, the captain of the Nicaraguan election, it was in a communication of the association. However, he chose the second captain Manuel Rosas. "We take responsibility for the administrative errors", said the statement. Rosas and also team coach Henry Durte, however, had voted for the messi, "just as it is in the official list of FIFA."
The other cases are now being examined by Fifa in an investigation, but he stresses that the election process was supervised by the consulting firm PriceWaterhouseCoopers. Lionel Messi remains the only uncontested winner of the World Football Election - and Jürgen Klop World Coach of the Year.
Ukraine-Affairs: High-ranking Republicans speak for official investigation
Two high-ranking Republicans spoke openly for an official investigation against US presidents and party friend Donald Trump. "I think the investigation is important," said the Republican Governor of Vermont, Phil Scott. "Wherever this comes from, it will be determined by the facts that will be identified." He wants to know more about the Whistleblower business before measures are taken. An impeachment procedure can lead to the suspension of the President.
Scott said he was not surprised by the discoveries. They had shown that Trump had repeatedly called on Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selensky in a phone call to investigate the activities of the democratic presidential candidate and former Vice-President Joe Biden in Ukraine. Scott observed Trump Biden "for years".
The Republicans have so far refrained from criticizing Trump because of the Whistleblower affair, only a few have been unwelcome for it. Scott's statements are now the first sign of this in Trump's party. Virginia's moderate governor had already turned against Trump's policy, for example against the lockdown of environmental protection regulations and the strengthening of immigration rules.
As another radiator, Charlie Baker, governor of Massachusetts, also spoke for the investigation. "It is a deeply disturbing situation," Baker said. "The right course and responsibility for the Congress is now to investigate the matter and to go on the ground."
Scott and Baker, as Governor of the United States, have not formally spoken in the procedure against Trump, which is decided on in the Congress. Their statements are therefore symbolically important. However, also the first senators of the Republicans have been critical of the situation. In Romney, for example, who represents the state of Utah in the second chamber, said that the case is "extremely disturbing, deeply disturbing". US media also reports that the first rise occurred among the Republican domestics.
The deal could lead to a trial in the opening of an official procedure against Trump, which the Democrats in the House of Representatives have announced, and they have proposed to him the abuse of power for the purpose of foreign influence for their own political benefits.
There is no precise timetable for the recruitment process. With its majority in the House of Representatives, the Democrats could strive for a so-called impeachment. However, the decision on a real post collection fell in the Senate, where Trump Republicans have the majority. The prospects for such a process are therefore low. So far, no US president has been removed by an impeachment procedure of the Office.
Were torturers on board Rockets "Sea Watch"?
Three men were arrested in Sicily, they were to have raped and murdered in Libyan refugee camps.
The German captain Carola Rocket (31) was arrested in June after she had been on board with the rescue ship "Sea Watch 3" and 53 Libyan refugees illegally controlled the port of Lampedusa. After fierce protests and international criticism - also by Austrian Federal President Alexander van der Bellen - her house arrest was lifted after a few days from an Italian judge.
Now, new heavy proposals are being made against rockets. In this way, three men who were tortured in Libyan refugee camps could have arrived with the "Sea Watch 3" in Italy. Suspects were recorded in a recording warehouse in Messina (Cisilia) after migrants had recognized their painters in Italy. "We can't exclude this, but we have not even secured information," said the "Sea Watch" speaker Ruben Neubauer of the German Press Agency.
From the police it was said in mid-September that the suspects in the North African country had raped, raped and even killed. It was Mohammed C. (27) from Guinea, and the two Egyptian Hameda A. (26) and Mahmoud A (24). "The migrants were systematically harassed and brutalized - by repeated and persistent physical violence," said the announcement.
NGOs and aid organisations now point out that they cannot know exactly who is coming to the ships. "We cannot scan who are the people. They come without passports," said New Buildinger. Torture is one of the main reasons why people from Libya flee. Therefore, it is highly likely that there are also offenders on the ships. "It is therefore very important that this will happen".
The Italian Minister of the Interior, Mr Salvini, once again called for an apology for rockets, which are still being found in Italy because of aid for illegal immigration.
Musk seeks delivery record at Tesla
Tesla-Chief Elon Musk has given his electric auto group a strong boost to the stock exchange with a view to new record numbers.
"We have the chance to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliveries," Musk wrote in an e-mail to Tesla employees published by the industry blog "Electrek".
The demand was strong, so that Tesla could book 110,000 orders, it continued in Musks Rundschrifben. The challenge was to bring the cars to the knowledge quickly. Tesla had to offer as many resources as possible for the quarter end.
Founders liked this: Tesla shares went with a plus of six percent out of trade. So strong the course has not been added for almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered well 95,000 cars and thus reached its previous best value.
Musk needs a record to achieve his high goals. 2019 he wants to deliver a total of 360,000 to 400,000 cars. This requires six-digit numbers in the current and coming quarter year. Especially the most affordable Tesla Model 3 is asked, but here are the few winnings. Despite the boom, there was last loss.
US budget dispute: Renews only a bridge financing
The new financial year will begin in the United States on 1 October without a proper budget. The Senate followed the House of Representatives on Thursday and decided on a transitional financing until 21 November.
Although the US Congress and President Donald Trump agreed in August to increase the spending ceiling for the financial years 2020 and 2021, the United States will once again face the new fiscal year beginning on 1 October without any plans. The Senate followed the House on Thursday and decided on a transitional financing (Continuing Resolution, CR) until 21 November. Without such a decision it would have come at a shutdown on Monday, a partial closure of the federal administration. President Trump has yet to come into force.
Shutdown cancelled
The federal administration is now temporarily funded at the level and according to the priorities of the expenditure plans for the year ending on Monday 2019. This is because the Congress does not have the time to implement the 12 expenditure laws, some that assign the funds to the various departments and authorities. Therefore, the federal administration cannot benefit from the new budget year from 1.3 bio. to 1.4 bio. expanded expenditure frameworks.
The Democrats have completed ten of the twelve laws in the House of Representatives, but the laws reflect the priorities of the Democrats, who have little chance in the Senate dominated by the Republicans. The Senate has also turned around ten of the twelve plans of expenditure, which are less or less capable of being able to do so.
The spirits differ mainly on the subject of resource allocation for the field of domestic security and border security. In the Senate, the Republicans obviously try to force $12 billion for the construction of the wall to be one of the great priorities of President Trump. The Democrats interfere with the building plans and their funding provided for other military buildings and projects. The fight on the construction of the wall has already been escalated in December 2018 and had led to a 35-day shutdown.
The Spirits Separate in Wall Construction
It is now unclear how the parties want to get closer to this issue. Probably more than an agreement on all twelve expenditure laws in the next seven weeks is an extension of transitional funding beyond November 21. Also, a shutdown is not excluded.
Against the background of the continuing inability of the Congress to agree in due course on the twelve expenditure laws, and thus the imminent danger of a Shutdown will win ideas for the automation of the process of popularity. template S. 1877 for the prevention of Shutdowns would automatically continue the financing of the federal administration at the level of the previous year, suspend the travel of parliamentarians and withhold their wages until the new annual expenditure plans are submitted.
France allows artificial breeding for lees and singles
In France, the artificial breeding of women and lesbians is expected to be open in the future: the Paris National Assembly agreed with a large majority for a government legislative proposal, after which all women can apply for in vitro breeding, so that the demand for anonymous co-sponsors should rise significantly.
In the three-day emotional debate, critics in the right camp had warned that many "children without fathers" could grow up in the future. Also, the French Bishop's conference is against innovation.
The new regime is the core component of a bioethics law, which the Minister of Health Agnès Buzyn defended as a " Chance" for society. It is the modern family, in which there are children with only one parent or with homosexual parents. According to her idea, the costs of artificial breeding for all women are to be borne by social insurance.
Prohibited breeding with sperm of dead husband
With a limited majority, the National Assembly withdrew an amendment to give widows access to the sperm of their dead man. In Belgium, Spain and the United Kingdom, the artificial fertilization "post-mortem" is allowed. In Germany, there were cases in the past, in which women allegedly complained about the issue of the sperm of a deceased person.
On the other hand, many members of the government party La República en Marche (The Republic in motion, LREM) of President Emmanuel Macron and members of the opposition had spoken of the artificial fertilization with the sperm of the deceased partner. They stressed that a widow would receive a "double mourning" if her husband's wish to remain unsatisfied by the death of her husband was not satisfied.
The initiators of the proposed amendment consider it unfair that a widow can be planted in the future with the sperm of an unknown person, but not with that of her own partner.
So far, artificial breeding in France is allowed only heterosexual couples who can't bear witness. They must be married or live together for at least two years. Buzyn had already announced in the summer that the leased motherhood would continue to be banned.
In Germany, artificial breeding is theoretically open to all women - for single or lesbian couples, however, it is often difficult.
Compensation for the climate: calls for tickets to Unis become louder
There is a lot going on at high schools, so the country is going to have a climate change. The Rectors say they don't have any money for it. But now they're also under pressure.
The schools should also be restricted when flying. Photo: dpa/Julian Street School
The debate on climate change on flights from universities and universities that took place before the summer break again is arduous. After the country director conference had responded skeptically to a corresponding advance from the Green-Black Coalition, the plans now receive support from the universities. In a joint statement, the doctoral students of six Baden-Württemberg universities and a pedagogical university are complaining about compensation for services. This is the first step "requiredly necessary", while at the same time there was a broad debate on the avoidability of flights, meaning in their opinion.
Russia re-established North Korean fishermen
According to the FSB secret service, the prisoners were to fish illegally in Russian waters. Ten days earlier 161 fishermen were arrested from North Korea. At that time there was a switch between the border guards and the boat crew. Three Russians and a North Korean were injured, the fisherman later suffered his serious injuries. But this time there were no injuries, it was said.
The communist North Korea suffers from chronic lack of food. The North Korean fishermen were therefore on their way in Russian high-level waters. The Russian Coast Guard will carry their own data to protect their multi-biological resources patrols.
30,000 ink fish seized
During the re-checks, 30,000 inkfish were discovered and seized on the boats. In addition, three fishing and two motorboats were seized and brought to Nachodka and Posjet at Vladivostok.
The Russian Fisheries Authority did not issue a licence to the North Koreans following the claims of domestic entrepreneurs this year. Thousands of North Korean fishermen have already been arrested in this year, according to the media.
The head of the association of Russian fishing companies in the remote Primorje region, Georgi Martynow, recently also complained about high environmental damage by the North Korean fishermen. They fished dense synthetic nets prohibited in Russia. These would also bring small creatures out of the sea. In addition, the nets would simply disappear in the sea where they needed 200 years to be cut off.
In the future only 18,000: USA lowers the ceiling of asylum
The "greatest nation in history": Donald Trump, here at a meeting with elected police representatives in the White House.
The richest country of the earth is shielding itself from protection seekers: As confirmed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Washington, the upper limit for the legal movement of refugees will be further reduced.
The US government wants to reduce the historically low threshold for the admission of new refugees again. In the 2020 financial year, which runs in the United States from October 2019 to September 2020, there will be a maximum of 18,000 people in the country, as the US Foreign Ministry has said. In the almost late financial year, the limit is still up to 30,000 people.
The government of President Donald Trump has drastically reduced the reception readiness for protection seekers from all over the world over the past years.
The stated ceiling of 18,000 refugees would be the lowest since the U.S. Refugee Programme was introduced in 1980. However, the U.S. Foreign Ministry referred to the US as "the most compassionate and generous nation in history", a formulation that strongly recalls the use of the official U.S. president's language.
A "responsibility-conscious approach" with refugees is that refugees can return to their home countries to help rebuild there, Trump explained. For his hard course in migration policy, he has a lot of demands from supporters, but there are also massive criticisms.
A major point of dispute is the border to Mexico, which wants to narrow down the Trump. In order to finance the construction of a border wall, Trump had suspended the national emergency. Whether there is a temporary link between the current measure and the current internal policy developments in the U.S. capital is unclear. Trump is currently under pressure because of the Selensky affair and a possible threat of official recruitment.
The U.S. government intends to focus on the inclusion of two refugee groups in the future after the appearance of the foreign office: people who are persecuted for their faith - and Iraqis who have helped the US military in the country and thus have been at risk as from the statement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. However, the Honduran, Guatemala and El Salvador should include up to 1500 refugees.
The United States wants to achieve that, in particular, people from this "north triangle" of Central Americas in other countries apply for asylum. For this reason, the United States has only concluded with Guatemala and now also with El Salvador and Honduras migration agreements in order to prevent migration at the US southern border to Mexico.
Court of Justice ordered the release of orange-utan from zoo
An orange Utan Weiben was placed at a detention station in the United States at the request of the Argentine justice of the former Buenos Aires zoo. The "sandra" born in 1986 in Rostocker Zoo was granted the rights of a "non-human person" and therefore its release was mandatory. The animal was brought on Thursday by direct flight to Dallas, however not as a passenger, but in the cargo room, as lawyer Andrés Gil Domínguez explained.
Since the 53 kilograms of heavy human hunger are not able to adapt to life in the wild, they will live in the future at the centre for Great Apes in Florida. There are already 21 other oranges and 31 chimpanzees, among them "Bubbles", former pets of Popstar Michael Jackson. However, before entering Florida, Sandra has to undergo another 40-day quarantine in Sedgwick County Zoo in Wichita in the US state of Kansas.
"Sandra" spent several years after its birth in Rostock in the former Ruhr-Zoo in Gelsenkirchen before it was transferred to Buenos Aires in 1995. The 2014 process of animal protection has contributed to the transformation of the zoo of Buenos Aires into an ecopark. By 2023, a research and education centre was to be established for the preservation of species diversity.
Record for Swiss Extremberger: 550 meters in 46 minutes
The extreme climb Dani Arnold has succeeded in a new house ride in the Italian Alps at the nearly 3,000 metres high.
Without net, double floor or other auxiliary means, the Swiss forced the 550 meters high north wall of the Great Zene in a new record time.
Dressed with Jeans, T-Shirt and only supported by absolute freedom of movement Arnold needed 46 minutes and 30 seconds for the climb. Thus he offered the old best brand for almost 19 minutes.
Arnold is now a record holder in the Free Solo Speed at four of the six most important North European walls.
Nike benefits from a new online marketing strategy
In spite of the trade conflict with China, the US sports producer Nike has booked a significant profit plus. Net profit rose to $1.4 billion in the last quarter (about 1.3 billion euros). This is 25 percent more than in the previous year, as announced by the Group on Tuesday. The reason for this is the new marketing strategy "Nike Direct", with which the Adidas competitor directly turns to its customers.
The sales increased by 10.7 billion dollars in the three-month period to the end of August. The most powerfully the Nike sales figures increased by a plus 22 percent in China. Thus, the Beaverton group in the United States of Oregon also benefited from its approach to address consumers directly through the Internet or smartphone apps.
Financial chief Andy Campion announced that with strategic investments, Nike will continue to pursue the "digital transformation" of the sports article manufacturer and thus expand its competitive advantage. The investors were pleased to respond to the quarterly figures - the shares of the sports article manufacturer increased by more than five percent.
Lifelong Stadium Ban on Racism in Italy
Because of racist comments about football profi Juan Jesus of AS Rome, the association from the capital of Italy has banned a long-lived stadium ban against a fan. The defender Jesus from Brazil was ridiculed by the fan on Instagram. Jesus then published the private news and asked his club to take action. "@officialasrom You already know what to do with such a fan. #NoToracism. Be proud to be who I am," wrote the 28-year-old who has been playing at AS Rome since 2016.
The association reacted on the late Thursday. He reported the fan's account at Instagram and the police. Furthermore, the Roma supporters can never visit a game of the association again, the club wrote on Twitter.
Rassism is a problem in Italian football. Regularly scanning Italian fans racist attacks against black players rivaling teams. "We cannot have any racism in society or in sports. In Italy the situation has not improved, and this is very serious. We need to identify and throw out of the stadiums," Fifa President Gianni Infantino said on the weekend. The occasion of the statement were racist songs at the first party between Atalanta Bergamo and AC Florence on Sunday.
But also about the supporters of Juventus Turin there had been discussions last time. The Italian authorities now have 38 random fans of record-master Juventus Turin with stadium bans. Four of them were not allowed to enter the stadium for a period of ten years, the police informed them. The rest were therefore prohibited from four to seven years.
Fans are linked to ongoing investigations against twelve leaders of Ultra Fan groups in the area of Juventus. The twelve are proposed, among other things, heavy repression, money laundering and private violence. The club had brought the investigations into play with an ad last year.
The Ultra Leaders were to post Italian media reports behind the black trade with tickets. They would have "militaryly controlled" the ticket trade for the fan curve and should have urged youth employees to come to more affordable cards.
Generation Z: Are they really different from Generation Y?
Millenials are narcissistic, the generation Z is political - all the years are considered with cruel terms. If you look more closely, the awards are full of contradictions. How well do these labels describe the respective sense of life of young people?
"The Krabs come!" with this call officially began on September 21st at the Gucheng-see in Gaochun, which also presented the opening event of the 19th China Gaochun Gucheng Lake Crab Festival, as announced by the Nanjing-Gaochun District Committee's Department for Public Works.
Gaochun, which forms the southern exit of Nanjing in the province of Jiangsu, is one of the national environmental zones. The city is the first international "Slow City" in China and here is also the Chinese seat of the international "Slow City" movement. The city has in ecological terms ideal conditions with a mix of "30 percent mountains, 20 percent water areas and 50 percent fields". The great natural environment of Gaochun offers its inhabitants all the conditions to be rich.
The people in Gaochun have already begun with cancer in the early 1990s. In the course of the time, the cancer industry has developed into an attractive industry that has provided high income and has become an important part of the economic development of Gaochun. In recent years, Gaochun has been actively involved in the large, ecological and scientific development of cancerous cancer as well as in a technically supported cancer. And the city has taken care of the promotion of more efficiency in agriculture and the income of farmers.
In recent years, Gaochun has developed a reform to "distribution of power, optimization of administration and authority services" and with care the service network for "entitlements under a roof, a team for prosecution, a network for services, a platform for credit granting". Thus, the city aims to optimise the environment for approvals, services and development.
Gaochun is creating the benefits on-the-spot by linking to the southern Jiangsu and the southern Anhui and using the development zone and its position as an international "Slow City" as an external source for intelligent high-end tourism, biomedical and health technology companies, energy storage and environmental protection, from the cultural and cultural resources of the region of Gaochun, which are leaders in the "3+2" area. At the same time, Gaochun has promoted the construction of a national, all-area tourism area and of foreign transport sites of national importance. The ecological and cultural resources of the region of Gaochun, which are integrated into the region of Gaochun, the state of the region of Gaiskim, and around the area of tourism, and around the area of tourism.
Conflict between Iran and the United States: Ruhani speaks of end of sanctions - Trump contradicts
Iranian President Hassan Ruhani, after returning from the UN General Assembly, spoke of a alleged offer by the United States of America to abolish sanctions. The United States had put an end to all sanctions in opposition to talks with Tehran's leadership, Ruhani explained on his official website.
But US President Donald Trump opposed the Iranian official on Twitter: "I wanted Iran to lift the sanctions imposed on him so that there would be a meeting. I said, of course, no."
Ruhani describes the event as follows: Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron were present in New York and had insisted that a meeting take place. "And America says I am lifting the sanctions," Ruhani added. The kind of criminal measures that should be completed have stood for the debate. "And they have clearly said that we are lifting all sanctions."
However, this was not done in an acceptable way, Ruhani criticised. In view of the current criminal measures and "the poisoned atmosphere of maximum pressure", no one could predict the outcome of negotiations.
At the beginning of the week, Chancellor Angela Merkel met with Ruhani in New York. The hope of the Europeans to save the nuclear deal negotiated with Russia and China was that the Islamic Republic should refrain from developing nuclear weapons. France's President Emmanuel Macron, like Merkel, had expressed the hope that Ruhani will meet with US President Donald Trump at the UN summit.
Severe Earthquakes near Istanbul - Nearly 200 Submersibles
After the western Turkey was shaken within the shortest time of two earthquakes, the fear of a disaster is growing. 34 people were injured at the earthquake on Tuesday. Since the bite of the day before, there have been almost 200 survivors, Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay said on Friday. Thus the worry of a disaster is growing.
14 schools in Istanbul were closed for security reasons. Hundreds of buildings were damaged. On Thursday, 5,8 the Marmara region had exploded before Istanbul and panic broke out in the millions of metropolis. Now the government wants to set up a Commission to prepare the country better for earthquakes in the future, Oktay announced.
In the past 20 years, Turkey has not been prepared enough for bees, Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu said. In the city itself the latent danger is always ignored. Every year poorly built houses are torn into pieces - among other things made by the many smaller earthquakes that regularly blow up Istanbul.
City planners like the well-known architect Mücella Yapici have been warning for years that large open areas registered in the centre as refuge sites have long been built. Only on the 20th anniversary of the Golcük baby in August, Istanbul's chamber of engineering had warned that a million buildings in Istanbul were not earthquake-proof.
The epicenter of the baby from Thursday was located in the Marmarameer in front of the district of Silivri and in about seven kilometers deep, as the disaster protection authority Afad reported. A smaller successor provided a few minutes later for even greater panic on the streets.
The Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu was not reported on Twitter, injured or damaged. The state-owned TRT showed people who suffered panic from the houses. Students were brought to the Silivri district for security reasons from the buildings. Some students wept as they saw pictures.
Istanbul is considered to be particularly vulnerable to earthquakes. Among the Marmarameer is a section of the so-called North-Ataltic disturbance that marks the border between the Eurasian and the Anatolic Plate. Turkey is constantly being threatened by earthquakes. One of the most deadly was the bee in 1999 near Istanbul. At that time, more than 17,000 people were killed.
Researchers fear that an earthquake could threaten the strength of 7.1 to 7.4. But when it comes to the earthquake, it is unclear. On Thursday, it hit the west of the country and Istanbul again.
Firms design emergency plans, private people have so-called go-bags packed with everything they need to be ready next to the door, and schools bring children to their senses as they are to be occupied when the earth wakes up. When the next big bees come, be unclear.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said that after his return from New York, eight people were injured. Some buildings had suffered slight damage. Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu persecuted developments from Istanbul Disaster Coordination Centre (Akom). After that, two minerals from Moscow were destroyed in the Avcilar and Sariyer districts.
Preparing for survival in Istanbul
In the social networks, many users of panic are reported. Buildings were walled. Schools and hospitals were evacuated. Phone lines were interrupted. It was more severe than Tuesday, a user writes. The head of the Turkish Red Halfmond, Kerem Clinic, warned by Twitter about the consequences. He called on people to stay away from buildings that had suffered visible damage.
The date of the bee is given according to official data at 13.59 hours (location time). Only a few minutes after the first bee, according to CNN Turkey, there was a bee with a force of 4.0 on the right scale.
Only on Tuesday had an earthquake of the strength 4.6 has affected the Turkish Marmara region - it was to be felt until Istanbul. Also its epicenter has been located in the Marmara Sea west of the million metropolis, the disaster protection authority Abad already shared on Tuesday.
It was not the only earthquake that provided for the strike on that Tuesday: Pakistan was also hit by a severe earthquake.
Researchers assume that sooner or later it could come to a catastrophic earthquake in Istanbul - the tension between the tectonic plates is extremely high. Scientists believe that it will ever get rid of it - and cause massive damage.
Earthbebebesearcher Sükrü Ersoy estimates that the Earthbebebebe is now a warning. It was thus more likely, he said to CNN Turkey. "These may be the signs to a larger Earthbebebebe", says Ersoy to the sender. "Before or later the great bee will also come."
Just a few weeks ago, there had been an intermittent accident - the bee also caused great anxiety in Istanbul. In Albania, there had been only a few days ago a severe earthquake - there were 68 injured. Even at the bottom of the lake this year, the earth had been bred.
Parliament: New in Ukraine-Affair
Two broken documents provide new fuel in Ukraine for possible abuse of power by US President Donald Trump. On the way to a possible recruitment procedure, the US Democrats are strengthened: The complaints filed by an anonymous notifier about Trump and its controversial phone call with the Ukrainian President raise important points for investigations against the president. Trump himself sees himself once more as a victim of a "Hexenjagd". He also questioned the credibility of the whistleblower.
U.S.A.: Airports from United Airlines in Toilet Closed - Airports surrounded
Since a passenger was locked in the board toilet, a United Airlines flight was conducted. The toilet door was blocked during the 1554 flight from Washington to San Francisco, the airline reported to US media.
In the case of an exceptional interim landing at midnight (local time) in Denver, the woman was finally able to be released from the narrow cabin. About an hour after they had been locked in there, US media wrote calling on other passengers. To proceed towards San Francisco, the passengers had to switch the machine.
In a video distributed on the Internet that is supposed to come from flight 1554, see how several people are trying to free the woman. "We are working on opening the door, Ma'am. We'll get you out soon, OK?" says a man. The airline has apologized to all the airlines. It was open first if the woman gets compensation.
The cake cake: inspired by Kafka: Ian McEwan writes Brexit-Roman
How does a writer like Ian McEwan deal with the whole Brexit chaos? He writes a book about it - and his protagonist is unknowable.
Ian McEwan (71) was inspired by Franz Kafka's famous story "The Change" by the British success author Ian McEwan (71) written a book about the Brexit chaos in Britain.
The novel "Die Kakerlake" (Original: "The Cockroach") will appear in German on November 27th, the Diogenes Verlag (Zürich) shared with him. It is about the transformation of a man named "Jim Sams", who was ignored or hated in his previous life, but now at one time is the most powerful man in the United Kingdom. He sees it as his mission to implement the will of the people in fact and is willing to let nothing and no one stop.
McEwan was quoted as saying: "When the Parliament is closed, so that the government cannot be challenged at a critical moment, when ministers lie as if once the Soviet leaders, when Brexiters in high positions just follow the disaster of a no-deal - then a writer has to ask himself what he can do. There is only one answer: write." McEwan was only published in the spring of the novel "machines like me" about artificial intelligence.
Kafkas 1915 is the first published story of Gregor Samsa, who wakes up one morning and sees himself "as an unhappily unlucky person", is excluded from family and society and is finally based on it. "Ian McEwan refuses to describe a world that is in the head," said Diogenes Verlag.
EU invests €9.5 million in Austria's railway infrastructure
11200 Wagons in Austria and Hungary receive fluorescent brakes to reduce noise load through freight trains. In addition, sections of the train connections between Graz and Györ and Wiener Neustadt and Sopron are modernised and electrified.
According to the EU authorities, this will make travel more comfortable and reduce CO2 emissions. The funds come from the EU infrastructure top "Connecting Europe Facility".
Thomas Cook: All trips down to October 31st
The German travel agent Thomas Cook cancelled all travel on one day after his application for insolvency until 31 October 2019. Travel could "not be made for insolvency reasons", the company informed on Thursday evening.
This includes bookings made by brands Thomas Cook Signature, Thomas Cook Signature Finest Selection, Neckermann Travel, ÖGER TOURS, Booker Travel and Air Marine, which are already paid or paid in full. As it stands for trips starting on November 1, 2019, the company opened. In accordance with the insolvency insurance, the other procedures will be examined, it was called.
Thomas Cook, in Germany, was in the chair of the British parent company and had applied for insolvency on Wednesday. The company, including Neckermann Travels, Öger Tours and Booker Travels, employs about 2,000 people in Germany.
Insurers want to transfer hotels from now on again
On the other hand, from this Friday, hotels abroad that are still staying Thomas Cook holiday are expected to receive money from Zurich insurance. According to Zurich, payments to the hotels are linked to the condition that vacationers are no longer required for extra payments.
On the basis of the booking information and without any particular invoices, the hotels in the holiday resorts should now receive 50 per cent of the outstanding payments, as a Zurich speaker of the German Press Agency said. "This applies immediately and provided that Thomas-Cook travellers from these hotels are not required from now on for individual payment of hotel bills or otherwise required," said Bernd English speaker.
The insurance thus responded to reports of hotel guests who were forced to pay their accommodation on their own site. Some had to put more than 1000 euros on the table. The German Travel Association (DRV) and the Federal Association of Consumer Centres had severely criticised this.
As many hotels are affected, it will be agreed on Friday with the insolvent travel provider, said the insurance speaker. According to Thursday, 70,000 Thomas-Cook-Pauschalulums were travelling from Germany. Zurich Germany has secured holidays and return to Thomas-Cook customers.
Insolvent managers want to try to continue three Thomas Cook companies in Germany and find a future solution.
However, the now announced payments to hotels by Zurich insurance only help travellers who are still on their way. For Thomas-Cook customers who want to fly on holiday, it seems bad. On the late Thursday evening the company shared, all travels would be cancelled until 31 October. This also applies to such bookings that are already paid.
As it stands for trips starting on November 1, 2019, the company opened. In accordance with insolvency insurance, the other procedures will be examined, it said. In principle, insurance is also responsible for these cases. The sale of new trips is stopped. dpa
The company refers to the insurer Zurich, which is represented by Kaera. Customers could inform themselves on the Kaera website about the possibilities of refunding the travel price and make their claims valid via a web form.
Prince Harry destroyed Springmine in Angola
For a long time, Prince Harry has continued Lady Diana's commitment. In Africa he is now turning directly to his mother's tracks.
The British Prince Harry in Angola, clothed with a blue splitter guard, has detonated and destroyed a sprinkling mine.
Near a British Halo Trust camp near the town of Dirico, he set the closing circle on Friday morning before the television camera. In safe distance, the troops exploded in the savannah landscape without damage. Although the Halo Trust alone destroyed more than 100,000 relics of the decades-long bloody conflict in the African country, there are still more than 1,000 mines that threaten the population.
On the fifth day of his African trip, Harry wanted to walk directly to the tracks of his mother Diana (1961-1997). He wanted to return to the path she was going to. The pictures on which Princess Diana 1997 went through a spacious mine field had gone around the world. She had also demonstrated support for the Halo Trust.
Harry (35) and his wife Meghan (38) have been on a ten-day African trip since Monday, which began in the South African tourist metropolis Cape Town.
Fixed Brexit Negotiations: The danger of a no-deal remains acute
In fact, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had clearly stated that he would not be guaranteed a third suspension of the Brexit negotiations. But what statements in the polarising British are already eternal. The latest judgement of the Supreme Court in Great Britain floats like a damocleschord over the blonde head. His suspension of Parliament in order to be able to carry out its Brexit course until the expiry date was cancelled. And a law passed by Parliament obliges Johnson to carry out an extension of bilateral negotiations with the EU until 31 October. However, Johnson had categorically again excluded.
Boris Johnson still holds a deal for
But the pressure does not seem to pass on to Johnson. Meanwhile, during a visit to a hospital, he indicated that in the event of a disagreement until the end of October, he supported an extension of the negotiations:
You know, we're gonna stick to the law.
At the same time, however, we are confident that we will leave the EU by October 31.
And best of all, with a deal, I'm careful that it's optimistic.
The time of the Brexit negotiators in Brussels seems to be running out of it. About six weeks later, the EU and British distributors have time to prevent a British withdrawal from the European Union without an agreement. However, the recent talks have not resulted in a breakthrough. An agreement is now more difficult to imagine. If the British Prime Minister does not break the law, a new shift of the date of withdrawal is in force. However, the opposition does not mind the words of the Prime Minister. She fears that Johnson could somehow implement the Brexit in the case of a no-deal.
US authorities: Other deaths by e-cigarettes
The number of deaths related to the use of e-cigarettes in the United States has increased to twelve. Furthermore, there are confirmed and probable injuries in the 805 years, the US health authority reported CDC. According to a study in the "New England Journal of Medicine", there were already more than 900 victims, about 500 of them confirmed. The cause for lung damage is still unclear. In Europe, no similar increase in lung damage has been reported.
Fear of new protests in Egypt grows
Millions of times, the videos of Mohammed Ali were shared in online networks. The construction industry and actors living in Spain are calling for a "global revolution". For today's Friday, he has called for further protests against President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and the Egyptian military who are critical of corruption and mismanagement. Ali hopes for mass media coverage with a million participants in central locations in the country.
The security authorities are alarmed at all times. In the center of Cairo there was already an enhanced police presence. Several bus stations were closed, roads were blocked around the central Tahrir Square. In the past days the police had strengthened their street controls and partially searched the phones of pedestrians for news and photos related to the protests.
On September 20th, the demonstrators gathered around Tahrir Square.
Last weekend it came to protests with hundreds of participants in Cairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura. There was no such open protest in Egypt for years. The security forces responded. According to the human rights organization Human Rights Watch (HRW), almost 2,000 people were arrested since last week. Many of them were voluntarily arrested - only because they were "for wrong time in the wrong place", HRW informed the detainees, calling on lawyers.
The organization also criticised the censorship in the North African country. The government is blocking Cairo websites and online services to stop further protests against al-Sisi. The General has ruled the country since 2013, after he had cut off the democratically elected Islamic President Mohammed Mursi. Thousands of Islamists, government opponents, bloggers and activists have been arrested and partially condemned in the past years.
"Ocean Change": Inherited Fuchs of Greenland expedition back
The Polar Researcher Arved Fuchs returned on Friday from his Greenland expedition. He was welcomed at his arrival in Hamburg port, among other things by the Skipper Boris Herrmann, climate activist Greta Thunberg with the Rennjacht "Malicia" over the Atlantic.
With a team of scientists, Fuchs had investigated and documented the effects of global warming on his ship "Dagmar Aaen" on the coasts of Iceland and Greenland in the past months.
The Fridays for Future Movement was a blessing, said the Polar researcher. He waited for years to report to the young generation. For decades he knew that the earth would warm up. However, many were acting like a planet B.
"What happens on the sea often takes place except in public," said Fuchs. He and his team wanted to inform people about the effects of global warming and the evaporation of the seas. In the expedition, among other things, it was measured with a dry Greenland glacier and fished with nets after microplastics.
For its "fighting for the sustainable and respectful use of the world's seas", the Polar researcher from Bad Bramstedt was awarded the "Seadevcon Maritime Award" in the framework of the Hamburg climate week. "For all of us who have lived the ocean in the heart, Arved Fuchs is a great example," said Skipper Boris Herrmann at the award ceremony. "He is a witness of the changes that have been made in the Arctic in the past decades."
Teure Spaghetti in Rome: Tourists paid for noodles 430 Euros
430 Euros for two teller spaghetti with fish in a simple restaurant near the Englishburg in Rome: That seemed too much to two Japanese tourists. The account included 80 Euros of drinking money was paid by the two women, but they posted the departure on Facebook, which triggered hot reactions.
"Such cases are damaging to the sight of Rome. We ask the police to question whether this is a fraud," asked a speaker from Federgit, the association of travel leaders in Rome, according to the Roman daily Il Messaggero (free-day edition).
Prompt came the reaction of the owners of the restaurant. The Japanese had not only ordered spaghetti, but also fresh fish, the local owner justified himself. However, this is not to be taken from the bill. Also, a drink money of up to 20 percent of the bill was normal, the host said.
A call in Ukraine, and everything is broken? U.S. President Donald Trump could actually be confronted with an office collection procedure after the turbulent discoveries of the last days, which the Democrats want to examine as quickly as possible with their investigation at the House of Representatives - the speech is from weeks to a decision.
At the beginning of the scandal, it is likely that the phone call with Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj is on the phone. The proposal of the Whistleblower, which has finally brought national security and democracy of the United States to the public with his complaint, is monstrous: the President has misused the power of his office to instrumentalize the government of another country for an influence on the 2020 election. He has exploited Ukraine's dependence on it and so they want to force it to be active against a political opponent.
The core of this event is also to be reflected in the currently published subscription of the conversation with Selensky, although it does not give up the full vocabulary. The phone call of July 25 is only an episode of a much larger story, in which the center next to Trump is primarily his personal lawyer: Rudy Giuliani.
The story is taken from the public's perspective in May 2019 when the New York Times of Rudy Giuliani's travel plans are reported to Ukraine. He wants to meet in Kiev with the equally elected President Selenskyj, and the lawyer himself knows very well that his intentions are excellent. "We do not mix in an election, we join in an investigation to which we have the right," he says the newspaper. He could think it was inappropriate, but "there is nothing illegal". Giuliani wants to be followed in Ukraine by investigations for which there is little basis - "because this information will be very, very helpful to my clients and could be helpful to my government."
The lawyer and former New York mayor seems to have been infected with the right conspiracy fantasy, fixed on Trump's opponent at the 2016 election: Hillary Clinton had conceived with actors in Ukraine, critics said at that time to construct a case for Russia's submissions in the USA. However, this proposal was never taken seriously.
It is precisely the findings that will be discussed so prominently on the phone with Selensky in July. The version of Giulianis and the President says: The former vice president and currently a rich candidate for the presidential candidacy of the Democrats, Joe Biden, as Ukraine's deputy director of the Obama government, has pushed Wiktor Schokin to disband the former Ukrainian attorney general. In order to stop the investigation of the gas company responsible for him, his son Hunter Biden was active in his supervisory board. Both seniors have pressured Ukraine financially to circumvent the corrupt machinities of his family.
In fact, the outcome was different. When Joe Biden asked that the Ukrainian attorney-general should go, the investigations against the gas company were already completed, Hunter Biden was never directly affected by it. In addition, shocking himself was put forward to the most corrupt charges, the U.S. government was not the only Western partner in the case of Wiitem, who was forced to release it. In addition, Obama's government explicitly supported the investigations against the company.
Disorders at Instagram Facebook and Whatsapp: Social media are down
Users worldwide report massive disturbances on Instagram and Facebook. This is especially true of Germany, the United Kingdom and Spain. On the website all disorders.de reports users that Facebook has not been loading since about 15.30 a.m., and Instagram reports the error message that content could not be loaded. Also, whatsapp seems to be affected by the disturbance, even if it is not yet in the same range.
Instagram and co. of disorders
It is not the first massive crash this year. Already in March and July the services were out for several hours. And as in previous cases, users also go back to Twitter this time, especially to make their angry air.
Polish Scientists Saved in Antarctica
Three Polish scientists were rescued from the Chilean Air Force from the ice of Antarctica. They were on their way with a hose boat and several miles away from their base when they lost their engine. They had luck in the accident - less than an hour needed the Chilean rescue shooter for the climb.
Eduardo Mosquera, Commander of the 4th Chilean Air Brigade:
"At 9:30 a.m. we received the message, about ten a.m. we started, and we were on the boat for 20 minutes."
Poland has been operating on King George Island since 1977 the Henryk Arctowski Polish Antarctic Station, 19 scientists are working there. The frozen researchers have certainly been brought back to their research station.
Attention: smartphone NO wireless charging
Practical but harmful
Inductive technology via Qi standard is extremely practical, but should not be used.
As recently, several new smartphones have come to the market that support wireless charging and sell very well - all in advance of the new iPhone-11 models, we would like to call again a study from the beginning of July into memory. Although wireless charging of mobile devices is extremely practical, but not necessarily recommended.
Higher temperature sets battery to
Researchers warn against the wireless charging of smartphones. This is according to the findings of the University of Warwick, which is extremely harmful to the devices. The reason for this is the significantly larger heat development. If you produce a normal phone per cable, the battery will heat up in three hours at 27 degrees. In the case of wireless charging, the researchers have measured itself at a perfect orientation of the smartphone on the charging pad at all times over 30 degrees. The phone is located slightly next to the coil, the temperature is even higher. In addition, the water strength of the charging pad is also rising, which in turn drives electricity consumption up to the height.
Capacity and lifetime
According to the researchers, the temperature for the durability of batteries is a crucial factor. As each degree plays a role. In charging with higher temperatures, the battery not only consumes capacity, but it also does not last for so long. The life span is therefore lower. The researchers therefore advise that the smartphone should always be charged per cable. Since a battery is always connected to modern smartphones at high costs, it should be a helpful tip. Apple has recently increased the cost of an battery even once more - and indeed for all iPhones.
Practical
The technique is extremely comfortable: Simply put the device on a corresponding charger - they are already already installed in many restaurants, airports, hotels and cars - and the battery will be charged without a loose cable salad and a difficult plug-in foam. Since Qi (which is for inductive energy transmission) has a global standard, with exception even Apple, there are few restrictions. However, the technology should be used only in exceptional cases according to researchers.
Everest-Stau photographer: 13 thousand in six months
A Nepalese mountain climber has established within only six months 13 of the 14 highest mountains in the world. Nirmal Purja (36) reached the top of the Manaslu in Nepal and thus set up a record, his expedition organizer shared with him.
The former soldier wants to climb all 14 thousands in seven months. Purja calls his project "Mission Possible". He has already made international battle lines: From him comes a photograph of mountain climbers that stand on Mount Everest snakes in the spring.
The image of the mass attack triggered a debate on stronger security measures on the 8848 meters high mountain and the highest summit of the earth. Within a few days, eleven climbers died at the rise in May.
A problem for Purja could become the rise of the 14th thousandth: Chinese authorities are currently blocking the Xixabangma mountain in Tibet. For this reason it is called bad weather, among other things. At the beginning of the week, Purja wrote on Twitter that Nepal's government wants to talk to China to allow it to rise.
Four dead elephants discovered on Sri Lanka
Among the dead animals was also a terrible elephant cow, a police speaker shared on Friday. "We suspect the elephants were poisoned".
The four kadaver were found in a protected area near the famous and many tourists visited the former rock festival Sigiriya. According to the police spokesman, the animals were probably between 15 and 25 years old. An autopsy was arranged to determine the cause of death.
In Sri Lanka almost 200 elephants are killed each year. The predators are often farmers in which animals have been kept harmless before. At the same time, about 50 elephants are killed each year. This is usually the case when the animals move near their living room.
According to estimates, only about 7,000 elephants live in Sri Lanka. The death penalty is theoretical.
Contained British oil tanker leaves Iran
The British oil tanker "Stena Impero" leaves the port city of Bandar Abbas more than two months after its arrest by Iran. This was announced by the Marine Office Bandar Abbas, according to the IRNA news agency. The Iranian Revolutionary Guards had set the tanker running under the British flag on July 19th under the proposal to have failed to comply with the rules of the law of the sea in the Persian Gulf.
Thomas Cook's Management in Criticism
The competent Economic Committee of the Under-House would like to examine in detail the board of the travel agent Thomas Cook. It would be as much a matter of the board's cost package as the question of why the British government did not allow the company struggling to move financially. "Our interest is the supervision of the company as well as the control of external auditors," said CEO Rachel Reeves in London. "We obviously have to do it with a bad example of management".
According to experts, genes are overestimated at the risk of intestinal cancer
The role of the gene in the increased risk of domestic colon cancer has been clearly overestimated so far. To this end, researchers from the German Cancer Research Centre (DKFZ) Heidelberg come into a current study. Other risk factors such as family eating habits are therefore likely to weigh harder than ever. This has had consequences for calculations of the individual colon cancer risk, the DKFZ scientists stress.
Elon Musk makes Tesla shares rise
This was written by Musk on a Thursday (local time) by the industry blog "Electrek" to Tesla employees. The demand is strong, so that Tesla could book 110,000 orders, it is called in Musks Rundschrieben.
The challenge is to bring the cars to the knowledge as quickly as possible. Tesla must offer as many resources as possible to the quarter end.
Investors liked the information: Tesla shares went with a plus of six percent out of trade. So strong the course has not been added for almost four months. In the second quarter, Tesla had delivered well 95'000 cars and thus reached its previous best value.
Musk needs a record to achieve his high goals. 2019 he wants to deliver a total of 360'000 to 400'000 cars. This requires six-digit numbers in the current and coming quarter year. Especially the most affordable Tesla Model 3 is asked, but here are the few gains. Despite the boom, there was last loss.
Will the British government deal with Brexit Act?
The British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is concerned about whether he is looking for an unregulated Brexit law in order to circumvent Parliament's last law. He said only on Friday before journalists that his government will remain in force.
The law provides that the government must apply for a transfer of the term of retirement should not have reached an agreement with the EU by mid-October. Johnson criticises this as a "Capitulation Act", which makes it difficult to negotiate with the EU.
On Thursday, former British Prime Minister John Major had expressed his suspicion that Johnson could try to use "political shifts" in order to enforce the law. Johnson could use a procedure which would delay the entry into force of the law at the time after the EU leave.
Johnson said he is seeking a contract with the European Union. "We are confident to leave the EU on 31 October, and the best way is with an agreement".
Iran conducts apparent uranium enrichment high
Iran's President Hassan Rohani has raised the pressure on the European Contracting Parties in the fight against the rescue of the historic nuclear agreement. "The European States have shown some inability or lack of willingness when it comes to concrete actions," Rohani said at a press conference on Thursday at the edge of the UN General Assembly in New York. In the event that they do not stand up to their promises, he took "more steps" away from the agreements negotiated in 2015.
The background of the conflict is to force the international agreement to prevent an Iranian atom bomb, which as a counter-performance included the commitment of Tehran to normalise economic relations. In 2018 alone, the United States came out of the agreement to force Iran with "maximum pressure" to change its course in the neighbourhood policy that was aggressively perceived. President Donald Trump's government wants to negotiate a new agreement with tougher orders and, at the same time, re-introduces severe sanctions against Tehran. Iran has recently reacted to this with a re-establishment of the limited uranium enrichment in the treaty.
The International Atomic Energy Authority (IAEA) confirmed in a report that the Islamic Republic has now used or at least prepared Uranium to use the installed centrifuge in early September. According to the IAEA, Iran also prepares the construction of more than 300 additional centrifuge.
The Europeans may not be prepared to carry their part of the deal and therefore left the Iranians alone with the costs and the burden of forced US sanctions, forced by Rohani. However, there will be further talks that hopefully need a solution.
Rohani continues to argue Iran's development in attacks in Saudi Arabia
However, following an attack on an important oil plant in Saudi Arabia in mid-September, Germany, France and the United Kingdom followed the US assessment Monday that Tehran was responsible for the attack. The Huthi rebels in Yemen were initially known for the attack, which was considered a false confession by the United States. "We have nothing to do with it," Rohani confirmed his position on Wednesday.
"Those who raise such charges must present evidence for this," Rohani said. The European leaders had not been able to do so during the UN General Assembly talks, but they had only called on the rebels in Yemen to carry out an attack like this. Rohani had met with Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson in the past days.
Prior to possible talks with US President Trump, the extensive sanctions of the US administration had to be lifted, Rohani demanded. He urged the government in Washington to shift to a policy of "dialogue and understanding".
Comet from another star crosses the solar system
Astronomers are currently observing a comet from the depths of the universe. This has been achieved before. The comet allows for conclusions on other solar systems.
What was initially only a suspicion is now confirmed: An interstellar guest crosses through our solar system. The comet from the depths of space was baptized after its discoverer on 2I/Borisov and has aroused the interest of astronomers all over the world.
The extensive comet was discovered on August 30 from the amateur astronomer Gennadi Borissow at the Margo Observatory in Crimea - with a self-built telescope of 65 centimeters diameter. Observations from various observatories confirmed not only that it was an unknown comet, but also showed that it did not come from our solar system.
2I/Borisov is only the second interstellar object that was seen during a journey of our solar system after 1I/'Ouumamua of 2017.
2I/Borisov offers astronomers the rare chance of getting insights into a strange solar system before it disappears into space. The first observations show that the interstellar comet like our own systems, as reported by the Astrophysics Institute of the Canarys. "The current speed of the comet is high, about 150,000 kilometres per hour, which in this distance is clearly above the typical speeds of objects surrounding the sun," said David Farnocchia of the US Space Agency NASA in a communication.
The comet is based on the analysis on a so-called hyperbole path that drove it out of our system - and clearly more interstellar origin, as reported by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). It is also responsible for the designation and categorisation of heavenly bodies. In honor of its discoverer, the interstellar stars, which were first led under the catalogue number C/2019 Q4, were named 2I/Borisov, indicating that the first part of the name is that it is the second interstellar object discovered in our solar system.
Astronomers are lucky: unlike 1I/'Ouumaua, 2I/Borisov has already been seen in the flight. Thus, researchers remain for months to investigate. "The object will reach the greatest brightness in mid-December and then be seen with medium-sized telescopes until April 2020," said Farnocchia. "Then it will only be observed with larger professional telescopes until October 2020".
Several observatories have already taken the visitor into the vision. Thus a team of Karen Meech from the University of Hawaii, who had already led the characterization of 1I/'Ouumamua, identified the diameter of the sky object as 2 to 16 kilometres in a first study. Recordings of the Gemini Observatory in Hawaii show a clear shift of the comet.
Researchers and researchers at the Astrophysics Institute of the Canary Islands (IAC) have already won a first so-called spectrum of the interstellar swivel star, offering a kind of fingerprint of its chemical composition. "The spectrum of this object is similar to the comets of our solar system, and this suggests that its composition must be similar," said IAC researcher Julia de León. This observation is very close to the fact that comets in other solar systems could be formed through similar processes as in ours, added by Leon's College Javier Licandro.
The discovery of two interstellar visitors within just two years, according to IAU estimates, indicates that these objects could open up a new way to explore certain processes in other solar systems. However, as often as such spot visits are, it is still difficult to estimate. One of the next interstellar visitors could possibly capture a planned satellite mission of the European Space Agency Esa.
By 2028, the agency intends to station the three-part space probe "Comet Interceptor" on a waiting position in 1.5 million kilometres away from the earth. According to Esa Director of Science Günther Hasinger, it is expected that it will be based on a yet unaffected fresh comet from our own solar system, or an interstellar visitor such as 1I/'Ouumamua.
First landing on Beijing's new Mega Airport Daxing
Right before the 70th birthday of the People's Republic it is so: On the new Mega Airport in the south of the Chinese capital, a first passenger machine of the Chinese United Airlines landed, a special honor for Captain and Crew.
By 2022, about 45 million passengers were to be executed annually at the new airport, and 72 million were already expected to be in 2025. China's President Xi Jinping personally announced the opening of the 450 billion expensive project. China's latest prestigious project is also called "Sistern" because of its six-story building structure.
The complex has four starting and landing routes to be extended to seven later and is equipped with the world's largest automatic flight management system. A new U-New U-bahn transports passengers in just 20 minutes to the city centre of Beijing.
During the construction, the Chinese had repeatedly announced that Berlin could learn from Beijing. The opening of the building since 2006 - and much smaller - capital city airport in Germany has been re-moved so far. In Beijing, after four years, a first passenger car was established.
New overpassing aircraft is due to fly 2030: In four and a half hours from London to Sydney
From London to Sydney in just four and a half hours, the UK Space Agency dreamt of the British Space Agency. It is possible to make this, a special drive (Synergetic Air-Breathing Rocket Engine, Sabre), developed by the company Reaction Engines from Oxfordshire, the US-Sender CNN. "This is the technology that could definitely make it work," said agent director Graham Turnock to the broadcaster. "We speak of the 2030s for the deployment, and the work has been very advanced."
In order to advance the project, the British space travel agency wants to cooperate closely with the Australian. A flight from the British capital to the Australian metropolis is currently about 20 hours away. As a single passenger passenger over-board aircraft, the agreements from 1976 to the setting up of its operations in 2003 covered the New York Paris route and required three to three and a half hours. In 2000, there was an accident at the start of a contract at the Paris airport Charles de Gaulle, where all 109 cases came to life. Last year, the US pilot Lockheed Martin Plane, together with the U.S. Space Agency NASA, also developed an over-board aircraft that has "X-Plane" in such a programme.
"Sabre will make the world smaller with its high-speed point-to-point transport," says Reaction Engines, among other things, on its homepage. The Sabre drive could be used for efficient travels at a speed of Mach 5 - this means five times as fast as the signal. Furthermore, such aircraft are also usable outside the Earth atmosphere and thus allow the "next generation of truly reusable rocket vehicles".
Ride in Washington: Trump wants to find anonymous tippers in Ukraine affair
In Ukraine's case of possible abuse of power by the U.S. president, Donald Trump wants to discover possible unscrupulous positions in the White House.
"I want to know who gave the Whistleblower the information," Trump said on Thursday before US ambassadors to the United Nations in New York. The person in question was almost "a spy" and with such a past was "a bit different" than today.
This was seen as a fearsome attempt against tippers. The event was not actually public. However, several US media distributed audio media on Friday from the address. Democrats responded to the president's statement.
The Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives had announced on Tuesday preparations for an official procedure against Trump. Their proposals are based primarily on the written complaints of an anonymous secret service employee who collects heavy charges against Trump and its government headquarters. At large public pressure there were written statements made by the notifier on Thursday.
As part of his work, the Whistleblower wants to receive information from several government employees, by which the US President "uses the power of his office" to reach out to another country to his advantage in the US elections in 2020.
In the centre of the proposals, there is a controversial telephone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selensky at the end of July, in which Trump urged his colleagues to investigate which could harm his political rival Joe Biden. It is about protecting his voice from Ukrainian justice before Biden's previous business of Biden's son Hunter in Ukraine and alleged efforts to protect his presidential candidacy for the 2020 election.
The Whistleblower accused the White House with a view to Ukraine's telephone also of the confusion: leading government employees had tried to keep the exact wording of the conversation under the cover. As usual, an electronic vocabulary protocol was produced. This was done after the conversation to instruct judges from the White House but was removed from a common database and was stored instead in a particularly protected system. So far, only a rough conversation protocol has been published.
The identity of the notifier is not publicly known. The "New York Times" reported that it should be an employee of the CIA Foreign Secret Service.
Trump again questioned the credibility of the source on Friday. In a series of Tweets, the president wrote on the subject, among other things, the so-called Whistleblower has distributed information from a second hand that had been out of order. Therefore, there may be no tipper or spy.
As Trump said in New York about those who were supposed to have played with the whistleblower information, however, excitement was triggered. The president of the U.S. House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, who reacted worried and complained, Trump's statement once again undermines the government's integrity.
In the House of Representatives, various investigations against Trump and its environment have been carried out in various committees for months. In view of Ukraine's proposals, the democracies are now in the process of moving forward investigations with new caution in order to launch a possible process of recruitment against Trump.
"The Whistleblower has given us a roadmap for our investigation," said the Chief of the Secret Service Committee in the House of Representatives, Adam Ship. Trump attacked the ship hard, threw a false display of the things before him and demanded again the resignation of the committee president. Trump regularly slandered the ship and had already demanded its return months ago.
More than 300 former U.S. government officials from the security and foreign policy area, most of whom were working under democratic but also under republican presidents, were following a statement published on Friday, following a study initiated by the Democrats for a possible process of office collection. If the proposals were to be preserved, it would be the "scrupulous use of power" by Trump, which was called.
For the further procedure, there is no precise timetable. With its majority in the House, the Democrats could try a so-called impeachment procedure. But the decision on a real office collection fell into the Senate, where Trump Republicans have the majority. The prospects for such a procedure are therefore small. So far no US president has been removed by an impeachment procedure of the Office.
VW Board of Directors: jobs are "sheriffed"
The plans of the VW brand, in which to further reduce the costs of production, could go to the load of production in Germany and Europe. This concern is driving the car manufacturer's operating council. The brand wants to reduce its annual factory costs from ten billion euros to two billion euros by 2023. 500 million euros are to be saved this year.
A key to this is the staff costs. The "future pact" negotiated between companies and the business council in 2016 already provides for the reduction of 14,000 jobs in Germany alone by 2020. In principle: a job can only be demolished in the car industry if it is almost proven that the related activities are no longer necessary. In addition, employment security is applicable until 2029.
However, as our newspaper now learns from business council events, jobs in production that are not actually at the disposal of the dissertation are "sparing" over a different path - that is, at the official course.
In these cases, the Board of Directors has no opportunity to force the recovery. Meanwhile, it lacks many staff to take up the job closure, the concerns would be greater in the face of a similar outflow of vehicles. In order to increase the fear that vehicle production could be withdrawn from Germany and Europe because it is more favourable in other parts of the world. From VW it was just said, "A change in the employment volume is taking place as agreed along the demographic curve".
The brand VW wants to make production even more standardized worldwide and to control new projects centrally. It also aims to reduce costs and accelerate decisions - the aim is to increase productivity and thus increase competitiveness. Production CEO Andreas Tostmann said at a Berlin Manager's conference: "In times of uncertainty from Brexit to the threatening trade war between the US and China, we are well advised to make ourselves a crisis party."
On this road there are already success: For example, this year, for the first time since 2013, production costs per vehicle are reduced compared to the previous year. Before journalists Tostmann said that the production time for the Gulf 8 should be presented on 24 October in Wolfsburg to shorten for 1,1 hours. Exact figures for the duration of production do not mention VW, according to our newspaper it is the same as the Gulf 7 around.
20 hours.
In our region, the Wolfsburg family plant is the only VW factory in which vehicles are produced. The works Braunschweig and Salzgitter make components. For the Wolfsburg interior, VW-in applies the Faust rule that 800,000 cars must be built there annually so that the work can be profitable. In 2018, however, there were only about 700,000 vehicles in Wolfsburg, due to the decreasing diesel demand and the problems in converting to the new consumption and exhaust testing process WLTP.
As Tostmann has already announced last year, however, in Wolfsburg, a million cars are expected to roll out of the band. This is intended to enable the merger of golf production in the family - because the Zwickau works by refurbishing to the location for e-auto production.
Moreover, the SUV Tiguan and Tarraco (Seat) are produced in Wolfsburg. However, the sales figures of Golf and Tiguan have recently slowed down. Therefore, the expectations now rest on Golf 8. He should, despite all his efforts to build e-mobility, remain the bread and butter car of the Wolfsburgers first.
forced by Voodoo to prostitution: human dealer convicted
Young women from Nigeria are armed with swords, locked in the pipe area and forced to prostitution. Six needy human dealers must be in prison for this.
Six conscientious human traffickers from Nigeria were sentenced on Friday to bail and prison sentences of up to eight years and three months. The accused had imprisoned young women from Nigeria into the area of silence and forced them to commit prostitution. In order to force their obedience, the exiled Nigerians still had to lay a ritual suffrage in front of a Voodoo priest in the home.
The victims were between 17 and 22 years old. They were brought by Libyan prisoners to seaboats. However, the dream of a better future did not come true. They arrived in Germany, they were distributed on different boards to cover the alleged terminal costs of an average of 25 000 euros.
The defendants - four men and two women - had added the enclosing and subsequent distribution of the young Nigerians to Bordelle in the process. "The work made it difficult for the women to create physically and mentally," said Judge Isabel Hoffmann at the notice of judgment. "Some were rightly opposed."
The judgments are based on commercial and gang involvement of foreigners, trafficking in human beings, detention and heavy forced prostitution.
Ufo calls for negotiations with Lufthansa
FIm Dauersteit with the Lufthansa Group has again threatened Ufo with strikes.
If the company does not return to the negotiating table, the trade union will "informed on 14 October about the labour struggles in the LH group", said Ufo tariff chief Daniel Flohr on Friday. Lufthansa and her daughter Eurowings have refused to conduct tariff negotiations with Ufo for months. This is also the question of whether the trade union has legally announced tariff agreements with Lufthansa.
At this point, Ufo is now strengthened following a decision by the Labour Court of Frankfurt. Lufthansa wanted to establish that the tariff agreements were not announced. The court rejected the applications. The company confirmed the decision and examined the remedy. "That a second court sees the matter completely differently, I consider it unlikely," said Ufo-Blohr.
In August, Lufthansa also submitted an application to the Landesbeitsgericht Frankfurt for judicial review of the status of the Ufo as a trade union. The company argued that the trade union had not used a representative board for months and thus could not fulfil its role as a tariff partner.
Previously, there was a strong leadership dispute in the joint trade union, in which many members of the board as well as of the council, including the long-term trade union chief Nicolele Baublies, had already put forward an early vote on the strike of the cabin staff at Eurowing's end in July due to doubts about their leadership.
Facilitated entry: Saudi Arabia announces new Visa System
So far, Saudi Arabia has not been known to be an international tourist magnet. But this should change now. The country in the Persian Gulf wants to introduce new visa regulations.
With a new Visa system, Saudi Arabia intends to attract international tourists in the future. By 2030, to increase the number of international and domestic visitors to 100 million per year, the Tourism Commission shared.
"The opening of Saudi Arabia for international tourists is a historic moment for our country," said the President of the Tourism Commission Ahmad Al-Chatib.
Saudi Arabia has so far been difficult for tourists. Visawerden usually only for short business trips, religious pilgrimages or visitors with residents in the desert state. The new rules hope for more revenues from the tourism business. According to its own auction, Riad wants to reduce its dependence on oil trade.
In mid-September, several rockets and drones had hit two main oil plants in eastern Saudi Arabia: the country's largest oil refinery in Abkaik and the Chourais oil field. Following this, the national oil production broke down dramatically, the oil price shots up. It may take several weeks until the production of the Kingdom reaches its old level again.
Justin and Hailey Bieber stick in preparation for wedding party
Singer Justin Bieber (25) and his wife Hailey (22) prepared for her wedding party. The model posted several party photos in their Instagram stories, on which she is to see in the white wedding look. Reality-Star Kendall Jenner (23) and others had, according to the People's magazine, organized a youth in Los Angeles.
Justin posted several colors, including banners printed on Instagram and asked his followers: "Help me choose my smoking for wedding". According to media reports, the promi couple wants to get married in the coming weekend.
The beebers gave themselves the yes word a year ago in a New York State office. A larger feast had not been made at that time.
In an interview with the Australian Vogue, Hailey recently explained that the two had found a common level after initial problems: "If you don't want to compromise, you can't have a relationship".
Two deaths in aircraft crash in Czech Republic
Two people were killed by the destruction of a small aircraft in western Czech Republic. The Wrack was discovered on Friday in a forest area near the city of Meschin, the police shared it. The death was a 38-year-old woman and a 64-year-old man.
The authorities had been looking for the machine since Thursday evening after the operation via GPS. The search was also a military helicopter in use. The accident has yet to be detected. The resort is about 30 kilometres south of Pilsen (Plzen) and 100 kilometres north-east of Regensburg.
Half of European tree species are threatened by extinction
In addition to injuries, diseases, alien species, non-sustainable timber and the growth of cities causes of threat, the IUCN World Conservation Union reported on Friday in Brussels. It has investigated the stocks of all 454 species known in Europe. 265 of these do not come to any other continent. Of these 265 are 58 percent threatened. 66 are already at the highest level of danger and thus before extinction.
The IUCN shares endangered species in six categories: from "potentially endangered" via "hazarded", "strongly endangered", "from extinction threatened" and "destroyed in nature" to "dead". Overall, it lists more than 28,000 species of animals and plants worldwide as endangered.
Eberische und wilde Rosskastanie threatened
In Germany, one of the authors, David Allen, the German Press Agency, was threatened in particular by Eberschen (Sorbus). "Most of them are threatened because the populations are also small or by the conversion or weakening of their living spaces."
It also looks bad for the wild ordinary Russians. They have been considered as "hazarded" since 2017, level two of the IUCN scale. The biggest threat is the Balkan minimote. It has spread over the entire continent since the 1980s and has hardly natural enemies. IUCN estimates the number of wild Russians (Aesculus hippocastanum) in Europe to fewer than 10,000 copies. In this assessment, the trees in cities, parks and villages are not taken into account.
Straucharten and Moose also in danger
At the same time, IUCN scientists have created new European red lists for weightiers, strawberries and moose. More than a fifth of the weightiers and mooses and almost half of all weight charters are at risk, so the IUCN. This is especially true of the destruction of the wild, including species, agricultural practices and climate change.
"This report shows that the situation for many species that are overlooked and underestimated is precarious, species that form the backbone of the European ecosystem and contribute to a healthy planet," said Luc Bas, the IUCN Director of the European Office. "We need to limit the impact of humans on our ecosystems and make the protection of these species a priority."
Earthquake before Istanbul: 34 reported injured
In the recent earthquake in Turkey, 34 people were injured. There were no deaths according to the data. Hundreds of people had to leave their homes, 14 schools in Istanbul were closed for security reasons, said Turkish Vice President Fuat Oktay on Friday.
Thus, hundreds of buildings were damaged. Since the bite on the previous day, there have been almost 200 descendants. The earthquake of the strength of 5,8 on Thursday had struck the Marmara region in front of Istanbul and triggered panic in the millions of metropolis.
Now the government wants to set up a Commission to prepare the country better for earthquakes in the future, Oktay announced. Over the past 20 years, Turkey has not been prepared enough for bees, Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu said.
Istanbul is considered to be particularly vulnerable to earthquakes. Below the Marmarameer is a section of the so-called North Anatolic disturbance that marks the boundary between the Eurasian and the Anatolic plate.
One of the hardest bees was one of the strengths 7.6 in 1999 near Istanbul. The epicenter was then located in Golcük in southeastern Istanbul. More than 17,000 people died.
On Tuesday, the area of Istanbul had been damaged by an earthquake of 4.6. The authorities called on the inhabitants to keep damaged buildings away.
Super Bowl 2020: Jennifer Lopez (JLo) and Shakira enter the half-time show
The Latin pop singer Jennifer Lopez and Shakira will be featured in the half-time show of the next American football finals Super Bowl. This was announced on Twitter. "It won't be bigger," Shakira wrote to a photo of herself and Lopez. She was reluctant to stand on the Super Bowl stage. On February 2, 2020, it will be so much in Miami.
Jennifer Lopez explained that she had dreamed of appearing at the Super Bowl since 1996 - at that time she saw Diana Ross flying at the half-time show in the sky. "Now it's even more special because the NFL is 100 years old and I will perform with another Latina." She could hardly expect it "to show what we can do on the biggest stage of the world".
Shakira pointed out in a statement that she felt honored, besides another artist standing on one of the largest stage in the world and representing Latinos and Latinas from the United States and the whole world. "And then also on my birthday!" The main sponsor of the event wrote on Twitter, it was the first time that the two "kings" were together on a stage.
Shakira came from Colombia. Jennifer Lopez was born in New York, her parents came from Puerto Rico.
Fighting the falling numbers of spectators
The Super Bowl is the highlight of the American football season. The game and the half-time show are among the most seen TV broadcasts in the United States. Even if you have recently lost sights: in this February, the spectacle in the United States attracted the smallest viewer for more than ten years. However, it was still almost 100 million people on the average.
About the half-time show of the last Super Bowl there had been a riot in the pre-field: In the fight to deal with Quarterback Colin Kaepernick in the past February media reports, topstars like Rihanna, Pink and Cardi B did not appear. Finally, Pop Group Maroon 5 launched the half-time show - the critics were not friendly.
Kaepernick, then quarterback of San Francisco 49ers, had gone to the knees in 2016/17 before NFL games at the National Gymnams of Protest against Police Violence and Rassism. With his protest, Kaepernick launched a movement, many players took over the gestures. This made him very excited, US President Donald Trump attacked most African football stars. Kaepernick himself has been inconsequential since March 2017 and no NFL party has fought anymore. He rejects the associations not to honor him for political reasons.
Cook-Pleite: Hotels get money from insurance
Some banks are expected to be expensive on the part of the travel provider Thomas Cook, according to a press report. High write-offs on outstanding loans and loans are threatened. Credit Suisse is also affected, writes the "Financial Times" in its release on Friday.
Banks such as Barclays, Morgan Stanley, UniCredit or the Credit Suisse had to make a total write-off of up to 1.8 billion UK pounds (about EUR 2 billion) on their books.
The creditors of loans were required to purchase down from 900 million to 1 billion pounds and the creditors between 550 and 825 million pounds. The amounts actually to be written should come at the top of the band, one expert said to the sheet.
As the losses of the creditors in the end will actually prove, after the insolvency proceedings have ended. A close-to-stand person did not have much hope. For example, about 40 Thomas Cook aircraft in Great Britain are "old" and many of the properties are in bad positions. Most money could be obtained by selling the airport slots as well as the Thomas Cook brand, it continued.
Missiles to have brought worthy murderers to Italy
The Sea Watch Captain Carola Rocket may have brought men to Italy who have tortured and killed people in Libya. "We cannot exclude this, but we have not even secured information about it," said the spokesperson of the Refugee Organization Sea Watch, Ruben Neubauer, the News Agency dpa.
Other migrants would have recognized the three men in Italy. You are supposed to have raped, tortured and killed people in Libya. The necessary perpetrators were arrested in the reception camp in the Italian Messina. New building stressed that the refugee organizations could not check who they left on their ships. "They come without passports".
Carola Rocket had illegally brought migrants into the port of Lampedusa on June 29 and a ship of the Italian financial police had boarded. On that day, the three suspects were also to arrive there. The captain was indicted for illegal immigration aid.
US warns federal government before Huawei
The head of the US Internet Agency Federal Communications Commission (FCC), Ajit Pai, warned the Federal Government to trust the Chinese network equipment Huawei.
We believe that the risks are too great," Pai said to the "salesblatt" with a view to building the new 5G mobile network.
China has a "national security law", which obliged each company "under Chinese law" to comply with the instructions of the security authorities.
The applicable law also prohibits the company from informing third parties about such requests", says the FCC Chief. This makes it very difficult to have confidence in the integrity of technical equipment and services.
In the meantime, the Federal Government has agreed to demand a "confidentiality statement" from suppliers.
Berlin wants to first try to control the risks, for example with technical solutions, reports the "salesblatt" calling on its own information.
Pai doubts that this is possible. The 5G technology is not only from hardware:
Especially the software is important to keep the devices at the latest. This software consists of billions of lines of program code that change with time," Pai said.
It is "very difficult to imagine", that a government authority, "as far as possible, would be able to check every single update in real time to detect security risks," said the FCC Chief.
The Chinese group Huawei offers close contact with the Chinese state apparatus:
The property conditions are impartial. The employees' company, which is supposed to belong to the company, is not necessarily independent of the government," Pai said to the "trade sheet".
The United States presents findings that government employees are placed within the company. Pai was recently for talks in Berlin to hire for the position of the United States.
Chemical factory in Northern France Burns: Schools closed
In the night, residents hear explosions. A giant fire wall illuminates the sky over a northern French chemical factory. The fire has been extinguished for hours - the cleaning work could now take days.
After a fire in a chemical factory in the northern French city of Rouen on Thursday, the schools and children's skulls remain closed in the region.
In twelve municipalities the facilities would not be opened on Friday carefully, the competent prefecture was informed. The interior ministry had asked the citizens to stay in buildings as far as possible and not to stop smoking. The injured were not there. Farmers and farmers were called to bring their animals in, to protect their feed and to set up the crop first.
The fire could be completely removed on Thursday evening, as the prefecture reported. There is still the risk that after the removal smell spread, so the prefecture on Twitter. According to the prefecture, 240 firefighters and 90 policemen and gangsters were in use.
A giant black smoke column was previously set up from the chemical factory. French media reported on huge fires and explosions in the factory of Lubrizol, which produces additional oil. The production plant is a few kilometres from the city center.
The factory in Normandy belongs to the so-called Seveso category of dangerous sites that are particularly monitored. In the Italian Seveso near Milan, there was a devastating chemical accident in 1976.
The prefect of the Normandy region, Pierre-André Durand, told the messenger BFMTV that there was not first "high toxicity" found in samples. However, a pollution of its nearby sites could not be excluded. In the river, dust dams were built against pollution, the prefecture explained.
The fire broke out early in the morning at 02:40 p.m., the authorities reported. The cause remained unclear at first. Rouen is a regional metropolis and is located at its centre between Paris and the port city of Le Havre.
French Minister of Finance: "Germany needs to invest and now"
The French Minister for Economic and Financial Affairs, Bruno Le Maire, has called on Germany to invest more in order to boost economic growth in the euro area.
Germany needs to invest, and now the sooner the better," Le Maire said on Thursday evening when presenting the French budget for the next year.
The euro area economy is weakening, the Minister warned.
We must not wait until the economic situation gets worse in order to make the necessary decisions."
The countries that had the budget spaces for more investment had to act, Le Maire said, among other things, with a view to Germany.
France did not have these playgrounds, added the minister and referred to the high state debt of its country. It is more than 98 percent of the gross domestic product. French state debt must be "stabilized" and "satisfied", Le Maire said.
In recent years, more and more calls have been made to Germany to make more public investments to survive the European economy, and in contrast, German politicians have repeatedly called on France to overcome its budget deficit.
The French budget presented on Thursday for 2020 provides tax reliefs of more than nine billion euros for households.
As a result, the French government reacts, among other things, to the protests of the Gelbwest movement. The new debt should fall to 2.2 percent, as expected 3.1 percent this year.
Is he still trying to trick?: Johnson hesitates to ask about Brexit tactics
British Prime Minister Johnson criticises the strict "Capitulation Act" adopted by Parliament.
Parliament is back, a law tells the British prime minister to avoid a chaos-brixit, but critics fear that Boris Johnson could use another trap. However, the Tory politicians will not be able to talk about it.
The British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is concerned about whether he intends to implement an irregular Brexit - despite the last law passed by Parliament, which should prevent this.
The law provides that the government must apply for a transfer of the term of retirement should not reach an agreement with the EU by mid-October. Johnson criticises this as a "capitulation law", which makes it difficult to negotiate with the EU.
On Thursday, former British Prime Minister John Major had expressed his suspicion that Johnson could try to use "political shifts" in order to enforce the law. The Prime Minister could use a procedure that would delay the entry into force of the law after the EU's expulsion. Johnson said he was seeking a contract with the European Union. "We are confident to leave the EU on 31 October, and the best way is with an agreement".
As Johnson's Chief Adviser Dominic Cummings explained, he felt the political contradictions about Brexit as a "passing out in the park" and was confident that the EU-enforcement sought could still come: "We will enjoy what we will win, we will (cf. Red: from the EU), no concern," said Cummings of the British newspaper "Telegraph" in a book presentation.
Cummings, who led the Brexit campaign "Vote Leave" in the course of the 2016 election, is now acting as a leading player in the British government seat of Downing Street. He is to be behind the uncompromising policy that has led the prime minister to a rather elusive situation.
"The Polaroid Diaries" by Linda McCartney
Jimmy Hendrix, Bob Dylan or Janis Joplin - they all stood before Linda McCartney's camera, who became one of the very big rock photographers. But it doesn't always have to be the big glamour. The photo book "The Polaroid Diaries" (bags) dives deeply into the entire private world of the McCartney family.
Paul McCartney, who was married to Linda's death from 1969 to 1998, was obviously proud and touched when he presented the film band "The Polaroid Diaries" in mid-September at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. Ringo Starr, Stella McCartney, Olivia Harrison and Pretenders-Front Frau Chrisie Hynde were also present.
After the launch of the event, McCartney wrote at Instagram: "#ThePolaroidDiaries is a fleeting view of the life of an extraordinary family from the time before Instagram, a celebration to the memory of LindaMcCartney as an engaged artist and the instant magic of the Polaroid Film".
At Linda McCartney, who had studied the history of art at the University of Aizona until she found her photograph, the camera was always there. Thousands of polaroids made it, some hundred of them are now published for the first time in "The Polaroid Diaries".
There are portraits, still life, landscapes, several hamsters, a sheep in the kitchen and other interiors from the early 70s to the late 90s. "She wanted real moments," writes art critic Ekow Eshun in his preface. And of course there is still one in the middle: your husband Paul - as you may have never seen him before.
Then he dances with his daughter Mary on the shoulders, telephones in the bathroom with a cloth on her head or wears impenetrable moonboats. Sure, the McCartneys were an exceptional family, but on the other side of the lighthouse on her farm in southern England or Scotland also led a very normal life. So said Mary McCartney according to BBC that she had slept as a baby in a bed that had built her father from old potato boxes. And it has not always been cleaned up at McCartney's.
Like hardly any other medium, the Polaraid camera starts the immediate moment. The recordings of Linda McCartney are certainly a kind of family diary, but they are much more than just snapshots.
It's about the decisive click: you have to recognize when a great photo happens before you. And then you have to cut it in the right moment," said Paul McCartney. "If you cut two seconds later or two seconds earlier, it can be a completely different photo." And Linda had the gift always to get the right moment. "You knew she had it," said Paul in Eshun-Essay.
The light, the composition, the picture cut and the colors, which makes "The Polaroid Diaries" not only an entertainable image book for Beatles fans, but also in addition to all anecdotics, is a great aesthetic pleasure, where landscapes also seem like abstract paintings. The perfect addition to the newly posted Beatles album "Abbey Road", which appeared just 50 years ago.
"We will continue to buy oil and gas from Iran"
Turkey wants to import oil and gas from the neighbouring country despite the US sanctions imposed on Iran. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in an interview published on Friday that Turkey could not cancel imports of oil and gas from Iran.
We will continue to buy our natural gas from there," Erdogan said in New York, where he had participated in the UN summit.
Erdogan, however, pointed out that Turkey had problems importing Iranian petroleum, as some companies had 'retired because of the US fluctuations'.
Nevertheless, Turkey "will continue our relations with Iran in particular on this and in many other issues," said the Turkish President, who repeatedly criticized the US sanctions against Iran in the past.
Since their departure from the International Atomic Agreement with Iran, the United States has been pursuing a policy of "maximum pressure" against the Islamic Republic. According to the United States, Iran is pursuing a nuclear programme in secret and does not adhere to the agreement.
Their sanctions have led to the collapse of Iranian oil exports and a severe economic crisis in Iran. In the past months, the tensions in the Gulf region have intensified considerably.
U.S. government wants to restrict the admission of refugees
The U.S. government wants to restrict the admission of refugees dramatically. On Thursday, the U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that the annual ceiling for a new settlement programme should be reduced from 30 000 to 18,000 refugees. This is an average of 40 percent.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs explained that the United States would continue to be committed to supporting refugees. However, the most important task was to protect and serve US citizens.
In the future, the US government will focus on the inclusion of two refugee groups: people who are persecuted because of their faith - and Iraqis who have helped the US military in the country and thus have been at risk as from the statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
In the 1980 programme, refugees from UN stockpiles are selected worldwide and re-occupied in the United States. The ceiling of 18,000 refugees for the 2020 budget year would be the lowest in the programme's history. Already the current ceiling of 30,000 is a threshold. When US President Donald Trump, Barack Obama, the White House left, the figure was almost 85,000.
Helping organizations responded to the announced cut-off of the upper limit. "This is a very sad day for America," said the head of the International Rescue Committee, David Miliband. The United States would continue to harm its leadership in protecting the most vulnerable people in the world.
Trump tries to limit immigration to the United States - legally as illegal - strictly. The US government expects, according to its own data, 350,000 asylum applications for the coming financial year. These figures are separated from the New Zealand programme.
Donald Trump - "Getting Near a Spit"
U.S. President Donald Trump has taken note of a point in the Whistleblower affair of the spyage. Whoever has ever told the informant that he has misused his power has changed the evidence accordingly, "a bullet is coming close," said Trump, according to a record of a private event on Thursday in New York.
Then Trump spoke in front of the U.S. mission staff. When asked about the person who informed the whistleblower about the controversial events in the White House, he replied, "This is coming a little closer." Then Trump added, "Do you know what we did when we were in the old days? Right. The spies and traitors, we were forced to do something different than we were doing right now."
Observers took note of a possible appeal to the death penalty. The democracies had strong criticism of Trump's statements and offered him the fear of witnesses. It was also an attempt to prevent a congressional investigation into a possible recruitment procedure against him, the chairman of the Committees for Foreign Affairs, Secret Service and Supervisory at the House of Representatives wrote.
The Whistleblower calls on the President in a complaint that his office has now been abused in order to ask another country to join the U.S. elections in 2020. It is specifically about his controversial phone call with his Ukrainian official Wolodymyr Selensky in the summer: In the conversation, Trump brought him close to initiating investigations against his potential democratic challenge, Joe Biden and his son Hunter in Ukraine.
It is still unclear who the whistleblower is, as well as its informants, but, as the New York Times reports, it should be an analyst of the CIA's foreign secret service.
Flying boat known: Baby and Baby Drinking in Eggs
People are always trying to get over the Aegean Sea from Turkey to Greece. They regularly know the many small boats. At the bottom of a boat, seven migrants have now come to life - including five children.
In front of the Greek island of Chios, seven migrants were killed at the fall of a boat. Among the victims were a baby and four other children, reports the Greek Coast Guard. Four children, three women and five men were thus able to be rescued from the floods by occupying a passing ferry.
Among the victims was also to be a shutter, reported the local news portal of Chios, Alithia.gr. The migrants had broken up from Turkey in the morning. They had tried to reach the small island group Inouses in the north-east of Chios. Inouses is between Chios and the Turkish mainland.
Currently, hundreds of migrants from Turkey to the Greek islands in the east of the Aegean, mostly in many small boats, are on this route. Last year, according to the United Nations Refugee Relief Agency (UNHCR) 174 people died.
The Who Breaks Concert
A U.S. concert of the rock band The Who has found a year's end because of the incompetence of lead singer Roger Daltrey. In the middle of the afternoon (local time) in Houston, his voice lost its service. At eight songs, Daltrey said to the audience: "I think I should let it, as long as it's still running."
Lead-guitarist Pete Townsend apologized and added, Daltrey could "not really talk right now". The audience promised Townsend to come at a recovery concert at his expense. However, a date is not yet set.
For Fridays in Dallas and Sundays in Denver, The Who said that they should be followed at a later time. The 75-year-old Daltrey and his 74-year-old bandmate Townsend are the only founding members. The British cult band was formed 55 years ago.
Rent suddenly set: WeWork leaves real estate markets cittern
In New York, WeWork is the largest office owner.
Within a few years, WeWork will rise from the small startup to the most expensive real estate markets in the world. But now the company is in crisis. Owners must be afraid of billions of revenue.
The crisis of the office tenant WeWork threatens to disrupt the balance on the world's largest real estate markets. The company had set aside founder Adam Neumann a few days ago, moved the planned stock exchange and began selling subsidiaries and values like the private sector for the leadership in order to gain financial space for the coming weeks and months. Among other things, the British "Financial Times", WeWork has stopped the conclusion of new leases with immediate effect. Thus, among other things, in New York and London, the largest tenants of offices are suddenly from the market.
WeWork rents large office spaces in the long term and rents them in part in small units to members. This can be individual free-runs, small startups or entire departments of large groups. So far, WeWork burns money with this business at stunning speed. Last year, the company introduced a loss of 1.6 billion dollars, with a turnover of 1.8 billion dollars. In this year alone, the rental costs of new large areas will be increased to $2.5 billion. In order to limit the loss, the new company management will now bring the emergency brakes and the rentals of new areas with immediate effect.
According to the Financial Times, WeWork has now concluded lease agreements with periods of up to 15 years, from which commitments of more than 40 billion dollars are made. These huge commitments could not only become a problem for the company itself and its investors, but also for the whole of the real estate markets.
According to estimates of the economist Dan Alpert from Cornell Law School in New York, WeWork rented in Manhattan, one of the most expensive real estate markets in the world, in the past 24 months, nearly 300,000 square meters of office space. Only WeWorks' new contracts provided that the demand for offices in New York was greater than the areas that had come on the market at that time. Without WeWorks expansion would have increased the office vacancy in the U.S. metropolis at this time, as Alpert wrote in the business interior. Similarly, it looks like in London where WeWork currently operates several dozen offices in a better position.
Also in the UK capital, the balance on the real estate market could vary significantly without further expansion of the aggressive startup. Among other things, WeWork is the principal owner, in a recent year by the deka stock supplier, for an office house purchased in the centre of the financial metropolis for nearly 100 million euros.
Many tenants have converted their properties for WeWork's requirements with high investment. WeWork is thus able to make its business model profitable soon, the real estate owners would probably have to cancel part of the expected billion acquisitions. Access to WeWork's - without any button - reserves do not have them despite long-term rental contracts. Because the rental of WeWork's individual locations is usually carried out by individual extra-founded subsidiaries, called Special Purpose Vehicles, for which the parent company only has close limits.
Russia again captured numerous North Korean fishermen
The Russian Coast Guard has again taken action against North Korean fishermen. In the past days, another 262 wilders were arrested who had been illegally fishing in the waters, according to the agency Interfax, the Russian National Secret Service FSB reported on Friday.
Only ten days ago, 161 fishermen were arrested from North Korea. Before the border guards were shot and three of them were injured. This time there were no injured, it was called. Communist North Korea suffers from chronic food shortages.
The North Korean fishermen were therefore on their way in Russian high-level waters. There the Russian Coast Guard carries their own data to protect their multi-biological resources Patrols. During the new controls, 30,000 inkfish were discovered. In addition, the data were seized after three fishing boats and two motorboats and brought to Nachodka and Posjet at Wladivostok. According to the agency, the Coast Guard, in 2018, recorded more than 8,000 violations.
The Russian fishing authority had also issued no fishing licences to the North Koreans after the claims of domestic entrepreneurs. Thousands of North Korean fishermen have already been arrested in 2019.
The head of the association of Russian fishing companies in the remote Primorje region, Georgi Martynow, recently also complained about high environmental damage by the North Korean fishermen. They fished closely synthetic nets prohibited in Russia. These would also bring small creatures out of the sea. In addition, the nets would simply disappear in the sea, where they needed 200 years to be cut off. Even the ships themselves do not comply with the hygienic and technical rules.
During the pre-week arrests, according to Moscow, three members of the Russian Coast Guard were injured. Also, a wounded North Korean died as a result of his injuries, according to the FSB. On 17 September, Russian border guards first set up a North Korean boat and then a second after it opened the fire.
U.S. bounded entry ban against ex-President Castro
The United States has imposed bans on former Cuban President Raúl Castro and his children. The U.S. Ministry of Foreign Affairs based this on a communication on Thursday with Castro's participation in "gross human rights violations". As Head of the Communist Party of the Caribbean, he introduced a system in which thousands of Cubans would voluntarily be arrested and there were more than 100 political prisoners.
As president of the fighting forces, Fidel Castro, the brother of the dead revolutionary leader, was also guilty of human rights violations there by supporting the President of Venezuela, Nicolas Maduro. "The abuse of human rights and the use of violence by the Cuban regime to support the former Maduro regime are responsible for the ongoing crises in Cuba and Venezuela," said US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo.
President Donald Trump had spoken against members of the Venezuelan government and the military on Wednesday. In Venezuela, for months, he has fought a demanding power struggle between the government and the opposition. The United States has suspended a number of sanctions against the Maduros government to force him into the knees and to assist the opposition leader and self-appointed interim president Juan Guaidó.
Cuba is considered one of the closest to Maduros. The socialist Caribbean branch receives Venezuela Oil in exchange for the services sent to doctors. According to the US and the Venezuelan opposition, Cuba has also sent numerous secret service agents to Venezuela to assist the government in suppressing government opponents.
New Climate protests of Fridays for Future
A week after the largest international climate protests so far, thousands of people want to go on the road again.
At the end of an international climate week, Fridays for Future again plans action and promotions in dozens of countries around the world. New Zealand and Australia should begin because of the time shift before the protests move across Europe to North America. There, climate activists Greta Thunberg wanted to take part in a major campaign in Canada's Montreal.
How big the global commitment to this Friday will be after record participation of the week is relatively unclear. Thunberg itself was good things. "The last Friday has reached over four million people for the climate. This Friday we will do it again!", she wrote on Twitter. So far it has given in the framework of the strike week 6383 actions in 170 countries, she added.
Especially in Germany last Friday was a very big one last Friday. A good third of all world-wide demonstrators - around 1.4 million - had participated in the protests in 575 German cities according to Fridays for Future. This time, a list of the movement has been planned in at least 65 cities. Among them in Metropolis such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller municipalities and cities such as Jouch in North Rhine-Westphalia or Western Sylt, people want to go to the streets for the climate.
At the age of 15, Thunberg had set himself in front of the Swedish Parliament in August 2018 to call on the politicians of his country to make greater use of climate protection. Within a short time, the Fridays-for-future movement was created. In the climate protests, students and students are particularly involved, but to an increasing extent also scientists and other adults.
Together, they call for greater respect for politics in the fight against global warming and the threatening climate catastrophe. In particular, under the Paris Climate Agreement, global warming has to be reduced to less than 1.5 degrees compared to pre-industrial times.
Thunberg arrived almost a month ago after a two-week transatlantic tour with a high-sea rhino in New York, where she had recently participated in climate protests and summits of the United Nations. On Monday, she gave an emotional talk to the UN, in which she spoke strongly to the Heads of State and Government of the Earth. In her home in Stockholm, she was given her address on Wednesday for her use for more climate protection of the alternative Nobel Prize at the Right Livelhood Foundation.
Russia prohibits smoking on the balcony
The people in Russia will no longer be allowed to smoke on the balcony in the future. This is a change in fire protection. "This also applies to smoking," said a speaker from the Ministry of Emergency Affairs in Moscow on Thursday. The ban is to enter into force on 1 October.
Anyone who smokes, then, has to count with a fine of 3,000 rubles (42,46 Euros). If the cigarette is to be fired, the penalty will fall higher. Under the ban, the Ministry will also be charged with burning candles. Also, meat is allowed to be grilled on the balcony.
Battle against cybercriminals - Founder remove server
In the fight against Internet crime, German investigators have for the first time raised a large server for illegal business in the darknet.
A total of 13 workers are suspected of having hosted numerous websites in a former Nato-Bunker in Traben-Workach at the Mosel via the internationally acting criminals.
This was reported by the General Public Prosecutor in Koblenz. Seven suspects were arrested on Thursday night in a major action. The Darknet is a protected part of the Internet.
Customers of the suspects were to be the operators of the world's second-largest darknet market for drugs, "Wall Street Market", which destroyed the investigators in the spring. Also the attack on 1.25 million telecom routers at the end of November 2016 was controlled by a server in cyberbunker, according to the General Public Prosecutor.
For the first time, such a host was raised in Germany, it was called. A webhost provides the infrastructure for an internet presence.
In the access case with the support of special units such as the GSG9, there have been searches in Germany and neighbouring countries. It has been the result of almost five years of investigation. In the middle of the day, the investigators want to provide further details.
New global climate protests of Fridays for Future
A week after the largest international climate protests, thousands of people are going on the streets again for greater climate protection.
To complete an international climate week, the Fridays for Future movement is re-planting actions and services in dozens of countries around the world.
In Germany protests are planned in at least 65 cities, including metropolises such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cologne, but also in smaller municipalities and cities such as Jüchen in North Rhine-Westphalia or Westerland on Sylt. Climate activist Greta Thunberg wants to participate in a major event in Canadian Montreal.
Climate protests Who are Thunberg's rearmen?
The sense of justice and courage are high virtues, even in the 21st century, in a world full of war and smoking factories that warm the climate. So it's more surprising that a 16-year-old girl calculates the power of this time keeps the mirror in front of her nose. But what is behind it? Is it an aid preparation or smart marketing of a climate activist? Historical mastership or manipulative tactics for herself?
On the one hand, Greta Thunberg puts the masses in motion and brings young people up for a better climate-friendly world. It is not historically seen for the first time in Europe that a young man creates an assembly of children and young people for himself. In 1212, a child named Nikolaus from Cologne has chosen to use himself for a more righteous world. At that time, he has also had a share of young people who can win for himself and overcome it by crossing the sea to reach the Promised Land, like Greta Thunberg recently made his way to America with a sailboat.
But is there a shadow page about this? Why does it need a stock called "We don't have time" to save the world? Additionally, Greta Thunberg has rich PR manager on her side. In addition, her mother published a book that has sold itself widely thanks to the daughter standing in the light. Greta Thunberg's old-fashioned followers were also a little upset about the last PR show, or the trip with the boat was probably also set up by some followers. This is also not unfounded, because the action came very well in the media worldwide and it flows much money thanks to the imposing action.
Here the spirits are now separated: Is it morally right to enrich themselves financially when saving the world? Is it still authentic if certain people's circles work together with stock exchangers during the world's rescue action? At the same time, what position is the final point of view, a critical and reflective point of view is increasingly important in a democratic society, because democracy lives from different opinions and discussions. Therefore, it can make sense to ask critical questions about some trends set.
Comet Discovered: Interstellar Guest Crossed by Our Solar System
A strange comet crosses our solar system at the moment.
The suspicions of astronomers have confirmed: a strange comet crosses at the moment of our solar system - it is only the second of its kind.
Garching/Washington - Long the researchers have only suspected it, but now they have certainty: A comet from another star crosses our solar system at the moment. He was baptized after his discoverer 2I/Borisov and employs astronomers around the world.
2I/Borisov: Comet was discovered by amateur astronomers in Crimea
The said body was discovered by an amateur astronomer named Gennadi Borissow on the Crimea. He looked with a self-built telescope to heaven and further observations confirmed his first suspicion. In fact, it is an unknown comet that does not come from our solar system. He is only the second of his kind that was seen during the journey.
The great opportunity for astronomers is now to capture insights into a strange solar system. Obviously, the comet is similar to that of our own system, as reported by the Astrophysics Institute of the Canary Islands. The comet is, according to the International Astronomical Union (IAC) of clear interstellar origin and is currently moving on a so-called hyperbola path that takes it out of our system.
Comet has already been viewed before arrival - and can be observed for several months
But before it is so far, astronomers can observe it closely. Because, unlike his predecessor, 2I/Borisov has already been seen in his journey, which means that he can be examined from the earth for many months. "The object will reach the greatest brightness in mid-December and then be seen with medium-sized telescopes until April 2020," explains Davide Farnocchia from the US Space Agency Nasa. "Then it will only be observed with larger professional telescopes until October 2020".
The predecessor of the new visitor: 1I/2017 U1 "Ouumamua".
First knowledge about comet 2I/Borisov stir hopes in science
According to the first findings, the comet is estimated to be 2 to 16 kilometres in diameter. At the same time, the celestial bodies seem to be similar to our comets - because as IAC researcher Julia de León expresses it, the spectrum of the swimming star is similar to ours. This observation is close to that comets in other solar systems could form through similar processes as in our, complemented by Leon's colleague Javier Licandro.
The observation, however, goes beyond individual knowledge. The fact that two such objects have been discovered within just two years allows, under circumstances, a new way to explore certain processes in other solar systems.
Asteroids are constantly occupying the researchers. A giant asteroid just recently passed on to the earth and approached her dangerously.
"Absolutely Accruald": Rachel Johnson excited about brother
To Boris Johnson it will be more lonely. First his younger brother leaves the cabinet, now his sister, with clear words, swears the military language of the prime minister as "tasteless". It is not the brother she knows.
"Capitulation", "Betrug", contract": Prime Minister Boris Johnson is still under pressure and is still in charge of - at least verbal. At Question Time in the basement this Wednesday, it came to the massive encouragement of the opposition, and in the meantime, other critics have reported on the word: dozens of bishops and his own sister Rachel Johnson.
The well-known journalist and author told the sender Sky News that her brother used words like capitulation, as if the opponents of an EU-outright were "held, dragged, tortured, tortured and fed up" . She held this highly reprehensible. She did not recognize her brother's version again, said Rachel Johnsons, who had attended the elections to the EU Parliament for the Anti-Brexit Party "Change UK".
She was particularly concerned that her brother Jo Cox mentioned an EU-friendly under-house agent who had been murdered a few days before the 2016 Austrian referendum by a Neonazi. Their thoughts could best be respected by passing through the Brexit, Boris Johnson had said in the underhouse. "It is very tasteless to refer to an agent who was murdered by someone who called the 'British first', now criticised Johnson's sister. The father came out of the right-wing camp, which felt "through this kind of language". For all those who were concerned, it was very tasteless.
The widow of Cox also criticised the Prime Minister. "It makes me sick when Jos Name is used so," he tweeted. The best way to honor her is to be, if you are passionately and determined for what you believe - no matter what your views are. But you can never "demonize the other side". He also complained that an atmosphere was created, in the attacks became more likely.
Only a few weeks ago, Boris Johnson, younger brother Jo, had laid down his office as State Secretary and his term of office as Tory's deputy. "In the past months, I had broken between loyalty to the family and national interest - it is an unresolved tension," Jo Johnson reasoned on the step.
Johnson's language also stood in the church on sharp criticism. As the "Times" reports, all 118 bishops and archbishops of the Church of England criticise the language that "this country is not worthy of it". In a common state, they declared: "In the past days, the language, both in debates and outside Parliament, has not been acceptable. We should speak with respect."
Shakira and Jennifer Lopez join the Super Bowl
The NFL is a strong sign in the year of its 100-year-old existence: In the half-time show of the upcoming Super Bowl, two women come up with Latino roots. They promise "an explosion of fun and energy".
Latina power at the Super Bowl: The Superstars Shakira (42) and Jennifer Lopez (50) will deliver the half-time show at the upcoming U.S. Football League NFL. This was announced by the organizers on Thursday (Place Time).
"I feel incredibly honored and humiliated to represent the Latino community in addition to JLo, because it has an incredible strength in the USA," Shakira said in a video.
The final of the American football league, which celebrates its 100th birthday next year, takes place in Miami on February 2. In the metropolitan area of South Florida, many people live with Latin American roots. Shakira ("Waka Waka") comes from Colombia, Lopez ("On the Floor") is a Puerto Rican origin.
"I love that the Super Bowl puts two women on stage this time - and two Latinas," said Lopez. This sends an important message to all Americans and the world. It promises for the show "one explosion of fun and energy".
The 50-year-old was born in New York after her parents had been raised from Puerto Rico. In the 2000s she landed with songs such as "Waiting For Tonight" or "Let's Get Loud" and later released songs in Spanish. Lopez also works as an actor and is to be seen in the drama "Hustlers" in German cinemas since November.
Shakira was known in Colombia as the star of a telenovela and singer. Her worldwide breakthrough was created in 2001 with her first two-language album and the single "Wheever, Whereever".
In the United States, it is expected that half-time guests will get to know each time. In this year many people will also appreciate the choice as a political gesture. Finally, the country, not least through the immigration policy of President Donald Trump, is deeply divided.
The Super Bowl is the largest U.S. sports event and at the same time a giant commercial. Artists such as Justin Timberlake, Beyoncé, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Madonna, Bruno Mars and the Rolling Stones were there for Furore. Usually they look at over 100 million TV viewers at the NFL finale, it is also very popular in Germany.
Last year, there was political controversy in the area. The reason for the fight was the Quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who had refused to raise himself in protest against police violence against black people, while playing the national anthems, and for that reason, among other things, the US President Donald Trump was very hard. From solidarity with Kaepernick, some musicians had rejected a super-bowl performance - including Rihanna and Pink. The rock group Maroon 5 was finally criticised by many.
One actor and youtuber sets Egypt's ruler: First, Mohamed Ali remains rather abroad.
The two men who had the influence on whether blood flow back to the streets of Egypt have spent the past two weeks abroad. One of the two swimsmen was back at Cairo airport on Friday. President Abdelfattah al-Sisi returned from the UN General Assembly. The former General, who in 2013 arrested the first freely elected Head of State of Egypt, had spent a pleasant time in New York: US President Donald Trump had pledged his allegiance to political Islam and had lost no silver on human rights violations at the Nile - in a week in which the Egyptian security forces arrested hundreds of people, because they had waited for it, against the military.
In the Irish, this is what the president of the other man, who is currently determining the events on the streets. Mohamed Ali, of course, stayed abroad, where he would be deprived of access by security forces who would immediately arrest him when he tried to enter Egypt. Last week, the 45-year-old was known only to a minority of Egyptians. Today he is the leading voice that dominates the political discourse in the cafés, the living rooms and tea tubs of the country: With his Youtube channel "Mohamed's Secrets" Ali calls on his countrymen to raise against Sisi.
He goes to the head of the state directly and in a very rustic language. While the people are hungry, the president is fainting in luxury and let himself build beautiful new palaces, that is. The army leadership that Sisi is based on his rule rejects Ali corruption and division. Because he did exactly this business for 15 years in his second year as a builder, he seems to know exactly what he is talking about - at least the impression of many Egyptians, as the precisely exploding clicks show.
After last week, after Sisis arrested thousands of people after power, and almost 2000 citizens, including prominent figures from civil society, human rights lawyers and opposition politicians, were arrested, Ali called for a "million march" this Friday. That there would really be so many people on the streets, it was unlikely. But there was a single little protest, for example in Giseh at Cairo and in the town of Kina at Luxor. Videos showed protests that participants in the social media suspected of Al-Sisi corruption and demanded his departure. During these protests, the police also put in train gas and rubber boots. These videos did not initially allow themselves to be independently verified.
From the city of Mansura in the Nildelta, where demonstrators last week with the portrait of the President in pieces, massive police presence was reported on Friday. Security forces built checkpoints in the city and on the highways. In Cairo several subway stations in the city were closed because of "maintaining works", most roads around the Tahrir Square, the heart of the revolution of 2011 were blocked. And on the Raba Square, on which the supporters of the hardened Muslim brother Mursi crashed in 2013 until the army took them under fire and killed up to 800 people, another measure was to prevent unresolved: Sisi's future party wanted to count a large holding for the president.
Mohamed Ali caused these provisions to change his tactics: "Our goal must not be the Tahrir place," said Ali in Barcelona in his video camera. "Let us not meet with police officers."But as a returner, it was not to be understood: "A lot of Egypt is the Tahrir place".
If the provider promises too much performance
If the Internet connection is becoming much slower than purchased by the provider, there are various test options.
Those who conclude an Internet contract do not need to be blind to the speed data of the providers. Customers can check themselves for how much of it is actually achieved.
Finally, the promised transfer rates are a component of the contract and should therefore also be reached, the consumer central Bayern explains.
If the connection seems to be much slower than the supplier, there are various test options. Thus, the measuring tools of the Federal Network Agency (BNetzA) measure the actual data transmission rates and compare them with the rate agreed in the contract.
"However, the tests of the suppliers are carried out according to specific requirements and are therefore not uniform and objectively calculated," says the consumer central Bayern on their side.
If the connection is significantly slower than announced, customers can set a reasonable period of 14 days for the provider to produce the promised performance.
If this does nothing after multiple calls, customers can cancel and, under circumstances, also claim damages. However, in the remaining success, only the way will help.
First-rate Republicans for Investigation
"I think the investigation is important, yes, and where it comes from, it is determined by the facts that will be established," said Phil Scott at a press conference on Thursday. He wants to know more about the Whistleblower affair before measures - an impeachment procedure can lead to the suspension of the president.
Scott said he was not surprised by the findings that Trump repeatedly invited Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj to a phone call to investigate interventions of the democratic presidential candidate and former Vice-President Joe Biden in Ukraine.
Republicans have so far held back with criticism of Trump because of the Whistleblower affair; few have found distasteful. Scott's statements are a first sign of this in Trump's party. Scott, a moderate Republican, has already turned against Trump's policy, for example against the lockdown of environmental protection regulations and the strengthening of immigration rules.
Spider-Man Stays in MCU: Another Marvel film planned
It was a shock for all Spider-Man fans: At the end of August it was known that Sony and Marvel would go separate ways in the future. Tom Holland's Spider-Man would therefore not be a part of the "Avenger" universe. It was completely unclear how it should go on with the films around Tom Holland.
Now the surprise: Spider-Man receives another final third film within the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) after "Spider-Man: Homecoming" and "Spider-Man: Far From Home". This is a consistent report by several US media. The film should also be recorded: The film should start in the USA as of 16 July 2021.
The magazine "Screenant" quotes Marvel-Boos Kevin Feige as saying: "I am glad that Spiderys path will be carried on in the MCU. I and all of the Marvel studios are very pleased that we can work on it ... He is the only superhero with the ability to play in different universes as Sony continues to work on his Spidery version. You never know what the future will bring about."
But how does it come to the sudden good news? It is likely that Sony Marvel has submitted an offer. According to industry stores, Disney, which also belongs to Marvel, would participate by 30 percent in the revenues of coming Spider-Man films. However, the message is not confirmed.
That's how Duke Meghan and Prince Harry dive into the "suits" finals on
After nine staffs, the series "Suits" in the United States is now at the great finale. In the latter case, there were many happy endings and also many Cameo performances. And also the royal couple Prince Harry (35) and his Meghan (38), who had been involved in the series for many years, was dubbed in a charming way. Attention, the following sections include spoolers to the series finale.
One way: Herzogen Meghan did not come back in the final for a final divorce as Rachel Zane, at least not for new scenes. Instead, some views once again showed the most worthy scenes with today's Duke. For example, the moments of failed and lucky wedding with Mike or how she greets him after his imprisonment.
But also her true husband, Prince Harry, was mentioned in the "Suits" finals, of course, in a wedding scene. When Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman, 49) screams straight towards the altar to marry his beloved Sheila (Rachiel Harris, 51), Harvey Specter (Gabriel Power, 47) makes a remarkable remark about his suit. If he has actually given up a horror, the accused Harvey of the wedding will know only to note briefly: "Louis, you are not the Prince of England."
Eggs: Baby and four other children drink at boat luck
At the center of a refugee boat in the Aegean, a baby and four other children were drunk. In general, seven people died as the Greek Coast Guard announced on Friday. Nationalities are still unclear.
The boat fell near the Greek island of Inouses, which lies between the island of Chios and the Turkish mainland. Four children, three women and five men could be saved.
Currently, hundreds of migrants from Turkey move to the Greek islands east of the Aegean. Last year, according to the United Nations Refugee Relief Agency (UNHCR) 174 people died. Federal Minister Horst Seehofer has now announced that both countries will want to visit.
Together with his French colleague and the EU Commissioner responsible, he wants to "in Turkey to know how it is about the refugee situation," Seehofer said on Friday. He wants to learn more about the "administrative problems of the Greeks" in Athens in order to help with the management.
On Friday, a speaker from the EU Commission confirmed the planned voyage of Seahofers with EU Interior Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos and French Interior Minister Christophe Castaner.
In Greece, there are still unusually many migrants from Turkey. On Tuesday alone, 654 people moved to the Greek islands, called it from the Greek Civil Protection Ministry on Wednesday.
Does the Turkish deal still work?
The increased numbers have recently raised doubts about the functioning of the EU-Turkey Agreement concluded in 2016. This means that the EU can return all refugees and migrants who are illegally arriving on the Greek islands from Turkey. On the contrary, the EU wanted to take a Syrian refugee from Turkey for all the Syrian Syrians who were displaced.
However, the processing of asylum applications is only difficult because of the lack of staff on the Greek side. At Lesbos, Chios, Samos, Leros and Kos, according to the Ministry of Civil Protection, nearly 29 400 people are out. The worst is the situation in Lesbos: In a camp with capacity for 650 people, 5200 migrants are currently being detained.
Ever since the entry into force of the EU-Turkey Refugee Pact in March 2016, there have been so many, the state-run radio reported.
Climate change: heat leads to more heart disease
According to medical researchers, climate change will test the health system in the future. Climate change is "very safe" one of the biggest challenges for the health system in the next 20 to 50 years, Andreas Zeicher, president of the German Society for Cardiology. Especially the heart crisis system created high temperatures and high temperatures within a short period of time and led to heart disease.

Green politician has to respond because of painful photo panel
The leader of the Canadian Greens, Elizabeth May, in the election struggle - was manipulated for this reason by the becher?
The Canadian Green Chief holds a multi-way cup in his hand on a photo. But now he came out: the cup was manipulated.
Ottawa/Canada - It has been undetected for quite a long time - and finally it has happened. The reusable coffee cup with metal struhalm Elizabeth May, the head of the Canadian Greens, has never been held in hand. On the party's website she was on a photo with this cup, in conversation with citizens. However, the photo was already published and also distributed to the media - and there the cup was still a fast (Papp) cup, as reported by the Canadian National Post.
Green boss has to answer for photo panel
The National Post then proposed Manipulation and that the Fake News party produce more crediblely on the topic of "Environment Protection". And this in the middle of an election to the sub-house election, in which Trudeau is also becoming increasingly difficult because of an arrest scandal.
The photo went viral in the social media and caught the discussion about Fake News. A user shares a counter-translation of the photos and writes: "The Greens manipulate a photo of their presidents to hide their entrants".
May showed himself shocked and admired on her blog to have nothing to know about this action. To emphasize this, she just posted the original: she, in conversation with citizens, had a cup in her hand. However, she put it right from bamboo. She always told him. A speaker of the party said that it was just going to put partiilogo in the picture, and not to miss something. From the photo on the website is just another cut.
May writes, "I don't want to call him stupid, but there was nothing to hide," she said about the Guardian and agreed to some of her overcommitted team: "If they want to edit a picture again, then they couldn't do anything with my face, so I look younger?"
Even the German greens were shot because of their use of disposable plastics or because of the fluctuations in Shitstorms - their pictures were not photoshoped, however. So the head of the Bavarian greens, Katharina Schulze, on holiday ice with plastic bottles, as merkur.de* reported.
Influencer wants free upgrade: Lifelong flight ban at Cathay
Apparently, Jaqueline Ng per mail by Cathay Pacific was secured an upgrade. But when she asked for it at check-in, she could not board - and she should never fly with Cathay again.
Spontan get an upgrade for the business class - many of them dream of flying. Sometimes they are lucky, and the employees at the check-in offer a change from the economy class for free.
This case shows, however, how it should not be done: A self-declared influenceor has actively asked for a free upgrade. Follow the Instagram Jaqueline Ng more than 65,000 users. On May 30, she fled from Taiwan to New York and on June 7th.
On the run, Jaqueline staff refused an upgrade, although they had shown a mail in which their Cathay Pacific allegedly presented an upgrade. The letter wants to be received by an airline marketing employee. On the other hand, the airline accused Jaqueline of having faked the mail.
On the return trip, Jaqueline again tried to get an upgrade for the long-distance flight. This time the woman was supposed to have shown the same mail, but with another reference number. The employees at JFK Airport were skeptical: they hated at the center. In fact, the employee who allegedly came from the mail had challenged the mail contact with Jaqueline. This also confirmed the mail system in which the messages did not appear.
The Airline employees cancelled Jaqueline's ticket and suspended a lifetime flight with Cathay Pacific. For 1,400 US dollars (about 1,280 euros) she had to buy a new ticket to Taiwan.
In her case, the influencer turned to Elliot Advocacy, a company representing consumer interests. Because Cathay had paid her the price for her original ticket, Jaqueline also demanded the cost of the new ticket.
However, as long as Jaqueline does not submit the mail metadata, the case remains clear: For Cathay, the influencerin has committed fraud, it remains blocked for future flights. Airline’s business conditions also say that it does not have to pay for the new flight. Jaqueline does not want to be satisfied - and now activates a lawyer.
Oil prices according to a report on the status of weapons in Yemen
The oil prices fell by more than one dollar on Friday afternoon. Lastly, a barrel (159 litres) of the North Sea species Brent 61.83 US dollars - about 1.4 percent less than the previous day. The price for a barrel of the American species West Texas Intermediate (WTI) fell by 1.3 percent to $55.77.
The trigger for the course was a report by the Wall Street Journal on a ceasefire in Yemen. Saudi Arabia should have agreed to a ceasefire in four areas.
A Drone attack on oil plants in Saudi Arabia had led to a decrease of five percent of the world's oil production in mid-September. The Huthi rebels associated with Iran in the civil war in Yemen had advertised the attacks for themselves. Saudi Arabia is responsible for Iran as the US government is responsible for. A ceasefire would remove political tension in the region.
If there is a real agreement, you can focus on growth and demand, said Ole Hansen, head of the Department of Raw Material Strategy at the Saxo Bank of the Bloomberg News Agency.
The oil price continues its downward movement over the past few days. One week ago, a barrel of WTI oil had still cost up to nearly 59 dollars, and Brent had almost 65 dollars.
Finally, Bloomberg, calling insider, had reported that the repairs to oil plants in Saudi Arabia after the attack in mid-September were faster than expected. Thus, the production volume again reached a volume of eight million barrels per day and moved again towards the original amount.
Last, there were several press releases calling insiders that reported rapid progress by the state oil company Saudi Aramco in the repair work. However, raw material experts pointed out that Saudi Aramco is currently trying to avoid a stock exchange and negative hit lines.
At the same time, there was some relaxation in the conflict between Iran and the Western countries: the British oil tanker "Stena Impero" is more than two months after the arrest by Iran and the recently released release on the way to leave the port. The crew now prepares the departure, while the ship is still in front of the anchor, Riederichef Erik Hånell told the Swedish radio on Friday morning in a SMS.
However, the U.S. announced the deployment of defence missiles and soldiers to the Iranian enemy in Saudi Arabia. The fear of an escalation between the Islamic Republic and countries such as the U.S. and the United Kingdom had led the oil prices to a significant increase over the past few weeks.
Forecasts Against Trump Increased
In the case of possible abuse of power by US President Donald Trump, there have been setbacks against the White House. Several leading government officials have been working hard to prevent access to the vocabulary of the conversation after a telephone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selensky at the end of July. This explained an anonymous notifier. The speaker of the House of Representatives, Democratic Nancy Pelosi, put forward the White House with an explicit "disgusting". Trump spoke of a "Hexenjagd".
North Korea holds the third summit of Trump and Kim for Question
North Korea has no doubt that it will soon come to a third summit of power holders Kim Jong-un and U.S. President Donald Trump. The sense and prospects of such a meeting were questionable because of the lack of progress in implementing the first summit agreements in Singapore, said top diplomat Kim Kye-gwan on Friday, according to the Agency KCNA.
The United States had not done anything to implement the decisions of the summit in the previous year, the consultant of the North Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs said. He also criticised increased US sanctions and the joint military command of the United States and South Korea. However, he hoped for a "wise" and "muster" decision of Trump to bring it back to an approach.
Trump had said on Monday that he only wanted to know what a third summit meeting with Kim should bring before he would make it clear. Negotiations on the disarmament of the North Korean nuclear and missile programme have taken place since the failed second summit meeting of Trump and Kim in February in Hanoi. In June both met in the demilitarized zone between the two Korean states. They agreed to resume the consultations, but so far without great success.
Prince Harry: Wearers to help with mine clearance
With a blue splitter protection vest, British Prince Harry symbolically detonated and destroyed a sprinkling mine. Near a camp of British Hallo Trusts near the town of Dirico, he set up the closure circuit. In a safe distance, the sprinkling body exploded. In view of the goal of getting Angola to 2025 min free, he later called for a TV camera: "I call all the countries whose names are standing on these weapons, but which have not helped in the space to commit themselves to help".
Pounds under pressure - interest expected
British Pound Print
In view of a rapid reduction in the amount of the fund, the amount of the EUR will be lost.
Frankfurt speculations on the early interest rate of the Bank of England (BoE) adds to the Pound Sterling. The British currency was committed on Friday by up to 0.4 percent to $1,2269.
The sellers of the sales were statements by notenbanker Michael Saunders. This led to a decrease in the conversation, even if a chaotic Brexit could be removed, as the insurance would affect the British economy at an observable time. This statement was surprising, since Saunders considered as the proponent of a restrictive monetary policy, said analyst Ricardo Evangelista of the Brokerhaus ActivTrades.
Last week, the Bank of England had already pointed to the economic burden of the Brexit Hickhack without directly signaling a decline. Prime Minister Boris Johnson wanted to lead his country, without a divorce agreement, to the EU on 31 October.
More: With his provocations, the British Prime Minister took a high risk, but it could be paid for, says commercial editor Kerstin Leitel.
Doping: Show more Russian manipulations
Material from the Moscow Analytical Laboratory is manipulated - this confirms David Howman, a former director of the World Anticipating Agency (Wada) and today's Chief of Integrity of the Light Athletics Association.
In January 2019, the Moscow Doping Laboratory finally delivered the required samples from 2012 to 2015 to the World Anti-Tiping Agency (Wada). Now it appeared that they were faked.
In December 2014, there was a systematic deception in Russian sports. The Wada had shut down the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (Rusada) for three years. During this time, Russian athletes were not completely banned from the world stage. The International Olympic Committee read after an individual examination in the 2016 Summer Games in Rio about 270 athletes from the country under a neutral flag, while in the winter games in February 2018 there were 168 Russian athletes and athletes at the beginning. Also at the World Cups in the various sports, they were supposed to be in the summer, even the football WM with the host took place as a participant in Russia.
No positive results
In the following September, the Wada raised the Rusada band again, but asked for access to the laboratory and the said samples. The data should provide a summary of the extent of doping cases at the state doping. They should help to punish athletes and athletes subsequently. Three months later they were delivered to the final.
However, the president of the Independent Integrity Commission (IAU) of the Light Athletics Association (IAAF) has now confirmed that the doping data from the Moscow Analyse laboratory has been manipulated. "Yes. We have received the data nine months ago. We should check whether the Task Force has received the correct data," said David Howman in the interview of the "Frankfurter General News" on Friday. "We have identified a number of differences between the data that the Wada has received from a whistler, and those that they have received from the Russians in January." Many positive findings were not mentioned in the McLaren report.
Not affected by the WM
This confirms the attitude of the IAAF: The Light-Athletics Association holds as the only organization on the banner of Russia. At the WM in Doha, 30 Russian athletes start under a neutral flag. They had to prove that they were training outside the Russian system and undergoing tests.
At the beginning of this week, the Wada had already put the manipulations into space and asked Russia to respond to the proposals within three weeks. Russia now threatens the renewed spree of the Rusada and, in the worst case, also the exclusion of the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo.
