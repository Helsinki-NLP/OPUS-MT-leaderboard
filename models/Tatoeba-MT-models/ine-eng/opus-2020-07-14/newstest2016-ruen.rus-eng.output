The social map of the Ivanov Region is recognized by electronic means of payment.
The changes provide for the maintenance of a public passenger service.
With effect from 24 September, the arrangements for the voluntary travel of citizens through the social map of the Ivanov area have changed.
As reported by the Russian Government on Ivanov, the changes provide for the maintenance of public passenger transport opportunities and provide a social map calculation scheme in accordance with the requirements of Federal Law No. 161 of the FZ “On the national payment system”.
However, the social map of Ivanov is recognized by electronic means of payment.
Accordingly, the conditions for its application are changed.
Thus, the filling limit is now not established on trips, as before, but in cash, with winter and summer periods not more than 400 rubles, but not more than 800 rubles per month.
Now the holders of the social card on receipts will need to track not the number of travels left, but the balance of the money.
The cost of a comfortable trip for citizens will be 1/2 tariffs for the carrier.
The remaining half of the cost of the trip is reimbursed by the regional budget.
The timetable for filling the social map with money remains the same - from 24 per cent of the previous month to 23 per cent of the current month.
A new social map would have a number of advantages.
Thus, it is possible to have a detailed account of the spending of money on a social map with the accuracy of the copies.
In addition, there is an opportunity to return the assessed but unencumbered money.
Let us also add that the system of interconnections with carriers is becoming transparent, as now half of the cost of the journey is paid by citizens, and exactly the same amount is reimbursed by the carrier.
No commission will be charged on the cash map.
In turn, Vasili Silkin, deputy head of the Ivanov Road and Transport Department, reported that in 2014 more than 33 million social travel visits were made in the region, in 2015 almost 25 million visits were made.
In the area budget, more than 470 million rubles are provided for the benefit of citizens using a social card.
As at 1 September, the reimbursement amounted to over 312 million rubles.
During the call to 911, the teacher is recognized in the murder of a friend
During a 911 call, almost without a ride, the teacher of the Shannon Lamb train told the police that he had shot his friend and that he needed staff to come home.
Lamb stressed that there was a "pesik" in the house, who was alive, but probably upset, and said that contact with family members could be found on her phone.
Inside the house, the police found the body of Amy Prentiss and a note handwritten on the white sheet of the taped paper: "I'm very sorry, I wish I could all go back, I loved Amy, and she was the only woman who ever loved me," said the note, according to representatives of the body signed by Lamb.
Nothing indicated that Lamb, who conducted two online courses at the University of Delta in Cleveland, Mississippi, had by that time managed to attend a 300-mile university campus where the police believed he had shot all the respected history teacher of Ethan Schmidt at the threshold of his office.
The Chief of Police, Delta Linn Baford, reported that the university staff had learned about the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
He reported that Lamb made that real call in 911 shortly after that.
By the end of the day, the victims will have one more: Lamb died with him as soon as the police surrounded him.
The next day, after the shooting at the educational institution had forced students and teachers to hide behind closed doors, staff members were still trying to put in one picture the motive behind Lamba.
Information shared by investigators in both parts of the state, as well as by students and staff who knew it, helped to produce a talented, but possibly concerned, portrait.
The students told me that they were looking forward to his work.
The police in Gotia, where Prettiss was killed, reported that he was not charged with violence or criminal offences.
Schmidt himself included Lamba in his book, in which he expressed appreciation for the "beautiful people" with whom he had crossed into his teaching life.
They both taught social sciences and history, which includes 17 teachers, and many students attended the lessons of each other.
At the same time, there were some prerequisites for problems.
A student who called out about Lambe, Brandon Bevers, said he seemed nervous and nervous, "like something was wrong with him."
Another student, Michael Sykes, reported that Lamb had told him about how he struggled with stress at the end of the school year 2014-15.
Earlier Lamb asked Delta State University to grant him sick leave, said he had some health problems.
He taught only two online courses this year.
Recent changes in university rules of admission to work meant that the doctor’s degree over which Lamb had worked so hard would not guarantee him that he would be automatically assigned a teacher’s post.
The president of William Laford University reported that he knew nothing about the conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "evidently, Mr. Lamba had something on his mind."
These are questions that Lamb will no longer be able to answer.
The police attacked after Lamba escaped from the camp when he went back to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb was shot by a 38-calibre firearm in the back yard, one mile south of his parents ’ home in Greenville, Mississippi, told the coroner of Washington Metel Johnson.
His car with a working engine was still on the road.
Immediately it was impossible why Lamb came to this house, although, according to Johnson, she believed that he knew the people in it.
Lamb grew up in those corners.
Lamb began to work at a university of 3500 students in the city with a population of about 12,000 in 2009 and taught geography and pedagogical.
He received the degree of doctor of pedagogical science in the spring of the same year.
One of the former friends of Lamba described him as a smart, charismatic, and cheerful man.
Carla Harston told me that she was 15, and Lambu was 20 when they met through common friends.
She and her friends studied in high school, and he was a classmate, an older man who had been trying to teach her to play guitar for several years.
In those years, he enjoyed the success of women.
All the girls were lying when he was near," says Harston, now 40 and who lives in Jackson, Brandon's prize.
Lamb and Prentiss have been dating for some time.
At 911 Lamb's call, he said, "I killed my wife," but there's no record of their marriage.
The couple had a dog named Lithning, who lived with them in Goth in a Kyrpish house, whose back goes to the canal.
According to the police, the dog's fine.
Former husband Prentiss, Sean O'Stin, reported that they were divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends, and that they have a daughter who is now 19 years old.
"She's all too old," O'Stin told me about the daughter.
She and her mother were good friends.
O'Stin said he didn't meet Lamb, but he heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and playing blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail were both at one summer festival three years ago.
Then they played together from time to time at the concerts.
O'Stin told me his daughter wrote music and poetry.
Prentis was a nurse and worked online for different companies.
Mike Schaffer, a barman and a co-ordinator of entertainment programs in the forest-lit bar The Julep Room in Gote, said the last time he saw Lamb and Prentiss on the night of September 5th, when Lamb finished playing guitar and lost charm for a few visitors.
There was nothing suspicious about it.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We had fun and studied with each other.
In the sense that they were both very stubborn.
Schmidt, a dead teacher, held seminars for the first class and specialized in the history of indigenous Americans and colonial America, told Don Allan Mitchell, an English teacher in the same educational institution.
He was married, and he had three little children.
He studied at the University of Kansas, Emporia, and was president of the Student Brotherhood and Student Self-Government.
At the campus of Delta State University in Cleveland on Tuesday evening, about 900 people, including university teachers, staff, students and members of the community, participated in a memorial ceremony for the burning of candles.
The wife of Schmidt Liz and Brother Jeff Schmidt also attended the ceremony, during which the University choir sang Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
The activities will be resumed on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get our students back," said Laforz.
The crisis is gone.
This is a healing day.
Amy and Rohelio Solis report from Cleveland, Mississippi.
The report helped prepare the authors of Associated Press Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans.
The material was edited in connection with the police's statement that the call to Lamba was received in 911 after the murder of Schmidt, and that even though Lamb and spoke of Prentiss as his wife, when he called 911, there was no confirmation of their marriage.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer employees for the holiday season
Toys R Us announced that he would not hire as many staff for the holiday season as he did last year, while the children's toys and goods riders assured them that they would be able to work more hours for staff and temporary staff.
The company reported that it was planning to hire 40,000 people for work in shops and optical bases throughout the country, less than 45,000 who were hired for the 2014 holiday season.
Most jobs will be part-time.
The company reported that it would begin discussions with the claimants this month and would increase the number of staff from October to December.
Although a few months before the holidays, the purchase season is getting closer, and companies are ready to hire temporary staff to have enough state in stores and for the sale, unloading and delivery of goods.
Michael J. Fox's kidding about "welcome" with Princess Diana.
The premiere of the film "Back to the Future" proved to be a great event for Michael J. Fox.
She was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in a theater waiting for the arrival of the royal family, and I noticed that a place close to me was free, and here I was delighted to sit next to me, Princess Diana," he told the trailer to the documentary "Back in Time" screen.
The movie starts, and here I come in my head, that I'm literally out of hand and in a fake zepk from seeing Princess Welski.
"Back in Time" is a documentary on "Back in the Future" film, which includes an interview with Fox, Lee Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and executive producer Steven Spillberg.
The premiere of the film "Back to the Future" took place 30 years ago.
"For me," says Spielberg, "it's no doubt the biggest movie on travels at a time that's ever been taken away."
"Back in time" will be available on VOD, DVD and in some theaters in October.
UN head states that there is no military solution in Syria
The Secretary-General, Mr. Pan Ki-moon, responded to the Russian military support of Syria, that for almost five years the " military solution " was not available, and the increase in arms would only increase violence and suffering for millions of people.
The UN head again called on all participants, including the UN Security Council, to join and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Mr. Gi Moon stated to the press that he planned to meet with the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent members of the United States, Russia, China, the United Kingdom and France during the ministerial session of the General Assembly this month to discuss Syria.
He regretted that differences in the Council, as well as among the Syrian and the local authorities, had made the situation unresolved.
Mr. Gui Moon called on five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity that they had demonstrated in dealing with the nuclear programme on Iran and in dealing with the Syrian crisis.
8 survey results that show that Donald Tramp won't shoot
Some have tried to hang a proponent on him.
Others turned away from him, accepting it as a joke.
And some require scandals.
But no matter how some Republicans try to break the high position of Donald Tramp in the polls, they have failed.
Ten of the last 11 national surveys have demonstrated the advantages of Donald Tramp in two digits, and some have begun to ask seriously what this means for a magnet of real estate in terms of the chances of getting a nomination.
Of course, it's just the beginning of the electoral cycle.
None of this means that Tramp has a chance to be nominated by the Republican Party.
The experts point out that in 2011, Rick Perry replaced Germany's winning popularity with Germany Kane, none of which had won one state in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he would be fighting in the general election.
But external groups, such as Jeb Bush's Superintendent Political Activities Committee, and the Economic Conservative Club of Growth, recognize the unsatisfying force of Trump and begin to deliver their dollars to overthrow him.
Here are some of the polls that say that a magnet of real estate is not just an intermediate phase:
Trampa's performance ratings were 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Tramp announced his application in mid-June, a survey at Monmouth University showed that only two of the 10 republics had a positive impact on this magnet in the area of real estate.
By mid-July, it was 40 per cent.
In early August, it was 52 per cent.
Six of the 10 republics are now positive for Donald Tramp.
About three out of ten say they have a negative opinion.
And all of these indicators are at the top of the initial stages.
The Quinnipiac survey in Iowa last week found that 60 per cent of the Republics there had a positive impact on Trump.
Two thirds of those voting for the GOP would set up Trampo as a candidate.
In the CNN/ORC survey last week, 67 per cent of the Republicans said that they had either been "with the eve" or "satisfaction" if Tramp had become a candidate.
Only two out of 10 say they'd be "distorted" if he were a candidate.
Only Ben Carson generates about the same level of enthusiasm as Tramp (43 per cent say that they would be "warred" against 40 per cent of those who say the same about Tramp).
Next at the level of the spell?
Marco Rubio, which has only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 per cent of the Republicans say that they will be "unsatisfied" or "dissfied" if the Jeb Bush Foundation is approved as a candidate.
Most Republicans do not consider Trampa to be a problem.
While the Mass Trap is criticised for its impatience and insults, 52 per cent of voters from all over the country think that the magnet has a suitable temperature to be the president, as shown by the ABC News/Washington post poll held on Monday.
The same figure is found in the first closed congregation in the state of Iowa, where the same 52 per cent of the Republicans believe that he has the same person as the chief commander, according to Quinnipiac last week.
However, 44 per cent believe that he is not the person who can be effective at the post, and almost six out of 10 independent voters say that his temperature is not suitable for the White House, reports ABC/Post.
The Republican voters are accustomed to this idea.
When they put on their hats, the Republican voters think Tramp is serious.
On the question of which was the most likely winner of the GOP, four out of 10 said that Tramp was a favorite, according to the CNN/ORC survey last week.
It's not like four out of 10 were put on Jeb Bush at the end of July.
Full disclosure: The GOP voters did not have the right magic crystal before.
At the same time, in the past cycle, four of the 10 Republicans elected Rick Perry as the most likely candidate, while only 28 per cent supported possible candidate Mitt Romney.
However, this shows that many GOP voters consider the Trump campaign to be convincing.
Even if the Republicans were to split around another candidate, Tramp was still ahead of everyone else.
Some indications indicate that such a distribution is likely to benefit the Tramp, while non-Trampa are equally distributed among the more than ten other candidates.
But the survey conducted by the University of Monmouth in early September shows that in a hypothetical match between Trampo and most other Republican candidates, Tramp is almost always supported by the majority.
He runs Carli Fiorina at 13 points, Marco Rubio at 14 points, Walker at 15 points, Jeba Bush at 19 points, and finally Randa Paula, John Cassic and Chris Christi at 33 points.
He has nothing to do with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who surrounds him?
Ben Carson beat the businessmen for 19 points in the hypothetical competition "one by one".
And half of Donald Tramp's neighbors say they've changed their minds.
A new CBS/NYT survey, held Tuesday, shows that only half of the members supporting the Trump say they are confident in their votes.
Clearly, there is much that can happen and change the situation, and no one can really say that he will never change his mind.
46 per cent say they leave the door open for other candidates.
However, the most intense competition in Trump at the moment is with a colleague-outsider neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they've rethinked will probably choose Trump.
Six of the 10 Republicans say they agree with Trampo on immigration.
Since Donald Tramp two months ago called immigrants from Mexico "violents" in his opening speech, the topic of immigration became the most relevant topic in the 2016 talks.
Some are concerned that the Trampa Valley will turn the key voters of Latin American origin from the Republican Party and prevent rebranding.
However, according to the ABC/Post survey conducted on Monday, six of the 10 Republicans said they agreed with Trampo on immigration.
Therefore, until immigration attracts universal attention, Donald Tramp seems to remain in the same position.
Disappointment by the Government has taken on new developments.
Donald Tramp and Ben Carson are now looking to support about half of the Republican voters, mainly because of their status as outsiders.
Six of the 10 Republicans said on Monday a new ABC/Post survey that they wanted a political outsider rather than a man with experience in government.
And they're also injured in Washington.
The survey of Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago shows that three of the four Republicans in Iowa are disappointed by the activities of the Congress, with 54 per cent being “unsatisfied”, and 21 per cent being “in anger”.
The Government will decide on the fate of the pension indexes in October.
Deputy Prime Minister Olga Golodeck stated that the Government is now looking for options to implement the Pension Index Act in 2016 to be effective in inflation, the GG.
She noted that the decision should be made by 8 October at the time of the next year's implementation of the draft budget to the Government.
The cabin also discussed the option of extending the decision to freeze the Russian savings pension.
The hungry noted that the amount of pension deposits amounted to 350 billion rubles.
The total pension index for the following year is approximately the same.
According to the Deputy Prime Minister, there is still no final decision on the question of who should pay contributions for non-workers.
A hungry person believes that if a person does not work on his own initiative and does not belong to socially unprotected categories of citizens, it is not quite fair that he will be paid for by society.
The media had previously reported that the cab had two options for balancing the budget.
Why are they often angry and red - colored?
Dr. Ophthalmologist Tatian Levashova answers:
Our ages are wide, protecting the eyelid from the many small particles that are sitting on them.
As we forget about the regular cleansing of the centuries, we often contribute to the development of bluff.
Simple output:
Not three eyes with dirty hands, you wear a special wet hat for centuries;
Not less than 1-2 times a day clean the end of the century from those stored in them for the day of harmful substances.
The cleaning procedures shall not be supplemented by warm compresses with the openings of the healing grass (salves, romach) that exhales the thick secret of the salt iron and then by the massage of the ends of the centuries, which should be carried out by the circular movements of the fingertips;
Don't use alcohol.
They dry and decompose the skin and further enhance the secret of salt iron.
Phanyan claims that the Korean nuclearists have created an atomic warhead.
The North Korean authorities reported that the main nuclear reactor in the country, the nuclear complex in Jonbene, is “full-power”.
A communication was made on the website of the Central Telegraph Agency of the country.
It is noted that at any time, the DPRK is ready to respond to “aggression and nuclear threat” and that the country has improved its nuclear weapons “in both quantity and quality”.
The last nuclear test was carried out by the North Korean authorities in 2013.
However, plans have not yet been reported for the resumption of the reactor ' s full-time work.
Phanyan claims that he was able to create an atomic warhead.
In addition, the DPRK has repeatedly tested mid- and short-range missiles, writes polit.ru.
Girinovski needed to remove the mention of brothers from the Russian gymnasium.
Leader of LDPR Vladimir Girinovski believes that the mention of the association of the brothers should be removed from the national gym.
He said that during the Gosduma meeting, he reported on the Russian news service.
Who are these peoples now?
Fascists and murderers!
"A very long gymnastics, the longest in the world, even sportsmen don't support," Girinovski said.
The deputy believes that all four categories of the line should be removed:
In the summer of 2014, Girinovski stated that the current gym needs to be changed to "God, King of Food", and the Russian tricolor to replace the imperial flag, writes Polit.ru.
Assad urged all the forces to unite in the fight against terrorism.
Syrian President Bashar Assad urged all forces to join in the fight against terrorism.
Assad is confident that if Europe wants to deal with the problem of refugees, they must stop supporting terrorists in the Middle East.
The issue is not that Europe accepts or does not accept refugees, but that the first causes of the problem need to be addressed.
If Europeans are concerned about the fate of refugees, let them stop supporting terrorists.
It's our opinion on this problem.
"This is the issue of refugees," he said in an interview with RT.
We must continue to dialogue in the name of consensus.
However, if we want real success, they are not possible until people die while the bloodshed continues and people do not feel safe.
"So, we can reach consensus, but we can't achieve anything until we win terrorism in Syria," Assad stressed.
It is recalled that some 500 thousand migrants, including those from Syria, arrived in the euro area this year.
The European Commission has stated that the current migration crisis in the world is the largest since World War II.
It has not been ruled out that there may be thousands of fighters of the extremist group, the Islamic State.
Members of a terrorist organization prohibited in Russia can use the situation to create their own cells in the EU to conduct terrorist activities.
The people of the German city set up a holiday for refugees.
In the last month, Germany had become a refugee leader, although it had recently strengthened border control to keep them in touch.
According to the authorities, some 800 thousand migrants will arrive in Germany by the end of this year, although some experts call it a very large number.
Since the beginning of September, more than 90,000 refugees have arrived in the country.
A bi-bi-si correspondent, Jenny Hill, was in Darmstadt, a city whose inhabitants offer migrants a very warm welcome.
Jeremy Corbin debuts in the session of the Prime Minister
Following the election of Mr. Corbin, his debut at the session of the Prime Minister ' s questions was expected with great anticipation.
The new leader of the Leborist Party, Jeremy Corbin, will soon be speaking for the first time at the Prime Minister's session, with David Cameron for the first time.
Mr. Corbin will address the first of the six issues raised in the second half of the day; his statement will probably be closely monitored by the press and members of the Parliament of the Lao People ' s Party.
He called for a "less theatre and more facts" on a weekly demonstration.
He also stated that some meetings could be missed by leaving them to their colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary test by Mr. Corbin as a leader; it will take place after his appointment of a tenure office and his words at the annual Congress of Trade Unions on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the decision of the leader of the lobbyists to stand silent during the national service gym on Tuesday, during the 75th anniversary of the British Battle, sparked criticism by a number of Conservative Members of Parliament and became the subject of several articles of excellence in newspapers.
Mr. Corbin ' s decision not to be a public gymnast drew attention to
Mr. Corbin's Press Secretary stated that he was “standin’ a good silence” and acknowledged “Kingdom VVP’s heroism in Battle for Britain”.
However, a member of Mr. Corbin Owen Smith's office reported to BBC 2 Newsnight that he would advise the leader of the labyrinth of the National Gymnnam "independent" from his belief that the monarchy was to be abolished.
Almost a dozen Ten Ministers refused to play in Mr. Corbin's team, sounding differences in economic, defence and international policy, while less than one sixth of the parliamentary party supported him as leader.
Political correspondent BBC Robin Brant said that political differences were also "coppered" in the team of Laborist after Mr. Corbin was appointed as a post in the European Union and the Government limited compensation payments.
Mr. Corbin said at the Trade Unions Conference that the Labour Party had made amendments aimed at eliminating the very idea of restrictions in general.
A few hours later, Mr. Smith, the Minister of Labour and Pensions, said that there was “full clarity” in the party, because it was opposed only to Government plans to reduce the ceiling from 26,000 pounds to 23,000 pounds.
Mr. Corbin will become the fifth leader of the lobbyists, with whom David Cameron will meet at the "Course Box" in the last ten years since he became the leader of the Conservative Party.
The leader of the Libyans, promising a different approach to politics, said that he had “drawed collective resources” to raise Mr. Cameron's questions and received more than 30,000 proposals.
A member of Parliament from the Islandton North District said that the Prime Minister's issues were causing excessive confrontation, and that he would also refrain from disproportionate responses and the exchange of amounts, instead promising to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and problems facing young people.
Mr. Corbin said that Angela Igle, the Minister of Economic Affairs in the tennis cabinet, would place him on prime minister issues when he was not present - for example, when Mr. Cameron was on the border.
He also sounded the idea of allowing other colleagues to take the floor if possible, saying that he was addressing the Speaker of the House of Commons John Berkou to discuss the matter.
As a leader in 2005, Mr. Cameron said he wanted to leave the political style of the "warm belay", often associated with the Prime Minister's procedure, but admitted that he had failed several years later.
Since the first broadcast in 1990, the Prime Minister's questions have been a key indicator of the leadership's views, their ability to manage the House of Commons and their reputation with other Members of Parliament, although criticisms have claimed that it has become a cartoon and requires major reforms.

Pound sterling grows as wages grow in Britain
The FTSE 100 index was raised by the SABMiller purchase proposal.
From May to June, UK earnings, excluding bonuses, increased by 2.9 per cent compared to the same period last year.
The growth rate has been as high since 2009, and it has been seen as a transfer to an earlier period of forecast for possible quota growth.
The sterling pound increased by more than 1 per cent compared to the dollar and amounted to $1,5505 and 0.84 per cent compared to the euro by €1,3730.
The FTSE 100 index grew to 6229.21 by 1.49%.
In general, SABMiller's shares, which grew by 20 per cent, were allocated to the purchase proposal made by the AB InBev competitor.
The deal would unite two world-renowned brewing companies with brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
The Burberry shares increased by 0.9 per cent in the light of the encouraging news from the competing Lux Richemont product group.
The latest sales data in Richemont exceeded all expectations and showed that sales in China - in the key market for Burberry - began to grow again.
Glencore's shares increased by 5 per cent after the mining giant stated that it was able to receive $2.5 billion through the allocation of shares, which was made in the debt reduction strategy.
Mondi's paper production and packaging team was the leader of a drop in index - 4.3 per cent after Goldman Sachs reduced the rating of the group to "sale".
JD Sports' shares grew after the sports clothing supplier reported an increase of 83 per cent to a half-year tax of up to 46.6 million pounds.
Chief JD Sports says higher wages can prevent the cost
The executive director of JD Sports Peter Caugill says that raising the minimum wage for British workers means "greater purchasing capacity for potential consumers".
But it is unlikely that such purchasing capacity will outweigh the increase in labour costs, he says.
Costs could affect JD Sports expansion plans, he added that could mean a reduction in the number of additional vacancies.
Metcash launches a low-level campaign to combat Aldi's pressure
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA stores from Aldi's pressure in South Australia and Western Australia.
The leading supplier of low-level food has launched a campaign to protect the market share of IGA Riddlers in South Australia and West Australia in the light of the upcoming influence of Aldi $700 million.
While Aldi is preparing to open two optical warehouses and the first 120 shops in South and West Australia in the beginning of next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen relationships with local food suppliers and promote IGA brand through marketing in leading media and social media and Adelaide Show.
The campaign is accompanied by riders and IGA suppliers, such as the manufacturer of frozen Simmo's from Dansboro, who offers tastings in IGA shops, and store owners selling low-permanent tickets to match the South Australia Football League.
Metcash is expected to expand its strategy of protection on 29 September, the day when this optical supplier of food, alcoholic beverages and industrial goods will conduct its annual investor strategy day.
There was little to be done, as in South Australia and Western Australia, IGA markets account for almost 30 per cent of all Metcash shops and show higher profitability than the Metcash IGA network in the eastern states.
Buyers in South and West Australia are known as regular routes, so the market here is more favourable for IGA riders than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland, more than 30 per cent in the US and 24 per cent in WA than in about 14 per cent in Eastern states.
However, analysts, such as Morgan Stanley, believe that Aldi will grant 5 per cent of the food market in these two states for 12 months after the opening of its first shops, taking the volume of sales to all the players present, but mainly to independent riders.
In a report published this week, Tom Kirat, analyst Morgan Stanley, believes that IGA rhythmians may lose $300 million a year and Metcash is $250 million by the end of 2016.
The forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA, with sales of $500 million and $600 million in these markets respectively.
The loss of profits and sales of food at the high level of the constant cost of Metcash may cost companies about 13 million dollars before payment of interest and taxes, Mr. Kirat said.
At the same time, Metcash loses its share of the market in the eastern states, mainly because of Aldi and Coles, and this is because the recent study by Morgan Survey found that IGA had the most loyal buyers.
Morgan Stanley believes that Metcash's food sales will fall by 3.8 per cent in 2016, 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018, reducing the company's market share from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3 per cent by 2020.
Last week, the fund manager, Hamish Douglas, founder of the Magellan Financial Group, observed that during the business lunch in Melbourne, Metcash " could be very likely to disappear for decades.
Metcash refused to comment publicly on Mr. Douglas' comments.
But it is assumed that a member of the board of directors of Metcash contacted Mr. Douglas last week.
The share of IGA on the market decreased from 18 to 14 per cent from 2010 and Metcash's revenues from the food business, which the company supplies to some 1200 IGA Riddlers, fell by 43 per cent compared to 2012 as a result of an operating delegation and due to sales and profitability pressure.
However, the company does not provide more than $150 million a year to compare prices differentials with prices in Coles and Woolworths at thousands of positions per week and to help IGA rhytheaters in the restructuring of trading venues, as well as to offer a rapidly expanding range of fresh products and a wider choice of food business products.
Director-General Metcash Ien Morris said that the price adjustment and the refurbishment of the trading venues was taking place and hoped that the company would increase net income in 2017, for the first time in four years.
Tanasi Kokkinakis supports President Dennis Australia Steve Hilly
Tanasi Kokkinakis deserves a start, not a criticism of his behavior.
Tanasi Kokkinakis has been brutally injured in a recent scandal about his friend Nick Kiryos and deserves more than criticism, says President Dennis Australia Steve Hilly.
Kokkinakis, a young man in a talented duet and often called "Special Ks", was not at the centre of his attention due to Kiryos' postage with Stan Wavrinky on the Montreal Masters tournament.
Soon thereafter, during a hot qualifying match in Cincinnati, the judge had to understand Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison twice, while Harrison said, "The crow had to be placed on Kiryos' shovels, and I had to be put on the shovels of this guy."
C, while Kokkinakis last saw a cracking rocket after the shipman in his leg rescued Richard Gaske from possible defeat at the US Open, Hilly loyally protects Kokkinakis.
The youth is currently in Glasgow, competing with Sam Grott for the right to be the second after Bernard Tomich in a single level in the semifinal of Cube Davis against Britain.
"I'm very concerned about one thing, that's what Tanasi got into the conflict," Hilly said.
He actually broke a rocket when he was wearing his leg at the US Open, but he wasn't the first game that broke the missile when the hopes went down, and I know Tanasi pretty well enough to be sure he wouldn't be proud of it.
But in fact, he was very well in a rather provocative situation in the US, with Harrison and so on, and I'm sure he deserves trust.
He's surrounded by a great team, he's got a beautiful family, and I just think they've been a little dishonest with him.
He's a very mature 19-year-old, he's a lot of work, he's very good at the team, he's never had any problems with other players, he's respected outside the court, he's intensively trained, he's in excellent shape, he's a very talented and advanced young man, and I think he should be valued for dignity.
Hilly also supported the decision to forgive Kiryos for an important match starting on Friday, believing that "common agreement" was the right way out for all, but expecting that the guy from Canberra would return to the team as a long-term game.
"First of all, we want the team to focus entirely on the match, not on the fights around [Cyros]," Hilly said.
And I think Nick took power very quickly to prove the people like Feder and Marrey, he's growing up in the audience, he's allowed some serious mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we're trying to help him realize the consequences of his actions, and I think it's necessary to get him out of the center for a while so he can think about them, and that's best for the team and best for him.
Migration crisis in Europe: Hungary announces an emergency, closes the border, detains migrants
With the announcement of an emergency situation, Hungary crossed the border with Serbia on Tuesday at the southern border and detained those who were trying to enter the country illegally to keep the flow of migrants flowing in.
On the border there were riots - hundreds of migrants dug in the border territory, which were severely negative by the Serbian authorities.
It delayed for an indefinite period on the road between the checkpoints of two countries, people fleeing armed violence to their families broke down the palaces and were based on that location.
However, dissatisfaction has grown.
When they were surrounded by a police helicopter, migrants shouted, "Open the border!" and shouted insults at the Hungarian police for a special appointment.
Some in protest refused food and water.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of Serbia announced an "inadmissible" expulsion of migrants back from Hungary when they are increasingly arriving from Macedonia and Greece.
Serbia wants to be part of a solution rather than a side-by-side solution.
The negotiations with Brussels and other countries need to be held in the next few days," Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
The Hungarian-Serbian border elections began the next day after the 28-nation bloc could not develop a common immigration policy at a joint meeting in Brussels.
The Ministers agreed to hold 40,000 asylum-seekers in overcrowded Italy and Greece in common responsibility and expressed the hope that an agreement would be reached in the future (in the next month or by the end of the year) that the Member States of the European Union would receive another 120,000 refugees, including refugees from Hungary.
The Chancellor of Germany, Angela Merkel and Austria, on Tuesday, demanded to meet at the next week's Euros Union Extraordinary Summit to discuss the immigration crisis that covered the continent.
Hungary, however, does not look forward to early action by Brussels or its neighbours.
On Tuesday, an emergency situation in the two southern regions gave the authorities more power to take action against the crisis, allowing them to cross the roads and speed up the judicial process of granting asylum.
Meanwhile, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Hungary, Peter Seyarto, said that his country was also planning to take a strike from the knee gap at the border with Romania to cover the flow of migrants across the country, now that it had ended the strike on the Serbian border.
Correspondent CBS News Charlie Dagata reported that even prisoners were involved in urgent work to complete the strike from the collapsing gap between Hungary and Serbia.
In the last few months, Hungary has become the main "closest place" and the border crossing of the Euros Union for displaced persons, many of whom are refugees of war in Syria and countries in the Middle East.
However, the Prime Minister of the country, Victor Orban, insists that most of the people coming to the country are economic migrants seeking a better life, not refugees who are victims of war who have the right to protection, and this view is strongly divided with the views of other EU countries, i.e. Germany.
New laws in force in Hungary are now considered to be a crime of cutting or damaging a 4-metre (13-foot) roll-over from a coarse line constructed by the Government along the southern border with Serbia, and include longer prison terms for the accused of trafficking.
"Because of the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian Government is declaring an emergency," a representative of the Zoltan Kovac Government in the southern city of Seged told reporters.
We clearly understand that the illegal crossing of the border is a crime.
The formal parliament still has to authorize the deployment of military forces, which is expected next week, but the reporters of Associated Press who are on the border have been observing the presence of armed men with vehicle and dog teeth for several days.
Derdy Bacondi, the National Security Council of Orban, reported on the appointment of 45 persons authorized by the authorities to cross the border at the very border, and 15 others within the country.
They have crossed the border by breaking the line and are currently under police custody and are accused of administrative violations under new laws.
The authorities are quickly recovering the damage.
The Hungarian authorities also closed two out of seven crossings at the border with Serbia on Tuesday morning, pushing to block one of the crossings a railway wagon surrounded by a wheeled spring.
The riots set off at the main crossing of the border near the city of Ryoske (Hungary), as the Hungarians placed a service room for the passage of people inside the metal container, and crowds of people were crammed into each other to break in.
There were about 20 people to enter, and thousands of people stayed outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main highway leading from Serbia to Hungary and announced refusal of food and water until they were missed in Hungary.
Elections 2016: Hillary Clinton's advantage over Bernard Sanders has been reduced twice in the national survey
Former Secretary Hillary Clinton continues to hold a two-way victory for the country's nomination of Democrats, but Senator Bernie Sanders is pursuing it.
Clinton now has 47 per cent support among the primary democratic voters (down from 58 per cent) and Sanders is the second 27 per cent (up from 17 per cent).
Vice-President Joe Baiden, who has not yet announced whether he is going to participate in the presidential race, is supported by 15 per cent of the primary democratic voters.
In more than five months before the start of the competition in the primary elections, the majority of Democratic voters said that they were still too early to say that they had been identified with the candidate to be supported.
Clinton's participants are more confident in their choice than in supporting other candidates.
Since the CBS News survey last month, Clinton has lost support for some demographic groups, and Sanders has achieved some bonuses.
Clinton maintains a great advantage among women and the moderate, but this advantage has been reduced.
Her support among men had fallen significantly, and Sanders had left it at only 5 points.
The preference given to Clinton as a democratic electorate for up to 50 years has disappeared, and they and Sanders are now at the same level.
However, Clinton still has a great advantage among senior voters.
In the past month, Clinton attacked Sanders for a double number of liberals, but Sanders now has the advantage of 5 points in this group.
Almost half of the primary democratic voters throughout the country say that they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she became a candidate for this party.
A quarter would support her with some reservations, and another 15 per cent would support her only because she was a candidate.
Six per cent would not support it.
It may not be surprising that Clinton's current supporters are likely to be more enthusiastic about her.
Among those who do not currently support Clinton, the view is more contradictory - only about a quarter with enthusiasm would support her.
Then, as 48 per cent of the primary democratic voters say that they would enthusiastically support Clinton, a smaller number of Republican voters speak the same thing about their leader, Donald Trampe (35 per cent).
When Clinton's supporters are asked an open question, why they want to see her candidate, the most popular answer is that she has the necessary experience (16 per cent), then that she is now a female president (13 per cent) and that she is the best candidate for that post (10 per cent).
Also, Clinton's supporters are talking about an association linking it to Bill Clinton (9 per cent).
It is also called an agreement on issues and opportunities for election.
Since the Vice-President is considering potential election participation, 57 per cent of the primary Democratic electorate would like him to join the race, although the third feels he should not.
When asked who they wanted to see in the second place among the candidates from the party, the primary democratic voters in most cases called Baiden.
In the midst of Clinton's supporters, they say they'd choose Baiden second, that's more than Sanders.
If Baden decides not to present his candidacy from the Democratic Party, Hillary Clinton's advantage over Sanders will increase from 20 points with Baden among the race participants to 30 points without him.
Fifty-five per cent of the Democratic electorate see Clinton as a candidate with the best chance of winning the general election; but this figure decreased by 78 per cent last month.
Byyden has a high drop in second place, but the percentage of those who consider him to be the most likely candidate has increased.
However, in response to the question that is most important in the candidate, democratic voters choose options other than the opportunity to be elected.
Similar to last month's situation, none of the candidates from democracy or potential candidates is an unacceptable nominee for those primary voters.
Democratic candidates, or potential candidates, have shown good results in some of the key characteristics of primary voters from their party.
Most consider Clinton, Sanders and Baiden to be honest and trustworthy people with good leadership.
Byyden of all three leads in honesty, and the strong side of Clinton's leadership.
Thirty per cent of the primary democratic voters do not consider Clinton to be honest and trustworthy, twice as much as those who say the same about Sanders (15 per cent), but 27 per cent do not have a certain opinion on him.
The primary democratic voters are also generally considered to be similar ideological views to Clinton, Sanders and Baiden.
According to all these measures, about four democratic voters do not have any opinion about Sanders.
While questions concerning the personal e-mail box and the server at Hillary Clinton continue to be in her capacity as Secretary-General, most primary democratic voters are satisfied with her explanation and believe that this has not adversely affected their general view of her.
But it's a completely different story for the American public in general.
Half Americans today are not satisfied with her explanation, and only about a third are satisfied.
The public’s views on this matter were further divided in March, shortly after the story became known.
Most Americans say that the debate on e-mail had no effect on their general opinion on Clinton, although 36 per cent said that their views on e-mail had deteriorated.
They are mostly Republicans, more than six out of every 10 who claim that their opinion of Clinton has deteriorated.
Even though Clinton was considered an honest and credible voter from her party, it continued to be a problem for her among registered voters in general: only 32 per cent considered her honest and trustworthy, at eight points below last month, and at 15 compared to May.
Sixty-two per cent of registered voters do not consider it to be honest and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55 registered voters throughout the country do not consider the Trump to be honest and trustworthy.
Clinton and Tramp both, however, receive good marks on leadership.
Of the six tested candidates, Baden, Carson and Bush show the best result in honesty.
Most people in Sanders see a more honest person than they do, but like Carson, many have no idea about him.
The sampling margin of 351 primary Democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
As a result of Ben Carson ' s national survey, he approached Donald Trampo.
Ben Carson's report to Donald Tramp on the latest CBS/New York Times survey
The two candidates took half of the voters in the new poll, leaving all the others in search of support under their feet.
The country-wide voters continue to support the Trump, which increased by 23 per cent in the recent CBS survey conducted prior to the Fox News debate last month, to 27 per cent in the Tuesday survey.
But Carson flew for the same period from 6% to 23%.
The survey also showed that Carson was supported by all demographic groups, focusing on the Trump group of top-level voters.
The remaining candidates, with the exception of Carli Fiorina and Governor Ogayo John Cassic, were back with Governor Wisconsin Scott Walker, whose support dropped from 10 per cent last month to 2 per cent now.
Former Governor of Florida Jeb Bush, former Governor of Arkansas Mike Hakabi, and Senator of Florida Marco Rubio, are taking third place by 6 per cent.
The threshold for sampling of 376 Republican voters in this latest survey is plus minus 6 per cent, and the survey took place in September.
The recent CNN/ORC survey, published last week, showed the growth of Carson's survey - demonstrating 19 per cent of the Republic's support for Trump with 32 per cent of the support.
The latest ABC News/Washington Post survey also showed that Tramp is significantly overrun by Carson.
As Carson's support increased last week, Tramp had several critical incidents towards the former neurosurgery, even when Carson apologized for questioning the faith of Tramp.
"We need energy," Tromp said last Saturday during the closing of the campaign in Iowa.
Five members of the brotherhood are accused of the death of Baruch College's first student.
About two years after the death of a college student during a ceremony in the Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania, the charge of murder was filed against five people.
"The members of Pi Delta Psi from the New York College in Baruch have been brutally attacked by Chan Michael Deng during the September 2013 ceremony and did not deliver him to the hospital, which led to his death," they reported to the police.
Officials say that a student with eyes tied and a 30-pound pedestal with a sand behind his back has been pushed a few times while trying to reach a goal on a rolling surface.
Mr. Deng finally complained that he had a headache and then fell unconscious.
The Py Delta Psi brothers didn't call 911 when Deng lost consciousness, and they were waiting for another supposed hour before he was delivered to the hospital, talking to the police.
They found time, however, to change Deng's clothes, to find his symptoms in Google and to contact Andy Meng, the national president of the brotherhood, to ask for advice, as told at the police chief Chris Wagner press conference.
"At this point, the members of the brotherhood began to hide personal property, essentially, by putting the welfare of the brotherhood above Michael Deng's health," said Chief Wagner.
They could not save him, and he ended up the next morning.
According to the report on the cover, Deng received several blunt head traumas, torso and beads.
“ Too many families have suffered as a result of the rituals of the brotherhood, as at least one student dies every year, starting in 1970,” said Douglas Fireberg, a lawyer representing the Deng family.
Brothers and their members must bear the responsibility, and this step by the authorities is very important.
The jury districts of Monroe have turned to the charge of murdering a third degree for the first five members.
Thirty-two other members, including Ms. Menga, will be charged with violence against a new and criminal settlement.
"We want to take responsibility not only for the individual participants, but, if there is an organization that authorized all of this to be officially or informally, so is it," Wagner said at the press conference on Tuesday.
College Baruch banned the brotherhood, and the national brotherhood excluded the local office from its structure.
What happens when the Federal Reserve raises interest rates
There will be a rise in rates, and the "big market" will fall, bond revenues will grow, and the economy will fall into recession.
That's what we know.
What we don't know is how long it's going to take before it's over, and how long it's going to continue.
In particular, for the economy, history has little to do with time.
The recession took place only 11 months after the first increase in rates and for a total of 86 months.
The rigidity of the Federal Reserve in raising rates often, although not always, determines the economic and financial response.
Therefore, the U.S. Central Bank's administration is so insistent that investors should not focus on when it starts to raise rates and on how much adaptation will take.
In fact, there are many variables in the game.
At the end of the day, however, market participants may find that the whole set around the increase rate is excessive.
"The first increase in the Federal Reserve with a global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal of the end of the era of cheap money," said Julian Jessop, the chief expert on the international economy in Capital Economics, in his commentary to customers.
On the contrary, we do not expect the gradual return of interest rates to the United States to a more normal but still low levels will be a seismic impulse that many fear.
This does not mean, however, that there will be no consequences.
This is the view of how some areas of the economy could respond depending on historical trends:
As the market has seen in the last month or about, the expectation of rising rates may lead to instability for some time.
When the rate is increased, however, the consequences are usually not such dramatic.
"It is not possible for stock revenues to slow down for 12-24 months after the first jump, which again probably reflects a delay in monetary policy," said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study of the Federal Reserve's increase in rates.
If, in particular, the market for the past 35 years is more frequent - about 14 per cent - in terms of increased rates, remains sufficiently stable for 250 days (average growth 2.6 per cent), then, at the end of 500 days, returns to normal at an average income of 14.4 per cent for the last six cycles, according to the recent analysis by Bob Doll, chief trade strategy expert at Nuveen Asset Management, published in Barron's.
Deutsche says that the result for securities tends not to become more pronounced immediately at the rate increase, and stock revenues are beginning to decline.
Reactions are a fact of economic life, but rising rates often contribute to them.
In this case, the Federal Reserve is placed under conditions that have not existed before and may speed up the recession.
In general, the gross domestic product will be at almost its lowest point at all times of the higher rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, in 118 cases, only twice the nominal annual GDP has been below 4.5 per cent since 1950.
Even though it was 3.6 per cent in the second quarter of 2015, few believe it was long, while only 1.5 per cent in the third quarter, according to Atlanta Fed.
The increase in rates on such a unstable economic background may be risky and asks whether there will be a change this time,” Deutsche reported.
Market participants are preparing to increase the Federal Reserve System rates annually, with their views attached to the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which ends on Thursday.
While many policy and economists believe that FOMC could approve an increase in rates at this meeting, future trade is only 25 per cent.
"In our study since 1950, all the growth rates up to today have been in the supercycle of the increasing financial gap with GDP, covering peaks leading to recession, very quickly after recovery," the report states.
In contrast, it was an extremely slow recovery after the worst recession in the chosen period.
The current cycle for the moment is longer than expected by the Federal Reserve System since the end of the last recession; the record has been 35 months, it is only 74 months and has not yet been completed.
The fixed income has also become unstable while the market is expected to increase rates, and this scenario is somewhat similar to what is being achieved for shares.
The basic difference is that the effect on bonds will be faster than on shares when the Federal System changes the strategic course.
In the case of bonds, it appears that income changes the vector immediately after the first increase/decrease in the cycle.
At the end of the increase rate cycle, bond revenues fall immediately," Deutsche reports.
Strategy specialists from Charles Schwab believe that increased rates will lead to the closeness of long-term and short-term bond income levels by making the curve more flat.
High-income bonds are often better placed in such a climate, although "we still fear fluctuations in income," says the study Katie Jones, a fixed income analysis in Schwab.
Interestingly, Jones believes that markets have already adapted to the expected results of federal policy.
“In addition to strengthening the dollar and falling inflation expectations, there are signs that the market has been built on a more robust monetary policy perspective”, she wrote.
The interest rates for short-term loans were increased, income levels were more flat, credit advances increased, volatility increased, all market characteristics increased by the Federal System.
In general, companies that run their main business in the United States win higher interest rates and local production will become more attractive.
International debt companies will be in a worse position, as the rising dollar makes them cheaper in the world market space and their debt cheaper in the financial sector.
"History shows that "quality" shares demonstrate the market efficiency above three months after the initial increase in rates," said Goldman Sachs analysts in the customer report.
Companies with a stable financial status have moved companies with a unstable status as a result of each increase in rates in 1994, 1999 and 2004 at an average of 5 percentage points.
High-income companies, as well as low-voltility shares, have also shown better efficiency than low-quality shares, on average, 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points) respectively.
It's going to be a big question.
Companies with a high percentage of debt at a floating rate lose most, according to Goldman.
In addition to purely stock exchanges, consumers will benefit from the rising dollar.
The contributors could also see profit through higher income, although experts were spending on how fast this would take place.
"BBC Radio 3 - a copy of Classic FM", - a member of parliament from conservators Andrew Bingham
A member of parliament from conservatives, Andrew Bingham, criticised the station for "lowing standards"
Proves that it is becoming less and less different from a commercial competitor
He also focused on BBC Music Awards, saying that the prize is just a match with the British.
A colleague on Parliament Damien Collins, who has been assaulted on The Voice with the same criticism, has not been original.
"BBC Radio 3 is turning into a Classic FM," said the leader of parliament, encouraging the radio company to prove that it is doing anything that commercial companies are not doing.
A member of Parliament from conservatives Andrew Bingham also told the BBC, which seems to be the public radio "slut" and is becoming less and less different from its commercial competitor.
"Radio 3 seems - I don't like to use the word "simplification" - but it seems to turn into a Classic FM," he said.
He also focused on the BBC Music Awards, launched last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which started last year, looks like The Brits under a different name.
So if you're trying to do something else, here are two examples that first came to my mind, in which you're actually just copying what's already on the market," said Mr. Bingham.
The Director-General of the BBC rejected the charge, claiming that BBC Radio 3 is moving far ahead of its commercial rival when it comes to live music and auditory education.
What I know about Radio 3, I don't know about classical music anymore.
And his devotion to live speeches and the creation of music will not really compare with anyone else.
"So it's really very important, I think the interest of Radio 3 in the search for new music and in the promotion of new productions," he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 Alan Davy claimed that radio stations had to work much more to attract audiences than in the past, because the British were less educated in classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only child of BBC who was attacked by five commercial competitors during the hearings of the Special Committee on Culture, Media and Sport.
A parliamentary member from Tori Damien Collins attacked The Voice, a musical talent show that BBC bought from the Dutch Talpa Media at a cost of 22 million pounds.
See why this programme is often discussed in connection with the lack of originality and distinctions?
Lord Holll claims that the BBC 1 show, in which Paloma Feith and Boy George participate as judges, was done in the "typical BBC style".
He added that he wanted the Corporation to "get a hit on his own home horse" next time she started a fun project.
However, it does not consider it necessary to prevent the creation of new The Voice seasons in the future or the use of the money of those who pay the license fee in other forms of entertainment.
The increase in Internet sales has slowed the most in August, and may therefore be a black Friday
The first three months of 2015 saw an increase in online sales by seven per cent
Last month, the slowest growth has been observed since it began to be observed in 2000.
Online sales increased three years ago by using mobile shopping devices
Experts are convinced that the November Black Friday could contribute to the cost reduction
For about ten years, virtual shopping has been experiencing a boom, turning many central streets into a city of ghosts in Britain.
But experts say that there have now been signs of online sales imbalances, after the latest data showed only a seven per cent increase in the first three months of 2015.
Total online shopping expenditures in August have shown minimal growth since they began to be fixed in 2000 with only a five per cent increase.
Experts say that there have now been signs of online sales imbalances, after the latest data showed only a half-percent increase in the first three months of 2015
"If you look at the growth rate in previous years and go back to 2000, they've always been a reasonable explanation," said Guardian Andy Malkehi, editor of the IMRG Sales Index.
He explained that online sales had intensified three years ago when buyers began using their mobile phones to make purchases.
This meant that more people had the opportunity to buy online, and that they could do so under any circumstances, for example, sitting on the couch.
But now it goes up to the plate, and you can see the decrease (growth).
The phenomenon of the Black Friday, which came from America, is mentioned as one of the reasons for the slowing of sales.
Experts believe that buyers could refrain from buying before the event that took place on the last Friday of November.
Last year, buyers made a five-fold increase in the number of averages to enable computers to benefit from offers, thus disrupting a number of vendors ' websites.
Experts believe that the Black Friday, when buyers enter the present fight for profitable purchases, could keep people from shopping
According to a study published by the British Retail Consortium, more than 1 pound of sterling from each 5 is spent online.
With regard to goods such as televisions and stereos, more than one third of them are sold through the Internet store.
At the same time, more than four people buy clothes and shoes online than in fashion shops on central streets.
Muslims protect the killed at the fall of the crane in Mecca, and Ben Laden's family is subject to sanctions
Muslims carry 29 dead bodies on the streets, as first funerals begin in Mecca
At the same time, Saudi Arabia partly blames the construction giant Saudi Binladin Group for the accident
The Ministry of Health reported that a total of 394 persons were also traumatized after the collapse of the crane
Hundreds of Muslims were on the streets to bury 29 of the victims who were killed as a result of the collapse of the skull in the main mosque of Mecca.
The majority of the white people present in the funerals have half-carried the passage to pay tribute to the first of the deaths that have taken their last way to the Al-Moaiss.
The healing process was past the sacred place, where just a few days earlier, the building crane had broken down and fallen into a fad.
The bodies were issued for burial, and at the same time, the King of Saudis had assaulted a construction company belonging to the Ben Laden family for an accident in which 394 people were also injured.
Body 29 members who were killed in the destruction of the skull in the Main Mosque, carried on the streets
Among the dead were the father of the four children of Kasim Akram from Bolton, the Greater Manchester, who was on his first pilgrimage to the palace when the crane was broken.
Mr. Akram was in the Main Mosque with his parents before the beginning of the annual strike.
The Saudi authorities have already promised that the Hague in Mecca will continue, as thousands of people continue to come to the city.
Today, King Solomon said that Binladin Group should not have left the crane shot on the non-working crane.
The Arabic version of the decree published by the State agency Saudi Press states that Binladin Group is partly guilty of the breach.
The English edition of the news agency did not mention this detail, but reported that the company's leaders had been banned from leaving the country.
Earlier this week, Solomon promised to identify the cause of the collapse of the skull in the court of the Main Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims arrived in order to go to jail this month.
Binladin Group did not make any statements on the violation of the crane, and its representatives were not available for comments.
The Royal Decree also accused the company of not using modern security measures and inadequate harmonization of action with the meteorological service.
Tens of the cranes are surrounded by the main mosque of Mecca, as part of the extensive construction work carried out by the Binladin Group.
For decades, the Ben Laden family has been one of the closest family heads of Saudi Arabia and has managed major construction projects.
The late leader of Al-Qaida Usama Ben Laden was a son-in-law whose family was denied in the 1990s.
Avariya occurred in strong winds and rain only a few days before millions of people came into the kingdom to participate in the palace, which is mandatory for every hardworking Muslim, at least once in life.
Officials reported that 158 people remained in the hospital.
Officials decided to pay one million rye (about 174,000 pounds) to relatives of the deceased, and the same amount was irrevocably increased.
The remaining victims will receive half of that amount.
Chapter B&Q argues that the trend is due to the availability of small-scale European masters
According to Veronica Lori, the British are increasingly hiring repair specialists
The number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe is increasing
Results - opening more than 200 new Screwfix stores for professionals
At the same time, Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q stores all over the country.

They speak, the British lay aside milk and malaria, and instead hire qualified Eastern Europeans to do domestic work
If you are able to deal with a moth or to paint the walls, you seem to be in a minority in our day.
Because, according to the owner of B&Q, British employees are increasingly hired to do housework.
Veronica Lori, the new Director-General of Kingfisher, who owns the house-building services network, reported that this trend was accompanied by a significant flow of qualified Eastern European teachers offering minimum-cost services.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open another 200 Screwfix stores specializing in the goods for masters and to close at the same time 60 B&Q stores.
Ms. Lori said that she would like to see more women in B&Q shop staff, since eight out of ten procurement decisions in the shop were made by the representatives of the weak sex.
Most of the staff are men.
In her view, the latest demographic trends, which are characterized by the growing number of households made up of single women, which are more involved in housing than in the past, cannot be observed.
Mrs. Lori said, "Our shops still work mainly for men.
Steps must be taken to achieve the balance sheet.
In general, half of our clients are women, and 80 per cent of the decisions on purchased goods are made by women.
Women play a major role in decision-making.
Ms. Lori, one of five women in the role of leading British companies, whose shares are taken into account in the FTSE100 index, also changed the composition of the top managers team from among directors of equal numbers of men and women.
Kingfisher is the only company in which 50 per cent of the managers are women, including the Director-General and Finance.
Ms. Lori said, "This was a conscious decision, diversification, an important issue for us.
It was difficult to find suitable women in the Board of Directors.
After the group had incurred the costs of closing shops, Kingfisher had shown a decrease in revenues and sales for half a year.
As a result of this trend, Kingfisher, who owns Screwfix and B&Q brands, opens 200 new shops
Time of decision on the interest rate of the United States Federal Reserve
The world is monitoring the meetings held by the Federal Reserve Bank, which discuss the adoption of an important decision within two days - to raise or not a percentage rate for the first time in the last decade.
The 80 economists survey conducted by Reuters found that more than half of those who thought the Federal Reserve would do so last week now believe that it would still be slowing down and saving the current rate of 0-0.25 per cent.
This is a historic event, as it has been seven years since the Federal Reserve reduced the rate to zero.
For the first time, we approach the fact that the main bank can move from a zero point of view and start the process of normalizing interest rates," said Anhel Ubid, head of the Peterson Institute of International Economy.
The US economy is working effectively, adding trillions of dollars to the balance sheet, while inflation is low.
However, the Federal Reserve cannot ignore how the decision affects the world economy.
He warned the markets that they should be prepared to change, but they all spoke of their confidence that all odds against such a step were at stake.
The decision will be announced at 20.00 CET on Thursday.
A new Balkan route: refugees enter the EU through Croatia.
"Open!" -- hundreds of refugees are scanning at the Horgosh checkpoint on the Serbian-Hungarian border.
On Tuesday, Budapest crossed the border for the displaced.
The asylum seekers have already begun to cross other routes in the Euro Union.
One of them lies in the closed border with Serbia through Romania.
Another, through Croatia and Slovenia, is in Austria.
According to some data, buses that have taken refugees from Serbia to Hungary are now being sent to the city of Shida on the Croatian border.
The leaders were ordered from the authorities to follow without delay.
The Serbian Interior Minister Nebojša Stepaniovic assures that his country is doing everything in its power to help refugees, but its possibilities are limited:
Our work is to ensure that Serbia is as secure as possible.
On the other hand, we must also help these people to have a human attitude toward them.
But this is already a common European problem.
It is not easy to resolve, no country in Europe alone will be able to do so, and more so a small country like Serbia.
Belgrade requests Budapest to open the border for refugees who do not want to remain in Serbia.
But Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban is unforgivable:
If a person is called a refugee, he must fill in the necessary documents in Serbia.
And if he doesn't, they won't leave him in our country, because Serbia is safe.
Hungary has already led a 175-kilometers strike on the border with Serbia.
But the Orban is not going to stop: it plans to bring the same fence on the border with Romania.
Bucharest has already stated that this is incompatible with European principles.
Vangelis Maimarakis: "Europe wants to help us."
Vangelis Maimarakis has been in the right-wing governments for several years, which, in the opinion of the left, have led the country to the financial crisis.
Now he, as the interim leader of the New Democracy Party, is facing the challenges of Cyprus.
A few days before the election, he met with the journalist Evronius.
Mr. Maimarakis, welcome to Evronius!
Vangelis Maimarakis: Thank you for your invitation.
Euronius: Nine months ago, your party suffered a devastating defeat by joining the SIRIZA coalition, but now, judging by the polls, "New Democracy" was compared to it in popularity.
What changed during that time?
Vangelis Maimarakis: Greece has changed, and so have we.
Mr. Cyprus lied a lot last January.
Nine months ago, Greece benefited from the budget and economic growth prospects.
The country now has a budget deficit and a high level of unemployment.
The investors left because Mr. Cyprus had chased them.
In the last nine months, the Greek have been able to assess the situation in which the country was in January and the false promises of Mr. Cyprus.
And now they can easily compare what they promised with what actually happened.
Daily life was much worse than in January when the situation improved, with most Greek citizens.
Euronius: But you say that if you win the election, you will strive for alliances with other parties, including SIRIZ.
Vangelis Maimarakis: The case is that, as we have learned in recent years, Greece cannot move forward without understanding and cooperation.
And it is not a coincidence that in all other countries where rescue programmes have been or are still in operation, political forces and all ruling parties have gathered together to implement the programme on which they have agreed, without rejecting their political or ideological autonomy.
That is why I firmly believe that, at the current stage, only cooperation between political forces and institutions will enable the country to move forward.
Euronews: Your party voted in support of the agreement between Mr. Cyprus and the country's creditors.
If you become a new prime minister on Monday, will you keep this agreement, or will you try to change it at least in part?
Vangelis Maimarakis: In fact, we voted for Greece's European road movement, because we are well aware of the disastrous consequences that would have brought the country's exit from the EU.
Europe is now helping us by granting subsidies to our farmers for their production, we have solidarity funds, the package of the Union and assistance in the banking sector.
All of this would be lost if there was no agreement with Europe.
But the current harsh economic measures have been the result of Mr. Cyprus ' s negotiations.
I know that Europe does not want to destroy us.
Europe wants to help us.
Thus, if Europe sees that, during the first year, the new Greek Government wishes to order, acts rationally, and realizes that the country has a strong political will to implement the rescue programme, then I am sure that all the commitments it has made cannot be fulfilled because of the recession can be negotiated again, but only after a certain time.
It would be a mistake to believe that, in the first year of the new agreement, we will be able to return to negotiations with our creditors, as they expect full implementation of the agreement.
If we want to regain their confidence, we must continue to privatize, reform and structural changes that have been agreed upon, and continue to benefit from EU funding and the great investment opportunities that we need to open up for a better understanding and cooperation with Europe.
Unfortunately, during the negotiations, the Government of Cyprus has not presented any serious arguments on many key political issues, which we have identified by discussing these issues with our European colleagues.
I can give you an example of farmers' income.
We have explained to our European partners that this is not about fixed monthly income, and therefore it cannot be fully charged in advance.
We were told that the Cyprus ministers never talked about it.
Greek ministers were not prepared and were not well informed, and were therefore unsuccessful in negotiating and concluding a failed agreement.
Euronius: If you win the election, you will soon be at a table with Mr. Junker, the Netherlands, Mrs. Merkel and other European leaders.
Will what you tell them be different from what your predecessor Antonis Samaras told them?
Vangelis Maimarakis: First of all, I will explain to them that by the end of 2014, we have tried best to implement the 2012 agreement, with the sharp corners of it.
We have made progress in the reform process.
Of course, we did not grasp the necessary strength and speed, but we acted in an emergency.
The market had fallen, and potential buyers were not seen to be willing to pay the price imposed by the Greek Government.
At the time, I was the speaker of Parliament, and I was able to agree on the views of three parliamentary groups, which were then the majority of the Government.
And despite their serious ideological differences on key bills, we had a working Parliament, which was in the presence of populists and extremists, as well as mass demonstrations abroad.
And we managed to bring the country into a normal situation that would continue to improve if the process had not been interrupted by the pre-term general elections that resulted from the December presidential elections.
Euronews: The mass flow of refugees has been moving in Greece for the last few weeks.
What do you think about this situation and the reactions of the European countries that these people are seeking?
Vangelis Maimarakis: The refugee crisis is a slow-acting bomb that we have to deal with after the election.
And the reason is that the Government of Siriza did not act in this situation as it should have done.
Such issues should be addressed because if you have a problem, only emergency measures remain.
And we're in this situation right now.
Even the temporary government, which has replaced Siriz, has only done more than Mr. Cyprus had done in seven months.
I am confident that these actions of the temporary Government, which is providing valuable assistance to the President of the Republic, who called for the EU summit, will enable us to find a solution.
We need to see how many refugees can leave the country, and note that refugees are not illegal immigrants.
It's the victims of the war in Syria, the victims of some of the emergencies that happened to them.
The issue has a profound humanitarian dimension, and we will stick to the position that European policies should take in this new situation.
The relevant decision should be taken at the EU summit, and the United Nations should be involved.
We also need better coordination of action, more effective border control and refugee reception centres.
We also need to make effective use of the economic assistance we receive from the EU in order to be able to deal with this pressing problem.
Evronius: Mr. Mamarakis, thank you for the interview.
Vangelis Maimarakis: Thank you.
In the peaceful city of Družkovk Donecka, during the day, the police chief's criminal investigation of the area together with military counter-reviewed found and detained the suspect, who was 34-year-old Ukrainian soldier from the city of Krivy Rog (Dnepropetrovska), who, in the evening, had launched a car in his opponent during the joint use of alcohol, and the conflict in the village of the Upper State of Yasinowat, Donetchina.

A man who opened fire at Delta State University left an apology note
After the shooting and killing of his friend in Mississippi on Monday morning, and before he shot and killed his colleague later that day, Shannon Lamb wrote a note stating that he was “suffering” for the first murder and would like to “return all back”, the authorities reported on Tuesday.
The police in the city of Gotie, Mississippi, reported that the professor of geography and public science at the University of Delta called 911 about 10 a.m.
On Monday, he told me he shot someone.
Lamb told the dissident that the police had to send people home.
He said, "I killed my wife last night," and he also mentioned that there's a peso in the house, which "no one thrones," but probably upset.
The police were interested in the name of the caller, but he didn't call it.
Lamb didn't explain why he opened the gun.
Upon entering the scene of the crime, the police found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41 years old, and a note written by Lamba, 45 years old, saying, "I'm sorry I want to go back.
I loved Amy and she was the only one who ever loved me.
After writing a note, Lamb went 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a professor of history, and on Monday evening, when the police surrounded him, he ended up with him.
The Rector of William Laford University reported that he had not been aware of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "Mr. Lamb was clearly aware of something".
Despite the information received on Monday that Lamb had intended a romance between Prentiss and Schmidt, official services reported on Tuesday that “there was no information or evidence” of the “love triangle”.
The Prettiss turned out to be the "good man" Sean O'Stin, who reported having been married to her for about seven years.
They were divorced 15 years ago, but they remained friends.
O'Stin told me that he and Prentiss had a daughter of 19, and that she's "beautiful."
He added that Prentiss and her daughter were best friends.
According to Lindsay Noulz, the newspaper San Gerald called a close friend Prentiss, the last one working from home on the Internet.
Noulz told me that Prentiss had a wild dog called Litning, and that she had met Lamb for about three years.
Nouls said, "She always wanted to help people."
According to the police, on Monday, Lamb called his family at some point to say, "He won't go to prison."
On the same night when the police hit him on the "1" show near Greenville, Lamb stopped the car, jumped out of it, ran into the woods and shot it there.
According to a summary on the university site, in spring 2015, Lamb received a degree of teaching in the State University of Delta.
Stars Losing Their Success
Actor (left), in a photo with his son Redmond (right), survived several difficult years.
In 2001 he fought leukemia and in 2009 he lost his multi-year life story, Farru Fossett, who died of cancer.
The actor was reportedly also suffering from drug addiction and was arrested for drug storage in 2008.
All of this certainly has played its part.
Luke Shaw from Manchester United went out for a few months due to a double break
Luke Shaw broke his right leg in two places during the Battle of the Champions League, in which Manchester United lost PSV in Endhoven.
While the defender survives in this regard, which is why he will not be able to go out in the field for at least six months, Louis van Gal hopes that Shaw will be able to play again in this season.
Trauma took place during the unreasonably sub-cooked Hector Moreno at 15 minutes when the 20-year-old show crashed into the PSV zone.
He was assisted in the field for nine minutes and was given oxygen before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gal said, "He has a double fracture, and he's in the hospital."
He'll be transported to Manchester tomorrow or the day after, and then they'll be operating.
It's terrible - the young man came to Manchester United at the age of 18, overcome great difficulties and started playing fantastically, and here it happened.
There was an oxygen mask in the compartment.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double break, it's for six months, and the guy can't play in the group phase.
I hope he can play again in this season.
Moreno's lucky he didn't get a red card and no pens were appointed.
Arbitr Nicola Riccoli didn't punish a Mexican.
Van Gal thinks the Italian judge made a mistake.
Judge yourself, when I say it's worth a pen and a red card.
It was a very poor two-legged basement.
In his Twitter, Shaw says, "Thank you all for your messages, not to describe how I'm devastated, my way of recovery starts, I'm going back harder than I was."
More on the subject: Manchester United is experiencing an accident with Luke Shaw when playing with PSV
An English defender will have an additional incentive to move to the European Championship in France next June.
Phillip Koku, PSV coach, said, "This is a very serious trauma."
When any game comes out with such a trauma, it's all very upset.
That was never the intention of our players to traumatize the enemy.
Moreno took over his leg when he played for Mexico against the Dutch team under the leadership of Van Gala at the Peace Championship in 2014.
"It's very difficult now because he didn't intend to hurt the enemy, and when you hear that it's a very serious trauma, you feel bad," Koku said.
I didn't have a chance to see the moment myself.
The only thing I could see was the ball that flew in the other direction, so it looked as if he (Morino) had touched it, but I didn't see the podium under Luke.
In a conversation with SBS6 Moreno, he said, "I know it's like, I know how hard it is to carry it.
I'm so sorry, and I'm so sorry.
Andres Guardado from PSV was also delivered to the hospital after meeting Chris Smalling.
Does David Cameron know anything else about Loracs?
Every parent takes one thing very quickly: if your child likes a book, it'll be a little while before you know it's almost gone.
See if you're not David Cameron.
In response to the question of the representative of the children's vacation organization in the canycle, the Prime Minister chose Lorex, a story with an environmental background written by Dr. Suez in 1971.
This was a difficult choice, wrote Cameron in a comment published on the SuperCamps website, and continues: "This is a funny, touching, unusual story with a strong message I like to read to my children because it always contains some image or message we miss."
And it would be good, apart from the last paragraph, in which Cameron is supposed to reread the content of the book, but in fact the subject of a single film, which was taken off in 2012, with new characters and details added in order to diversify quite briefly the original version.
"In the surrounding high walls of the city of Allanjuville, where there was no green and even the air was sold for money, a boy named Ted was hoping to win the heart of Audrey, the girls of his dream, to see her, to see this tree," we read in the text a description of the love story that Dr. Suzu (the current name of Theodore Suez Gezel), who died in 1991.
If this is not surprising enough, Cameron's text is read almost as a short presentation of the movie "Lorax", posted on the Internet Movie Database: "In the surrounding high walls of the city of Ammnuzville, where everything was artificial and even the air was sold for money, a boy named Ted was hoping to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dream."
It is unlikely that Cameron, generally recognized as an active parent, is so unaware of the contents of a book that a boy is not named in the name of a boy that destroys the environment of a thirsty tree cutter and a smolderer, Nadokins, despite the protests of Loraks (the name of the book) - a funny substance with everything that "speaks on the name of trees".
It is likely that this uncomplicated PR assignment was commissioned by an executive who never read a book on Loracs 20 times a day.
The representative of Downing Street stated that the text was probably received from the Cameroon office in the electoral district.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was received from Cameron's headquarters, but no further comments were followed.
There was a clear risk for Adam Lit not to fall into England, but it was still a difficult question.
The victory over Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a simple task, but if you look at the assembly that England has chosen for this tour, I don't think it is possible to repeat the 3-0 test series that happened last time.
I would also not rule out a victory in my field.
The team of Alistair Cook may be less experienced than it was three years ago, but there are players who play games, virtually taking rounds, and collective thinking very much; they will not bring with them a 2012 scarf, but only a youth's position.
With Moen Ali's ball, it turns into a ball that gives a ball, and Adil Rashid, even if it's an unknown figure for the test level, it's an attack option.
More on the subject: Adam Lit came out of England on a test cricket and was replaced by Alex Heilz
The decision to exclude Adam Lit from me, his chief coach in Yorkshire, of course, is difficult to analyze.
His seven test matches had two good attacks under difficult conditions, and the obvious but harsh reality was that the cricket games were assessed by the judges as a result.
There were no questions about John Ruth, for example, which led to this announcement, because (and I have already said this) the games are best chosen by themselves.
A couple of half a century ago, and Lithuania could have waited for a longer career, but he was in charge of his own destiny.
We hope that if he gets more wounds for Yorkshire, there will be another chance.
The chief coach of England's gathering, Trevor Baileys, responded well to his mood, even when he didn't show what he was capable of, and it didn't surprise me; he was first a team game, then everything else.
The question of how long it will be before the Batman test cricket will leave its mark on itself is a difficult question.
Lit played seven games like Sam Robson before him, and Nick Compton was nine.
Only Compton got a chance to play on his own and on a foreign field.
The only thing you could regret is that England chose Jonathan Trout for the Caribbean League, when Lit was in the best form, but this lost opportunity already in the past.
It's Alex Haels, and he's the betsman I appreciate.
He's an unforeseeable cricketer that we saw at the Yorkshire Club at the beginning of this season when he won 236 in a match against us at Trent Bridge, which was already something.
It should be given at least the same opportunity as those before it, but it would, of course, depend on the composition of the OAU team.
The idea of putting Moen next to Cook as an open-end bet, which would allow for an additional spin-off, keeping four fast boulevards, is to be considered, and I am not against it at all.
I can't see why the winning game can't get a ball out there, and this left has already shown that he's a hell of a cricket.
Moon may not be exactly what it takes for his Vustershire county, but it's the third number for them, and there's no big difference here.
My old teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 test matches "third Beatsman" before leaving as opening in 2001.
He won three hundred at once, and he didn't see it.
Zafar Ansari came to the stand as a backbone, and with my constant association with him he showed me a very promising young man.
People can look at its approximate statistics -- on average, 31 with a beat and 35 with a ball -- and think it's a risky rate, but among those who vote for a little, and choose youth.
He'll learn a lot in this tour.
In addition to the collection, England plans to make a couple of practical supplements in the training.
The appointment of Mahela Jayouordin, a Sri Lankan Batman, as a test match consultant could be a master course.
He's one of the best guys for the game that will bring in the most rich experience from all possible conditions and in any attack.
Paul Collingwood is included in the games where a white ball is used and will provide both energy and safety at the setape.
I always felt that he was born to be involved in an international cricket, whether a game or a training job, and like Michaela, he has little intelligence.
Sometimes the new voices in the divide, even if they say what has been said before, may add new forces to the team.
Colley on the Darem Ben Stokes team was left for one day, Ruth was given a similar break with Australia, and I do not, for example, have any problems with that.
While not all agree, coaches and players do not define the schedule.
And you have to remember, as players, their positions depend on the results.
Such decisions are never easy.
The UK withdrawal camp can win if the economy is depressed by 2017
David Cameron's unimaginable policy to resume negotiations on Britain's preservation in the EU is becoming increasingly difficult every day, even without regard to the choice of the genius Jeremy, "It is yes or no?" -- Corbin as a leader of the Laborist or the TUC nuance on Europe Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their Corbins and Nigel Faraj.
The friendly European diplomat explained that, in the current situation in which the EU is experiencing a variety of crises, not all of them are made by their own, some of the countries that are in the throat of the British ego-centric agenda are sitting down at the top of the scenes and the underlying agreements that they do not want to make.
Upon meeting in Briton on an annual meeting, TUC decided that he would not want them at all if they destroyed social protection.
We could even call it "the program of Selfi Dave and George."
The Prime Minister and Minister of Finance are crammed at the summits and bilateral sessions in foreign capitals, taking pictures of themselves in the background of a well-known local monument, in or without a local identity company, then coming home and saying that they are attracting allies to reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants to keep interested in Britain's external contacts under the EU's will, "Don't leave us with France," says Berlin, suggests that the corrupt ministers and officials in some capitals come to an understanding when they get there, we stay or leave.
Angela Merkel, a very careful German Chancellor, is an ally, but she is ten years old and wants to leave the office before the situation for her is worse, as it has become worse for the Tetcher (11 years), Mitterran (14) and Kola (16).
France's head, France, is before re-election or replacement in 2017.
He's losing power, too.
Poland may soon receive the nationalist government of the right-wing, Spain-left.
It's hard to see their skin-skin-skin-skin to help the self-britches whose energy could be lost to preventing Scotland from leaving the United Kingdom, which they don't want either, because most of them have similar separatist trends.
So some of these ministers can even plan to issue deliberately useless SNP-style diamonds during the 2017 referendum campaign in Britain to boost Britain's exit from the EU, my friend suggests.
"The review was an idea-fix" and "British has not received any value from renewed negotiations".
Europeans know for their own good what predators can be, and how skeptical of the EU are media magnets, unlike Tony Benn's 1975 referendum, which supported our accession in 1973 by 2:1 ratio.
They can hardly remember Boris Johnson, the crowned Euroopportunist, who celebrated his "EU direct bananas" by the Brussels correspondent in the early 1990s.
In all his nonsense, Ed Milliband knew who his enemies were.
They included a cluster company of fearsome jumbo taxes, phone hackers and pseudo-residents who own most of our major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair had the same opinion about them, but he realized that when you're in a cell with a giant gorilla, you have to give her bananas to pull her away and not let her eat you in a chain and with a cup of tea.
In fact, Milliband was more committed to Blair than Blair himself in the face of the idea of Cameroon's referendum, as Blair was in favour of the rejected EU constitution, which was buried by French and Dutch voters in 2005, who issued him a winning ticket.
The press didn't forgive him any of this.
But my dear Jeremy Corbin, who got me in the back of Westminster on Monday, I told him that he had no time to spend on me - it seems he's risking repeating the strategy of Neil Kinnock "the Merdoku Boy" from the '80s - a mistake and then, and now.
This may take time, but it must develop a consistent strategy of interaction with the press - not with me, but exactly with Andrew Marrom, on which he sat at the VVC on Sunday.
The official position of the Corbin on Europe is that I call evolution a delicate one.
He said he would like us to remain in the reformed EU.
Indeed, the majority of people outside the traditionalistic trend of Ukip and the wider circle of “small English sidewalks” may say yes.
It's the same as Hillary Benn, but not Bennit, Benn said on the radio and TV this week, while his internal fighter for all the forces refused to admit that the appointment of Corbin of the bare John McDonnell as a "ten-year" finance minister was a bad idea.
This reminded me of the 1970s when his father-in-law of all the forces fought on TV for the disloyalty of colleagues in the labyrinth, not going too far and not losing his position in the Cabinet of Ministers.
The Battle of Hillary was more attractive.
But the fight to remain "under any circumstances" is not what McDonnell said, and not what J. K. spoke to Perm and Members of Parliament at a private meeting on Monday evening, in general opinion.
To tell us about the democracy and his "boy" Corbin - remember, he has crowned even me - the discipline of the messages remains important during the seven-day television century on a weekly basis, and especially in the water cycle of social networks, the guise of paranoia and betrayal.
It's reasonable not to let Cameron just separate from Europe, allowing him to accept as worthy the support of the lobbyists during the referendum campaign, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so.
But the main mistake of McDonnell and Corbin on EU membership - within the "Bennit" economy of decommissioned strength - is no longer the issue of an esoteric discussion among left-wing dissidents, for which narcissism, a minor distinction, is a central principle in dogmatic disputes.
With regard to his mistakes regarding Nato-Tom Watson, it is unquestionable that J.C. will not act as an exit, foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to bring this to their leaders at home.
Why would Paris or Berlin spend political capital -- they also have suspicious voters -- on Britain's entries when it can be meaningless?
The United States has already been very disappointed by the weak military actions of British people in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even though the government of the country will cut the costs, as I was reminded on Monday at a forum called British Influence Security.
Experts criticise the review of e-cigarettes from Public Health England
Statements by the Government of the Agency that electronic cigarettes were 95 per cent less harmful than smoking resulted in a meeting of 12 people, some of whom were related to the tobacco industry as reported by the researchers.
Experts published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) together with Lancet criticized the evidence used by the Public Health England (PHE) in their electronic cigarette report.
PHE published an important report - "returning mass" last month, calling it "a comprehensive review of evidence".
However, some researchers questioned the reliability of the data and referred to some experts in the tobacco industry.
In the editorial article in Lancet's medical journal last month, they criticized the "extremely shaky argument" on which the PHE had built its main conclusion.
In article BMJ, two other researchers wondered whether these statements were “strong or narrowly grounded”.
Martin McKi, professor of the organization of European health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at Liverpool University, reported: “The fundamental principle of health should be based on evidence of effectiveness”.
According to them, the public expects that PHE's statements that "current best estimate shows that electronic cigarettes are about 95 per cent less harmful than tobacco use" were based on a detailed discussion of evidence and modelling.
In fact, this is reflected in the only meeting of 12 people gathered to develop a multi-criteria analysis model of decision-making in order to summarize their views on the harm associated with the various non-containing products; the results of the meetings are briefed in scientific publications.
McKi and Capewell reported that one of the congregation's sponsors was a company called EuroSwiss Health, which reported that he had previously received funding from British American Tobacco for an independent study.
It also confirmed the health certificates of BAT in the report on sustainable development.
One of the 12 people at the meeting announced funding from an electronic cigarette manufacturer, not to mention the funding he reportedly received from the tobacco company Philip Morris.
There was no reasonable explanation for the choice of members of the Council, but several well-known supporters of electronic cigarettes, some of which also claimed to finance the industry in the publication.
It is not known whether other participants have experience in tobacco management.
I will also visit the tobacco manager at PHE.
The scientific article, published by the group, "is highly agreed" that there is a lack of "significant evidence of the adverse effects of most products on most of the criteria", wrote McKi and Capewell.
However, none of these links and limitations were affected in the PHE report.
McKi and Capewell said that PHE's statements that "there is no evidence at the moment that electronic cigarettes are expensive or non-smoking," were premature.
Prof. Kevin Fenton, Head of Health and Welfare at PHE, said that BMJ had already responded.
He said, "Electronic cigarettes are much less harmful than tobacco."
One of the two smokers died of his passion.
All the evidence implies that the health risks from electronic cigarettes are relatively small, but we must continue to study the remote effects.
PHE has a clear responsibility to inform the public about what they prove and what they do not prove, especially where the public had doubts about the relative danger of tobacco.
About 80,000 people die from smoking - related diseases each year, and smoking is spent in NHS at 2 billion pounds per year.
Clearly, while electronic cigarettes are not safe, they are only part of the harm caused by smoking, we are carrying out our tasks before the nation.
Former Head of Channel 4 believes the BBC should stop the EastEnders series
Former Head of Channel 4 Luke Johnson believes that BBC should stop launching programs such as EastEnders and The Voice, noting that their business competitors would give a lot of money for a successful show such as the "Alberta Square" mill.
Johnson noted that licence fees should only be used to create programmes that are not issued by other British broadcasters.
He criticized the BBC for putting public broadcasts, which probably only a small part of the audience, at peak airtime when competitors go to a high-rated show, and on channels like BBC4.
After the BBC Director-General Tony Holll said that the corporation would like to cooperate more with other organizations, Johnson noted that he had unsuccessfully tried to establish cooperation with BBC during the work on Channel 4.
"I cannot separate myself from the idea that the BBC is preparing to launch and broadcasts that could show competing companies that do not receive grants," Johnson told members of the Committee on Communications of the House of Lords in an analysis of the future fate of the BBC.
If you keep a licence collection that I do not consider as a good solution in the medium and long term, the company should only leave in the air programmes that are not issued and are not to be issued by other companies.
The Voice show goes out in the air in the lobby because the creators want to get as much support as possible for the future.
The idea of no one showing it anymore is ridiculous and obviously absurd.
Johnson: " I don't understand why regressive taxes should go to funding transfers that could be sponsored without subsidies.
The Voice is one such example, EastEnders is another; it is known that they are their own production.
Other channels would no doubt be too far behind her.
I don't understand how this can be a public message.
I don't think that'd bring down the BBC.
The serial entrepreneur Johnson, channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, accused BBC of pursuing ratings “on account of the ambitions of staff members and their faith that this is the best way to obtain long-term support”.
His comments on the BBC's most popular show are addressed with comments from the executive director Sky Tony Bolla, who, in his lecture on remember McGagart in Edinburgh in 2003, invited BBC to sell EastEnders series.
Johnson noted that the lower BBC public transfers "are continuing to go to BBC4, where it is often not possible to assess the audit, but therefore the company's function has been performed, and this can be presented as an argument in the Hungarian sermons justifying the income from the 4 billion-pound licensing: "Yes, of course, we do all these unmistakable transfers that no one sees."
They put them in a slot where no one will ever see them.
Regarding the licence collection, Johnson told the Committee: "I call on you to find a more regressive system with regard to who will receive the most from it.
Of course, you all think, we all think that 150 pounds a year is a huge amount, but for people for whom 150 pounds are big money, I wonder, because they don't really watch and listen to the BBC.
The former Executive Director of Sky and Channel 5 David Elstein, who also spoke before the Committee last Tuesday, said that the BBC should review the Rita mission in favour of “information, education and entertainment”.
He noted that only a small part of the BBC material released is now formally classified as educational - he said it was 1% of the television content and 0.1% of the radio, and that the company should welcome the initiative of Australian and Canadian broadcasters under the heading “Information, Education and Entertainment”.
On Elstein's partnership, the BBC has noted that more efforts should be made in such areas as "Remote concerts" (only part of them, he says, are on TV) and enter into alliances with commercial broadcasters to make them available for online viewing.
"Sonegenetics" allows brain cells to be controlled by sound waves
The video shows how there is no change in the direction of movement when they are affected by sound impulses.
Scientists have released worms with a genetically modified nervous system that can be managed using sound waves.
Nostalgia changes the direction of movement at a time when they are affected by sound impulses, too high for human ears to hear them.
The pulses are affected by the activation of neurons genetically modified to use membrane channels that react to ultrasonic waves.
More on the subject: Researchers manage brain activity through light
Scientists have explained that worms demonstrate the possibility of a new technique called “sonnetics”, which is the subject of ultrasound to initiate certain brain cells, hearts and muscles, while the source of ultrasound is available outside the body.
Schrikant Chalasani, a scientific officer at the Institute of Solka, La-Hoya, California, told the Guardian that this technique could one day replace the profound brain stimulation - an invasive procedure in which electrical impulses are sent to the human brain and used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease.
Red nematodes usually do not react to ultrasonics, but the Chalasans discovered that they began to react when they were placed in a fluid containing microscopic bubbles.
He discovered that the bubbles are increasing ultrasonic waves, which then penetrate the worm’s body.
Strong ultrasonic waves affect the structures called “TRP-4” in the membranes of some red cells.
The ultrasonic waves force these ion channels to open and stimulate the cells associated with them to be reported in the Nature Communications report.
In order to create the nematodes that can be controlled by ultrasonics, Chalasani made genetic modifications to the worms, so their motor neurons used the TRP-4 ion channels.
During the use of ultrasonics to affect modified organisms, sound waves were increased by microscopic bubbles and introduced into worms by activating modified motor neurons.
This method is similar to the one used in "optogenesis" - a new direction that allows scientists to include and exclude neurons with light impulses.
Chalasani claims that in comparison with this method, sonogenetics may have some advantages.
Unlike the light that is delivered to the required area of the brain, low-frequency ultrasonic waves pass through the body’s tissues, so they do not need to be delivered inside the skull.
"We believe that, in order to treat certain neurological diseases in clinical conditions, the use of gene therapy and therapeutic viruses will eventually make human neurons sensitive to the ultrasound signal," Chalasani said.
He added that, in addition, the method may apply to muscle and insulin-producing cells.

Advertising announcements are published on British arms trade
Consider the role of Amnesty International in protesting the arms exhibition.
Screaming drones!
Ruining iron canals!
Cascade bombs!
Electric rainstorms that cause unbearable pain, but do not leave traces!
There is no doubt that this advertisement of the largest international arms exhibition - one of the parishes prepared by Amnesty International in order to draw attention to the intention of the British Government to "interpret" weapons through repressive regimes that are taking advantage of the ExCeL Centre in Doklands by the exhibition of defence technologies and security systems.
More on: DSEI Arms Exhibition: Authorizing regimes go to London
But the special campaign also causes a sudden number of posters on bus stops and on subways that need to be looked at again.
"A major announcement on DLR from 15 to 18 September?" is written on one of them by London Metro, with a picture of DLR line turning into a tank silhouette.
In September of this year, a crowd of arms dealers will be burning on DLR. Passengers are asking for help to prevent the display of weapons.
300 posters were written by artists who exhibited their work at the "Museum of Cruel Design" in the Banky Park "Dismalland".
The Special Patrol Group has helped to distribute them to London using the 6-pound set of slots, which is said to be “access to about a third of the advertising space on the planet’s bus stops”.
Transporters in London hated such "vandalism" as unauthorized posters.
One of the paramilitary announcements issued by the Special Patrol Unit.
According to Gavin Greendon, curator of the Cruel Designs exhibition and teacher at the Essex University, artists are becoming more demanding and are striving to bring political art to the auditorium outside the gallery.
Many artists start working with Protestant activists, realizing that they have to go to real world for their art if they want to influence society.
Another poster against the exhibition of weapons welcoming passengers in the subway.
A video from Amnesty was viewed more than 100,000 times on Facebook and was created by a VCCP pro bono agency, with a graphic designer and sound artist who also works for free.
The creative director of VCCP Matt Lever was struck by the ad silence around the arms exhibition - with a break in the ExCel calendar - and thought, "Let them set up the campaign they're trying to avoid."
They intended to create more realistic and ethro-human corporate advertising, but “to fill her house with bright colors and animation became more fascinating”.
"They have helped us incredibly to attract attention to the sale of illegal experimental equipment at the exhibition," said Tom Davis of Amnesty.
We now need the British Government to take measures and ensure that this torture equipment will not be illegally sold directly at our threshold.
Perhaps the most creative art on the subject of the exhibition of weapons is within ExCeL, where participants are engaged in fantastic euphemistic production.
In the press release, Saab revealed information on the order for "AT4CS RS for shoulder shooting" from the US army.
It includes “a non-alike cumulative military weapon that brings uninterrupted illegal action within the goal”.
Whatever he does, it's not gonna be nice.
Eight Golden Rules for Living in Student Living
It's been 11 years since I moved to the student community as a normal 19-year-old, still believing in berets and moral relativism, but only now I remember the smiles of those I've offended - and many long-standing complaints to others.
Basically, what I learned can be divided into eight simple rules.
The move to the community can range from a mild nerve to an absolutely scary one.
He's encouraging me to tell people where you've been, you've taken academic leave, and you've taken it, you've supported Corbin, and why you're "honest, I don't love, I don't hate Marmite," because seriously, guys, it's just a tricky extract of HAHAHA, I'll be there."
Take a breath.
And help others to move, too, ask questions and show interest.
It's a conversation and it helps you find people you like, not people you don't even want to talk to, even if you're on fire, and they're on fire.
Give people space.
People’s rooms are often turned into drinking establishments, semi-trailers, and places of common shower, but they are also the place where people dress and repair the underwear below.
More on the subject: Don’t even think about starting university studies in relationships
Introverts at universities are unfair.
Your room must be a refuge, but many communities form a culture of Satan from one room to another, which promotes friendship, society and leads to long friendship.
This could be a hell of a man who's trying to restore power.
Nothing in culture makes you say, "I like you, and I want to keep dating you, but I need you to go, and I can restore the energy I've spent on communicating with you."
Try to feel as if the contestant is tired of the community, not to knock on it, but to send a text message.
I mean, knock: do it.
One man in my hometown followed the principle: if the door was not closed, he was invited to come in.
He saw something.
He's driving friends with a firefight.
Since you're starting a university life at the peak of the Bake-Off show, you're going to knock on the door to people to introduce and teach the chocolate cake, it's no longer such a strange act, it's not so much a reminder since the 1950s that they said, "We're welcome, we're neighbors, I've done something for you, and now you're smiling, and I'm going to ask you personal questions."
Offering household chores is a great way to get married.
Your neighbors will feel obliged to fight with you, and as a result, your face will probably be associated with a pleasant surprise.
Of course, it depends on how much you're a good baker.
Badly blind spots of torment, sugar and fat will make people turn to sleep when you knock on them.
Food industry is a typical crime in student communities.
Of course, giving someone a chicken is a rat, but isn't it a spell to get to feel milk for tea?
Go to the owner of the milk.
He's probably going to suggest you don't hesitate, even if you're in anger.
If someone's stealing your stuff, it's annoying, and I'm sorry, but try to treat this adult as my neighbor who poured in her milk to wash the dishes to avenge those who took him without asking.
She's in jail now.
You don't have to make noise that will prevent people from sleeping or learning.
Not only to be a decent person, but also because you are the same people from a glass house.
A girl in my corridor asked her neighbor to make the sound of drums and bass guitars, as it was three o'clock in the morning, and she had an exam in the morning.
In response, the neighbor increased the noise.
When he finally shut up at 5: 00 a.m., she kindly allowed him to sleep for two hours and then she turned her music and shut the door and went to a three-hour exam.
Wouldn't it have been romantic if your future husband had settled in the same neighborhood as you?
On the contrary, wouldn't it be extremely, until you cut the balls, not even if you took your future wife's neighbor, got involved, broke their relationship, and should you see him every day, and maybe watch him pull on his side all your common friends?
Of course, you won't show your heart - but if your hot neighbor is not exactly your future husband, try to cool your own dust.
At that exciting moment, when you realize that someone has left the keys inside their own locked room, the edge between the gamer and the grass is thinner than it seems.
A good game is fun, but it turns into opposition for a few seconds.
Teach a valuable and interesting safety lesson by hiding something - but never touch a room of toothpaste and shampoo.
Close the outside door and drop the keys in the glass with the water that you'll then put in the freezer - but don't attach the other thing with the Blu-Tack glue to a little bit more than twice.
iOS 9: How to establish a new operating system on the iPhone after the Apple update
A new operating system can be requested by entering the Settings plugin and selecting General and then - Software Update.
If it's ready, the phone will allow you to jump it and set it up.
Some have encountered problems after installation when an error message was reported, stating that "The update of the annex has failed".
To avoid this, users are either advised to wait until the recovery is quiet or try to renew via iTunes.
Phone hints will allow you to complete the whole process.
The process may include the removal of applications to increase the free space - but Apple has minimized the likelihood of this action by reducing the amount of the update and has also simplified implementation with the help of a special tool that proposes to remove the applications and re-establish them after the completion of the process.
You should be sure that when you update, your phone is loaded or is next to the charging device so that you do not let your battery down.
If the charge is too low, Apple will stop the update, as the order of the phone in the process may result in an update.

Washington responded to Russia's military activity by telephone.
U.S. Secretary John Kerry called his Russian colleague Sergei Lavrov to discuss the situation in Syria.
In his view, the military support given by Moscow to President Assad only exacerbates the conflict.
At the same time, the head of the White House is not going to talk about it with a Russian colleague, PJ Media writes.
US Secretary John Kerry called Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov to discuss Russia's military activity in Syria.
This is reported by PJ Media.
"The secretary of Kerry made it clear that the continued support of President Assad from Russia poses a risk of escalating and prolonging the conflict, as well as a negative impact on our common goal of combating extremism, if we do not continue to focus on seeking solutions to the Syrian conflict by direct transfer of power," said the representatives of the United States Department.
They also noted that Kerry had repeatedly stressed the commitment of the United States to combating the Islamic State as a coalition from more than 60 countries.
He also noted that President Assad could never be a member of her.
In addition, the United States “will be pleased with Russia’s constructive role in trying to oppose the Islamic State”.
On Friday, representatives of the White House said that they did not know exactly what action the Russian troops were taking in Syria, but Washington was going to discuss this issue with Moscow.
However, the press secretary at the White House, Josh Ernest, noted that the time for telephone conversation between President Barack Obama and Russian leader Vladimir Putin had not yet come: "When the President decides that the telephone conversation with President Putin will benefit our interests, he will raise the pipe and try to make that call."
Sam Barak Obama believes that Russia's decision to increase support for the "criminal rate" regime of Assad.
I remember our conversation with Mr. Putin four or five years ago when I told him it was a mistake that further support from Assad would only worsen the situation.
"But he did not listen to my warnings - and as a result the situation deteriorated," said the President of the United States.
Importable yachts will be exempt from customs duties.
The development of the mine is intended to temporarily release imported yachts and other floating means for recreation and sport from customs duties and taxes.
The corresponding changes in the list of spare goods for temporary duty-free imports were prepared by the Ministry for the Command of the Government of the RF.
This was reported by the Assistant Minister of Economic Development Elena Laškin.
In June 2015, the Prime Minister of RF Dmitry Medvedev, as a result of his visit to Crimea, commissioned a number of agencies - Minconomy, Mintrans RF, Minkultura, MIDI, MCS, FSB, FTS, Rosturism - to prepare proposals to create favourable conditions for yachting in coastal areas of the country.
In turn, experts note that the main problem is the complete lack of infrastructure for the storage, maintenance and maintenance of yachts.
Owners prefer to keep their courts abroad - approximately €200 million per year for the maintenance, repair and maintenance of yachts.
Russia ' s Ministry of Economic Development prepared a draft decision of the Council of the Eurasian Economic Commission for Europe " on the introduction of changes to the list of goods temporarily imported with full conditional exemption from customs duties, taxes on customs duties, taxes on imported yachts and other floating means for recreation and sport.
In the Ministry ' s view, this will certainly contribute to the establishment of favourable conditions for the development of yachts in coastal areas of the country, Laškina noted.
The question was raised by the Customs and Tariff Sub-Commission, non-tariff regulation, protection measures in the external trade of the Government Commission on Economic Development and Integration, which took place in September, and was also endorsed by the agencies as a result of the discussion.
As the representative of the Ministry of Development noted, the proposed measure of full conditional release on imports is in fact a benefit.
Therefore, following the adoption of the minutes of the meeting of the Sub-Commission in the Government of the Russian Federation, the Ministry of Economic Development will present a proposal to the Eurasian Economic Commission for discussion with the member States of the EAEC, Laškina explained.
The list of imported goods that are completely exempt from customs duties, taxes includes the goods necessary to promote external economic activities and international cooperation, for the use of science, culture, cinematography, sport and tourism, for international assistance and so on, among them, office equipment (personal computers, machines), measuring equipment, sound equipment, staged costumes and decorations, moving laboratories and crafts, watercrafts, goose cars, motorcycles, sports aircraft, books, newspapers, magazines, musical instruments and objects for religious operations.
In the press service, Mintrans RF “Investments” said that they had prepared binding orders on the ports of Kerchi, Sevastopol, Yalta, Feodosia and Eupatoria, which provided for a simplified procedure for the entry and exit of small-scale, sports, and leisure ships in the seaport.
The mandate of the shipowners of the seaports of Crimea is given by Mindrans to ensure that small-scale, sporting, and pedestrian ships enter the seaport and exit the ships listed from the seaport.
Mintrans has also prepared draft orders from the Government of the RF on the approval of the limits of the seaports of the Crimea.
With regard to Yalta and Feodosia, the others are in the process of harmonization, noted in the press service of the department.
Mindrans considered that the Republic of Crime and Sevastopol should be subject to registration in respect of small-scale vessels used for non-commercial purposes.
The problem is that in Russia it is extremely difficult to navigate because of poorly developed infrastructure.
If you look at the south of Italy and France, there is a whole constantly developing industry, with a large number of people involved.
In Russia, everything is actually in place.
Our shoreline is a small, only piece where yachts can be operated round a year, is the Black Sea in Sochi, Gelenjika, Novorossianska, Anapea.
But the great difficulty is that the border service rules are extremely strict in this area: a mass of permits is needed to get out of the boat.
Besides, inside Russia, you're going to go somewhere.
Two days she can go with her fuel, and then she gets the problem where to take it, says the sales director of Nordmarine Denis Novikov.
With regard to yacht storage sites, Moscow and St. Petersburg now have special yacht anchors up to 30 m. The yachts are also sent to storage in Turkey, Finland, Sweden and Germany.
Novokov noted that the buyers of yachts were rich, but the demand for yachts was reduced at the start of the crisis.
The World Bank has granted Ukraine $500 million in loans.
The World Bank approved a new loan project for Ukraine of $500 million for the development of the financial sector.
This was reported by the press of the international organization.
"The new funding will support a number of priority measures to reform the banking sector in response to the financial crisis in Ukraine," the communication said.
The Director of the World Bank for Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine, Cimyao Fanh, said that banking sector reforms would help restore loans to the real economy and encourage economic recovery.
He also noted that the Ukrainian authorities had taken impressive steps to reform the economy and the World Bank had observed the first signs of stabilization.
But because of the serious problems, Fanh calls on the Government of Ukraine to accelerate reforms.
Formerly, the Polish Government approved a loan of €100 million in Ukraine, passed the RIA News.
Prisons are asked to create separate blocks for transgenders.
In October 2015, the Public Council of the Federal Criminal Service (FSIN) on the protection of the rights of convicted persons, among other issues, will discuss the possibility of establishing separate transgender and transvestite blocks in colonies.
A member of the Council, Vladimir Grib, told me about this.
He believed that, depending on the total number of prisoners in Russia who had not been identified with sex, individual chambers, blocks, or even (if there were many such offenders) could be provided for the establishment of a special colony for transsexuals.
However, Vladislav Grib emphasizes that the punishment of citizens in such isolated places should be determined only after the convictions have been carried out by the relevant medical experts, which will prove that the offender is indeed a person identifying himself as a representative of the opposite sex.
Vladimir Grib is confident that the isolation of transgenders from other prisoners will ensure the safety of the executions.
According to him, the proposed practice has been successful abroad: SISOs (where accused before the court's decision) have separate transgender cameras and special blocks in correctional facilities.
Today it is the only way out of working with such criminals.
It is equally necessary to isolate them, since the presence of transvestants and transgenders in ordinary cameras is dangerous for them, it is suffering for their families and the sea problems for the FSIN staff.
The lowering of the traffic by the roommates is guaranteed, says Vladimir Grib.
Depending on the size of the city, the number of offenders with an indefinite sex must and should be calculated where to distribute them.
Some of them don't really need the cameras, the blocks in the prisons.
Yeah, a separate colony is possible if there's a lot of transgenders.
As Grib explained, the block may contain 50 or 100 persons, and if a specialized corps is established in Russia alone, transsexual prisoners will be able to be punished there from any region.
The citizen is held in SISO at the crime scene, so the arrival of transvestants or transgenders from other entities during the investigation and trial is unrealistic, and this is what the Grib considers to be a practice for those already convicted in a separate colony.
It is recalled that law enforcement officials have not been able to determine in which male or female investigator Dmitria Kozukova (known as Alina Davis) was detained for drug trafficking, and therefore a man with a virgin was not arrested.
He was released from the house under the signature of a non-passengagement.
This news has been widely discussed in social networks and media, as there is indeed no mechanism to hold transgenders in SISOs and colonies in Russia.
Russian human rights defender, LGBT movement activist (LGBT-Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transsexual) Nikolai Alexeev supported the idea of creating special places to punish transgenders, noting that, abroad, it is also possible to identify men or women in the colony, depending on their own wishes.
Considering the atmosphere in Russian prisons, the proposal is correct.
Yeah, it's a very small percentage, but there's a problem, just as there's a security issue for homosexuals, Alexeeev says.
Prisons should be safe, so individual blocks could be made for this and for homosexuals, more than transgenders in prisons.
However, Alexeiev is doubtful that there will be many citizens in Russia who are willing to give themselves over to transcexuals in order to become different from the ordinary colony.
Of course, medical examinations can be introduced before people are placed in a transgender colony, but not always the same.
For example, in the U.S., one of Chelsea Manning's prisoners looked like a man, and already in prison he said he wanted to change the gender," Alexeyev said.
A man can feel who he likes.
But as long as there are no separate places to punish the transgenders, I doubt that prison officials will think seriously about the safety of such persons and address them or gender identification.
At the same time, an international expert on reproductive health in the territory of FF Boris Lordkipanide noted that the introduction of a new system for the distribution of transsexual offenders into the colony could severely delay the start of the sentence of conviction.
The commission is a matter of sexology, long-term observation by psychiatrists, not one test based on high-prevalence.
Today's psychiatry opportunities allow for this.
Therefore, and before changing sex, potential patients are always going through such experiments - they are showing exactly whether the change in sex with the necessary surgery is a necessary measure, says Lordkipanide.
However, it is difficult for me to imagine how this system should be implemented with regard to the convicted, as the average year for such an investigation is a month.
The doctor, although the idea of creating separate blocks for transsexuals was generally supported, is also suspected that, in the current economic conditions, it would be appropriate to allocate funds for the construction of new premises, medical expertise, transgenders in Russia.
There is no official statistics, but if you take into account the fact that homosexuals in Russia are about 5%, it can be said that transgenders are even less, and those who have such a deviation and still commit crimes, a very small number, said Lordkypanide.
At the request of the colony of homosexuals, transgenders, and so on, may receive certain conditions of content.
Michael Antipov won a junior world chess championship.
The Hanti-Mansijske has completed a world chess championship among young people up to 20 years of age.
The ending of the championship was more intriguing.
The winner was determined only in the last round, and became Russian, Michael Antipov, who had yet to push the fear of Jan-Kshtof Dudou, who would certainly be heading for the title.
The victory girl was celebrated by Ukrainian chessman Natalie Boxes.
The World Chess Championship, which took place from the beginning of September in Hanti-Mansijske, had seemed to have lost almost all of its intrigue, since the Polish representative Jan-Kishtof Duda, who issued a series of four victories (swives under the 13-tour system), had certainly taken the lead.
Considering that Duda was a favorite racer, yes or no, one of the most promising young shammatists, the probability that he would miss the winning break was very small.
And even when Duda got rid of the traffic and allowed the Russian Michael Antipov to reduce the drop to 0.5 points, he remained a clear favourite in the fight for title.
For Antipo had to win on the 13th tour to kill the leader.
But it wouldn't even help you win your party.
In addition, this obligation of victory could, of course, affect the Russian chess game and lead to unnecessary mistakes.
Fortunately, Michael Antipov managed to avoid them.
He must have dealt with Francesco Rambaldi, after which he was forced to wait when his party ended up with Doda, who met Benjamin Boek.
Fortunately, for Antipova, the Polish shammatist fought against the Dutch destroyer.
Thus, Antipos and Duda have taken an equal number of points - 10 out of 13 possible, but Antipos had the best additional indicators.
That is why his leadership of the Hunty-Mansian Autonomous District, whose governor, Natalie Comarov, traditionally devoted great attention to the development of chess in the region, has given the main prize.
And that's not what happened in the competitions for girls with an intriguing ending.
The leader of the tournament, Natalie Buxe (Ukraine) - was not enough to win the title in the last round, which she had done successfully.
Thus, the victory of Russian Alina Bivol did not allow her to touch the Box.
The Russian sportsman remained second, leaving the champion in 0.5 balls.
The impact is changing the regional structure.
The company brings together the Prilgian and Ural regions in one united Volzko-Ural region, Siberia and the Far East - in the Eastern region.
The project will be completed by 1 November.
As said by the Director-General of Wimpelkoma, Mikhail Slobodin, changes are being made to “remain a strong player in the market”, to develop a company “in new, not always favourable external conditions”.
In an interview with the Russian 24 television channel, Mr. Slobodin made it clear that they intended to reduce the "ten per cent" staff in Russia.
He checked 78 Moscow-style Burger King and issued 367 regulations.
As a result, a restaurant on the Volokolam Shose was penalized for 50,000 rubbing and the establishment on the Big Tull Street was closed for 90 days, but resumed work after all violations were eliminated.
43 lockers violated the requirements for the device.
Among other violations, inadequate sanitation and sanitation facilities, non-compliance with ventilation requirements, have been found in some institutions in the bacterium group.
The Burger King brand France belongs to the OOO Burger Russia owner of the Chocolate Network, Alexander Kolobova, and has 293 amazing jobs in Russia.
Igor Artemiev, the head of the FAS, said that the anti-indices department had charged 10 per cent of the freight and hosting charges, as requested by the ODA.
At first, they wanted 17% of the index, and now they want 10%, and even billions of budget subsidies, he said.
We're saying: that's wrong, that's too much, reduce your costs, learn to save, turn away from expensive people, football teams, own TV, stop spending money on the left and right.
He added that FAS had its " much more stringent" proposals that were now being discussed in the Government.
Polymetal is considering a possible net-cost option with Sumeru Gold B.V. instead of implementing a full $300 million share option, the acquiring company reported.
In this case, Polymetal will have to pay Sumeru up to $80 million (the difference between the issue price for Sumeru and market quotes) that can be taken from a free cash flow.
Sumeru has time until 3 October to make an option or to require payment.
The details of the negotiations in Polymetal do not reveal.
The option was included in the purchase of Polymetal Project "Kizil" in Kazakhstan.

Minpromtor: Addressing food aid will not be the same as a card in the USSR.
The Deputy Minister of Industry and Trade of Russia, Viktor Eutuvov, said that the food address aid programme would not be the same as the food distribution system in the USSR.
This is the modern address for food to the population and the support of an effective domestic producer.
I'm asking you not to speculate about the word "food card."
It should be noted, in particular, that the proposed product maps should not be confused with the total deficit over time, a distribution card system where the number of products received is regulated.
We have so far proposed the concept, if it is approved, we will propose amendments to legislation," says Mr. Eutuhova, TASS.
Previously, "U" wrote that a programme for the introduction of food cards for the poor was introduced into the Government.
For more information on the Minpromtorga initiative, read "U" Game of Schwałov ordered the preparation of food cards".

This year's study of the Association of Russian Managers " Top-1000 Russian Managers" is 16th time.
As a tool for assessing the professional reputation of Russian senior managers, the study is conducted by the work of the Russian managers per year, identifying leaders in the sectors and functional areas.
The primary pool of candidates is from last year's award winners.
The winners of last year are invited to confirm their participation as candidates for the current year's rating and to appoint members of their management team.
In addition, each of the candidates included in the initial list of candidates is invited to bring up to ten new managers from other companies, which would be appropriate to add to the overall pool of candidates.
Possible deployment of the following company executives: Financial Director, Business Director, Marketing Director, Personnel Director, IT Director, Public and Corporate Communications Director, Director of Government Relations, Corporate Management Director.
Each proposed expert is invited to participate in the rating and is given the opportunity to make a statement to his management team and up to ten new managers from other companies.
The nomination of industry candidates is based on a sectoral classification of the Association of Managers: information technology, commercial banks, forest and forest processing industry, machinery, media, metallurgics, multi-profile holding, professional services, communications and telecommunications, consumer goods service and manufacturing, insurance, construction, trade, transport, financial sector, pharmaceuticals, chemical industry, energy and fuel complex.
Login and password are provided to each participant for access to www.top1000.amr.ru, where they see information on the remaining participants and can submit their assessments on the criteria proposed for each functional direction.
The rating methodology is based on the principle of "Best Choices" : top managers evaluate top managers, functional managers evaluate functional managers.
Such a principle allows for the highest authentic assessment of the professional reputation of colleagues.
The final results of the rating are approved at the meetings of the expert commissions.
The expert commissions are invited to the meetings of all desirable candidates for the current year's rating and multiple candidates for the previous year's rating.
The Commission is organized on a functional basis: the list of senior management commissions and eight commissions for the approval of executive managers.
The expert commissions are invited to approve the lists submitted in alphabetical order (places are strictly maintained according to the internet assessment and closed information prior to the publication of the rating) or to update them according to the attached list of candidates.
The names of the companies are given in accordance with the rules in the Russian language and the rules of "U".
At the time of publication of the rating, possible changes in the status of managers and companies.
The comfortable rate for the investment is 10-13%.
Experts estimate that the small and medium-sized business lending market in January-April of the current year was 40%.
What do you think is the situation today?
After the panic attacks of late 2014 and early 2015, the amount of ICB's credit decreased significantly.
The reason is a sharp increase in interest rates.
No one benefited from credit below 25-30 per cent of the year.
If the bank had previously been able to raise all its potential problems in the future, from time to time, it could not do so now: rates and so cloudy.
For the business, the current level of ICB credit rates is uncomfortable.
For a large part of the investment projects, the current level is unacceptable in terms of their availability.
The rate of 10-13 per cent would allow business to invest in a wide range of projects and generate attractive income.
How well do you estimate the demand for loans for entrepreneurs?
After a decrease in the percentage rate of the CB, the situation improved slightly.
Credit resources have become more accessible.
However, according to our observations, customers have turned to loans a lot less.
First of all, business does not understand the prospects for its development and future income.
One way to do business today is to learn to work, focusing on today's economic situation in the country and in the region.
It is necessary to monitor the current results more closely, to monitor the flow of money.
At the same time, new technologies should be used to modernize equipment, reduce production and energy costs.
All of this, in the end, enables companies to make production more competitive and to keep business even in a unstable economic situation.
What major developments in the ICB credit market will be strengthened and affected by its development by the end of 2015?
Will the interest rate change?
The forecast for lowering the average rate would depend largely on the policy of the Central Bank, and the regulator now demonstrates consistency in the issue of lowering the key rate.
However, the radical decline in the price of loans for the ICB is not worth waiting for.
In the current situation, inflation is a problem, first of all, which makes it necessary to raise the interest rate for real income.
Moreover, the value of money in Russia will remain high even when the CB rates are reduced.
With regard to the level of delays, traditional small and medium-sized enterprises, limited both in cash and in the options for economic behaviour adjustment, would undoubtedly pose a greater risk to creditors.
I would not expect a substantial reduction in the proportion of bad loans.
The main reason is international sanctions and their negative impact on the economy.
New Mazda CX-5 and street fashion.
This is how the word Mazda is written by Japanese hieroglyphics.
Beautiful, laconic and at the same time difficult for those who are accustomed to Cyrillic or Latin.
So is the new CX-5 crossover, as well as any other brand model: an attractive outside, technically made inside.
Japan has simply been able to connect its "Japanese" to the products of the rising sun to the state of full dawn.
It may be appropriate to argue in favour of cars from other countries, and even in principle, the person will agree with these arguments, but the whole conversation will spread from the final phrase: "But this is a Japanese car!
Don't argue about it!
Such people should probably love not only technology but also other Japanese.
Quoting from Basse's walk, preparing a tobacco meal, collecting catacombs, and dressing your friend - not in kimono, of course, but in Japanese street fashion canons: sweet, creative and very unexpected.
Please, Japanese school form is the only form that girls enjoy and after school.
It has amazing properties: both sensitive and strict at the same time.
And the older the girl, the sweetest step.
Main change in appearance CX-5 is a five-line horizontal radiator grid.
But where does the car change the shape of the new image of the headlamp and the rear lamps, which the car is currently known in the car stream?
As before, Mazda CX-5 looks very flattering.
The silhouette is harmonious, the shapes are sensitive, but the appearance is tight.
No need to call the police.
Under the CX-5, one of the safest in the world, only Japanese peace can be experienced.
The 2.2 litre diesel engine provides a high torque in a wide range of speeds.
In this context, the fuel consumption of this engine is 175 L.C., with a total of 5.9 L. A total of only automatic transmission and full output.
Black boots, black coat, black bag...
To add a little black humour to this image, you can select the leggins with a print from the Not Cross police tape.
On the other hand, in Mazda, they made the most of their efforts so that you would not be on the scene of your own VAT.
In order to increase comfort, while maintaining excellent governance, the subjugation of front and rear amortizers has been redesigned, as well as optimized the shape of the front-end gears.
The full drive system has been adapted under Russian conditions.
The level of noise from roads and high-speed engines decreased by 13 per cent.
The bathroom in a flower or pole is as boring as the budget seat.
It's another matter if a girl is growing up in a bathroom with an original drawing.
For example, from a computer game in a roll-fighting genre.
She will then receive no less attention than the new CX-5!
The new CX-5 improves the design of both front and rear seats, which provides optimal space for both wide shoulders and long legs - who has anything.
Even longer, the emphasis on the front of the central tunnel is likely to be soft and do not fall on the thighs in expressions.
The widest set of active safety systems for Mazda is proposed at CX-5.
Radars, lasers and cameras are used to identify potential threats.
There is both adaptive lighting, and a warning of the rise from the field, and monitoring of the dead zones, and safe braking.
Mazda CX-5 has one of the best luggage in the class.
The comfortable, minimally speaking, is a load of 561 litres. The rear seats are composed of 4:2:4 - each section is supplied with a separate yield line - and increases the baggage section to 1560 litres.
The costume of a hero multifilm in Japan is called "siggurums."
It's particularly expensive. It looks like a kigurumi-pjam.
She can do anything!
Of course he's asleep.
But it's still about having fun with little kids.
Or just walk that beast down the street...
It's so great when there's an opportunity to choose -- a dress, a behavior or a car.
Thank you for your assistance in preparing the Kawaicat shop material.
Kiev has broken the atomic union.
Kiev formally rejected Ukraine ' s cooperation with Russia with the AES Hmelnik.
The High Council, however, voted on Wednesday with a second attempt to break the agreement with Moscow.
Arrangements for the addition of the third and fourth blocks were signed in 2010-2012, but the project had not yet been implemented.
On Wednesday, the Supreme Council of Ukraine adopted a law derogating from the 2010-2012 agreement with the RF on the construction of the third and fourth blocks at the AES Hmelnik.
The draft law adopted by the Government was only made by a second vote, and for the first time 210 MPs supported it at a minimum of 226, but then 234 members of Parliament voted in favour of the draft.
The initial project Hmelnikka AES was to have four 1 GVt power blocks with VWR-type reactors, but only two were able to build.
The accession negotiations with Moscow led to the conclusion of an intergovernmental agreement by 2010 and the Council adopted the relevant laws in 2011-2012.
Since no funds were available in Ukraine's budget, it was assumed that building blocks would be owed to the Russian side, but no funds had been allocated.
Following the conversion to Kiev in February 2014 and the subsequent cooling in relation to the two countries, Kiev began to undermine its relations with Moscow in the nuclear industry, declaring its refusal to cooperate on the AES Hmelnik and on the project of construction of the nuclear fuel plant in Ukraine.
The only area where relations remained remained was the purchases in the FF fuel for active Ukrainian AES (approximately half of the electricity generation in the country), as the Ukrainian NAEC "Energoat" replaced Russian supplies with something.
The AES Hmelnik and other contractors in Ukraine have not yet finally declined: negotiations with Czech Skoda JS have been announced in Kiev in 2014.
UN Gensec against the use of military force in resolving the Syrian conflict.
UN Secretary-General Pan Ki-moon reported during the press conference that the situation in Syria could not be resolved by military means.
"There is no military solution," the AP replied to the question of military support from Syria by Russia.
Mr. Gui Moon also announced that he would meet with the Foreign Ministers of the United Nations Permanent Council member countries on the situation in Syria.
I will meet with the heads of UNSCR permanent member states later this month.
"There will be a meeting in Syria," he said.
Earlier today, Deputy Chief of Genstab VS Russia Nikolai Bogdanovski reported that Genstab did not rule out the possibility of establishing a future VS base in Syria.
There's no such plan.
"But anything can be," said Mr. Bogdanovski.
Earlier, U reported that the United States did not trust the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, who stated that military assistance to the official Damascus was needed to combat the FF- prohibited terrorist group "Islamic State".

The OSCE reports a possible meeting of the Ukrainian and Russian parliamentarians.
The head of the delegation of Ukraine to the Parliamentary Assembly (PA) of the OSCE, Arthur Gerasimov, reported on the possibility of a bilateral meeting this year with Russian parliamentary colleagues to discuss the situation in the south-east of Ukraine.
"What I know is that a certain meeting is planned this year, perhaps between Ukrainian and Russian parliamentary delegations," says Mr. Gerasimov.
He also called for the implementation of mine agreements and the return to the normal viability of our countries.
In his view, the dialogue between Ukraine and Russia at the parliamentary level, whether it is possible, in " Normandy" or in the form of a contact group on the part of the OSCE, Mr. Gerasimov noted that the dialogue had been held, that there were mine agreements.
At the same time, the policy states that Kiev supports any kind of dialogue.
The former representative of Ukraine in the negotiations, the former President of the country, Leonid Kuczma, said that the self-declared Donets and the Luganian Republic had not changed their positions in the tripartite negotiations, but the tenacity of the dialogue had become more positive.
The parties were given mandates.
Yesterday, the Election Commission of the Netherlands led the elections to the municipal council on the municipal district by distributing 12 parliamentary mandates on the party lists.
Traditionally, many complaints of electoral violations were made by the representatives of the CRC accused of “covering counterfeits”.
No comments from the opposition were received.
The Russian Communist Party has also refused to hold a referendum on the abolition of multi-quarter house car rental.
The city election officially presented the results of the elections in the pride of the Lower New York City in the municipal electoral district.
The total number of voters in the Netherlands was 1.03 million, the ballots for the field commissions were 746.7 thousand, and 268 thousand voters were elected.
More than 11.7 thousand ballots were declared invalid and 24 lost.
Yesterday, 12 mandates were distributed to political parties, depending on their votes.
The list of six seats in the pride of Russia is based on Dmitria Svatkovski, Dmitria Krasnovo, Vasili Supranov, Elizabeth Solonchenko, Vaceslav Rasteriev and Igor Nagorno.
The sole mandate of the LDPR was given by the leader of the party, Vladimir Girinovski.
The two mandates of CRC are shared between Vladimir Bulanov and Mr. Alexander Tarnaev.
The three mandates of the Fair Russia are given to Alexander Racmussky, Igor Bogdanov and Mikhail Shalugin.
For five days now, these candidates must determine whether they will work as mayors in the urban order: in the event of a refusal of the mandate, they will go to the next candidate on a part-session.
The Chairman of the Goizbircoma Alexander Maceev informed the members of the Commission that he would introduce a "declaration of telegrams to Girinovski and others" for refusal of mandates.
With the approval of the protocol on the outcome of the elections, the representatives of CRC reported multiple violations.
A member of the summit with the right to vote by the CPRF, Leonid Krasnokutski, proposed not to acknowledge the outcome of the four rounds No.21-24, recalling that, under the authority of the head of the Administration of the Sormous Region, the entrance to the administration building was closed, where four district commissions had been available.
Within a long time, neither members of the House of Commons, nor candidates themselves, nor observers, were able to pass, and the rational scandal with the door of the Home Administration was shown on the television.
At the meetings of the district commissions, all observers and members of the commissions with the right to vote had the opportunity to attend.
Their head had stopped access only when the vote had ended and the local commissions had not yet arrived to deliver their ballots.
This was done to prevent various provocations.
"The head was repaired, and at all meetings interested persons could be present," said a member of the elected Natalia Andrhushin.
The Communists objected to the fact that the blocked administrative building had illegally held the deputy of the Ludmil Aristov Congregation for more than four hours, in which a statement was sent to the investigative committee.
The opposition also regretted that, on the day of the elections, a number of WIKs began to print the ballots at 6-7 a.m., giving them tickets for the preliminary vote.
However, the members of the Committees with the right to a meeting vote and observers had not been notified, so they had already arrived at the opening of the elections on 8 a.m.
The Communists are convinced that in the morning before the opening of the polling stations in the urn, they could throw out the ballots uncontrollable.
However, the mountain, which has already considered more than 124 complaints on various occasions, says Alexander Maceev, has not found any violations of the unrecorded ballots.
The members of the Commission and their colleague's proposal from the Fair Russia, Maria Popovov, were not supported by the note to go out with the amendments to the regional legislation in order to make it clear that the time had been set for the opening of the envelopes with the minutes, which then fell into the clock.
"In your own initiative, even in the CEC," advised Ms. Popova Alexander Makeev.
At the end of the meeting, CPRF member Sergey Samohin, who shouted that the election would ignore dozens of complaints and cover the defamation of elections.
"You're not here at the meeting, be careful!" the president of the election.
As a result, the Protocol was approved almost unanimously.
By 27 September, the electorate had to approve the general outcome of the elections, after which the first meeting of the City Hall of the sixth Assembly would be held within three weeks.
In addition to determining the results of the elections, the city electoral commission rejected the Russian Communist Party's political party in registering an initiative group to hold a local referendum.
According to the documents, the parties were going to discuss two issues for the low-towners: do they agree that multi-quadred houses should be “cut off immediately” and the rates for housing and municipal services “frozen by 2020”.
However, Irina Maslova's lawyer explained that the treatment of the Russian Communists was contrary to the law.
FedEx is a mixed character, downsizing 2016 forecasts.
FedEx was concerned with the negative results of the last quarter, and the delivery service giant reduced the annual income forecast due to the decline in demand for freight services and increased costs in its sub-division of land transport.
The company also stated that it was planning to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for holidays.
At the same time last year, FedEx announced that he would hire 50,000 temporary workers for the holidays.
Its shares amounted to about 2.5 per cent in the preliminary trades in 45 minutes before the opening of the stock exchange on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. stated that he was planning to earn from $10.40 to $10.90 in the financial year, which ended next May, 20 cents less than in the previous forecast.
Analysts estimated $10.84 according to the FactSet review.
A reduction in the forecast was observed despite an increase of 4.9 per cent on average, which would enter into force on 4 January, and an increase in land transport charges for heavy or heavy goods beginning in November.
The company stated that it was still planning to increase surpluses compared to last year by reducing costs, increasing gross income and increasing online trade.
The President and CEO Fred Smith said that the company “worked stablely on the basis of the weak, compared to the forecast, economic conditions, especially in production and world trade”.
The work force plans for the holidays were announced on the following day after the competitor ' s statement, UPS, that they planned to hire an additional 95,000 staff, about as much as they had been employed last year.
For the quarter that ended 31 August, FedEx earned $692 million, 6 per cent more than a year ago.
The share income was $2.42, close to an average of $2.44 for the Zacks Investment Research survey of 12 analysts.
Income increased by 5 per cent to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts surveyed for Zacks estimated $1.23 billion.
FedEx has suffered in recent years from a decline in the international transport sector, resulting in a lack of gross income in its express-transition division.
However, the purchase boom on the Internet has greatly improved the results in FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, the land-use receipt rose by 29 per cent, but operating income remained generally unchanged due to increased costs for major missions and self-insurance.
The express-transition unit received higher income due to higher basic rates, while income in the freight sector fell due to increased wage costs.
In the preliminary trades about an hour before the opening of the FedEx stock exchange fell by $3.85 or 2.5 per cent to $150.15.
They closed on Tuesday, falling by 11 per cent per year and by 17 per cent below the record of 11 June.
The Federal Reserve System leaders will hold a two-day meeting that week at the 27-foot table of the Honduras red tree, deciding whether to raise the key interest rate for the first time in almost ten years.
At one end of the richly decorated room for two-storey high-level meetings, the image of the United States will be recorded.
This map reminds us that the President of the Federal Reserve System, Janet L. Yellen, and her colleagues, must place the economic interests of the country above all others.
The Central Bank received a double mandate from Congress: to maximize employment in the United States and to maintain stable prices here.
But since the Great Recession, the heads of the Federal System have recognized that there is also a third, unwritten order: financial stability.
And this third order may be an unknown factor in the almost projected decision, which will be announced on Thursday, whether the US economy is ready to withdraw from the unprecedented incentive provided by almost zero short-term interest rate since the end of 2008.
Even when most data show a confident economic growth, recent shocks on world financial markets can also hold the Federal System leaders cautiously from adding volatility by raising the base rate on federal funds, even at only four percentage points.
"It is clear that the labour market and inflation will be the first and most important subject of consideration," said Lindsey M. Pyegza, the chief economist of the broker company Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"I think that if they were looking for a reason not to raise the rates that have increased uncertainty around the world market, it would be enough to justify them to wait any longer," she noted.
There is no consensus on what they are doing in the Federal Reserve system, which is causing the financial market fluctuations in itself.
About half of the economists recently surveyed in Bloomberg forecast an increase in the interest rate this week.
The financial markets, however, expect the Federal system to refrain from this, while the key indicator shows only about 30 per cent of the probability of rapid recovery.
This may lead to a decline in the stock market if the Federal System raises the interest, provided that those who decide do not slow down the promise that the next increase will be soon.
On Tuesday, Dou-Johns' index rose to 228.89, or 1.4%, to 16,599.85.
The summer was driven by expectations that people who define the federal system strategy would be leaving the rate this week, said John Lonski, the leading economist of the Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would be a surprise if the Federal System would increase the rates at this time," he noted.
If the Federal Reserve System leadership does so, “they will have to go far in adopting their strategy to keep financial markets in their hands so that they don’t panic”.
Other experts objected that the increase in the rate could calm the financial markets, as this would remove uncertainty as to how the Federal System would operate.
The Federal system seems to have set a rate of 0.25 per cent this month, making the first small step in the slow tightening of the financial conditions, which could confirm the strength of the US recovery.
Yellen said in the spring and early summer that she was expecting an increase in the rate this year, despite the liberal complaints that there was a need for greater economic progress.
Although the emergence of new jobs slowed in August, the labour market growth was stable this year.
Unemployment decreased to 5.1 per cent last month, which was the lowest rate in over seven years, and almost at the level that the Federal system considered full employment.
The increase in wages shows signs of acceleration.
While inflation continued to be below the target of 2 per cent of the annual central bank, the leadership of the Federal System stated that the temporary effect of a sharp drop in oil prices had been a key factor.
The economy “may be able to cope with higher rates and needs them, given the reduction of the labour market,” said Ian Schefferdson, chief economist Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, financial markets all over the world began to shake at the end of last month, after China had devalued its currency.
The Dou-Johns average index for industrial companies fell by 16 per cent relative to a record high in May, as investors feared that China's slowdown could slow world growth.
The market has partially restored its position this month, and the Dou-Johns index is now about 10 per cent below the high level of May.
In order to manage the Federal Reserve System, market reprisals are further complicated by the simple calculation of the increase in interest rates.
"In the absence of information about what happened in the financial markets and news about the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks, they would have turned their backs on this meeting," said Steven D. Oliner, senior researcher UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and former Federal Reserve Officer.
Now, according to his forecasts, they will wait at least a month to gain more control over the consequences.
"There is great uncertainty about how the US economy can be affected, and they have almost no reliable data since the recent events in China," Oliner said.
The health of the world economy is not a major concern of the Federal System, and it should not be technically taken into account in the adoption of these decisions.
But essentially, the Federal Reserve system has become the world financial power.
The impact of the Central Bank in recent years has been tremendous.
Only one announcement from then President Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Federal Reserve System could "deplete" its monetary expansiveness caused the shocks of markets around the world.
In a world where markets and economic systems are increasingly intertwining with one another, it could be expected that the leaders of the Federal Reserve would not only monitor developments everywhere but also consult representatives of other Central Banks and experts to better understand the world economy.
Their decision-making process is "better art than science," noted Zakari Karabell, head of Investnet Inc, a company that is engaged in global state management strategies.
Jeffrey Laker, President of the Richmond Federal Reserve Bank, Virginia, noted this month that “there have been cases of an excessive reaction in the history of the Federal Reserve System to the movements of the financial market which seem to be unrelated to economic principles”.
Lacer, a member with the right to vote of the influential Federal Open Market Committee, as an example, made decisions 1998-99.
The financial crisis in Asia has led to the federal system lowering its base rate by 0.75% for three meetings, “in spite of the limited identified effects for growth in the United States”, Laker said.
A year later, federal system leaders cancelled these reductions.
The Federal Reserve system should be the first to take care of stability only in times of major crises, such as the market collapse in 2008," said Adam S. Pozen, a former member of the Bank of England interest rate committee.
The last panic didn't get close to this level, he said.
"Of course, you would not want to be in a situation where you are afraid of rising rates because of the shock that markets are experiencing," said Pozen, President of the World Economic Institute for Peterson.
The Federal Reserve System Act still has a dual mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until this is changed, I do not think that they should prevent events.

Speakers of Mr. Sergei Narishkin's opinion allow the United States to destabilize the situation in the Middle East so that the wave of refugees will wander in Europe.
As “Interfax” is transmitted, he has given such an opinion to journalists in Ulan-Bator as part of the October session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly.
"I am not a proponent of conspiracy theories, but I wonder whether it is Europe's ultimate goal for those who have destabilized the situation in the countries of North Africa and the Middle East with such maniac resilience in recent years?" he asked.
"One must have thought and known that the flows of refugees, these unhappy and helpless people who are saved from death, will reach the prosperous EU countries," he added.
Narishkan wondered, "Have many political leaders of Europe openly expressed the causes of this crisis, this wave of refugees, which is now literally destroying their countries?".
"No, old Europe, with a rare exception, prefers to be silent," he observed.
According to Nariškina, NATO supports many European values and norms of international law.
"Europe has, unfortunately, long and impartially seen and observed how the NATO standards of military soap are being broken down by moral ideals and fundamental principles and norms of international law," the speaker stressed.
The opposition of the rebels, mainly of the Islamists, to the government forces and their loyal military forces.
Later, the Turkish terrorist group " Islamic State " , which was banned in Russia, joined the Syrian Government's opponents.
The United States of America supports rebels who oppose both Assad and IG.
The official Damascus considers such rebels to be terrorists.
The President of Syria called the cause of the unfavourable West to Russia.
The West's claims to countries such as Syria, Russia and Iran are in fact that they are sovereign States.
That is what Syrian President Bashar Assad said in an interview with RT, First Channel, Russia 24, NTV, Russia today, TAS, Interfax and the Russian newspaper.
According to Asada, the West does not accept partners and sovereign States.
In those countries, he would like to remove one person and place another in his place, which would be for the benefit of the Western countries, rather than for his family, he noted.
Assad drew attention to the sudden development of Western media with the beginning of a revolution in Ukraine.
According to him, Russia's President Vladimir Putin “turned from the other West to the enemy, the king, the dictator, who suppresses the Russian opposition, which came in a non-democratic way, despite his election as a result of democratic elections in the West”.
Putin called on the world community to unite forces with Assad to fight against the Islamic State.
Commenting on the West's continuing statements that Assad himself must leave, he noted that the President came to power with the consent of the people through the elections, and if he did, on the request of the people, not the United States decision, the UN Security Council, the Geneva Conference or the Geneva Communiqué.
"If the people want him to stay - the president remains and, otherwise, he should leave immediately," he stressed.
Assad called Russia and Iran friendly countries and reminded them that they were cooperating.
Syria is also fighting terrorism together with neighbouring Iraq.
Speaking of military support from Iran, the Syrian leader noted that the country supported the Syrian State in its policies, in its economy and in its military sphere.
He rejected the claim that Iranian military units were being sent to Syria.
Tegeran's supplying us with military equipment.
"Of course, there is an exchange of military experts between Syria and Iran, but this exchange has always been carried out," he explained.
With regard to the rest of the States, we are open to cooperation with any of them, with a serious desire to fight terrorism.
"We don't see this in the case of the so-called anti-terrorism and anti-igular coalition known as the United States," Assad said.
The number of deaths was over 230 thousand, the number of refugees was 11.5 million.
Part of the territory has captured the Islamic State terrorist group, which is banned in Russia.
The International Coalition in the head with the United States is hitting the IH with air.

Reuters refers to the representative of Mr. John Kirby.

Borodai called the U.S. newspaper a curse on the Arrow.
The former president of the Government of the self-declared Donate of the People's Republic of Alexandria Borodai rejected the information published in The Washington Post.
That's what he said in a phone interview with the correspondent "Lenta.ru".
The note in Washington Post is beautiful because it's completely distorted.
The former Minister of Defence of the DND Igorya Strëlkova, of course, has not been linked and "extended" from the territory of the Republic of Donbass in a very subordinated mood, without rope, without three fur money that is attributed to him by different personalities," he noted.
According to Borodya, the story of the Arrow in the conversation with the reporter of the American newspaper has really gone.
"Yes, I said that the arrow was urgently required to remove the territory of the Donkey People's Republic," said the former head of the DND Government.
Borodai stressed that he did not know why the correspondent of the U.S. edition decided to write that the Arrows had been exported to the Russian "connected" territory.
I suspect it's a provocation.
If it is not a provocation, it is a strange misunderstanding of words, because I stressed that the Arrows were gone alone," said Borodai.
"That's a curse on me and the arrow," he said.
Previously on The Washington Post, an article in which Borodya stated that he had taken the arrow to the territory of Russia in a coercive manner.
According to the publication, Borodai noted that he had to bind his fellow.
The Polish authorities began to search for a gold train of the Nazis.
Polish foresters began to cut down trees over the underground tunnel, where, according to some data, they were on a third ray gold train.
The work began on Tuesday, September 15th, Reuters reports.
According to military experts, it is necessary to clear the forest in order to verify the reliability of the railways with the treasures.
Weapons and valuable minerals may be within the train.
On 31 August, the Polish Governor of the Lower Silesian Duke Thomas Smolarz (Tomasz Smolarz) suggested that the new evidence of the existence of a gold train would not be more convincing than that of the previous.
However, the authorities decided to take over the search area.
Three days earlier, the Deputy Minister of Culture of Poland, Petr Zuchovski, stated that local landowners with "99 per cent probability" had found the same train with the gold of the Third Reich mentioned in legends.
Jukhovski noted that if assumptions were confirmed and values were found, they would become property of the State, while the secrets would not be transferred to Russia.
In mid-August, two clients of the legal firm approached the authorities of the Polish city of Valbži with a message that they found a train in a frozen tunnel at a depth of 70 metres.
The Chief Narcotician of the FF proposed that the sale of tobacco to persons under the age of 21 should be prohibited.
Russia's chief drugologist suggested that the sale of tobacco should be prohibited by the age of 21.
Eugenia Brune noted that before this age, “loved psychoactive substance, tobacco, alcohol, drugs, is particularly harmful”.
So he said in the direct air of the Moscow Radio Station, commenting on the fact that speaker Sovfed Valentin Matvinko supported the idea of banning the sale of alcohol to citizens under the age of 21.
The human being is created in a way that is not fair.
You can serve in the army for 18 years, you're physically ready for this.
He has been mentally ready for a full life in society since he was 21.
"It is known from scientific data that the brain, its biochemistry, is finally only creating by the age of 21," said Brun.
Former member of the Public Chamber and head of the project "Treswa Russia" Sultan Hamzaev reported to the "Reports", that Matvinko supported the initiative to increase the age of selling alcohol and "agreed with the Public Chamber to raise this issue again at the top of the House of Parliament".
According to the activist, the Council of the Federation will soon establish a working group to develop a bill under the leadership of Matvinko.
The Bible has been asked to check for compliance with the Law on the Protection of Children
The inhabitants of Novosibirska requested the Regional Prosecutor ' s Office to check the Bible for compliance with the Federal Law on the Protection of Children from Information That Harms Their Health and Development, which was issued on 16 September, by correspondent Sib.fm.
The author of the claim stated that on 26 August 2015, he obtained a Bible at the Chinese City of Krasnos, published in 2013 by the Russian Bible Society.
In the book, he found fragments that, in his view, violated the FZ “Protection of children from information that is harmful to their health and development”.
On 16 September, a statement was adopted by the Public Prosecutor ' s Office of Novosibirsk.
The response to the treatment of Novosibirska will take 30 days.
The point is not to ban the book.
Much more interesting to show the absurdity of the law itself, the complainant commented to the correspondent Sib.fm.
Moreover, it is a fundamental problem that will be brought about by society.
It will begin to read the Bible, which has not been done before.
Brazil's Pediatric Union, Rio-Grandi, promotes healthy food for breast feeding
The Brazilian Paediatric Organization of SPRS has devised a scandalous method to convince women to be fully fed during breast-feeding: the method implies the demonstration of images of infants with breast-feeding as prescribed by images of harmful food.
The breast milk consists of various proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates, from which children receive all the nutrients they need to form a strong immune system.
In view of the high energy requirements of pregnant and pregnant women, it is recommended to increase the daily calorie rate by about 500 calories per day.
However, the recent study shows that one increase in calories is not the only change in the diet that mothers should make.
A recent study conducted by Robert Waterland, Professor of Medical College Baylor in Texas, found that healthy diets of pregnant women actually affect the expression of genes in children and prevent the development of tumours.
Regrettably, the negative effects of malnutrition on the immune system of the child have been identified.
A school bus broke down under Hamburg.
Near Hamburg, the train crashed into a school bus that stuck on the railway.
The 23-year-old driver, realizing that he could not move from the relays, ordered 60 students to leave the vehicle.
And a minute later, there was a collision in their eyes.
He was filmed by one of the schoolchildren.
An accident caused panic among students.
Some children began to cry and run along the fences.
The road is still blocked.
According to the police, no one was affected by a miracle except for one passenger who had been injured easily.
Accidents were estimated at EUR 300 thousand.
Doctors are calling for a ban on boxing.
The Australian Medical Association (AMA) led to ban boxing in the country after the death of local sportsman David Brown.
On Monday, 28-year-old Brown died from the trauma received in isolation with Filipino Carlo Magali.
The fight for one of the regional titles of the International Boxing Federation (IBF) in the weight of up to 57.15 kg last Friday ended with the victory of Magali by the 12th round.
Brown fell into a hospital with a brain tumor.
His condition was considered critical, and he was connected to life-saving equipment.
In the professional ring Brown won 22 victories, suffered only two defeats, and one battle ended with destruction.
He's got two kids left.
This has already been the second case of a summer break among Australian boxers in the last six months.
In March, a 23-year-old student named Bradon Smith died from a ring injury.
AMA now recommends not to engage in this kind of sport, but rather, in its view, that it be banned at all.
I understand that this is happening unintentionally, said Vice-President Steven Pernis.
But in the way that there is a box now, there will always be situations where a sportsman gets blood flow or brain damage, leading either to death or to serious injury.
That's why AMA believes that we can't keep living with it.
The Australian Medical Association is an independent professional structure that combines practitioners and medical students.
Sergei Narishkin called upon the OSCE to abolish sanctions on the FP parliamentarians.
Speaker Gosmunda RF Sergei Narishkin called the imposition of sanctions against parliamentarians.
He said that, speaking at the OSCE PA session in Ulan-Bator.
We consider this to be an unacceptable act, such as the rise in the value of parliamentary diplomacy.
"This should not be repeated because it is a manifestation of political intolerance and a disregard for the principles of open international dialogue," said the politician.
In addition, Narishkin called on the OSCE participants to restore the partnership between Russia and the EU.
Let's put morality back in politics.
Let us return dialogue and the right to practice international communication.
Let's put humanistic ideals back in a democratic order.
"The duality never ended well," he said.
Speaking from the House of Parliament, the speaker of the Russian Government called on parliamentarians to convene an inter-Parliamentary contact group on Ukraine.
I call on members of the Assembly to focus on the following specific security challenges.
"First, to solve the Ukraine crisis by negotiating and bringing our inter-Parliamentary group together," Narishkin said.
He also noted the need to pay tribute to the OSCE.
"This is almost the only common area where they are still discussing how to normalize the situation in Ukraine," said the politician.
The session of the Parliamentary Assembly was opened on Tuesday, 15 September, in Ulan-Bator, and extended until 18 September.
He enjoyed winning a couple of days.
The World Championship on Easy Athletic Sergey Shubenkov.
This season can be called triumphal for the 24-year-old athlete from Barnaul Sergey SHUBENKOVA.
He was able at his crown distance of 110 meters with barriers to win at the European Command Championship, to establish several records, and mainly to become a world champion, the first in the history of the national barrier print.
In addition, the sportsman has recently won the final stage of the British League, taking third place in the general reading.
The "New News" asked Shubenkov to share the impressions of the coming season.
Sergey, the season is not over for you yet?
Yeah, I'm going to go to World War Games, which will take place in October in Korea, and then I'll think about rest.
True, I'll be ready now at the house in Barnau, and being at the house is a completely different situation.
It's easier than going around the world every week.
You said the fall is the favorite time of the year for you.
At the end of August, the beginning of September was a wonderful time.
After the main start of the season, the load of responsibility is gone.
It's a pleasure to meet you at the "slabon."
Plus, you know, vacations are about to...
What about fatigue?
Still the season is special, the mass of positive emotions...
The fatigue of the end of the season is always tiring.
And it doesn't matter what he did anymore - he played or he played.
Every competition is stress.
Permanent crossings, transfers, all of this is not going to happen to the body indefinitely.
You get up physically and emotionally.
But now, of course, I have emotions.
What's there? I'm just happy!
As soon as you finish the World Cup in Beijing, you come back a lot?
There is.
And you journalists don't let me forget about it.
But in general, I believe that the bad sportsman who lives with the old victories is turning his successful escapes again and again.
He's been enjoying a few days' victory, and we need to move on.
Did the preparation for this remarkable season differ greatly from the usual?
I can't say that there was something special.
We started cooking in December, but I missed the winter competition season.
He was first trained at the house in Barnaule, then at the meetings, then at home again.
It's just as usual.
But the coach and the coach were asked to try to go to a new level I haven't been to yet.
Almost all the winter time they spent building a base.
They've run a bunch of cross-sections, they've been trained in the physical training, which included both the burden and the jury, and we've gone back and forth.
Then, after the barber training, a lot of technical work was done.
For the way the opponents speak, did they follow?
I'm always trying to do this, and good times in the Internet are no problem.
He saw the winter champion of Europe, and there the whole pededestal was taken by the French!
I thought, there's something I need to do to get this company out of here.
With each start in this season, you added and added results.
Did that give you confidence?
I've got all these last seasons in about the same pattern.
It's not like I'm running 13.20 first, and then it's 13.50.
I always break my shape gradually.
The main thing you wanted to do is get out of here in 13 seconds.
All the work was aimed primarily at this outcome.
But the paradox is that you feel like you're ready for a show, and the competitions are not always ready.
How was that, for example, at the Olympics in London?
I'm, if you're right, that semi-final run (Shubenkov couldn't go to the final.
It was ready very well, it really could have escaped in 13 seconds.
Even if he repeated his best result at the time, he would be the bronze player of the game.
But it didn't work.
Remember your first world championship?
How so?
It was in Teg.
I really wanted to go to the finals, it was such a maximum program.
And he broke off from tomorrow, in the preamble.
Then he realized that to break and wear a head fracture means not to go anywhere.
Two years later, at the World Cup in Moscow, he went to the finals with the best time.
I remember my feelings before the decision-making exercise: I really wanted to win the gold by then!
How do you manage to develop a high speed, not lose your head, not turn off?
And that's the most difficult thing to do.
It needs to be very accurate, focused on technology so that there are no barriers.
He noticed that when you're focused not on the result, but on the process, it's so much easier.
And it's the coffee when you feel like you're running away and it's like you're getting yourself!
To be honest, it's worth it.
Many of our deep - seated athletes are trying to move closer to the capital.
Has there never been such a thought?
It's better at home anyway.
I don't know where I'm without my coach. Who do I need?
Maybe it would be better to have conditions better, but I'm trying to be happy with what I have.
C The keys you've been together for a long time?
Since he was 12 years old, since he came into the light athletics.
More precisely, I first trained with his wife, who worked with the children, and then she handed me over.
He started it with a syringe, and then in the length, it's a triangular.
There was a baby bulwark -- it's when the ball is aimed, it's coming in the distance from the place...
At 14 he tried to run with the barricades, and I liked it.
From the very first, it was possible to comply with the rules of the second adult level.
That's it.
There's never been any fear of barriers?
It was a deal with them right now.
But there was always a lot of work to be done on technology.
How much worse it was for him!
But there's no way out of this routine.
The technique needs to be constantly removed - so that I can wake up at night, I get up right away and run through the barriers.
All those who saw your escape to Beijing claim it was a very beautiful escape.
Thank you.
I liked it myself.
I usually don't rethink my escapes, and I couldn't stay here.
But there is no scope for improvement to work on effectiveness.
Don't you fear now that the victory of the year before the Olympic Games is a heavy burden on your shoulders?
As they say, I am trying to justify my expectations.
Once he chose this path, he must go to the end.
My coach likes to say, if you're not weak, you don't have to feel any extra stuff.
And I totally agree with him.
Otar Kushanashville
Well, I'm not so naive as to be led by an amazing reaction to the interview that happened in Ukraine.
People are mad, I understand, their bread is not fed. Give it to the enemy.
And even though I wasn't fooled by the flag, and the same thing, millions of times I spoke here, and I didn't call anyone directly, another thing happened to me.
All my pseudo-friends drowned in a second.
The pressure that I'm subjected to is so strong that even I, the kind of peer, think that the white people are in trouble.
It's like he's walking, he's walking, and you're being hit by a mob, and you're going to mutate your fingers.
But I need to know, I'm not a room eagle, I'm a doll, I'm out of the hood, I'm old, I'm scared.
Another case is no support.
I had no idea, but now...
I've always had the best self-sufficiency, so taste it.
And to give passports to people like Fred Derst or Monson, they can only be fools.
I'd rather, a better journalist, work is ruined.
A week ago in Kiev, Otar Kushanashvili briefly described Crimean events:
What they did to the Crimean Peninsula is a crime.
That's what they call "anxiety."
I believe that the reference to the way that the anointed Christ has been trying to sign something is not at all included in the common picture of human society.
It's how to get to the neighbor and take his place...
The war from Kremlin went, and it's just going to end there.
I'm almost 100% sure that, like in the summer of 2008, she started calling some asshole from the Kremlin lock.
I'm guessing who that could have been...
Coconut's not so much alive anymore.
I don't understand, he's the greatest artist, why he needs to touch Putin's hands.
He's losing his apartment?
Well, they took his memory.
Of course, the people remembered him as an insult to their little family.
And reconciliation now depends only on Vladimir Vladimirović.
Sunrise 7 is leading a rating despite the efforts of the 9th leader to highlight today's show
Carl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson in Canberra to highlight the consequences of the Liberal Party's statement on the release of the leader's seat failed to raise the rating today.
The morning of the 9th show was broadcast from the capital of the State after the collapse of Malcolm Ternbull Tony Ebbot.
The competitor, Sunrise, with David Kokh and Samantha Armitage, stopped in London as part of a weekly international news series, which also includes Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancún.
This torture seemed to have little significance for Australian television broadcasters, while the Sunrise audience had 397,000 spectators in the five largest cities compared to today's audience in 339,000.
Today has taken a little more than his rating on Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but his figure was worse than last Thursday (343,000).
Today has reduced the break with Sunrise in recent months.
In August today there were 318,000 compared to 330,000 in Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, there was a gap between 40,000 and 50,000.
As of September, the Sunrise has 349 000 viewers against 314,000 at Today.
It's the most interesting thing that's been going on all morning.
Winds of change affect more than Parliament this morning, guys!
Carl and Lisa are fine, thank you for your clarification.

An important news for the Seventh was a stunning debut 800 Words with the former star series Packed to the Rafters Eric Thompson.
The new drama about a newly elected father of the family, who decided to move to New Zealand on the coast with his two children, gathered an impressive audience of 1,219 million spectators.
Critics wondered if Tomson could handle a popular show alone without the stars Rafters Rebecca Gibney.
The result of last night's dinner is a huge answer to yes.
The X Factor 7 remained in strong positions with an audience of 1,136 million, easily surrounded by The Block (838 000) and TBL Families (726 000).
For the seventh, the success and failure of the second night, Chase Australia.
The first half-hour (from 17:00 to 17:30) of the new television set by Andrew O'Kiffi brought together 446 000 viewers.
The second half (from 17:30 to 18:00) scored up to 623,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Hot Seat Eddy McGwar (613 000).
On Monday evening, the first half hour of Chase Australia gathered 520,000 spectators, and the second half was a flood of 720 000.
Hot Seat's got 620,000.
The fall of Chase Australia's ratings on the second night will make the Ninth quietly admit that Hot Seat will still dominate at 5.30.
Chase Australia is a million dollar minute replacement that couldn't play the MacGwar show.

Three finalists agree that "Holostyak" Sam Wood is the perfect guy, but who will he choose?
A secret revealed?
Lana Jevon-Fellow, Sarah McKay and Snow Markoski may have accidentally given an idea which of them wins the Holocaust.
A woman with whom Sam Wood will finally stay in Holostjak, surrounded by a veil of secrets.
And the three girls who came to the finish, of course, keep silent about who got his last rose.
But when we met with Sara McKay, Snow Marksky and Lana Jewons-Fellows before the day when the three girls will have to stay two, they may have given an unwelcome hint about the winner.
Sam Wood keeps silent until the final, which will take place on Thursday.
All three women come into the lyrical mood, explaining why Wood was the perfect man, who mentioned his feelings of humor, zeal, family values, and joy as the reasons for each of them being happy to be his satellite.
But with their answers to the question, "If not for you, who should be given the last rose of Wood?", they could hardly tell who really conquered the heart of Holostika.
Jewons-Fellows and Marcoski no doubt called McKay the ideal pair for Wood.
From the first day, Sarah and Sam had a good relationship.
"From the moment I joined the participants, I felt the energy (Sarah) and the energy of Sam and understood that they were very close to each other, and the whole show had no doubt about it," said Jewons-Fellow.
"Sarah is a very open person, easy and fun with her," said Markoski.
I've seen them together, there's really a bond between them.
They feel beautiful and comfortable with each other.
Sarah McKay thinks she and Sam Wood will have a great couple.
Mackey himself said that she realized last week that Wood was probably the same person.
"As soon as I saw him between my friends and relatives, I realized it wasn't just a game - I trusted him with all my heart," she says.
If it wasn't for Wood to be chosen, she would have answered yes.
"I don't know if I can talk about it," she said.
I like both girls the same way, and Snow and Lana deserve it equally.
The Bachelor's show ends Wednesday at 7.30 p.m. on the Ten Canal.
Originally published as "Sarah is the best choice of Sam Wood?"
Jarrid Haine had several career options in NFL.
Detroit and Seattle were very interested in having him moved to the United States, as were many other clubs that sent requests after an impressive open day of training last year.
But Hein chose San Francisco 49ers and Coach Jim Tomsul and it seemed to be a wise decision.
Some of the coaches would leave Hayne on a spare box for the rest of the game for the loss of the ball that the former Australian League of Regby allowed for the first return to the winning game with Minnesota 20-3.
But Tomsula believed in his game and gave Hayne another chance to return the pont, and also put him in the game after Reggie Bush's trauma.
Tomsula showed up on the right side and after the game, in the split.
Instead of building the gap between the new ones in the presence of the team, he got them.
Tomsula also publicly supported Hayne at press conferences after the match.
A special reporter at the 49ers Club, Kim Inman, reported that Hein also received support from the Special Team Coordinator of Thomas McGoy, who advised him to forget about the lost ball and to think about the next game.
Jared Hean lost his ball at the back of the mini-sawings team in the first quarter.
At the start of the referendum in NCHL Hein and his many Australian worshipers clearly did not count.
It was evident that Hein was crying, leaving the field after the ball was lost, and later he told the leading show "Hamis and Andy" at the Australian radio station 2DayFM 104.1, that he could not present himself a more successful start for a career in the NFL.
"That's the case, you're just thinking about the next game and everything," he said.
Hen compared his career with his debut in the 2007 series of Origins, when a ball win in his starting zone led to the temptation of Queensland.
Finally, this experience proved very useful for the 27-year-old game.
Hen took a photo of the Australian flag and fans after the game and posted a picture on Instagram.

As a result, the Hungarian police applied hydrogen and liquefied gas, Reuters reported.
Migrants have turned down police stones and are trying to bring down a strike on the border.
The clashes are aimed at strengthening, police are responding to acts of aggression by migrants and their attempts to break the border.
As the Agency France-Presse reports, refugees were able to break through the police border, after which dozens of migrants fled to the territory of Hungary.
Some refugees leave the Serbian-Hungarian border on buses heading to Belgrade and the border with Croatia, reports Bi-bi-si.
The country ' s authorities allowed migrants to come to Croatian territory and ensure that they were transported from there to the country they needed.
According to the Hungarian authorities, 20 police officers were injured.
On 15 September, the Hungarian Parliament strengthened the legislation on migration and border protection.
The amendments include the involvement of the army in the protection of state-owned foreigners, the prosecution of those who illegally cross the border, and the accelerated procedure for dealing with asylum applications.
The Hungarian court has already recognized one migrant as guilty of illegal crossing of the Hungarian-Serbian border and will therefore be deported and will not be able to return to Hungary for one year.
The Hungarian Parliament also intends to consider soon the transfer of functions to the Hungarian armed forces to protect the border of the country.
At the end of June, the Hungarian authorities began to build a railway fence of 175 km long on the border with Serbia to prevent the flow of migrants and refugees to the country.
The Russians recognized the greatest in the U.S. history of cybercrime.
Russian cyberattack in the U.S.'s largest history, Vladimir Drinkman, admitted to stealing more than 160 million credit cards, reports Reuters.
During the trial in the state court of New Jersey, Drinkman agreed to have unauthorized access to computer systems and to commit fraud.
During the meeting, the Russians spoke with three Russians and Ukrainian citizens accused of cyberattacks by 15 companies.
The total damage to the accused was estimated at $300 million.
"The respondents, such as Vladimir Drinkman, who have the skills to break our computer networks, pose a threat to our economic well-being, personal life and national security," said U.S. prosecutor Paul Fishman.
Drinkman is in danger of 30 years of imprisonment, as well as a million-dollar fine.
In the case of a sentence, the court shall take into account the recognition of russian and may reduce the time limit.
Drinkman's sentence is announced on 15 January.
Vladimir Drinkman was arrested in the Netherlands in 2012.
Then another suspect, Dmitry Smiljantz, was arrested.
The last of his guilt for the crimes he has committed is denied.
Kerry warned Lavrov about the risk, supported by Russia's Bashar Assad regime.
During a telephone conversation with the head of Russian Mid-Mid Sergei Lavrov, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry warned that the support of Russia's Syrian President Bashar Asada was exacerbating the country's conflict.
"The Secretary of Kerry suggested that the support of Russian President Assad would be at risk of exacerbating and increasing the conflict, as well as destroying our common goal of combating extremism if we were not focused on finding a solution to the conflict in Syria through an effective political transition of power," said the statement published on the website of the United States Department.
Kerry reaffirmed US commitment to combating the Islamic State group (which was banned by the Supreme Court in Russia) in a coalition of more than 60 States.
According to the Secretary, Assad "will never be able to be a reliable member" of the coalition.
Also during the telephone conversation, Kerry stressed that the conflict in Syria could be resolved only through political transition from Assad.
In the White House, Russia was threatened by isolation because of the support of the Assad regime.
Recently, the White House Press Secretary Joshua Ernest threatened Russia with isolation if it did not stop supporting Assad.
As an alternative, Ernest proposed to join an international coalition that is carrying out an anti-terrorist operation against the Islamic State.
In recent times, media have often reported the presence of Russian soldiers in the territory of Syria.
The head of the Russian MIDI, Sergei Lavrov, said that the Russian soldiers had been in Syria for many years and helped the Syrians to seize the technique to use it against the Islamics.
Four were killed when the police opened a gun with resin bullets on the protests in Nepal.
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal when the police started shooting resin bullets in a crowd protesting against the proposed new Constitution, as the official representative said on the Wednesday.
Violence took place on Tuesday evening in Rupanda County, about 175 miles west of Kathmandu, the capital of the country.
The former Chief of the District Police, Dakal, reported that more than 1,000 protestors had gathered at one of the police stations, some had thrown stones and fire bombs.
Mr. Dhakal reported that the police had used liquefied gas, and then fired in the air before leaving the resin pools.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It is not clear why resin bullets, which are known to be killed, are traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, have caused such a high mortality rate.
This conflict was the last few weeks of fierce protests in the southern, equal part of Nepal, where representatives of the people of the Madesi state that new provinces formed under the new Constitution would reduce their political influence.
Protests also took place in the west of Nepal, among the people of the country who want to have their state.
At least 40 people, including eleven police officers, were killed in violent clashes, beginning with 10
August, when the four main political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into a province, it became a decisive step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal, which had been centrally managed for several centuries.
Work on the new Constitution has been under way since 2008, but the legislators have accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
The legislators voted in favour of the draft constitution in Kathmandu this week, and the officials said that the new chapter would be signed by Sunday.
Syansk plans to set up an enterprise at 900 jobs.
Sayansk is the youngest city in the Irkutsk area.
It was built in the 1970s as a center of the chemical industry, with developed infrastructure requiring system support.
A year ago, Syansk headed a new mayor, Oleg Borovski.
As a result of the first year of work, he described new projects and prospects to the Correspondent of the Area.
Oleg Valerjevic, what did you start working for as a mayor?
First of all, I have been familiar with the results of the audit of financial and economic activities, initiated an independent audit of the expenditure of the local budget.
An audit of municipal property was then carried out.
One of the first practical steps has been to reduce document combating up to five days.
Previously, the papers by the institutions could have walked for months.
Income-based and cost-optimization activities have been developed.
In November last year, a government visit was held in Sayansk, which addressed the issues of the socio-economic development of the Territory.
There was no project documentation (PSD) for any object in the city.
Without that, Sayansk could not participate in federal programmes.
We started preparing the PSD on the road, the children's garden, the northern sewer and the water.
The road work in two locations is now under way.
How is the President of the RF's order to build children's gardens being implemented in the city?
In July of this year, 105 children were born in Saanska.
Such a positive demographic in the city has not been observed for the past 27 years.
So the issue of the security of places in children's gardens is one of the most relevant today.
As of 1 September, children ' s capital repairs No. 10 were closed at 320 seats.
The estimated repair value is 86 million rubles.
The city has never received such funds before.
Last year after the repair, a children's garden No. 23 was opened, which is now visiting 200 children.
The refurbishment was made in terms of co-financing from the regional and local budgets, and its value was over 67 million rubles.
Thanks to the efforts of the Administration and the assistance of the regional Government, funds for the purchase of furniture and equipment were sought, and the National Initiatives programme also helped.
There are plans to start the construction of a new child gift in 2016.
With its introduction, we plan to eliminate the order of children between the ages of half and three.
We don't have anything special for children from three to seven years old.
Are investors interested in the territory?
We have a clear understanding that construction in the city must be done, above all, by the Chinese companies, that they need to be provided with work.
In October, a 60-quarter-year-old children's home in the Leningrad microregion is already in operation.
With regard to construction, I will add that Sayansk is one of the four cities of Priangaria, which has entered the class housing programme.
All necessary documentation has been prepared.
The construction of 90 block sections will begin soon.
We have all declared the construction of 10,000 sqm of the homes of those wishing to participate in the programme very much.
One condition is that the apartment is not worth 30,000 rubles per square metre, which includes the "under the key" section.
If we deal with the assigned amounts, we will continue to participate in the programme.
With regard to investors, we have other interesting projects.
In time, the Sayan pig complex was built in the territory, which was sold at no cost in 2004.
We're working with the prosecutor's office to counter this deal.
More than the underworld is in federal property.
Working with Moscow, dealing with the transfer of 88 ha to the area property, with the subsequent transfer of land to the municipality.
There is a potential investor who is ready to invest in reconstruction and launch the 1.5 billion rubles project.
With a pig gun, we're going to have 900 jobs, which will be a great support for the city.
A social partnership institution is being developed in Sainsk?
We have about 140 treaties in the socio-economic partnership.
A number of projects have been implemented through the active social position of business representatives.
Efficient support is provided by companies such as East-Center, New Zealand TEC, the Sayan Broiler, the MDF PC, the management of these enterprises is responsive to all treatment.
Directly to the day of the OOO City, the Sayan Broiler gave the city a children's town, the East-Center company repaired a horse court where professionals were dealing with children with IPA, with more than 1 million rubles.
The sponsorship has made it possible to enrich the territory of the city of ZAGSA.
The sponsors helped them to observe the Day of the City in a beautiful way.
As in the old days, a parade was held with the participation of urban communities and organizations.
The city’s butterfly, a book of Chinese poets, was released.
The first - century builders and the people who have made a serious contribution to the development of the Sayanska have been awarded the anniversary medals.
Mezenats are also involved in the work of the urban charity fund.
The first step has been to acquire tools for young talented musicians.
Over the next nine months, more than 800 thousand rubles have been targeted to support talented children, to support children who need expensive treatment, and to support children from low-income families.
How are the social personnel issues addressed in the Sainska?
There's not enough doctors and educators in the city.
The provision of housing professionals is essential to the management of the staff issue.
Last year, we rented five medical rooms, and we received four teachers.
We've been working on a housing program with the opportunity to privatize it in five years.
The plans are to re plan a building with eight more apartments for teachers.
Teachers and doctors are also involved in the "Russia Family Grill" program.
In the future, the building of a house for budgetary workers.
The main thing is that there is a working team in the city with which I can deal with the most complex issues.
It is important for all crises to make the right conclusions, but life will not stop.
The potential in Sayanska and our region is great.
The Duma introduced a bill on the indexation of savings, taking into account price increases.
A bill to index social pensions has been introduced annually since 1 February, taking into account price increases.
The author of the document, a member of the Fair Russia, Aleksandr Lomakin-Romanzev, also proposes to conduct an additional pension index on 1 April if the rate of growth of the minimum living is higher than the rate of growth of prices for goods and services.
The index of savings, in accordance with current legislation, is carried out annually on 1 April, taking into account the rate of growth of the pensioner ' s minimum living in the FP last year.
The draft law introduced in the lower Chamber provides for the introduction of a social pension index, taking into account the rate of growth in consumer prices.
The first index is carried out on 1 February and the second is carried out on 1 April.
The OSCE head stated that Mogerini was not allowed to impose sanctions on parliamentarians.
In an official letter to the High Representative of the Euro Union for Foreign Affairs, Federica Mogerini spokesperson PA OSCE Elkka Kanerva stated that sanctions against legislators participating in the assembly activities were unacceptable.
The journalists reported on this by a member of the Russian delegation at the October PA OSCE session in Ulan-Bator Nikolai Kovalev.
The TACS reported that, in support of the position of the Canary Islands, signatures of European parliamentarians, including representatives of Germany, France, Italy, Cyprus, Greece, had been collected.
"There has already been enough strong support," Kovalev said.
He had previously stated that the OSCE chapter had spoken with the intention of gathering the signatures of MPs, which indicated that sanctions against parliamentarians were not allowed.
In particular, he noted Kovalev, the Canerva promised to raise the issue at the level of the Euros Union guidelines and to “request the relevant petition”.
NHC reports that the probability of cyclones south of the Green Measles is 60 per cent
The wide-ranging low-pressure front of approximately 350 miles (560 km) south of the Green Measles is likely to turn into a tropical cyclone for the next 48 hours, the U.S. National Hurricane Centre reported on Tuesday.
Another clearly defined low-pressure area in the middle of the Green Mouse and the Small Antilles also has a 60 per cent probability of developing a tropical cyclone in the next two days, reports synaptics from Miami.
Google launches a $11 million sacrifice campaign for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) announced the start of a double-supply campaign to raise $11 million for humanitarian organizations to assist the countries that have been occupied by European refugees who have fled the war-distributed and disbanded countries.
Google used a non-character personal approach, announcing a campaign to collect donations on its blog.
Instead of making a statement by one of the leaders, Google Rita Masoud, who was running with a family from Kabul when she was seven years old, described her personal experience.
"We went on suspicious trains and buses, endured hunger, thirst, hunger and fear," she wrote.
I'm lucky.
But since the crisis of refugees and migrants in Europe has increased, many people like my family desperately need help.
Victims will be handed over to four non-profit organizations assisting refugees and migrants: "Friends Without Borders", the International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google stated that it would double the first $5.5 million of donations until the amount on the google.com/refugeerelief page was 11 million.
Europe is facing a stronger crisis with refugees since World War II, caused by most of the four-year civil war in Syria, resulting in more than 4 million people moving this year.
Many are also fleeing from the wars of Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Diabetics with a small diet can help with obesity
The beneficial effect of post-menopausal surgery may be at least five years, according to a new study.
However, it is still early to argue that small-dose diabetics live longer after the nursing surgery than those receiving non-surgical treatment.
"Death statistics are not happening right away," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, a nursing surgeon who wrote about a new study in the column of editor JAMA Surgery.
Surgery, or bariatric surgery, uses different methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce the feeling of hunger and limit the ability of organisms to absorb food.
For a few years, bariatric surgery has proven its effectiveness in treating type 2 diabetes, but major studies have been conducted among people with morphine-based body mass index (IMT) 35 or above.
IMT, the measure of weight relative to growth, is considered normal from 18.5 to 24.9.
IMT 25 or above says that humans have overweight and people with IMT over 30 are considered to be obese.
You can count your IP here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For a new study in the Taiwanese Min-Sheng General Hospital, the data collected since 2007 were used to compare two types of bariatric surgery - ironing and manic hospitality, with type 2 diabetes treatment in people with low obesity.
The average value of ICTs for those undergoing surgery fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year of their participation in the study.
At the same time, IMT remains at approximately 29 levels for those who have received non-surgical treatment from diabetes.
Among those who underwent surgery, 36 per cent were completely cured of diabetes, and in part 28 per cent.
In the treatment group, for comparison, the full-treatment of diabetes was only 1%, and in part only approximately 2%.
In addition, blood pressure, triglycerides and “bad” LPNP cholesterol “were generally better in the surgical group”, the authors say.
Researchers have also monitored levels of A1s hemoglobin in the blood that reflect blood sugar levels in the dynamics.
Haemoglobin A1c is better kept below 7%, says researchers.
After surgery, the mean haemoglobin level of A1c decreased from approximately 9 per cent to approximately 6 per cent.
In the therapeutic group, however, it remained stable, approximately 8 per cent.
But better glycaemic control rates, reflected by good levels of haemoglobin A1c, did not reduce mortality in five years, according to Dr. Chi-Cheng Su and colleagues.
The study group also compared the mean results of two types of surgical treatment.
For the fifth year, compared with the group with the roman ostrichtome, the sintering group lost more weight (18.7 kg versus 14.2 kg), increased IMT ( 7.4 versus 5.1) and haemoglobin A1s (3.1% versus 2.1%), and was closer to full remission of diabetes (46.9% versus 16.7%).
Although the new study does not demonstrate the benefits of the surgical method in part of life after five years, there is evidence from the results of the study of people with overweight in Sweden that surgical treatment actually results in an increase in life expectancy, as Blackstone of the College of Medicine reports at the University of Arizona.
According to the Swedish study for people with obesity who chose bariatric intervention, the probability of dying over 15 years was about 29 per cent lower than that of a group with more traditional methods.
Although the new study did not show an increase in life expectancy, Blackstone noted that it encouraged people with ICTs below 35 interested in such a procedure.
“The report is very important here, as it claims that such a surgical intervention is safe in a low-IM group where there is no increased risk of death or initial illness”, she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as the patient falls within the range of 27 to 30.
"I think we've been waiting too long to make people take this seriously," she said.
It seems to me that as soon as they develop the genetic changes that lead to obesity and diabetes in their bodies, it is very difficult to bring it back.
In the Mitzoths, robbers were taken out of the shed house and 9 million rubles.
In the Myths, looters attacked the inhabitants of the sub-muscular house and stole 9 million rubles and three women’s sheds.
It informs the Interfax with reference to the IMF press service.
The incident occurred Tuesday morning.
Two strangers entered the house on the street of Goriko, tied the 20-year-old to the housekeeper and, threatening both the knife, kidnapped 9 million rubles and three holes.
According to the preliminary data, the amount of damage amounted to 9 million 265,000 rubles, a criminal case under the article “Rasbius”.
Fans from Europe are at risk of becoming homeless.
Only 23 peterburg hotels have the right to accommodate tourists who will come to see the World Football Championship in 2018.
The rest of the hotel is still not in a hurry to obtain the appropriate permission.
Experts believe this is a very disturbing sign.
In the forefront of the world, the authorities will urgently need to think about how to disembark all the city's guests.
Rosbalt's interviewers believe the value of renting land apartments will grow by 10-30 per cent, and after the land-based housing champions will have to pay over.
The World Football Championship had the authorities draw attention to the state of Russian hotels.
According to the law written especially in advance, each hotel in Petersburg must undergo a classification procedure and prove that the declared number of stars and service levels are consistent.
Now it is clear that this will not be done by all: the hotelers are so afraid of checks that they often do not even issue documents at the request of the Federal Anti-Money Service in Petersburg.
As UFAS head Vadim Vladimirov said, the department has studied 138 guards and is now planning to carry out 34 hotel cases, many of which have simply failed to respond to antimony users.
There are signs that the three-ten companies led by the city's leader, placing some number of stars in the advertisement, Vladimirov noted.
The problem is that now, literally, no number can be lost before 2018.
Officials suspect that during the football championship, the hospital will take over all the peterburg hotels.
In the city of tourists, there are now 30.5 thousand numbers.
According to Small, in Petersburg, 17 five-star hosts, 51 four-star hotels, 100-two-and-three-stars, 550-one-stars.
According to the First Sub-Committee on Tourism Development, only 23 hotels have been classified at the moment - so many inspections have been carried out by the company accredited in Petersburg.
And here is whether any hotel has ordered such a procedure in regional enterprises, which is unknown to the Small in a surprising way.
I mean, there may be more of the classifications that have gone on, but no one knows about it.
"The last half-years have not been very successful in grading," said the director of the North-West Office of the Russian Union Tourindustry Ekaterin Shadski.
This is due to the high season during which the hotel earns the most money and does not want to handle other matters.
Another reason is the budgets for which no verification costs have been incurred, and the procedure may cover the hotel, depending on the status of 30 to 100 thousand rubles and more.
However, in recent times, hotel managers have intensified and started to apply for classification, Shadskian said.
They must succeed before 1 July 2016, otherwise they will not only pay the fine, but will not yet receive the right to work at the world championship.
It is already known that, depending on the star, a fixed fee will be made for the hotel room during the tournament.
The formulas on which value will be calculated will be published next year.
This was done in order not to allow prices to rise by 200-300 per cent, as is the case, for example, during the Petersburg Economic Forum.
There's a need to have a conscience and not allow for a two-and-a-three-fold increase, but there's also a need for the hotels to make a profit.
"I think growth will be up to 50%," explained the President of the Russian Hosting Association of Gennadius Lamshin.
In turn, Vadim Vladimirov is not sure that price fixing is consistent with market economy understanding.
I don't know how much this is going to fit into economic theory, but I hope this measure is justified.
"It's better to travel safely," he said.
It's not clear that it's going to be with popular cheap hotels.
The Members of the House introduced a bill to prohibit hotels in homes.
We hope that this law will not be adopted or will not apply to Petersburg.
"We will hold back the view that the houses should be preserved," says Nana Gwachia.
However, she said that the owners of the mini-owners should in any case be prepared to strengthen the Housing Code.
If the House still approves the bill, there will be about 80 per cent of the guests in Petersburg, and at this point there are 1.5 thousand numbers.
According to the President of the Federation of Restaurants and Hoteles in the North-West of Leonida Garbar, there are no two-and-a-three-star hosts in Petersburg, which have been claimed by football hospitals, because there is room for guests with four and five stars.
Such a situation is similar to that in which "at the 80th millennium, 75 thousand evictions are in place."
This can only be corrected by the mini-stationers.
Their possible prohibition is "idiotism": "I think it's strange that some people can live in their rooms, and that's why they can't come."
If the hotel is used as a living room, I agree it's wrong.
But if the hotel where the guests arrive for a short time, why not?
The mini-hospitals are at risk of losing the world championship for football and for their indiscriminateness.
Hundreds of small ostrichs just can't get through the classification, and it's being self-contained.
By the summer of 2016, all city hotels will be booked.
“The companies that can carry out this procedure are not so much, so they will reject less-paid orders from the mini-hotels and choose those who travel,” noted Gennadius Lamshin, adding that in a number of cities, for example, Moscow and Volgograd, the checks that have been carried out so far are much higher than in Petersburg.
The reason for the delay in Petersburg was related to permanent displacements in the Government ' s tourist block, which did not contribute to a concerted effort.
Experts believe that if the Petersburg authorities do not all have enough, it is likely that they will have to pay attention to regional hotels and holiday homes.
For example, the 300-year-old Petersburg in the city can mobilize a river fleet, which means guests of the tournament will be able to live in cabins.
In addition, many patients will be prepared to arrive on vehicles that can be nighted.
"The main thing isn't to set up so many hotels that they'll let go," is sure Gennadia Lamshin.
Also, there will be a great popularity during the football championship.
The city's most likely to create a pool of joint apartments.
Rental rates will grow by 10-30 per cent.
"It is obvious that the first is to go to the stadium," said a specialist in renting the Agency for Development and real estate research, Larissa Bragina.
The rental price may not return to the previous level after the championship, especially in the sleeping areas.
This will also contribute to the construction of new transport links on the outskirts of the city, she stressed.
There is no need to forget about the human qualities of the city.
For example, Leonid Garbar is convinced that Petersburg has always been a hospitable city where people not only sign the road, but can also take a mini-excursion.
There are difficulties.
In the 1970s, my father met a family from Murmanska, a father, a mother, and two children.
They found it somewhere to sleep, so it was difficult to sleep in the car.
"And the pope brought them to our community room to sleep," recalled the interviewer.
True, he added that there was no such thing in the city’s inhabitants now — to call the house a horrendous and terrible.
But might in 2018, following the failed decisions of the House, the error of the hotelers and the governments have to be remembered?
Gyrinov's stilt to the Amur area.
He looked with appreciation at the Girinowski Club in Gosduma today.
He did such things when our generation had just learned to trade in newspapers, and still is in a beautiful form.
The theme of the statement, such as, "LDP protests against the outcome of the Amur elections".
Protocols shall not be limited to anything; there are no other protocols, except those signed by the electorate, in the LDPR, judging as a matter of fact.
He raises up the second place, John Abram, and cries out, "Here is the winner of the election!"
And there's nothing going on in Rodney, and then, after the change with the chairman, he introduces a faction from the meeting room, literally saying, "You're all with the fronts of your juggles and holes."
The press, of course, focuses, not on Abramov, but on scandal and demarches of factions as a result of this scandal and insults.
Indeed, Wolfovich has beautifully and elegantly carved the Amur region along with Abraham.
For the whole of the country, this is the regular outcome of the Jirinovski in the style of "Pondon!" and is not a protest against the political party against the results of the specific elections.
And the fact that the fact is that the fact that the party and the Facebook site of Ivan Abramov are not recognized is a formal scandal, and the elections are not recognized, but the leader of the issue is clearly coming down.
It provides the dead in Amur to bury their dead themselves, and it blesses itself against "One Russia" in general and in nothing to be blamed by the family.
A clear decision not to lose a person, not to go to the present, but to show scandal.
Another case that Abraham himself is now in a strange situation.
In addition to the backdrop, he was not expecting anything, and there were no alternative protocols in his hands.
He was not in the focus of public attention, on the one hand, but on the other, for the narrow circle, he was a formal cause and insulting the respected champion, and, on the other hand, he had a homicidal accident at the address of the ER and the UNF.
And here, of course, he has to think very seriously about what to do.
Because from the main electoral beneficiary, the policy number 2 of the region and the candidate number 1 can become the only one-member district, which has been successfully used by its own party leadership and super-responsor for the same UNF and the foreign party leadership.
That's right, it wouldn't be Girinovski, it should be thought about, and it should be looked after.
It's still growing and growing.
There was news that LDPR would return to the hall during the next plenary session.
I mean, the bathroom's got nothing to do with it.
Only Abram's theme is a grave.
Beautiful indeed.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe cannot accept all refugees, Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader called for an end to violence in refugee countries.
Dalai Lama addressed the ongoing refugee crisis in her speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Ethics Studies in Oxford at the beginning of her 10-day visit to Britain.
He stated that in the current circumstances, the interests of humanity must be above the interests of individual countries or even continents.
He also stressed that, although this was commendable, the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis was not adequate.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe," he said.
Although Dalai Lama was highly concerned with the actions taken by Germany and Austria in connection with the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
"The entertainment of thousands of refugees is wonderful, but at the same time you must think of long-term solutions to how to bring peace and development, mainly through education, to these Muslim countries," he stressed.
Finally, we must think about how to reduce the number of murders in their countries.
We must weaken the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.
Speaking of violence, Dalai Lama also commented on the actions of George Bush after the 9/11 terrorist acts, stating that the United States' harsh reaction had triggered a series of uncontrollable events.
After 9/11, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush and told him that the problem could be resolved by non-violence.
I know that his intentions were good, but he used force, and that caused unexpected consequences," Dalai Lama said.
Four-fold increase in the number of children who have been swallowing a hand disinfectant over the past 4 years
The toxicology centres in the United States reported an almost 400 per cent increase, starting in 2010, the number of children under 12 years of age who have been diagnosed with high alcohol-containing degeneratives, as reported by Georgia's toxicology centre.
According to Dr. Heilor Lopez, director of the State Toxicology Centre of Georgia, children under 12 years of age have been diagnosed with hand disinfectants from 3266 in 2010 to 16117 in 2014.
“Children are more likely to contact these substances, and, unfortunately, some of them are sent to the emergency department,” said Lopes CNN.
He said that some children drink denouncing fluids especially, and some do so to impress their friends or to argue about social networks.
Youtube videos show teenagers drinking disinfectant fluid as a cheap drink.
Adolescents reportedly mixed disinfectant with alcohol-containing fluid to soften their mouth to get stronger drinks.
A younger child may attract pleasant tastes of disinfectant fluid.
"The baby doesn't think it could hurt him," said Lopez.
Many of the most attractive (defective liquids for hands) are those that are aromatized.
There are disinfectant fluids for the hands with the smell of the club, the vineyard, and the oranges that are very attractive to the children.
The distilling fluid for the hands contains somewhere from 45 to 95 per cent of alcohol.
In young children, in particular, all a few cracks can cause alcohol poisoning.
"This is a spirit of high concentration," said Fox 4 in Kansas City, Dr. Steven Thornton, chief doctor of the toxicology center at the University of Kansas.
You wouldn't just leave a box of whiskey, but people would think of these disinfectants for hands, and if children were to go to them, it's a quick way to use a lot of alcohol.
Naigja Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently lost her hand disinfectant with a club aroma in about four dispersals, was sent to the emergency care unit.
The blood alcohol level was 179, twice as high as that of an adult who was legally considered alcoholic, according to Dr. Chris Ritchie, a medical doctor who had treated her at the Günnett Medical Center near Atlanta.
Naighja was wrong and couldn't walk when she was delivered to the emergency room.
Doctors observed her all night at a separate child clinic to avoid any signs of brain injury, as the girl fell down and hit her head, Ritchie told.
"It was very scary," said CNN Orttoria Scott, mother of Najiji.
That could have been fatal for my child.
Lopes recommended that parents and teachers use non-spirited substances or disinfectants, in addition to cleaning disinfectant fluids from the reach of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants link to death.
In 2013, two women from Ontario died after swallowing a disinfectant containing a toxic undeclared ingredient.
Health officials suspect that the product contained methanol, a deadly agent, not ethyl alcohol, which was indicated as an active substance.
In January, three fourth-class students in the north of New York agreed to poison their “anti-bacterial” teacher by “dissemination of antibacterials in class”, according to the police report.
The teacher had a strong allergy to hand disinfectors, and she banned them from being held in her class.
The police believe that the plan was "empty conversation" and addressed discipline to the school district.
As the oldest children’s library in Barnaula, she became a family club.
On the back of the rocking at the entrance to the end of the children's library, N.K. Krusko is a swan-swan.
The kids who come after the books are trying to feed her with pills.
Several generations have gone to this library for 95 years.
The first readers of the 20th century had set up huge readings here, put on Majakovski’s lyrics, carried out literary Victorias, and copied with Lenina’s wife.
The census continued for four years, and, as the newspaper Uni Stalinec wrote in 1939, with every day "the friendship between Hope of Constantinople and friends of the children's library of the city of Barnaul" became ever stronger.
Hope Constantinople even sent her childhood picture to distant Barnaul friends one day.
And when the barnacles asked if Hope Constantine objected to the library's name, she wrote that there was no, no.
The books are long burned in the museum, and the first - century readers’ grandchildren and lawyers have to explain which profile of this hard profile is decorated by the barelef on the library building.
In the years that followed, many people were upset: Why is the children’s library not being renamed?
Let's make a library name for some good child writer without a political spell!
The library staff sat down, thought, and decided to leave everything as it was.
"Krupsky" is, please, the most famous and popular library in Barnaul, as a "lean" in Moscow.
On the field in the library magazine, a yellow - red rag road.
"Wonderful of the Amazing City" is the favorite theme of the artist Ollie Moscow.
In the past, Ola was a manager in a legal company, had come to work in eight, had gone to five, and all the other managers were distinguished only by love of drawing.
And then she found an on-line announcement, "It takes an illustrator for a book."
The book was written by a little American girl, and she was called "My Cancer Mommy" in my mom's cancer.
Oil made illustrations, and thought that life could end at any time, and there would be no wonder in it if you didn't create them yourself.
Now she works in the library, she illustrated the children’s books of writers around the world, and she makes stories herself.
Traditionally, children lose interest in a book, that they live in some virtual space more and more...
But we have children reading, and their parents understand the importance of reading, says the director of the Russian Planet, Tatian Kuschvid Library.
In recent years, we even have a moment of confidence that the children's library is needed, and she's going to live -- kids are coming here!
I think the interest in reading is coming back.
The library’s website hangs a large exhibition with an updated photo exhibition.
New photos of readers who go to the entire family library — Mom, Dad, and children — are featured in the neighborhood.
The library rejoices that the popes have become increasingly popular with the children.
If you have read all of this to your child in two years of age, he needs more books than ever before.
But now there is a law that prohibits an eight-year-old widower from issuing 12+ books.
To get such a book, a child must bring his parents with him, they come back again, and gradually "Krupsky" becomes a sort of family club for them.
In the library there are treasures - a dorevoluncy collector was with ethos and eras, to bring Queen to the annex to the magazine "Niva", a "Murzylki" in 1936.
We're not just the conceptual space of a book temple now, we're now open to movement, we're trying to be a special place: not home, not work, not school, - explains Tatian Kuschid.
We can come here to read together, play, paint.
We've made a game zone for the kid, the kid just comes to play, and the arm still hangs in the book!
Some of our readers have their parents, and they stand by their feet, and they do not want to leave.
Moms often come with wheels - and we are pleased that they put the library first among all the other places where they should come with the children.
Tatiana Kuschid says: Modern children like us sometimes love classical children's literature:
“The publishing case is now developing, and much attention is paid to the authors who are related to the generation.”
And when it comes to little kids, it's important for them to be a hero who travels from one book to another.
Children don't like to break up with their heroes.
The brochure is constantly published by Jehovah’s Witnesses, and it is provided as part of a worldwide Bible educational work supported by voluntary donations. It is provided as part of a worldwide Bible educational work supported by voluntary donations.
The booklets are so interesting and intriguing that adults are interested, but this library is not for them.
It is forbidden for adults to produce books outside the reading room.
This magical privilege is for children only.
In the very next room, the library has a square hole with an old wooden ladder in the basement, in the library.
Steps will slip under your steps - it's a very old time machine.
You meet with your childhood book like an old friend: Hi, it's good that we don't change with you.
Ellie is just as happy to walk along the road forced by a yellow bear, the Tol Rižikov tapes are stealing magic rings, and Malchis Kibalchis did not say that to the cursed bourgeoises of the Military Secret, that's what he already has.
Such books are like passwords, and they can be found anywhere.
It is in the warehouse and the current book series - for example, the dorevolution collector was with the baits and the weather.
Or bring the Queen in a famous annex to the magazine "Niva".
Or "Murzylki" in 1936.
It was time for the pages to be old enough to be decorated with a cup of tea.
These publications are no longer published to readers.
These are the details of our future collection, and I'm dreaming I'm going to retire, and I'm going to have a few children's books.
But the kids are not going to do it, and the old books aren't very bright, and the themes... you open the first page, and there's Lenin, the party, the Commodore.
Now it seems like why did we all write this "Pioner Truth"?
But it was still interesting, says Galina Ilásov, a Russian planet that leads to a library.
The Mursilki pages have been faded from time to time.
Galina Vasilievna spends her entire life in the bookstore.
She knows what color the bourath in Buratino, when Harry Potter became captain of Griffindor's team at the Qiddish Championship, where Carlson uses a motorcyclist, and who works for Alice Selènevy's father.
The librarians pay little for their work, and those who can live without these book series find themselves in a different profession very quickly.
Only the most convinced are the educators, the educators, the ministers of book worship.
They can also be found smiling - it is thought to be a professional drawing of a children's library.
If he smiles at you at the first minute of the conversation, he's a professional.
I love children's books as much as I like to be a librarian so that they can be straight and beautiful on the poles, and I still love to read them, Galina Vasilievna says.
I read everything: military, historical behavior, stories, fantasy.
I'm reading modern Russian authors, fresh translations...
Of course, I think everything was different in my childhood.
The books were the most interesting and fascinating thing that ever happened to me.
And since I was foolishly fond of them, I thought the library was a magical place.
And I wanted to work where everyone was sitting and reading.
I hope the books will always be, despite the knights.
And I'm happy when our ex-readers bring the kids and the grandchildren...
Listening: There's no difference in "Seltic"
Griffiths objected to the debate on the disputes in Celtic after Dale's admission that Hopes was in a bad situation, but he's going to fix it.
Harts will protest the Scotland Football Association claim to Nelson, and Worberton fears signing contracts in January that may violate the team's unity
Dons have increased the benefit of Celtic to five points
The Adam Runny Penalties in the first time gave Aberdina a little advantage over the Hamilton in Pittodre, allowing Dons to get rid of the Celtics for five points.
Griffiths objected to disputes
This sparked the controversy in Celtic, which had been overcome by Griffiths, claiming that he and his teammates did not suffer any stronger criticism in preparing for a meeting with the leaders of the Dutch League.
I don't think we feel the tension, I think the games are trying to make him.
The Dutch are bored because the Scottish are not fighting for title - de Bour
The former Rangers' defender and former Dutch member Ronald de Bour said that Dutch footballers lost interest in Celtic because he did not meet with Rangers.
De Bur, currently a representative of Ajaxa, said: "In the Netherlands, the most attractive moments of the Celtic game no longer show, but why?"
That's because there's no Rangers.
People here are not just talking about the Rangers return.
They're talking about the Old Company.
They're talking about both teams together, and that's what they're interested in.
In the old firm's games, there's a lot of tension, and not only people in Scotland want to see these games.
"I'll change everything," said Dale.
Ronny Dale admitted that "Seltic" is experiencing difficulties, but the Norwegian coach swore to change everything.
As a result of a defeat by Malmo, and as a result, you soon followed up with 10 Aberdina footballers, who are now on top of five points.
But Dale said, "Seltica has had bad times before, and we're going out again."
Now we want to get out of this as quickly as possible.
I understand it's very boring, and a lot of people are very, very angry or upset about what's going on.
So do we, but we have to keep going.
And we really really need Seltica's support, because it makes the game much better.
Staying together now is so important.
Worberton is looking forward to January transfers
Despite the views that had appeared a few weeks ago that he had identified some of the objectives of the January transfers, the Rangers boss, Mark Worberton, was unfaithful to the January campaign, claiming that he did not want to destroy the unity of the team.
The former attacker, Brentford, said, "The Hungarian transfer window is very different from the summer window."
With regard to the players who come in summer, you have a period before the beginning of the season for their adaptation, which you have seen in our own group in this season.
The team is working really well.
Sometimes more harm comes from adding unnecessary toys to those you really need.
Micha, who was interested in "Seltic", concluded his career.
The "Soonsi" Mitch, connected to "Seltic" during the transfer window, decided that he could leave the football after his contract with "Lebedas" ended.
The 29-year-old toy had been in trouble with the lodge for two years and was unable to leave Wales this summer.
Harts is going to oppose the SFA on Nelson's statements.
"Harts" said in account 2:1 when they removed Patterson, and began to play 3:2 but the red card of the defender was cancelled later; it was the third red card of Colum, cancelled eight months later.
Nelson doesn't give up his words by saying, "I didn't question ethics, I didn't comment on the game."
Griffiths swore to avoid Tinkasl.
The Hibernian team's direct play was given an explanation after he admitted that he sang a song with insults about the former Harts-Scathel game.
The incident occurred in a pub in the Roseburn district of Edinburgh before the beginning of the Edinburgh Derby at Tinkasle in March 2014.
"It was a derby, and it was a fireman," said the attacker, adding, "I can't be sure I'm not going back to Tankasl unless he's playing for the Celtic."
Donnelly: Tannadis's advice trusted in Dandi United's management
Simon Donnelly claims that Dandi United's Board of Directors is still confident that the management team will change the situation for the better, but agrees that the deterioration in the field should end.
I think Steven Thompson believes in us.
We'll get the guys out again," said Donnelly.
Mackinnes is glad he won the "unpretty" in Hamilton.
Derek McKinness admitted that his team "Aberdin" had had to desperately fight against "Hamilton Assisi" to win the seventh victory in the championship of the League, which put them at five points above "Seltica", on top of the tournament table, thanks to Adam Runny's penalized in the first time.
McInness said, "There's no team here that would win something like a cube or a league champion who didn't win a meeting like that."
Unemployment among Scottish people does not change, while in the United Kingdom it generally grows
BEZABOTIA in Scotland remained at 164,000 people for the period from May to July, while the total number of non-workers in the United Kingdom increased by 10,000 to 1.82 million for the same period.
The unemployment rate in Scotland, 5.9 per cent, was higher in the United Kingdom at 5.5 per cent, as reported by the National Statistics Service (ONS).
At the same time, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 in three months, with the number of workers now being 2,612,000.
The employment rate for Scotland was down to 74.0 per cent, which is above the average of 73.5 per cent for the United Kingdom.
The Minister of Scotland, David Mandell, commented on the latest figures: “The long-term plan of the Government has laid the foundations for strengthening the economy”.
Almost a year has passed since Scotland made a historic decision to remain in the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months, we have seen further improvement in Scotland's labour market in terms of employment growth and unemployment reduction.
Why I'm a witness to the Oklahoma Penitentiary
Today, by turning away from legal interference at a later stage, I will see how people are being punished.
If that happens, and I hope it doesn't, I'll be sitting in the eye gallery of the death squads in Oklahoma State Prison when Richard Glossip is being punished with a lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses of his death.
For the first time, this request was made in January, through his close friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day drew near, I became afraid.
So why would you do that?
I agreed, because I thought it was a good way to tell a detailed history of the death penalty.
That would suggest a unique feature.
Yes, journalists are allowed to attend the American executions, and since they often want more than places, the results of the dark lottery decide who will be elected.
In Oklahoma, the number of press posts was reduced from 12 to five.
Whoever's chosen, he'll look at it with no emotion.
I can't do that.
I'll be sitting with Richard Glossip's closest friends, and we've had our own relationship with him after a few months of telephone calls and a visit that lasted two and a half hours.
I like this guy.
We often laugh when we talk to him.
The prison administration claims that I cannot be a witness and a journalist at the same time, so I will not be allowed to take a note and a handbook to record what I see.
I'll have to try to remember all the details.
A Oklahoma journalist accused me of being impartial on Twitter.
It's a lesson.
Tell the story of the prisoner as he likes to get access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that she “could and better formulate” herself, but still felt that I was wrong about what I was doing.
Richard Glossip didn't agree with any of what I said and wrote.
He didn't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't do that, even if he did.
I told him he could get me out of his witness list any time.
But he wants the journalist to be present there to write about it.
If he dies, he believes that publicity will help to eliminate the death penalty.
Kim Bellver, Haffington Post reporter, will be with me.
If you want to know more about it, listen to the podcasts I wrote.
I'm not going to be here in detail again.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glossip wasn't guilty.
His actions after Barry van Treise's murder have made him guilty of crime.
But I believe there's a great chance he's not guilty of murder.
I firmly believe that the death sentence was not enough.
I think his punishment is wrong.
And I'll watch him die from that.
I can't say I'm totally objective.
There will also be other reporters that can be consulted.
You'll know what it's like to see a man I like die without need.
Persecuted by the police, they agreed to leave the Canning River.
Constable from the town of Canning-Wale was able to arrange for a man to leave the Canning River and remain dry.
Perth's population was about to leave the police, but he couldn't stop in the dirty water at the mill in a few metres from the police officer who was trying to "make it easy to get on the beach".
The Kanning-Weil police were called on Tuesday on the illegal entry of a foreign territory in Buckingham.
When the police noticed the suspect, he tried to get away from them by throwing himself in Canning.
But he didn't get away.
"He was standing in the water and saying, "I'm not going out, let's go, catch me," said Senior Sergeant Chandelle Kasldain.
Constable Laklan Perhavec didn't really want to drown, so he used a safer reception -- "a conversation with a good police officer."
"Sometimes people do strange things to try to escape," said Senior Sergeant Kasldain.
That's what Ben Casinos football champion remembers.
In 2006, Casinos went to Kuwait to avoid meeting with the police patrol to check on alcohol and tried to cross the Suon.
His efforts were in vain, but the locals were hoping to invent a funny "Biathlon of Ben Casinos".
Peter Modi accuses stewards of trying to spy and threatens to get out of horse sport
Peter Modi accused the Racing Victoria stewards of trying to put a spy in his convoy last year and threatened to leave the horse sport immediately.
Its aim was to become the stewards and officers of the Racing Victoria Ethics Division, whom he accused of organizing a campaign against him personally, and to withdraw from the start of Lady Dadai because of violations of the drug regulations on the day of the beginning, on Wednesday, became the last Solomon.
Modi reported to Fairfax Media that he always applied all his efforts in jumping, and he found himself in a difficult situation when it came to the positive result of the Kobalt Ledari test, which he could not explain.
He kept the language about the suspicions of spying for half a year and did not want it to “seem to be a green vine”.
"I didn't mean to say anything about it, and I've been for a long time, but sometimes it's getting you so out of your way that you don't stop," Modi said.
They know it went on.
Sometimes you react, and then you have to survive the consequences, and I'll have to live with what I said.
I'm going home tonight and I'm going to sleep tight.
I want to walk with my head up high, and I want my owners to know that I'm doing everything for them.
When they start thinking it's not like that, then I'm gonna have to stop being a coach.
Then I'll have to think about what to do with my license.
Mody had previously made a sensational statement during a race.com interview that the ethics department was trying to spy on his horse.
"A year ago, Terry Bailey, Dale Brown and Dr. Brian Stuart were sitting in a room with a man I'll call, if they ask, and offered him a job in my cone to pass on information about what I'm doing in my cone," Modi said at Racing.com.
They obviously think I'm a liar.
If that is the case, they should all make statements because they failed to get me.
Robert Rollston, former president of RVL, David Modi, current president of RVL, and Bernard Sondri, senior executive director of RVL, have known about this all the time and they know it now.
Shouldn't that make me think it's getting personal?
Shouldn't RVL take courage and call for an answer to what's going on in this business, other people besides coaches?
Am I afraid of this profession?
Am I bad for this profession?
Maybe people there think it's true.
Maybe they need to get me a license and get me out of here, and I don't doubt what I'm saying right now can make them think about it.
But I've come to the point where I don't care, and that makes me sad.
I'm really sorry about that.
I will put pressure on them, and I will be responsible for their decision-making.
I have family support, and I can leave.
The coach's mature only grew during the long investigation of the cobalt and the leader's case, and the latest withdrawal of the horse from the start forced him to declare that he could "turn his license on the table".
Modi, the most well-known of the fact that he had prepared the invincible Black Caviar champion, called the requirements for the use of medical drugs on the day of the “smoothing” competition after the horse’s legs were pressed from clay, which was a violation of the rules.
It's a violation of the rules on jumps.
"I must bear the full responsibility for it," he said.
One of my employees made a mistake in getting her a leg.
She could've gotten a compress last night.
She could have got it yesterday, as it was.
She was with him the day he ran.
Modi may be disqualified for three months under the medical prescriptions on the day of the compressive exercise, for which the study has been initiated by the staff.
It's anecdote.
People who create these rules don't know anything about trash.
"We all understand that we need rules, but that's too far," Modi said.
A driver who has made a raid and has been hiding from the scene in Cobra, arrested
The police arrested a man who had hit a motorcyclist in Cobra and hid himself from the scene.
The motorcyclist was delivered to the helicopter at the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after his car was hit by Murrey Welly Hayvey on Saturday morning.
The police said the driver left without stopping to help the injured motorcycle driver.
On Monday, a 50-year-old resident of the city of Natalie surrendered to the police in Sheppartone.
He is expected to be charged with leaving the scene, non-help and other road traffic rules.
A motorcyclist, a 40-year-old resident of Kobrama, remains in a stable hospital.
Coach Melbourne Storm, Craig Bellami stops charges of rivals in the use of harsh forces
Coach Melbourne Storm Craig Bellami called the criticism of the take-over by his team as the "launching of the agenda" by two favorite NRL champions.
Coach Sidney Rusters Trent Robinson said the judges allowed Storm to "fight" with his team during the sudden victory of Storm at the end of the qualifying game in Sydney on Friday evening.
Coach Brisbane Bronkos, Wayne Bennet, made a clear guess on Storm after his team won the final qualification tournament at Nosern Queensland Caubowez on Saturday night, when he called this game "typical" for the League of Regbies and said that two of Queensland's teams were not "too successful" in hand-held.
Bellami was protecting his team's ball cover and said they were just focused on "contact", taking the ball.
Bellami added that he was convinced that his team had been criticised by two leading coaches, as that meant that they were concerned about possible damage to Storm.
"It's still coming up - I didn't hear Trent Robinson talking about hard receptions when they took us to the 24:2 account," Bellami said on Wednesday.
I can assure you that we haven't changed anything in our systems or protection techniques all year long, just in the last six weeks, we've been paying special attention to contact with the ball, and this has become a turning point for us.
It's been there for three years, and he's been training a great team, so he's probably not used to playing, and it's been a bit of a shock to him.
It's funny how it always turns out this time of year.
Bellami argued with Bennett's idea of an impressive football, reminding his teacher that "St. George-Illavar Dregons" Bennett won the 2010 championship, showing a "hard" football.
Wayne's talking about winning football.
He decided to compare his game on Saturday night with ours on Friday night, and see how impressive their game was," Bellami noted.
I remember that in 2010 St. George was not critical, calling a mourning team, and Wayne said it would never take care of him.
But now he has a team that can show what he thinks is impressive football, especially his young half-guards at their speed.
It's a football that you'd like to play when you have such games.
He made this comment in 2010, and now he wants everyone to play football in his style - not every team has two defenders like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so they can play like that.
This gives me more confidence because they're saying these things because they're a little worried about playing with us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think about us when they got to big games.
Bellami also noted that the Storm and Rusters game was a competition with a large number of points than the Broncos and the Cauboise game.
The Broncos game was probably good, I haven't seen it yet, but what was the score? 16-12?
In our game he was 20:18, there were two more attempts - and what, is there an impressive football?
Or do you consider it a shock - inspiring breakup and unsuccessful attempt?
It's a routine for me.
If they mention us, that means that at some point we can meet them there.
In Storm at the end of this weekend, as they won the right to take either North Queensland Caboys or the Crown Sharks on the next Saturday evening at the preliminary final at the AAMI Park Stadium, tickets will be sold on Tuesday morning.
Indicted in the possession of drugs, Serbs were released for $20,000
A man who was threatened with a life sentence for attempting to allocate 40 kg of cocaine delivered to Queensland contraband was sentenced to $20,000.
Marco Maximovich, 29 years old, was one of five people arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kilograms of drugs on the Solay yacht from South America through Vanuatu and settled in Kumer in August.
During the whole morning, Maximovich and his associates saw them at the port, and later he met them at Coomera Roadhouse, where the police found 40 kg of drugs in Toyota Echo.
Despite the fact that Maximovicu is threatened with a life-long attempt to place drugs in sufficient quantity for sale, lawyer Maximovic claims that there is no evidence that the last attempt was made to catch the whole party, and that the man could be in coffee without any intention.
The Supreme Court judge, Peter Flenagan, doubted that Maximovic should have been released.
The latter has contacts with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he said in court on Wednesday.
During the criminal proceedings, he lied to the police about his whereabouts.
Maximovic's mother and father was invited to make a joint pledge of $20,000 for his release.
"It is clear from both evidence that the amount of $200,000 is too much financial burden for them," noted Judge Flenagh.
But one such measure is not sufficient as a guarantee that it will not disappear, the judge added.
Maximovich was allowed to be released on bail, provided that he would deliver both his Australian and Serbian passport, be observed in the police every day and observe the command clock from 6 o'clock to 6 o'clock in the morning.
"I'm proud of Greece's assembly, which has been fighting in the last few seconds."
Greece's main coach, Fotis Cacicaris, paid tribute to his team after the match 1/4 final Eurobasket-2015 with Spain (71:73).
According to him, the fate of the games has made some mistakes.
It was a big game, quote the AFP Cacicaris.
We've prepared for a great game of Spanish execution.
They tried to work in the defense, but the defence errors identified the fate of the meetings.
It's sad, but I'm proud of my boys.
They've been fighting for the last second.
Joel Freeland: "I'm going to be assigned to the CSCA to the functions of Kaunas."
CSCA's novel Joel Freeland says he doesn't believe in the curse of the soldiers.
The British also expressed confidence that his new club would be able to break down the negative trend and finally win the Eurolyche next season.
I spoke to Coach Dimitris Itudes several times this summer, and, myself, after I joined the team, he quoted R-Sport as saying that I would actually be entrusted with the functions of Sashi Kaun, who left the team, both in defence and in a three-second attack, and I think I can do that.
Yeah, I'll need some time to adjust to the central position, but in the NBA, I've been playing for the Forward.
Now we're going to have to stand up to a big central opponent, but I've done this before, so I think I'm going to be able to do it now.
The army last won Eurolygue in 2008.
Since then, they've been going to final four, but they've never been able to show their best basketball.
It's about the opinion that the team was wrong.
In this whole game, you can't win forever.
Of course, it's complicated, I understand the disappointment of the club and its sick people.
But we have a great team now, and if we're going to show the best we can do, we have a good chance of winning Eurolysis, I really think.
I always wanted to win this title, the Moscows have already won the tournament, and I think this year will be the year of the CSCA.
As for the mirror, I'm not a man of superstition, and I don't believe in any kind of curse.
I believe in hard work and determination, if you combine these two things, it's possible.
I don't have any rituals, I'm just listening to music and trying to relax as much as possible.
Louis Enrique: "For me, a Roman match will be special."
The chief coach of Barcelona, Luis Enrique, did not hide that he had returned to Rome for the 1st round of the team tournament of the League of Champions with Rome with special feelings.
According to the teacher, his current and former team's visible unity would be far short.
Let us recall that Louis Enrique trained wolves in the 2011/12 season, but he was unable to show up on the best side in the capital of Italy.
I returned to Rome a few years later, for which I had gained some experience. - The official website of WEFA, Louis Enrique.
I have only warm memories of Rome.
It's gonna be a special game for me, but it's not that important.
The main thing is to start the Championships League with victory.
The August meeting in Cuba by Joan Gamper does not affect the actions of the teams in the nearest match.
I'm expecting the Roma game she showed in series A against Yventus.
It's a strong team that can press and know what to do with the ball.
Vadim Scripchenko: "Craznodar" has various options for attacking."
The chief coach Urala Vadim Scripchenko, in front of the 9th round of the Prime Minister's team with Krasnodar, noted the variety of attacks on the rival's team.
According to the teacher, bees have several models in their arsenal in the attack.
The unit will be held on 21 September and will begin at 16.30 in Moscow time.
As we're going to play with Krasnodar, we're going to see the official website of the Urala word Scripchenko.
We've had a week's training ahead.
This team has various options for attacking, multiple-faced attacks, while we're not slow, so I think it's going to be a very interesting game.
In the face of this game, given that Krasnodar is the champion of the League of Europe against Dormouse, we are trying very well to prepare to win.
Roher Kanyas: "The Astana House" can pick the eyes of anyone you like."
Astana's defender, Roher Kanyas, after the 1st round of the team tournament, the League of Champions with Benfiya (0:2) expressed confidence in improving the quality of his team's game in the future.
A hawbek believes that astanas can select their eyes from any opponent.
Despite the fact that the match was hard for us, I can say that we played well, the official website of the UEFA says the Kanyas.
Benfika's top-class, but in a domestic match, I think we can count on them to pick the points.
That's quite real.
But first we need to think about Galatasarae, and then about Atlético.
At home, we can pick the eyes for anyone.
Raphael Bentez: "The second time ever: Kristian Ronald is the best in the world."
The Chief Coach Raphael Bentez expressed satisfaction with the great victory in the 1st round of the team tournament of the League of Champions with Shatter (4:0).
The specialist gave the honour to Christopher Ronald, who was the author of three heads.
Match was not easy, because Shahter has the ability to control the ball, a UEFA official website, says Benez.
The opponent had few moments, but their counterattacks always pose a threat.
I'm not going to say that the Real was playing perfect, but we had plenty of guts.
I'm glad we didn't miss the ball and killed four.
Christian Ronald confirmed his level.
It's the best game in the world, I'll repeat it as often as I like.
"Christian Ronald can't be compared to Messy."
The protector of Barcelona, Gordie Alba, believes that no one will be able to compare with his associate Lionel Messy.
According to Spanish, the Forvard "Real" by Kristian Ronald can't do it either.
Messies on five heads above the others, quote Le Figaro Albu.
Even Kristian Ronald.
With Leo on the field, I can't compare it to anyone.
Daniel De Rossy: Barcelona has not only a unique style but also a bright individuality.
The semi-defenser Daniel De Rossi, who was the winner of the team tournament of the League of Champions with Barcelona, noted the importance of compaction and insurance in the game with such a strong rival.
The meeting will take place tomorrow, beginning at 21.45 a.m. in Moscow.
For example, the “CE” will carry out its textual transmission.
Barcelona is a special rival, a good team of great players, quoted the official website of the UEFA De Rossi.
It's hard to play with the blues, because they have not only a unique style, but also a bright individuality.
To let them go, we're going to have to smoke all the time, and we're going to have to take care of each other.
Missions are almost always successful when they go into the environment, so we need to maintain compactness and organization.
The food hopes to be released in the initial composition of the SCA in a match with the Slovenian.
Golkiper SKA Ilia Ežov stressed that he was hoping to join the army in the next KCL championship.
The food went to ice instead of Mikko Koskinen at the 23rd minute at 0:3 and reflected all the branches at his gates, the fourth goal of SCA missed after replacing the doorman with the sixth field player.
The next team match will be marching against Slovenia.
I hope that I'm going out in the next match in the beginning, says "R-Sport."
I'm not an expert on the doorkeeper, I'm a doorkeeper, we don't have to show the missing head again, so it's hard to track.
"Dinamo" played well, everyone has bad matches.
The team's still lost.
I'd better miss the bigger, but the team won.

Steven Hogg used the girl's phone to get the pedophiles to send photos
Pedophile used the phone of 11-year-old girl to ask for images of violence against children.
Stephen Hogg took the girl's phone while she was sleeping, registered to the Internet message service, where he received a number of inappropriate images of children sent to him by another user.
The girl woke up, found a phone breach and found it in the hands of a sleeping Hog.
She checked it and found shocking pictures, and then she immediately turned to her mother.
The police came and saw five images, then examined the computers found at this address, and found “relevant” requests in the search system using words to detect inappropriate images of children.
Hogg then told the police what he did, because it could "draw pedophiles", and then he would "make him a cop to scare them".
A court officer, Elid Robertson, told the sheriff's court in Dandi: "He said it was a passion, he was afraid to scare people.
He admitted that he had made requests on the computer, but he said that it was because he wanted to become a police officer to scare the pedophiles.
He was asked about the conversation with an unknown person who sent images to him and that he asked for more photos.
He said what he did to fool them.
He said he had problems with his head when he was drinking, and he said he wanted to see images of rape and murder.
Ms. Robertson added, "When the girl found pictures on the phone, she called her mother, she cried and cried.
She saw inappropriate images on the phone, and the accused was then given a noticeable rate.
The girl was interrogated and reported that the accused had used a computer and a Plasterishn to talk to the girls who looked much younger than him.
Hogg, 23, from Ward Road in Dandi, admitted to being guilty of the allegations made in the manufacture of improper photographs of children on 14 June last year, in violation of the conditions of 25 January of this year and not in court on 24 March of that year.
The lawyer, Gregor Sim, applied not to bring Hogga into the list of persons who committed sexual offences, as it could be shown that there was no "significant sexual element" in the crime.
Sheriff Alistair Carmailel suspended the sentence until October, prior to receiving reports from social services.
Hogg was dismissed on this case, but he was arrested before hearing other cases.
It was listed by sex offenders until the date of the conviction.
President Zimbabwe Robert Mugabe doesn't read that word in parliament
Mr. Mugabe, the senior African government leader, fell off the ladder that led the podium earlier this year.
He did not suffer, but a videotape from the fall was currently distributed on social networks.
The opening of Parliament was also obscured by statements of parliamentary opponents that they had received anonymous threats warning them of Mugabe ' s education during the treatment.
Months ago, they enlightened the President during his address to the nation in parliament; that is what Mugabe repeated on Tuesday.
A member of Parliament from the Movement for Democratic Change in Innocent Goneze said that seven opposition politicians had received text messages on their mobile phones to prevent Mugabe from interrupting.
“The message came from a number that is not illustrated, but it is titled Death,” he told reporters at the conclusion of Mugabe’s speech.
It warned the noted members of Parliament that the integrity was ending in the Parliament building, and as soon as they left, the parliamentary integrity did not work.
A member of Parliament stated that the party led by Morgan Cwangaria was “disturbed” by its political threats.
Hewlett-Packard will reduce to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard intends to reduce from 25,000 to 30,000 jobs under its service restructuring and cost reduction programme.
In the same year, Hewlett-Packard is divided into two company stock exchanges, separating the production of computers and printers from the faster development of equipment and service operations.
As a result of the projected decline in jobs, approximately US$ 2.7 billion, from the fourth quarter, is reported in the Hewlett-Packard statement.
"This restructuring will provide a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," said Mag Whitman, Chairman and Director-General Hewlett Packard, who will lead the organization after the division.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be less and more focused than Hewlett-Packard is currently, and the business portfolio will be wider and deeper that will help the company move to a new business style," Witman said.
As a separate company, we are in a better position than before to respond to the growing demands of our clients around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have an annual revenue of over US$ 50 billion and will focus on providing previously unaccompanied integrated technology solutions, as reported in the company ' s statement.
This is how the company, educated by Stanford University graduates Bill Hullett and Dave Packard, is divided into electric equipment; their garage in Palo Alto was called "the birthplace of the Kremney Valley".
Hewlett Packard is in the process of large restructuring to move from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
Such a step by HP, the world's second computer manufacturer and one of the largest US technical companies, is the latest developments in this sector, based on the confidence that highly specialized companies are working better.
Captain Arsenal Michael Artet says his associates must support the traumatized Jack Wilshire before the game with Dinham Zagreb.
In his discussion with Wilshire Wenger, he also stressed that only September is yet, and that, provided that Wilshire's recovery is planned, nothing will prevent him from returning to Christmas.
In the most favourable development of Wilshire events, at least four of the following games will be missed in England and its participation in the European Championship will remain under consideration next summer.
The most recent problem is that Wilshire has certainly completed the previous season with the only trauma of the lodge and is going back to the usual aggressive style of the game during preseason training.
Wenger: "This trauma does not threaten his career."
It's just not a living bone.
Nothing serious.
It's just a coincidence.
This is not related to the hives or injuries that he had before.
These may be medically related things, but as Wenger has also allowed, there is a risk of additional injuries to any game returning to the middle of the season.
There is also an unfavourable trend.
According to Primer Injuries Ltd, Wilshire reported that 23 different injuries occurred six years after his debut.
In addition, he played only 65 of the 157 Arsenal games in the league in the last five seasons.
If you look at Arsenal's schedule wider, you can see that in six of the eight seasons, starting in 2007-08, Arsenal was one of the two Premier League clubs, which account for the most lost due to the trauma of the day.
Wenger recognizes the likelihood of a delay in the post-harvest cycle, but Arsenal believes that the improvement of the statistics on injuries will continue in the last season.
"Sometimes after the trauma, you've been vulnerable for some time - for that time you need to regain your strength and gain a competitive advantage," Wenger said.
Jack's young enough to do it.
I hope he'll recover physically, I'm sure he'll be the one he deserves.
Arsenal launches a champion league campaign in the middle of a match with Dinamo-Zagreb and will continue on Saturday with Chelsea and on the next Wednesday with "Tottenham Hotspur", and Wenger intends to turn the band.
Ector Bellerin and Aaron Ramzi did not come to Croatia, so they would probably play Mother Debushi and Arte.
Perhaps Wenger will also introduce Kiran Gibbs and Olivia Gyru instead of Nacho Moreal and Theo Walcotta.
"I'm trying to keep the balance and give a little advantage to the players that need it," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal is an unconditional favorite in group F, the Maximir Stadium in Zagreb is among the most infamous in Europe.
"Dinamo" has not lost any of the 41 match since they had their last season as "Invincible".
On Tuesday evening, the stadium was hit by a 3,2 ball earthquake on the Richter scale.
It was 10th in Zagreb this year.
Wenger is confident that Arsenal has learned a lesson in the past season when the team suffered a defeat in the Games of the League of Champions from Monaco, and it remains with little hope to bring the club to victory at the final Cup of Champions.
"This is an incredible drive," said Wenger.
Arsenal has never done that before.
We were very close to the target in 2006, but, on the other hand, I'm a realist.
We have ambitions, but we're not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy show that taught us serious lessons from a man's friendship
The lack of such stories is left to the eye, especially if it is to take into account the desperate need for men to be honest, now more than ever, when the level of suicide among young men is up to 15 years old.
In 2013, this was the only major cause of men's death between the ages of 20 and 45 in the United Kingdom, and it will happen to men three times more often than to women.
In an attempt to address the problem of the campaign against unhappiness, the year 2015 announced the Year of Men to address the challenges of a culture that does not allow men to address when they need it.
Friends are at the center of this battle to accept this challenge.
A recent study of over 2,000 university students with symptoms of depression revealed that if the patient has a large number of “normal” friends, the chances of treatment are doubled.
Similarly, for those who are not depressed, the circle of healthy friends doubles the chance of mental disorders.
Of course, though, the friendship should work, especially if it is to be.
In a time when communication is managed by social networks, when the style of content is preferred, the speed of response is often more appreciated than the content of contact.
Our digital life doubles the need to be strong, loving, and successful, even if it is a reality of loneliness.
Such superficial success depends on what psychologists call external values - money, image, social status, entirely from internal values, our inner desire for personal growth and friendship, which has a greater impact on our mental health.
And, as one billionaire recently noted, the video game creator, for money, don't buy any more happiness.
The dignity of Friends is that they draw attention to this.
Each individual was determined, not by his work, but rather by the personality that appeared in association with his friends.
Jumor Joey and Chandler's constant hugs, the moments of watching football on comfortable chairs, the breathing of Ross on Rachel, all depends on the understanding that men can feel it, even if they often refrain from fully studying their feelings.
As the Samaritan officer told me, "...my role as a listener for people who feel depression and suicide is to stress how even the smallest communication of friends can benefit."
Often the men who approach us feel powerless to talk to friends.
The old teaching "live with it" is as strong as the feeling that a frank discussion of problems can be perceived as weakness."
Friends one of those shows that comes to mind when I'm trying to offer longer working overcoming mechanisms.
It stressed the small moments of a man’s friendship.
With regard to my task, the status of a telephone interviewer helps people at times of despair, while long-term support comes from a close family and friends.
So, if you visit FriendsFest at Comedy Central in these exits, where for the holiday the decorations have been completely restored, why not take your friends to Central Perk for a drink.
Or, even better - if you see a single man in Starbucks, smile and say hello.
Never think of the benefits that friendship can bring.
Series Friends show on Comedy Central from the beginning and to the end, all 236 series, by tag #FriendsFest
De Maria's killing a goal by helping the GSP burn Malmo.
Angel de Maria, like Blas Matthew and Edinson Cavani, celebrates the killed swords at Malmo's gate.
Angel de Maria, who was a member of the Champions League, shot a goal, which allowed the GSP to easily go to Malmo on Tuesday.
Here's a report of a match and a game reaction.
Angel de Maria and Edinson Cavani did their job when the Pari San Germen started their game at the Champions League with a very comfortable victory 2:0 against Malmo at Park de Prances Stadium on Tuesday.
Di Maria killed a ball less than four minutes after his first game in the Champions League began as a game of the "PSG" to turn the champions of France, but they lost a number of opportunities before finally increasing their advantage when Cavani killed the goal at 61 minutes.
Along with Real Madrid and Donkey Shatter in Group A, Pari had to take a good start in the game against the Swedish championships, because they aimed not at the qualification of the playoffs, but at the continuation of the successful series of the last three seasons, where they came to the four finals.
They won, but at the same time it was not the best decision by Lauren Blan to consider the Gold Ibrahimic as useless in the attack and later to replace him in the field against a team from his hometown and club, where he began his brilliant career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win a house or a guest in the Champions League, so to win a 2:0 win, deliver trouble to the opponents and play a great defense is a good start, even if there are other moments we'll have to finish during the season," Blanc said.
It's very promising.
We wanted to win, and we did, even though I'm sorry we didn't kill for one or two more balls.
Ibrahimovic returned after a trauma in one of the replacements of the Paris team, which brought her nothing with 2:2 in a match with the "Bordo" in the First League in the exits, but he gave it back to De Maria's last plan for the fourth minute.
The Argentine attacker noted that he was a player who was able to bring the GSP to a new level in Europe after it was bought at Manchester United last month, and he proved why when he escaped from Mark Verratti behind Malmo's protection and finished a beautiful attack, he sent a ball to Johann Willanda in a distant corner of the gate.
However, if someone expected an easy and great victory at the time, they had to be disappointed.
Malmo, who won Seltik in playoff to reach this stage, with nine world-level players in the field at the beginning of the game, five defenders and two violent semi-defensers in the middle of the field, was a serious opponent.
But with the exception of the shot by Nikola Jurdzič, where the ball flew past the further stand by the gate of Kevin Trappa at the 34th minute, they attacked a little bit.
Therefore, in times of unrelenting transmissions and weak attacks, especially from Ibrahimic, who was unable to accomplish at least five attempts in the first half, and then failed to process the sword killed by Kawani immediately after the game was resumed.
However, he showed himself much more capable in the exact footsteps, and it was a passport from Ibrahimic, which, De Maria sent a ball with a round stroke, which had been pushed to the stand near Wieland for 52 minutes.
The second goal was finally killed after the time mark thanks to the Kawani, the Uruguayan killed his sixth ball in the season after Ibrahimic had sent a ball sent to the center of the field with the left flag Maxwell.
This put an end to any idea that had been at Malmo about the return to the game, and only the close-out capture of the sword by Wiland did not allow David Louis to increase the final account before the goal of replacing Esekiel Lovessi was set aside at the end of the match.
Malme coach Age Harede later admitted that the PSG was the top of his team, while the Norwegian said, "Our last game in the League of Champions took place in December last year."
Since then, we have played only in the Swedish league, and that's not the level.
Not enough qualifications.
Praise "Pary"!
It was a wonderful match with them.

White House confirms Si Xinpin's visit to Washington
The White House on Tuesday confirmed in an official report that China's head of China would be visiting the United States by the end of this month.
This visit - the first visit to Si Cínpina in Washington - will take place on 25 September and will be a response to President Barack Obama's visit to Beijing last November, as stated in the statement.
The President and Prime Minister of the United States, Michel Obama, will also receive Si Xinpin and his wife, Pen Liuan, on the same night as the two leaders hold bilateral negotiations.

A successful biker in the Kutuz sledgehammer received 2 years of colony.
In addition, the Court has partially satisfied the civil claims of the victims of Dani Mirzoevu at 1.2 million rubles.
The Moscow Dorogomilov court sentenced Danny Mirzoev, who killed a motorcyclist at the Kutuzovske Perspective in Moscow.
According to the Russian News Service, Mirzoev received a two-year prison sentence in the colony.
He was found to be guilty of the article "Infringement of road traffic rules and the operation of vehicles" by the UC RF.
In addition, the Court has partially satisfied the civilian searches of 1.2 million rubles.
During the debate, the prosecutor requested Mirzoev to be sentenced to three years ' imprisonment and to recover from him the total number of victims of eight million rubles.
The accident, which is referred to, occurred on 22 May about three hours of the night in the area of the house 30 on the Kutuz View.
The BMW car, followed by Mirzoev, crossed the field of traffic meeting and hit a motorcyclist standing on the side.
From the injury suffered by a man in 1989, birth ended on the ground.
Friends who died in social networks reported that the BMW driver had gone very fast and had gone to the meeting area before the DTP.
Fearing that the driver was trying to get away from responsibility, the bikers organized a motorcycle test from the Walls to the HUMVD Moscow building in Petrovka, 38.
Soon thereafter, it became known that the investigation had led to the alleged DTP offender ' s detention.
In Moscow, a naked man was detained in the temple.
He took it easy and did not commit any wrongful acts, and the police handed him over to his doctors for immediate psychiatric assistance.
The officials of the capital police arrested Moscow, who entered one of the temples without clothes.
This is reported by Moscow.
As told by the head of the U.S. media service in Moscow, Andrey Galiakberov, an incident occurred on Tuesday, 15 September, about 4 p.m. on the Kasher Shoss.
A naked man entered the temple of Saint Nicholas.
He took it easy and did not commit any wrongful acts.
There's been a call to the police.
Lawgivers were waiting for doctors from the emergency psychiatric care unit and handed them over to the man.
The 26-year-olds were born in Moscow.
More than 40 orders and orders were signed by Vladimir Jakušev.
More than 40 orders and orders were signed by the Governor of the Tumen Region, Vladimir Jakušev, at the meeting of the Bureau of the Regional Government.
Some of these included the provision of funds for educational and health institutions in municipal education.
In particular, funds are being made available for the purchase of a bus for one of the schools in the Lowerwater Region, for the capital repair of the district hospital in the Kazan Region.
As indicated in accompanying documents, money will be completed at the capital level of the second therapeutic office.
Warm and cold water supply, water supply, power grids and electrical equipment, ventilation systems will be refurbished, rooms will be refurbished, fire safety and energy conservation activities will be carried out.
The second forum of the regions of Russia and Belarus will be held in Sochi.
The second forum of the regions of Russia and Belarus will be held in Sochi from 17 to 18 September, where the delegation of Turkmenistan will take part in the chairmanship with the Governor.
The upcoming event in Sochi and the interim outcome of cooperation are the honourary General Consul of the Republic of Belarus in Tumena Vladimir Shugla, who is a member of the official delegation.
Vladimir Fedorovic, what are the tasks of the Sochin Forum?
The massive event in Sochi reflects the industrial policy of the Federal State.
It builds on the fruitful cooperation of the regions, an important link between the two States.
President Vladimir Putin and President of the Republic of Belarus Aleksandr Lukashenko are scheduled to attend the plenary meeting.
In plenary and section meetings, the experience of the regional and local authorities of Russia and Belarus in the implementation of industrial policies, the rule of law and the programmes of the Federal State will be discussed.
The Forum will be chaired by the Governor of the Tumen Region.
I believe that this demonstrates the successful, sustainable interregional cooperation of the region and Belarus.
The forum will also be attended by representatives of the relevant ministries and departments, Russian and Belarusian entrepreneurs.
Trade fairs and specialized exhibitions, including from the Tumen region, will be provided.
I hope that the Forum will help to conclude new beneficial contracts and agreements.
I would add that the first such meeting took place in Minsk last June.
More than two hundred delegates, including 19 regions of Russia, participated in his work.
At the same time, a very important treaty on cooperation between the Tumen and the Minas had been signed.
The importance of our work is also stated by the fact that there has been a permanent seminar in Tumena at the Russian and Belarusian Parliamentary Assembly.
In addition, the delegation of the APC of the Tumen region visited the Republic of Belarus to explore the experience of Belarusians in training for agriculture, to identify additional compatibility points and to organize new investment projects in the agro-industrial complex.
You have recently met with the head of the region and head of the city administration.
What topics were discussed?
At the meeting with the Governor of the Thumen area, Vladimir Jakušev, spoke about the cooperation of the region with the Republic of Belarus under the current unparalleled conditions.
The issue of the supply of Belarusian agricultural machinery and the use of financial mechanisms is needed to reduce the value of machinery for the final consumer.
Problems had been discussed in the work of the temple trade house, Belshin, and options for preventing losses.
Matters are important, as investment projects must work and bring income to the region.
It was about further supplies of OAS freight transport technology, the development of the OAS service centre, MAZ, which was established in Tumena on the OAS-based "TPATP".
The discussion also focused on the preparation of a visit by the working delegation of the region to the Republic of Belarus by the end of the current year.
Another topic was the conclusion of an agreement on trade, economic, scientific and cultural cooperation in the Thumen region and the Republic of Belarus.
Thus, the dynamics of relations promise to move to a new level.
These issues were also addressed by the Regional Centre.
At the meeting with the head of the Tumeni City Administration, Alexander Moore, we talked about the renewal of the Tumeni Bus Park.
About 100 buses are already "halved on the deck", so a new batch of cars from Belarus is required to operate on a gas, clean fuel.
Another aspect is that the Tumeni elevator company cooperates with one of the leading manufacturers of the OAS power plant Mogeliftmash.
In my view, this could become more active, taking into account new elevators in the district centre.
I would add that, as part of the expanded mandate of the consulate, a meeting was held with the Governor of the Kurgan Region of Alexe Kokorein, during which the issue of increased duty and the provision of modern Belarusian technology was discussed in Zaurala.
A meeting with the U.S. Governor was scheduled at the end of September.
The expanded consular district includes five RF entities, but Thummen can be called its own headquarters.
The region is a policing ground for many promising projects, including the work of the honouring consul.
In general, such meetings are important and good to enable many problems to be addressed directly and quickly by taking them away and developing mutually beneficial cooperation.
Under the present circumstances, it is vital not to destroy the stock by continuing to work in the future.
Matt Damon against focusing on the ethnic diversity of people employed in cinema production
Matt Damon argued with an African-American producer, Effi Brown, saying that there is no need to take into account the ethnic composition.
During the resurgence of Project Greenlight on the HBO channel, a well-known actor interrupted Brown when she tried to stress the need for an alternative view of the main black hero in the project.
"The diversity is appropriate when you're casting for the film itself, not for the show," Damon insisted.
The brilliant Brown, who didn't believe in his ears, often called out, "Oh, nothing, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
To discuss the finalists of the show, Ben Afflek and Brother Farelli joined Damon and Brown.
"I would like the participants -- no matter who will be the director -- to think about how they are going to behave in harmony," Brown said at the beginning of the discussion.
The only black person is a prostitute killed by a white woman.
The film producer Dear White People said that the film directors were Leo Angelos and Kristen Brankačo; Damon was strongly opposed to saying, "We can't get what we want in the end."
After this discussion was shown on television, social networks exploded with unfavourable comments to Damon.
Twitter user MrPooni was furious about the video saying, "Explaining the essence of the diversity of Matt Damon's only black man in the room TAKOE BELOE, which is painful."
Twitter's got more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes.
Damon's statements appear only once when the written coverage of the theme of the media is the most urgent issue on the public debate.
After a teenager named Michael Brown was shot by a police officer in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement gained popularity throughout the country, calling on lawmakers and authorities to stop discriminatory practices against the colouring population.
In February, the singer Prince mentioned this movement during the nomination of the candidates for the Grammy Awards.
"Albums still matter," he said.
Like books and lives of blacks, albums still matter.
Recently, the Black Lives Matter movement leaders issued an official statement in response to the question of collaborator Fox News Elizabeth Hasselbek whether this group would be considered as a group of haters.
"The Black Lives Matter Network is a group of lovers," said movement leaders.
It was recently announced that Damon was included in the list of actors for the show, producers and the media invited to visit the Pope to discuss the image of the Catholic Church in the West.
I don't know if the actor accepted the invitation and met Papa.
American Ninja Warrior awards the first champion
A professional skallass and Assistant Officer Isaac Caldjero became the first winner of the American Ninja Warrior show on Monday evening, taking away a $1 million home prize.
At this sports show, the 7th season just ended, none of the participants have been able to pass all stages of the obstacles.
At the end of the season, two participants, Caldero and operator Jeff Britten, reached the final round.
The final task was to lift 75 feet long in 30 seconds.
Britain has performed its first task and has set itself in time, became the first athlete for the entire history of American Ninja Warrior, which has been a nudge phase 4, but Caldero has been able to accomplish the task for three seconds faster, which has made him the winner.
After a victory with incredible labor, Caldeira, who was shocked by the winning millions of dollars, gave an interview with E!News.
"I've never worked and lived for more than $10,000 a year," I said to reporters E!, commenting on this serious leap of my income.
And secondly, I've never even imagined what it's like... the future doesn't know.
Executive producer Kent Weid met with reporters "The Hollywood Reporter" to talk about the final and why Britten, who was first on the track, won't get any cash prize.
According to the rules, money is the fastest participant.
"If there's more than one finisher, the prize gets the fastest of them," said Wade.
Although money is a wonderful reward and life changes, it still has great satisfaction.
I don't think he's feeling a bit upset about it.
He was happy for what he did.
He's got tons of hunchbacks from fans.
He's a wonderful man and a family man.
He's a hero for his children and his wife.
Jeff told me, "If I've been told to lose someone, I'm glad it's Isaac."
And I think Isaac would feel the same way if we changed our roles.
The show "America Ninja Warrior" will be back with the eighth season, which will begin in spring 2016.
"Dear Tigers" quietly walk "Minnesota Twins"
MINNEAPOLIS - The second half of the season was not particularly fun for the Detroit Tigers.
One of the best baseball teams ever, Tigers is now taking the last place in the Central Division of the American League.
I'm just claiming to be a match, Tigers with a flash win on Tuesday at Minnesota Twins with a score of 5-4 at Targetfield.
"Twins" missed the chance to cut half-games off Houston Astros and take second place in the game-off according to the number of points after the winners.
For the Detroits, let's even one night, it was a return to the letter F, which took most of the second half of the season.
"All the winnings are fun, no matter how they get," reported the manager of Tigers, Brad Osmus.
Pitcher "Tigers" Alfredo Simon made his contribution to supporting the attack, resulting in Detroit taking three points in the first two innings, then adding one in the sixth and one in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) was a painter in 6 1/3 innings and missed three wounds.
It was only his third quality start for nine exits.
"I just want to finish the year with good indicators," said Simon.
I can't put a spare on every game, and that's why I want to go deeper into the game.
Victor Martínez, who was a black-and-white tiger, was able to take three hits and hit two wounds -- the first RBI from mid-August.
It was the first day with three hits from four hits in the game against Seattle Marines on 6 July.
"He worked well in battle," said Osmus.
He showed himself well in (battery quality), he noticed better in the battle and kept this quality for the game.
I got three wounds in the second half of the seventh inning, and Twins got their best chance to get back to the game.
The central host, Byron Baxton, opened an inning on the left-hand side of the field.
Wrightfielder Aaron Hicks, made a band, took the first base, and the second bassman Brian Dozer got a shot out of Simon before he took his left Blaine Hardy's place.
Hardy went to Morea, the only toy on the road, before the newly appointed renegade Miguel Sano, who picked up the two-year single on the left of the right-hand Drew Verhagen.
In the case of a couple of wounded not in a car and a comparator wound on the second base of VerHagen, it was possible to bring Trevor Pluff's third bassman to double-play.
This was the 27th time for the leading league game this season, when Pluff scored a double ball.
After Detroit had added the insurance wound to the first half of the ninth inn, Moer earned RBI a double in the space between the outfielders against the closing painter "Tigers" Bruce Rondon, and the account was 5-4.
However, the correctional game killed Sano after three strikes and got his fifth saw.
Detroit benefited from the temporary non-practicing Phil Hughes at the start of the game.
"Tajers" earned three mornings in the first two innings against a deserving drinker, who was on the list of traumatized before the game, without more than a month in the event of a fire of explanation.
" Definitely not the start that I would like," said Hughes, "but as the game developed, I felt more comfortable and so I was able to accomplish a few pretty good pieces in the third inning."
After the first beater reached the first base, he dropped the single second bassman of Jen Kinsler.
The eye on the two cars of J.D. Martínez has taken Victor Martínez, who made a single in the middle for the first morning in the game.
Victor Martinez finished his "0 for 21" series with runners in a successful position.
The third base game, Nick Casteljanos, followed by a single, was injured, but Victor Martinez was killed in an attempt to get closer to the third base, so the threat was eliminated.
"Tigers" increased the account in the second inning by receiving a single doodle from James McCann's casserole and a two-car "single" from Anthony Gouz, and it became 3-0.
"It was a powerful hit," said the manager of "Twins" Paul Molitor.
He was not particularly good, but he fell right into the point of need.
Hughes, whom he was considered to be the third innkeeper, was replaced by a lawyer, A. J. Ahter.
Heuzu had three hits on six hits and a four-track-out lesson.
NOTE: Anibal Sanches, right-hand Pitcher, was released in connection with the unfolding of the right shoulder.
He will be examined by Dr. James Andrews, who had performed Sanchez on his shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez, who is on the list of traumas since mid-August, is scheduled to begin on Wednesday.
In the absence of Sanchez, the left-handed Daniel Norris will leave the list of traumatized ones and go out against "Twins".
Norris, dating from "Tigers" at four startups since his acquisition in exchange for David Price's left drinker on 30 July, has 1 victory and 1 defeat.
He did not participate in games since 20 August due to muscle hair growth.
"Tigers" and "Twins" will finish a series of three games on Targetfield on Wednesday.
Against Norris (2-2, ERA 4.43) will play Ervin Santana's right-hand pizza (5-4, ERA 4.73).
The original complaint by Cador on the book "Polba to God" was brought to the South Shaalin Court.
In the South-Sakhalian City Court, the original appeal was filed by the representative of Chechnya Ramzana Kadyorov for the decision to accept the book “Extremist material” “Pray to God: Its Meaning and Place in Islam”, states “Interfax” with reference to the president of the forest of Alexander Chuhray.
The court is now awaiting possible objections from the parties.
The jury refused to comment on the statements by some MPs in the FP on the need to verify the rigour for possible cooperation with foreign services and IGIL.
"The gun itself comments such nonsense," he said.
On 11 September, the South-Sakhalin City Prosecutor's Office appealed to Judge Natalie Perchenko for recognition of the book "extremist material".
The prosecutor's office of South Sahalinska filed an appeal on Friday evening.
There are nuances: the prosecutors believe that they have asked the court to accept only the extremist opinion of the author of the book, not the secrets of the Koran.
In the view of the prosecutor, the judge has made the wrong decision," Chuhrai said.
The decision to accept the book “Extremist Material” was taken on 12 August 2015.
In particular, the people of the Extremist have been called from the Koran: 'We worship You, and to You we pray.' 'Do not call anyone with Allah.'
Kadirov called the decision-makers on the book "Shitans and Provocators".
He called on the Members of the House to rule by law against judicial decisions relating to the texts of sacred writings.
"I am firmly convinced that the House must adopt a law that prohibits judicial decisions relating to the text of the Koran and other Divine Scriptures," Kadirov wrote in his Instagram.
Facebook will remove comments that offend migrants and refugees
Facebook staff are planning to remove posts and comments that give a negative assessment to migrants and refugees.
In addition, the social network will provide financial support to organizations that collect user complaints to the wrong content.
To combat the manifestations of xenophobia and racism in the network, the Facebook Guide is intended to be together with the German Ministry of Justice.
So, previously, the head of the department, Hayko Maas, stated that the minority, together with the specialists, is now engaged in the creation of a special group of moderators.
Its participants are required to track and remove irregularities with regard to migrants and refugees.
According to Hayko Maas, the authors of non-tolerant posts are expected to receive notices indicating the reason for their deletion.
To facilitate the operational blocking of the wrong content, organizations should also be involved in collecting complaints from users of aggravating complaints.
The Facebook Guide is intended to provide them with the necessary financial support.
A decision to remove posts containing negative statements to migrants and refugees, social network management and the German Ministry of Justice was taken after the xenophobic attitudes of the German section of Facebook had grown sharply.
One of the most obvious reasons for them was the unprecedented migration crisis that had taken over the euro area a while ago.
Thus, in Germany today, all the items intended to accommodate refugees have already been filled.
In the past, the country ' s authorities decided to temporarily reside in the territory of the former Buchenwald Concluding.
Deprived migrants from the Middle East and Africa are housed in barracks where prisoners and prisoners of war were detained under Nazi regimes.
There will be a relaxation zone in Moscow.
In the near future, several capitals are immediately equipped with specialized relaxation and psychological rest areas.
Among the first will be the Boutsko, Domodedovska, and the Sharbinska stand.
The first area for psychological rest has already appeared at the Troykuru headquarters in Moscow.
Such locations will continue to appear in other areas of the city.
About this portal, m24.ru told Artem Ekimov, who is the head of the State Budgetary Institution Ritual.
The relaxation zones will represent small green areas that resemble parks.
Professionals believe that in such "angles" visitors will be able to breathe, become alone, and restore psychological forces.
The area for relaxation will soon be built in the Domodedow, Boutov and Sharbin Squares, and then in other areas of the capital.
According to the head of the GBU, Ritual, where there is a need for an extension of the site, the builders will try to maintain the existing forest masses as far as possible.
Green settlements will serve as a living barrier, which will divide the resting areas and areas directly below the burial sites.
The experts of the GBU Ritual also stated their intention to propose a refusal of burial.
New storage facilities can really be free of barriers.
In addition, in GBU Ritual, it was said that electronic terminals could be used to enable visitors to know the GPS coordinates and numbering of the funerals.
In June of this year, the "Ritual" GBU also proposed adjusting the value of funeral services according to the time of the year.
Yes, the wheel of the grave in summer will stand on a thousand rubles of silver, a week of winter when the earth is frozen.
It should be noted that during the last year, the rates for all types of ritual services were on average 10 per cent.
Five days later, in the Elenin woods, we found a stray mushroom.
The old man was alive, though he spent more than a hundred hours in the forest without a provision.
The miner was able to be found through the joint efforts of rescuers and volunteers.
Alexander Blinnikov, correspondent: "The 79-year-old pensioner from the Tambov area spent five days in the forest."
No food and no water.
He was wanted by relatives, rescuers, volunteers.
There were even dogs movies, but there was no result.
The man was found after the search for work was connected to the helicopter.
On that day, Vitaly Alexanderovich used to go to the woods behind bars and shelters, but he did not return to dinner.
The family immediately sought help, and for the next day, about 30 people were raised in rescue and insurgents from the neighboring village.
At five o'clock, the helicopter of the fire-saving centre joined them.
Andrei Seletkov, head of the search and rescue team of the Fire and Rescue Centre of the Small Area, said, "The helicopter was attracted, the man was found."
He's gone very far, quite somewhere else.
It was about 12 km from the search site.
He's gone a great distance at his age.
It's a miracle to stay alive.
The mine was delivered to the Greek Central District Hospital without any knowledge, in a very difficult condition.
The doctors diagnosed him with pneumonia, as well as severe dehydration and overheating of the body.
As an elderly man could stay alive after five days in the forest, doctors are not completely represented.
Valentina Nepša, who is head of the Greek Therapeutic Unit: "A patient study, treatment is scheduled."
Infusion therapy, antibacterial.
Taking into account all his chronic diseases.
The patient's condition has improved in the morning, and remains heavy, but with positive dynamics.
Pensioner Vitaly Aleksandrovic comes to Smolenchen from the Tambov area every year.
His son said that his grandfather had gone to collect mushrooms before, but he never got deeper in the woods.
Alexei Spitchenko, the grandson of the miner, shared: "Lest not far from the road, not in principle local."
He went to the house for a few years to visit his family.
Well, he went after the mushrooms.
I see he's gone away and he's gone astray.
At the start of the fungus season, people are regularly lost in all areas of the Small Area.
Just in the last few days, five similar cases.
Rescuers remember: In the woods you have to walk in bright clothes, with little food, snacks, and compass.
Furthermore, it is desirable to leave traces so that they can be returned.
An An-2 per annum in a brotherly tage.
On average, in Siberia, An-2 was an accident.
An external landing from the Red Air Force Enisey took place 68 kilometres from Bratska.
There are no casualties and no casualties, but the plane itself has suffered considerable damage to land.
An-2 was on a mission trip.
On board, there were three crew members -- the commander, the second pilot, and the boat mechanic, says "Interfax".
The crash aircraft was on the route of the Ferristroske-Ilimski-Achinsk, which is based on the airline.
The aircraft crew has already been delivered to Bratsk.
The Bratial Transportation Prosecutor ' s Office, following an emergency landing, began verification of compliance with aviation safety legislation.
The investigation team of the East Siberian Transport Prosecutor ' s Office was at the scene.
In September 2010, the Tu-154 crew deployed its aircraft with passengers due to technical failure at an abandoned cargo airport in the Commission.
The liner was rejected by the engines and the ship's electronics, but the crew did not make it possible.
There were 10 crew members and 72 passengers on board.
No one was injured when the plane landed.
News Economics - Nobel laureate: globalization
The printing of globalization processes had to contribute to the reduction of world inequality.
The situation seems to be different, but the difference in the income of the population in developing economies is growing.
Eric Maskin.
In order to correct this, it was necessary to increase the level of education of low-skilled workers, and it was considered by the chief scientific officer of the International Laboratory for Analysis and Choice of Decisions of the U.S.A., the Nobel Prize for Economics, Eric Maskin.
Over the past 20 years, the world has experienced an unprecedented increase in global markets.
Trade borders between countries have become increasingly open.
Globalization partners forecast great benefits for developing economies.
"And these predictions have happened in many ways," says Maskin.
For example, China and India have had a significant increase in GDP per capita.
But it's not that happy.
Globalization was expected to reduce the gap between "the poor" and "the poor" in poor countries, which showed a high inequality of income and a more accurate wage for work.
But in fact, this inequality has only increased, notes Eric Maskin in his article "Why global markets have not reduced inequality in developing economies," published in The World Bank Economic Review, which the U.S.A. has translated and quoted.
Together with the economist, Professor of Harvard University, Michael Kremer, Eric Maskin has developed an alternative theory that demonstrates why the income gap in poor countries is increasing as globalization increases, the U.S.N.E.N.E.
Specific processes are taking place in the new global market.
To demonstrate them, Maskin has four levels of professional qualifications -- A and B -- for rich countries, C and D -- for the poor.
After globalization, D professionals from poor countries do not have sufficient qualifications to cooperate with A and B professionals from rich countries.
And if C-level employees from poor countries grow due to cooperation with B-rich staff, D-workers do not feel growth or their wages fall altogether.
The result is that internationalization of production will contribute to an increase in the pay gap between the two categories of professionals in poor countries and, accordingly, to an increase in inequality.
The Kremer and E. Maskini have been offered an amazingly beautiful model, an alternative to the Ricardian theory of comparative advantages.
It explains why globalization has led to income inequality, says Fuad Alescherov, a professor of law conducting the International Laboratory for Analysis and Choice of Decisions, head of the U.S. Department of Mathematics.
And as any powerful theory, I'm sure it will lead to empirical work in this area.
The problem, in the view of Erik Maskin, is to raise the level of education of low-skilled workers.
However, the employees themselves, as the scholar notes, do not have the means to pay for their training.
In this situation, Governments, international agencies, NGOs and private funds can play a significant role, says Maskin.
The scholar notes that the theory developed in no way calls for a halt to globalization, which has produced and produced its fruits in the form of growth of GDP in countries.
Derbent: live connection time.
Derbent, one of Russia's oldest cities, noted his 2000s in September.
In the festival programme, the National Culture Festival of the Dagestan peoples and the Jarmarque in the style of the past, the exhibition of Derbent Caves and the Day of Open Temples, the historic and musical show "2000 for two hours" and the tour of the reconstructed Peter I Museum.
The medieval stones of the Narin-Kala fortress, ancient Arabic inscriptions on the walls, narrow streets and courtyards are all as if it had fallen from the "Thirds and One Night" page.
Derbent is the only city in Russia that has remained in place since ancient times.
Although he was claimed by the Roman Empire, Vizantia, Hazzar Kaganat, and the Golden Order.

The cobblestones in Derbente were still in the fifth century, and the technology of this unique craft has remained almost unchanged until our day.
On one of the street markets, the coves are sold on any taste of the hat, boy or soldier of all colors and shades, with the hair and without it, with a complex ornament and a beautiful fireplace.
The city’s construction began with a magola - neighborhood with one - sided stone structures.
Over the years, there has been almost no change.
Only satellite tiles, wall conditioning and street bells remind you that you are not in the middle of the century, but in the modern city.
In the old part of the city there were details of the watercourse built by Persians about a thousand years ago.
To this day, ancient sources of water have come to be used by locals today.

Debentures usually discuss domestic issues.
But in front of the anniversary, they remember the episodes of the unique history of their city, which affected the fate of the entire Black Sea and Caspian region.
There was a business "game at the airport" in Domodeda.
The capital has a new form of education.
Four hundred students have tried themselves as airport staff.
For this, three aircraft models have been demonstrated in Domoda.
Young people not only reviewed and registered passengers but also operated aircraft.
All of this is in the form of a business game, but it has not become a reality in any way.
The late voyages, immediately two passengers with a break on board, the trap was lost somewhere on the way to the plane.
For this airport - ad.
A standard set of tasks to be decided on by new people is the one that was based on Domodedova's Angara.
In one corner, three major airports from different countries of the world were immediately accommodated.
Today, four hundred students from city colleges and colleges work.
The unparalleled opportunity to learn all about the inner world is aviavan.
Registration of passengers, aircraft maintenance, baggage traffic - even buses on the flight, stairs and inspection of passengers.
And passengers are very troubled.
In one accident with the documents, the other delayed the trip, the third filled the bag with suspicious items.
And all this needs to be done, as in life, at a minimum.
For each of these tasks, they shall be credited with a certain amount of virtual cash, as if the airline had paid them the appropriate amounts for travel.
"In order not to fulfil their respective tasks, the penalty is sought," explains the financial analyst for the Dmitri Hilko game in an interview with the news programme.
The officials of the Ministry of Education are closely monitored.
For them, this exam is an attempt to try a new form of education.
She has already taken part in secondary vocational education.
"The six interregional centres of competence will be formed, which will become, in fact, new models of modern colleges with modern management, with highly qualified staff, with modern equipment," explains the director of the State Policy Department in the field of training and additional vocational education of the Ministry of Education of Russia Natalie Zolotareva.
That's why students don't have global plans.
After three days of such training, they seem to need an exit.
Therefore, the evaluations for the examination were quite logical.
The new smart eyes, the best I've ever seen!
"I received them for having responded in time to the claim to our airport in Instagram," was pleased to be part of the game, the pilot manager of the Frankfurt Airport team, Sergei Schwałov.
The best judges, which is called, were taken to the Kandash to invite them to work by the end of the course.
The US Embassy regrets the closure of the US Centre in Moscow.
The US Embassy in Russia regretted the closure of the foreign literature library of the American Centre.
The Centre worked in Moscow for over 22 years.
The US Embassy in Moscow deeply regrets the unilateral decision of the Russian Government to close the US Embassy at the M.I. Rudomino University Library in Moscow.
"The unilateral steps recently taken by the RF have challenged the commitment of the Government of Russia to relations between the Russian and American peoples, who have not even been interrupted during the cold war and at other difficult times in the long history of our country's relations," says the US Ambassador John Teffta, quoted in Interfax.
The U.S. Centre has established deep and strong links between people and the culture of Russia and the United States.
He was the center of American culture, history and literature in the Russian capital, and served as the venue for meetings with numerous prominent American actors, including spacers, artists, sportsmen, scientists, politicians and writers.
“Just last year, the American Centre carried out more than 400 cultural and educational activities and adopted more than 50,000 Russian visitors,” the diplomat stressed.
Tefft recalled that about a year ago it was decided to close another joint Russian-American project - the FLEX Programme of Education Exchanges (Future Leaders Exchange Program).
The Green Tribunal was quick to settle.
Typical situation: Four officers are standing at the table of Judge Svatter Kumar, hearing his claims for the work he has done.
The court is not fully satisfied with the quality of your work.
We did not give you a 110-page order so that you might be comforted by it," Kumar said.
If there's one more piece, we'll show you all the existing buildings.
Kumar is headed by the National Green Tribunal (NPT) - a judicial body established in 2010 to stop the rapid pollution of the environment, which has led to a sharp economic growth in recent decades.
During that time, the Tribunal was able to consider more than 10,000 air pollution claims, waste collection, geological development, toxic waste and dam construction.
In two of the three cases, the court has decided to terminate the construction leading to pollution.
Incredible high rates: over the last 60 years since India declared its independence for increased industrial development, India has become a country of virgin jungles in one of the world's most populated and polluted countries.
The problem is particularly acute in large megapolises, where infrastructure development is not conducive to rapid urbanization: the city is covered by power, the rivers are filled with pesticides and wastes of businesses and households, and the few remaining housing units are being demolished by new residential quarters.
Despite the formal support of the State ' s green movement, NPT has regularly been criticised by the Government of Narendra Modi, since major investment projects have often been the main cause.
Yes, in May of this year, the Minister of the Environment called the judgments of the court “extreme” and “incompulsory”.
Sometimes the court's decision is indeed impossible to fulfill within the time limit set by the court, affirms the environmental counsel of Raj Panjuvani.
However, the incomplete dolls also have a positive side: at least they force responsible persons to move.
"His main goal is to bypass this system," adds the lawyer.
The Green Tribunal has already abolished several major structures: the closure of the construction of the airport, power stations and hundreds of smaller facilities.
However, people are also trying to remember: for example, during the discussion of the fate of a pharmaceutical company in the state of Telagnan, which is contaminated by the local river February.
We can close your factory, but we're responsible for the economic consequences.
"People are losing their jobs," Kumar commented.
However, such explanations are not always understood by the simple people whose lives can be changed by a single extract of the judiciary.
In April, the Tribunal decided to prohibit all vehicles from entering the capital over 10 years.
Despite a sharp decline in popularity and criticism, Svatanter Kumar refused to cancel the decision.
Instead, he ordered the Government of the Déli to provide statistics on the entry and departure of vehicles, as well as a proposal to purchase 10,000 additional buses, previously recognized at factories if they were able to execute such an order.
As the sources of pollution, such as garbage, fuel quality, and even road accidents began to be found in the court ' s attention, people ' s anger began to diminish.
But the most painful topic of the principle judge was the Gang River cleanup programme, with a pump announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi last year.
When it comes to Ganga, the sacred river for the Hindus, the judge often ceases to restrain his emotions and goes to screams.
Do you know what the word "holy" means?
Someone threw water out of Ganga for God's sake, and there were feces in it, and the judge was burning.
You continue to pollute the river because you think that Gang is Gang, he will take all our sins.
This is the river which we worship, and see what you do with it every day.
The cleaning of Ganga is the most ambitious and expensive environmental project announced by the new Government.
The number of fecal bacteria in this river is now more than 120 times the norm.
Each year between 1.5 and 3 out of 700 million Hindus are dying from infectious diseases.
In February, Narendra Modi even donated money to the Gang Rescue Fund from selling his suit, where he met Barack Obama and another 455 items from his personal collection.
Ecologists have accused the prime minister of populism: the suit was bought for $700 thousand, while at least eight billion were required to clean the river.
The participants of the Green Tribunal agreed that India would have to go a long way before it could be called a developed country, but did not consider that the price of progress should be ecological.
"In the developing country, environmental talks are often perceived as an unfavourable highlight," says the activist, Malik Bhanot.
And the court is trying to find a gold medium between the environment and development."
The man poured blood on several pictures of Dali at the exhibition in Riga.
A visitor to the Latvian Union of Artists in Riga broke the window into the museum and exported the sculpture of El Salvador Dali "An angel's Revelation".
The museum is now presenting the work of El Salvador Dali and Pablo Picasso.
The man of 1985 entered the sculpture hall at 14:20.
He immediately said that it was not enough: he exported the sculpture, he broke the window.
Then he started moving around the premises and covered with blood a few permanent exhibits.
Among them is the portrait of the message of the Meervaldis Kiss Police.
According to the President of the Latvian Union of Artists, Igoria Dobicin, known as Interfax, was also exported.

China calls for a more open economy for peace
The economy should be more open to the world to boost its growth, as President Si Xinpin said on Tuesday, in addressing the reform leadership task force.
"China should focus on attracting foreign investors and experts and developing a policy of openness," he said, addressing the 16th meeting of the Central Steering Group on the full deepening of reforms.
In his view, the expansion of openness and the deepening of reforms would give the economy new impetus and life force and provide a new space for economic development.
The Steering Group adopted a number of directives, including regulating market access for investors, amending border control rules, promoting public enterprises (SOEs), attracting private capital and revising the population registration system.
According to the statement, a list of sectors of the economy and production that are not available for investment will be drawn up.
The system will be phased out through test programmes.
This is an important step, as it will give the market a more significant role in the distribution of resources, ensuring the legality of business and increasing openness, as stated in the statement.
The Government will also weaken control over the powers conferred on it by guaranteeing that companies will run their own business.
The statement also states that China will allow border regions to adopt new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms for strengthening local growth.
More areas will be available to private investors to increase the openness of sub-control States in the economic sectors.
"The government will not change its policy on foreign investors and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign financing companies and provide them with better conditions," said the statement.
The procedure for submitting applications for residence permits for foreigners or the Green Card will be further facilitated by optimizing the requirements and simplifying the delivery process itself.
The meeting also discussed the rights of lawyers and the training of professional judges and prosecutors.
According to the official report issued after the meeting, it was also attended by Prime Minister Li Katán and ministers Liu Yunshan and Zhan Gaoli.
