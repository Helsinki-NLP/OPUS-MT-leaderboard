Bosniaks protesting Croatia's plans for the storage of radioactive waste
In Friday, hundreds of people gathered in northern and western Bosnia in protest against Croatian neighbouring plans to store part of the only nuclear power plant in the region near the border with Bosnia and the main river known as natural beauty.
The demonstrations in the Bosnian city of Novi Grad demanded Croatia to charge the construction plans for waste storage in former military barracks in the town of Trgovska Gora and declared the fight against the project.
The facility would contain waste from the Krško nuclear power plant.
The Bosnians, holding banners with the words "I want a healthy future" and "Stop – (river) Una needs us," said that the storage of radioactive waste can endanger the Union's rivers and the lives of some 250,000 people.
We have to tell NO,
He told the crowd Miroslav Drljac, mayor of the village of Novi Grad.
We have to fight to protect our way of life and our Union.
Located in Slovenia, the Krško power plant built in the 1980s is also to Croatia.
The representatives of both countries will meet next week to discuss additional waste storage issues.
The Croatian public television HRT said on Friday that Croatia has not yet decided whether to build the waste storage itself or to pay for the storage of part of the waste in a new facility built by Slovenia.
Croatian Minister for Environment and Energy Tomislav Coric told reporters that Croatia also has a problem with the use of institutional waste from schools, hospitals and prisons and hopes to find a comprehensive solution.
In Bosnia, activists, officials and residents on each side of the country's ethnic division insisted that Croatia find another location in part of the country closer to the power plant.
"Why does Croatia throughout its territory claim that this is the best place in Bosnia?" asked Drljac.
We can't let them down!

US Congress agreed to sell Poland 32 F-35 aircraft
The Congress of the United States, for a statutory 15 days since the approval of the State Department of the possible purchase by Poland of 32 F-35 multi-stakeholder F-35, did not object to this transaction, which means that the last condition was met before the start of the procurement negotiations.
The Congress decision, although it was not unexpected, is of great political importance.
"After approval of the sale by the Department of State, and now by Congress, I see no more serious obstacles," said John V. Venable, Senior Council of Defence Policy, a conservative think tank of the Heritage Foundation.
The expert explained that under the 1976 Defence Control Act, the federal government, represented by the Department of State, must notify Congress of any planned sale of arms abroad for 15 days before signing the contract if the value of such a transaction, in the case of sale of weapons to a NATO Member State, exceeds 50 million dollars.
The value of the proposed purchase of 32 F-35 thinkers by Poland is estimated at 6.5 billion dollars. This amount includes technical and logistical assistance costs, auxiliary equipment and pilot training.
The main supplier of F-35 - if this transaction is finally finalized - will be the American armed group Lockheed Martin, and its sub-manufacturer is the manufacturer of engines for F-35A band Pratt and Whitney thinkers.
The proposals for the purchase of American thinkers of the fifth generation F-35, on behalf of the Polish authorities, were made in May by the Minister of Defence Mariusz Błasczak.
The Polish offer was discussed in June of the current year during the meeting of President Andrzej Dudy and President Donald Trump in the White House.
If the agreement is finalized, the representatives of the Pentagon will be held under the Foreign Military Sales Programme (FMS).
As part of the FMS programme, Poland has already acquired, among other things, the Patriot anti-racite system.
The price of one F-35 thinker at the time of submission by Poland of the purchase offer was – without weapons and technical assistance – about 89.2 million dollars.
As the US military experts who wanted to maintain anonymity informed the PAP, such a price given in the initial negotiations was "a maximum price, much higher than the price to be negotiated".
"The prices are very low, currently the price of one F-35 is below 80 million dollars, with much less than Eurofighter, which does not have the benefits of F-35," said Venable.
PAP spokespersons hoped that the final negotiations on the purchase of US fighter aircraft by Poland would end this year.
The possible participation of Polish subcontractors in this transaction – offset – will be addressed directly to the American F-35 thinkers producers.
What is the deputy Münchhausen team on the Netflix platform in the "Payton Hobart's Choices" series?
Caregivers and parents with the above disorder show that their healthy child is ill.
The "Payton Hobart" series is on the Netflix platform today.
He tells the story of Payton Hobart, who wants to become president of the United States, but first he has to become president of the academic self-government in his high school.
In Ryan Murphy's series, the designers "American Horror Story" and "Glee", we'll see Gwyneth Paltrow, Ben Plata and Lucy Boynton.
Without revealing too many details for those who have not yet had the opportunity to see the series, he moves on the subject of the Münchhausen team, a mental illness that occurs in caregivers, who act as if the healthy person concerned was affected by physical or mental illness.
There are various types of this disorder, such as the Munich team, which is responsible for causing symptoms of the disease.
The deputy Münchhausen team is based on the simulation that the person who remains under our care has certain difficulties.
It is also called an invented and caused disease, and it is treated as violence against the child.
This is a rare disorder that usually involves a parent who develops symptoms or causes symptoms, so it would seem that his child is ill.
What are the symptoms of the Münchhausen team?
The symptoms of this disease may vary, but NHS points to the following examples of behaviour:
Convinced medical staff, however, that a child who looks healthy feels bad.
Relieving or inventing symptoms.
Falsification of the results that the child is considered to be ill, e.g. giving glucose to urine samples, seems to have diabetes.
Symptoms of the disease, e.g. when giving medicines and other substances to children.
How often does the Münchhausen team show up?
It is difficult to estimate how often this disorder occurs because many cases of disease are not reported.
The study published in 2000 shows that 89 cases of this disorder occurred over two years.
What should be done if a child is suspected of being in danger?
You should contact the local department of special services or call the NSPCC child protection infoline by choosing the number 0808 800 5000.
Nigeria: Police raid at school in Kadunia, evacuation 300 children
Kaduna – The Kaduna State Police station conducted yesterday a raid at Imam Ahmad Bn Hambal school, located in Layin Maidubun Tsumma, Riga, Igabi's self-government camp, arrested seven teachers and evacuated about 300 children.
The police claimed that the children were in a highly dehumanizing condition, and the school authorities objected to this claim.
“ They don’t tell the truth because all the children were there for their parents ’ approval, ” said a schoolmate named Shehu.
Before they took their children to school, they signed a form.
Parents brought their children daily food and knowledge of the conditions under which they were living.
We were extremely surprised by the arrival of the police and the evacuation of the children, as well as the removal of the entire food of the students delivered by the parents before the school was closed.
That's not right, because parents can tell if their children are in bad conditions, as the police say.
He added that the former Commissioner of the Abdurrahman Police, who once visited school to check the level of care for children, never had any reservations.
He claimed that the children were studying the Koran and nothing else.
However, the Posteruncist of the Public Relations Police, Yakubu Sabo, admitted that after giving the government the status of children, they would join their parents.
‘It shall be maintained under dehumanising conditions in the name of giving or acquiring Korean knowledge.
A lot of them had a scar on their back, which proves it's bito.
That's why we're studying school to get to know her owner," he added.

"I think Donald Tusk and Malgorzat Kidawa-Blonska have a chance to win the election with President Andrej Dud," says Thomas Semonika.
Deputy Chief of the Population Platform Tomasz Semonikak spoke to Polsat News about an affair with chief NIK.

He can be a minister of culture from some entertainment, not a chief of NIC, or a minister of finance.
No one who's responsible for billions, for the data," he said.
"This is a very serious state crisis," he added.
Seimonak also spoke of the candidate of Claudia Jachiry.
‘The PiS lists are Antoni Macierewicz.
A man who didn't just say things, he just did them.
He was the head of the former KSKW for espousing Russia, destroying their lives, destroying their families.
Why doesn't anyone appeal that Antonie Macierevich was not on the list?" he asked.
“The young people from us have a different aesthetic.
I think that Jachira, who for one thing has already apologized, feels that sometimes she's overcome.
Let's not do this campaign problem," he added.

"Adolescent" masked child rapist from Central Coast forced to look at his victim in court
Dressed in a masquerade, a man caught up with a 12-year-old from the back and brought her into dense growth in Central Coast in May 2017.
Then he tied her to the tree and raped her.
Soon after the arrest, a search warrant was carried out in his home, where officers kept a number of important items for investigation.
The man was convicted of seven charges relating to the attack and three other charges relating to the detection and sexual exploitation of another girl, aged 11 years, between August 2016 and August 2017.
The 12-year-old victim walked on the path, and when she looked behind her, she saw the suddenness of the crusades armed with a large spear and knife.
When she prayed "stop, stop, stop," she grabbed her neck and forced her into adulthood.
The man said: “Don’t yell.
Don't yell because I'm gonna have to hurt you."
Holding the knife in his right hand, he tied her hands and her feet with cables, and then he tied her up to the tree and yelled for about an hour.
When he cut her off, the girl ran to school with a hysterical scream.
The man got to work around 9.30 without responding to a few text messages and contacts from his colleagues.
His clothes were dirty and he carried traces of grass and wood, and he himself claimed that he was involved in a road rage attack, where he chased another driver in the bushes and fell off his couch.
The next man's case will take place on Tuesday.
The Pope calls on the executive directors of technology companies to use artificial intelligence for the common good
On Friday, Franciszek warned the executive directors of technology companies, diplomats and financiers that, with the pursuit of artificial intelligence and other forms of digital achievement, the risk of increasing social inequalities is linked if, in its course of ethics, the common good is not taken into account.
Pope Francisk delivered these words at the Vatican conference, which was attended by government envoys and representatives of Facebook and Google, as well as philosophers, physicists and ethics.
A small group of scholars and bishops of the Catholic Church gathered participants at the conference "The Common Good in the Digital Age".
This is a three-day event, the latest evidence that the Vatican is interested in the debate on prospects and dangers related to artificial intelligence.
It discussed the technological achievements in the field of war art and the future of work, which will increase the role of machines, as well as the study on the case of a study in Christchurch in New Zealand and decisions taken by companies owned by social media in connection with the expansion of the film recording the massacre.
During his talk at the conference, Pope Francis praised the potential of technological progress, noting that the machinery at the beginning of the industrial revolution saved workers from dangerous and monotonous work.
He warned, however, that more and more dependence on robotics in order to achieve gains is the risk of people being deprived of the value of work.
"If technological progress would become the cause of increasingly visible inequality, it would not be real and real progress," he warned.
If so-called technological progress was to become an enemy of the common good, it would lead to an unwanted insanity of some kind of barbarity under the most powerful law.
The conference organizers expressed the hope of using the expertise of the participants and identifying potential future advisers of the Catholic Church in matters related to high technology.
Martin Odegaard, a coach hired by Real Madryt, is making fans in euphoria his effective assistant.
Martin Odegaard recorded an impressive assistant at the opening of Michael Oyarzabal’s goal.
By winning 2:0 with Ossuona, Real Madryt has climbed to the top of La Ligi table and continues to be an unencumbered band in his own battle this year.
However, despite the fact that there is no failure in this season in La Liga Zinedine Zidane, there is a huge pressure on her as a result of the stormy pre-season period and the public battle with the Wall Star, Gareth Bale.
The situation reached a turning point when Real Madryt was humiliated in the Masters League by Paris-Saint Germain (PSG).
However, Zinedine Zidane and Real Madryt have real talents at their disposal – for some of them the French have plans, for others not.
Vinicius Junior is an example of such a star of the future of Real Madryt and is currently playing in the team.
However, the Norwegian young player Martin Odegaard, who was loaned to the Real Sociedad, caused a great movement, counting an incredible assistant in the La Ligi game.
During a meeting of the Real Sociedad with Alaves Martin Odegaard, he performed an impressive assistant at the opening goal of Michael Oyarzabal and Real Sociedad finally won 3:0 in front of his own vision.
After taking the ball on the right, Martin Odegaard ordered the player from the opposite team, establishing a network for him, and then sent him a great deal of power between two other racers and his teammates just left to deliver his leg.
The second gate of Williana Jose and the third in performing the amazing Oyarzabal, this time from the prison throw, provided a decisive victory for Imanola, before Man Garcia was sent out of battle five minutes before the game was over.
Martin Odegaard joined Real Madryt only as a 16-year-old in 2015, but he had difficulty trying to meet the expectations of fans.
Now, at the age of 20, the Norwegian footballer finally seems to feel safe on the battlefield.

“ED will know where his name came from” said Anna Hazer, a multiple participant in the protest against corruption.
Sharad Pawar objected to the Royal Act and claimed that he was in no way connected with the Bank, as well as the fact that the case was reported a few weeks before the elections in Maharashta on 21 October.
The former Minister of the Union has ensured that he will not lie with the Majesty of Delhi, clearly referring to the central government of the BJP party.
NCP assessed the case of the Executive Directorate as politically motivated.

Is this the punishment of God?
What does the Church say about suffering?
Cataclysm, severe disease, child's death.
It's a drama that causes a lot of suffering and it's hard to understand.
We're asking, "Why?"
Sometimes we also hear that "God wants so."
Does the Creator send us misfortune and sickness?
John Paul II was very suffering at the end of his life
When Nick Vujicic was born 36 years ago, his father was terrified to leave the hall.
"My son has no arm or leg!" he cried to the doctor.
Their parents did not know that their child was suffering from an incurable disease that left them with no end.
At first, they couldn't accept the boy.
But they prayed, and after four months, Nick's mother felt that God had a plan for their child.
She decided to love her son with all her heart.
Today, the Vujicic is a world famous evangelist and motivational speaker, making many people turn around.
"I'm proof that God is never wrong," Nick stressed.
"When suffering touches us, it is difficult to understand.
We're looking for reasons.
We ask, "Why did this happen to us?"
If we believe that God rules the whole world and directs our lives, there is naturally a question of whether he has sent us a disease, an accident...".

“ I will never be able to express myself fully in words, ” said Judge Jeremy Richardson, “as you have done.
The crimes you've committed, they're talking about themselves.
The murder of two children.
An attempt to kill four children and the whole conspiracy to get rid of them.
I am practically convinced that each of you will be punished at the appropriate time for several sentences of life-saving freedom."
This judge has decided whether it will be a punishment for an indiscriminate deprivation of liberty without the possibility of parole.
The verdict will fall on 12 November.
Po Sejł PO Krisztof Bryza calls Cézaro Gmyza
"As a result of the campaign of written lies, I am on my way to Cézaro Gmyza," the post-Krzysztof Brejz was informed on Twitter.

Boris Johnson addressed to the police department in charge of the close relationship with businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri
The IOPC's independent police authority shall examine the possibility of initiating an investigation against the prime minister explaining whether, during the conduct of the public authority as mayor of London, it has been allowed to commit a criminal offence.
The Council of Great London (GLA) stated in a statement that its supervisory inspector registered the "question relating to the proceedings" of the Prime Minister in connection with the allegations of preferential treatment of Arcuri arising from their close acquaintance.
“The ‘procedure’ can be referred to when information indicating the possibility of committing a crime appears,” he said.
It doesn't mean it's proven in some way.
IOPC will now consider whether it is necessary to examine this matter.
The issue was addressed to the IOPC, which deals with complaints against members of police services in England and Wales.
She was transferred to the police department because Johnson was then acting as the appropriate police commissioner and criminal commissioner.
Johnson objected to his close relationship with Arcuri as if it had come to any irregularities.
He said earlier that he would apply to the order of the London City Council and provide details on his relations with Arcuri, but he relied on the Council to "come up with an incorrect problem".
The decree is followed by the report "The Sunday Times", that Arcuri, an American who moved to London seven years ago, received 126,000 pounds of budgetary money, as well as privileged access to three foreign trade missions, which were then the mayor of Johnson.
As a result, the government had frozen a grant of £100,000 for Arcuri Hacker House until the case was considered.
The government is looking forward to asking questions about the verification procedure carried out before the grant of the funds.
Minister of Digital Science Matt Warman said in Izbe Gmin that his department's employees "usually maintained proper care" and that the company has a British phone number.
According to numerous reports, however, the number was transferred to the office in California, where the 34-year-old Arcuri is now to live.
The close relationship of the Prime Minister with businesswoman "was a secret police staff".
The GLA decision to direct the case to the independent IOPC police department met with dissatisfaction at 10 Downing Street.
According to the source of the higher rank of government, it is "politically motivated attack", and its term, in the pre-conservative Conference of the Party, is "political".
"The Supervisory Inspector has not presented any evidence confirming the charges and the Prime Minister has not been given the opportunity to reply to him before the press release late Friday evening" says the source.
Neither citizens nor the media will be able to rely on such a clear political law.
Today, in the early hours, journalists "The Standard" said that the close relationship between Johnson and businesswoman from California, who was assisted by the agency for tourism and promotion in London, was "the secret of police".
The London & Partners (L&P) said that Arcuri was given a place during the foreign trade trips of Johnson as mayor, despite the fact that her company was then not considered "reliable".
Third-party drug offences related to Mac Miller's death
LOS ANGELES (AP) – As a result of the death of rapper Mac Miller over drug overdose, a third man was arrested and charged with committing drug offences.
According to the court documents, Stephen Walter is suspected of selling processed oxycodone pills made by fentanyl, which Miller had in his possession before his death in September last year as a result of accidental overdose of cocaine, alcohol and fentanyl, a strong opioid responsible for the “epidemia”, which buried several thousand human beings in the United States.
Walter complains about the delivery of pills that another man, Cameron Pettit, sold to Miller.
The court documents sealed Tuesday reveal that Pettyt was receiving drugs from Walter all August.
Ryan Reavis, who was arrested earlier this week in Lake Havas City in Arizona, is suspected of playing the role of "curier" Walter, who delivered the pills to Pettito.
Neither man was directly accused of causing Miller's death, nor did any of them present defense lines in his case.
Walter, who was released on a drug parole in 2005, is in custody and has been further sentenced to five months' imprisonment for violating the conditions of release.
Prosecutors dealing with the case that they first brought on Thursday's website dedicated to TMZ Celebrates are asking Walter to remain in custody waiting for the trial, claiming that there is a serious risk of the defendant's escape.
The reply to the message left to his lawyer's automatic secretary did not come immediately.
Pettito was put before the federal court on 4 September, and his defendant refused to comment.
The word of Miller's novels is sincere about his depression and the use of drugs, which makes him a fan of the biggest hip-hop stars.
From Pittsburgh Miller, who was really called Malcolm James Myers McCormick, for two years he left behind in connection with the songmaker Ariana Grande, who finished earlier in 2018.
After his death in the Instagram portal, she published an exciting film with the participation of Miller and the creation of "Thank U Next", which mentions him with love.
Miller is one of the musicians whose death has been linked to the abuse of opioids in recent years.
Matthew Roberts, a guitarist from 3 Doors Down team, also died as a result of overdose in 2016 and his body identified the presence of fentanyl and hydrocodone.
This Article is amended as follows: the correct spelling of Walter's name is "Stephen", not "Steven".
9-year-old Nigerian creates over 30 games on mobile devices
9-year-old creates a game of fun with free Scratch 2 programming.
Scratch 2 allows users to create games, animations and stories in online or offline mode.
So far, Basil has generated more than 30 games for mobile devices.
Today’s game is a non-topper that is kept in accordance with the program.
The player gets a point every time he grabs a bat that comes out of the shelter.
The creations of the game have been taught at an accelerated course.
"Now I create them when I'm bored," Basil CNN said.
In March, Dad wrote it for a five - to - 15 - year - old class.
The course, organized by Codefest International, aimed at providing children such as Basil, access to new technologies such as robotics and virtual reality.
The boy's father, Basil Okpara senior, says Basil played a lot on mobile devices.
“When he was 4 years old, I bought him a tablet because he always caught the phone and played it.
He played a lot in Candy Crush and Temple Run," said CNN's father.
But Basil's interest in making games grew when he was 7 and got a bull for spending all the time on the game.
"One day he played on the table as usual, and he was so embarrassed that I was upset," said his father.
I said with anger, "You're still playing, can't you think about creating your own games so they can play it for others?"
Speaking those words, I was upset and didn't think he'd take them seriously," he added.
Since then Basil has shown an active interest in the science of creating his own games, has moved parents to purchase laptops and to write it on course, where he has known the basis of the creation of games.
Basil, who in the future wants to be a scientist, gives his gram of title based on their contents.
One of his games, "Mosquito Mah", is available on Google play store.
Africa has the largest population of young people in the world and, like Basil, this population includes innovation leadership in the continent.
Two Nigerian 12-year-olds have recently been celebrated for using codes to create robots that divide their jobs at home.
In May, the Acrobot team from the middle of the female school in Ghana won the Robofest 2019 competition for programming robots for box-stamping.
And thanks to the growing investment of giants in the field of technology, such as Google and Microsoft, in Africa, Basil and its peers are on the right path to a career of coding stars.
Former President of the Republican Party in the North Carolina Admits to Corruption Lies
Of the court documents filed in Friday, it is clear that the president of the Republican Party in the North Carolina has admitted in court that he has lied to federal agents investigating the corruption of the main political donor.
According to Wakanda Robin Hayes, he's going to be admitted to guilt in the future.
The document containing a factual basis prepared under the defence agreement and signed by Hayes states that Hayes knew that it was a false statement by FBI agents investigating corruption in 2018.
The defence agreement has been signed, and there is no factual basis for Hayes's accusations.
He was initially accused of verbal abuse, corruption, and false testimony.
The prosecutors have accused former Congressman Hayes of participating in the plan of the insurance company's authority to run a campaign to the head of the insurance market regulator in exchange for special treatment.
Director Greg Lindberg and his two partners were accused of trying to repurchase the State Commissioner for Insurance Mike Causey.
Lindberg is the founder of the insurance and investment company, which has been one of the main state-of-the-art political donors in recent years, who has been transferring more than $5 million to national and federal candidates and committees since 2016.
He supported mainly the objectives and policies of the Republican Party, but also gave thanks to the Democrats.
His lawyer did not respond to a Friday e-mail request.
The defendant Hayes Kearns Davis did not respond to the Friday e-mail request.
Of the reports made on Friday, Hayes reported that he lied to FBI agents in August 2018 when he said he did not talk to Causey about the State Insurance Department employees.
According to a document containing Hayes' factual basis, he actually spoke to the Commissioner for Insurance on Lindberg's request for changes in the staff employed by the market regulator.
The prosecutors claim that Hayes also helped Lindberg organize a meeting with Causey and that he talked about the trap directly with the regulator.
According to the April Act, Lindberg required special treatment of his insurance activities and planned to transfer up to $2 million to the case's new campaign in 2020.
The complaint also shows that the contract also includes a request for a change in the department's official who controlled Lindberg.
The future Republican Causey has announced the alleged attempted corruption to federal agents and has helped them to collect evidence on the matter.
He wasn't charged with any charges.
According to Lindberg's complaint, Hayes ordered him to transfer $250,000 to the cause of the campaign during the interview, where Lindberg and Causey were also present.
In the course of Hayes' conversation, he initially protested that the transfer of such a amount of money would draw attention, but as a result of the complaint, he finally stopped.
"Whatever you all want to do, we will do" – Hayes said according to the indictment.
"Okay, I'll take care of it."
The Federal Prosecutor's Office did not reply to an e-mail requesting further information on the agreement.

Our goal is a state of well-being
"We are building a state of prosperity in Poland," Zbigniew Ziobro, Minister of Justice, ordered.
He came to Szczecin to call for a vote on the counsel of Darius Matecki, a candidate for the Sejm from the List of Rights and Justice.
"The programme of good change is the implementation of the Polish version of the welfare state strategy," the minister said.
"We want the Polish to make a lot better for their lives to be at a higher level.
This is necessary because otherwise young, dynamic, well-trained people will leave Poland, and we cannot afford to do so.
For four years, our government has consistently carried out a programme that has been committed to carry out four years ago.
We said we'd put in the 500 plus program.
Platform, Donald Tusk and Eva Kopcz said it's impossible that the money just doesn't exist.
We proved that the money was and that it was, but the PO did not care about those to whom it was due."
Ziobro also reminded the children's manufacturing and the thirteen-year-old – and that the four-year-old's pension is also planned.
In addition to the "resolved share of national income", PiS priorities are a just country and economic development.
The money should not be given to a large stream of selected pockets, which have a good relationship with the institutions and the authorities, but should be given equal access to the entire society – he said.

Facebook with a feeling of self-esteem hiding on a sample of favorites
As part of the first experience in the world, which aims to improve user self-esteem, some of Facebook users will soon under the others will not see the number of favorites, reactions and video displays.
Favourites will be hidden and visible only for the author of the post and this change will be introduced in Australia following a similar test carried out on Instagram in July.
A new version of Facebook launched next Friday will also be launched in Australia.
Mia Garlick, director of Facebook's privacy in Australia, said that the change was the result of a study on self-esteem and an opinion of mental health experts showing that a number of favorites can be compared to others.
"The clothes from the many groups that cooperated with us on the fight against nuisance, as well as the organizations in the field of mental health, were really positive," said Garlick.
The elimination of this number will make people focus on the quality of their interactions and on the quality of their content, not on the number of favorites or reactions.
It is expected that sharing with others through the platform will be more enjoyable and will not be taken as a rival – it has been stated.
Garlick has ensured that companies that rely on Facebook will continue to receive the same indicators and observations that they have had access to so far.
She stated that it was too early to be able to determine whether the test would be extended to other countries, as was the case with Instagram when the test was carried out in Australia, Canada, Brazil, New Zealand, Japan, Italy and Ireland.
As with Instagram, which belongs to Facebook, there is no indication of this when the experiment ends and whether the change will be introduced on a permanent basis.
"Initiating user comments on new rules in the Instagram were positive, but at this stage we are still learning and listening to opinions" – she said.
Commenting on the site of the world experiment, Garlick said Australia has very active, technically well-known Facebook and Instagram users.
We believe that this is an incredible country that provides us with measurable opinions indicating whether new experience is valuable for people using our services or not.
Frequent: Counsels want rewards for pilgrims
It is often not commenting on the Council's appeal to Abpa Wacława Depo for financial compensation for the maintenance of the waste economy in the pilgrim season.
The city's asking for 1 zł from the pilgrims.
On Friday, he spoke about the event addressed to the metropolis at the press conference, including the leader of the Spring Robert Biedronia, organized on the front page of the Spring Frequent Mountain, the Most Holy Mary Missy, the vice president of the town council and the candidate for Sejm Lukasz Kot.
As he reported that a day earlier, SLD advised the Abpa Wacław Depo to pass on to the city one gold from each visiting frequent pilgrim – to support the work of urban, municipal, etc.
We accepted an appeal to Archbishop Depo to help the city, help us clean up the pilgrims, get the town for the pilgrims.
"Please refer to the budget of the symbolic city of gold from each pilgrim.
This city will enable them to enjoy better living conditions in Chęstochoja," the vice-president of the city council said.
Asked for a comment by a frequent speaker who had originally prepared a few comments, Mariusz Bacalarz, but then asked, as he pointed out, at the order of abp. Depo, to replace it with information on the content: “By the time we received the official position of the city council, we did not refer to the matter”.
According to a project on the site of the frequent Magistrate of Appeal to Abpa Depo, "the provision of financial compensation for the City of Frestoch for the maintenance of the municipal waste management system during the pilgrim season".
"As a result of the increasing number of pilgrims coming to the Common Pilgrims and therefore increasing the cost of the management system of municipal waste during the pilgrim season, taking into account the city's views among the residents and residents, fishermen and fishermen, we would like to offer a share in the costs of handling the waste system, as part of the generally accepted canons of care for our common well-being, a small father of the Commons.
"In order to maintain, in an appropriate manner, the purity of pedestrian tracks moving by pilgrims, while using small infrastructure, i.e. external waste, we present a proposal for symbolic participation in the municipal waste management system in the amount of 1 zł from pilgrims," it said.
"In addition to the participation in annual costs that the city covers from its own resources, taking into account the purity and aesthetics of the urban area, and wishing to emphasise that such cooperation will benefit all parties, we declare that 20% of the amount will be spent on improving tourism infrastructure, for example by increasing the number of publicly available public toilets," the Council stated.
They noted that, however, the financial issues they proposed resulted from the number of reservations made by the residents regarding the condition of the roads that are moved by pilgrims.
"In view of the clearness of our city and the possible positive effects of cooperation, the Council of the Common City calls on the Archbishop of Wacław Depo to provide financial compensation for the Common City for the management of municipal waste during the pilgrim season," the appeal was repeated.
According to the press office, 834 thousand people attended the sanctuary in 200 Polish pilgrims throughout the year.
About 124 thousand faithful ones arrived in 255 pilgrims.

A total of 20 disabled persons arrived in the sanctuary, and more than 170 pilgrims from two groups were on the roll.
"Knowledge" TVP mentioned the Confederation when describing the survey
According to a poll conducted by Pollster, in the elections to the PiS Sejm, 45% of the votes, KO 26%, Levica 14%, PSL 7%, and the Confederation 5%.
The election threshold was even written on the "Super Express" portal for which the survey was conducted.
In the main edition of "Knowledge", describing the same survey, only four first parties were presented, completely ignoring the Confederation.
The leader, Edith Lewandowski, made it clear that only four committees crossed the electoral threshold and would enter the Sejm.
The TVP also showed the division of seed mandates without taking into account the votes given to the Confederation.
It would give PiS self-government.
Krisztof Bosak commented on this whole situation as "a public compromise on honesty towards society".
“They began with a sense of “moral revolution”, he recalled and said that this was a sign of weakness.
In turn, Robert Winnicki wrote on Twitter that "The knowledge of TVP" in further actions against the Confederation shames Urban and Michnik".
He also drew attention to the lack of legal reactions of journalists.
"But let us also look at those who allow silence.
These "rights", "independent", "incorruptible".
In a few years they became a more primitive version of all that they fought with at midnight," he added.

Brother sentenced to life penalty for honouring the social media stars Qandeel Baloch
Qandeel Baloch, who became the star by means of a photo published in social services, was released in July 2016.
The Pakistani community media star Kandeel Baloch was convicted of her murder on Friday and sentenced to life imprisonment for the most loudest "honor killing" in this patriarchal country.
Baloch, who won the praise by publishing smiling selfies, which are in accordance with Western standards, but in a powerful misogynistic Pakistan considered to be a provocative, was drowned in July 2016.
Her brother Muhammad Waseem was arrested.
A few days later, he said during the press conference that he had no convictions about his actions and stated that "of course" he had murdered his sister and that her behaviour was "unacceptable".
His lawyer, Sardar Mehmood, told the AFP that the court in the western city of Multan recognized his client as guilty and sentenced him to life in a long-awaited sentence.
"Inshallah (if God permits), will be executed by the higher court," he said.
Earlier Baloch's mother, Anwar Mai, announced to the AFP that she hoped her son would be executed.
“He is innocent.
She was my daughter, and she was my son" – she said.
The murder of Baloch has hit the heads of world information services and renewed calls for action against the so-called honour killings, in which victims, usually women, are killed for breaking the patriarchal social principles.
Women were burned, raped, shot or stylized for crimes such as choosing their own husband or, as in the case of Baloch, for bringing their family "greed" by manifesting their own sexuality.
The murders are usually committed by a close bloodthirsty.
According to Pakistani law, Qisas (blood money) and Diyat (debt) may ask the nearest victims for forgiveness.
Three months after the assassination of Baloch, Parliament adopted a new legislation introducing the punishment of a life imprisonment for honour killings.
However, whether the murder will be recognized as an honorary offence remains in the presence of the judge, which means that the murderers can theoretically rely on other motives and be imprisoned.
In the case of Baloch, her parents initially pressured their son not to show kindness at all.
However, the controversies feel that they can also lose it, change their mind, and declare that they want it to be destroyed.
The international repression caused by the murder has led the Pakistani state to take an unprecedented step and to announce that they are falling behind with their parents, thus forcing the case to move forward.
One of the most well-known works of Baloch is to offer a stripper to the Pakistani cricket team and set up a decolonized purple dress in Valentina.
She was criticized and threatened, but many, including young people, viewed her as a violation of the country in which the position of Kim Kardashian can be considered a bold and political movement to strengthen the position of women.
The root cause of the "honor" killings lies in the noble social standards that continue to prevail in South Asia, and in particular in order to regulate the behaviour of women, although men can also be victims.

Anarchy doubles the number of displaced persons from north-west Nigeria to 40,000: UNHCR
On Friday, the United Nations said that increasing violence has caused the number of people displaced from north-west Nigeria to nearly 40,000 people in the last four months.
The UN Agency for Refugees has found that concern has created a "new exceptional humanitarian situation", which requires an inter-agency effort to collect by the end of the year the new measures amounting to $35 million.
Babar Baloch, spokesperson for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, said that the Islamic group Boko Haram, which has been in the northern part of the country for decades, is not responsible for the recent attacks.
The increase in violence in the Nigerian states of Sokoto, Zamfara and Katsina observed over the past 10 months is rather the result of organized armed groups.
"It's a scary picture of anarchy and uncertainty," he told reporters on Friday.
He reported on frequent reports of rape, torture, forced murder, and sexual assaults by attackers, who also destroyed homes and stolen property.
The military and police were sent to fight gangs of criminals in the region.
However, the army is withdrawn from the fight with Boko Haram and the withdrawal of the Islamic State in West Africa, which was separated from its former group in 2016.
“Friends don’t come with group names” – he said.
They're coming for it with the magic stories.
Most refugees arrive in the neighboring Niger.
In his statement, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said that more people are expected to flee to Niger in the coming months, along with the worsening security situation, in particular in the state of Sokoto.
A new date has been set for the trial of the male accused of killing women and 2 children.
A new date has been planned for a man from Guatemala accused of killing the state of Iowa and her two children.
According to the Polish District Court, 31-year-old Marvin Escobar-Orellan is accused of the first-degree murder of the first floor, according to the authorities, by a false name that first handed to the police: Marvin Esquivel-Lopez.
He didn't admit it.
According to the police, he shot 29-year-old Flores Rodriguez, her 11-year-old daughter, and her 5-year-old son at their home in Des Moines on 16 July.
The court's documents show that the new date of the case, i.e. 27 January, gives both parties more time to prepare.
The immigration and customs officials of the United States state that Escobar-Orellana is illegally staying in the United States and was deported twice before the shooting.
In 2010, he was sentenced to illegal entry into the United States.
‘The Sun’: Boris Johnson in the form of a cabinet grant that seeks to reduce the demands of the Brexit and to reach a compromise agreement with Brussels
In just three weeks before the final EU leaders' summit of the country's most important people around the Prime Minister, there is a growing fear that he will not have enough time to get more important items.
Boris Johnson is facing the risk of a bribe on the part of the office that wants to reduce the demand for a break and reach a compromise agreement with the EU.
In the negotiations, there was an impasse on the new customs system, which would replace the backstop mechanism for Ireland, because Brussels had defined the proposals for other provisions offered by Johnson as "inexhaustible".
The Corona ministers expect EU decision-makers, headed by German leader Angela Merkel, to offer you recently a compromise as a three-year deadline for the backstop mechanism.
The Sun journalists spoke with three different cabinet ministers, all of whom are preparing to confront the Prime Minister after the annual tourist conference next week in Manchester.
The "aggressive" strategy, developed by his close advisor, Dominic Cummings, on the attempt to use bluff against the EU and threaten to leave the Union without an agreement, will be called upon to accept the proposals he has recently made by the Union.
One of the cabinet ministers identified the jury's verdict of the Supreme Court on Tuesday to end parliament's detention as a "warning signal" and added: "The only way we can leave the European Union on 31 October is to do so on the basis of the agreement.
We've never encountered arithmetic in the Gmin Chamber, which works for our disadvantages.
The Prime Minister must now swallow and accept what he is able to get.
Aggressiveness doesn't pay: it's obvious that Cummings' plan burned on the board.
We can't fight on so many fronts.
The second cabinet minister committed himself to hand over to Johnson to try to break the agreement of former Prime Minister Theresy May, if not everything else.
This minister said, "If I have to, I will tell the Prime Minister to re-present the agreement proposed by Theresa May in the Gmin Chamber."
There are many opportunities for her to vote, and it is all very important to end this issue.
If we're forced to extend the deadline, it's the end of Boris Johnson and the end of all of us.
John Major accused Boris Johnson of not taking negotiations seriously.
In a brief speech, the first minister of the tourist team said: “The Prime Minister tells us that he wants an agreement with the European Union.
But we don't see him sitting in Brussels and working on it.
Instead, it goes against cattle in Scotland, it checks eggs in Wales and fights with citizens on the main streets – everything in the world's eyes, as if it's already going well with the election campaign."
The speaker of the current Prime Minister admitted yesterday that the agreement was still far away and added: "No one should have a bad idea: to ensure a very long agreement."
However, the speaker also said that the Benna Act introducing a three-month delay in the absence of an agreement "actively weakens our negotiating position" in Brussels.
He said: "There is no doubt that this law makes negotiations difficult, but despite it, the first, together with the workers, is still trying to make progress through hard work."
Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay is returning to Brussels today, where he will have more discussions with Michel Barnier on the EU side.
They will discuss a book on how to operate the area for all of Ireland for food and food.
A dog with no nose and legs is subjugated by Instagram.
Perfectly imperfect
The customer was supposed to be asleep.
However, this has been prevented.
The bitch was transferred from Romania to Britain by Beacon Animal Rescue Centre.
A photo of the sand was published on Facebook.
Kate Comfort fell in love with the animal since the first appearance.
"I started having trouble convincing my husband to adopt because we already had three dogs," she said.
The woman decided that she would take care of her mother until she was adopted by someone.
But no one's reported it yet.
"The fact that no one wanted her made me want to take care of her more and more.
She was sensitive and needed love," Kate said.
Finally, the marriage decided to adopt Bonnie.
"Our Bonnie is perfectly imperfect.
We love her the way she is, and if anyone doesn't like the way she looks, it's his problem, not ours," said the woman.
Bonnie has become a social media star over time.
In Instagram, more than 14,000 Internet sites are being watched.
Lorraine Kelly: It's said that with the music accent, I'll never make a career on TV.
According to Lorraine Kelly, TV bosses said that because of the accent from Glasgow, "never makes careers" as a presenter.
Referring to her 35-year-old career in Kelly’s television industry, in 59, she admitted that before the first show on the screen, she felt “great frustration”.
"I was only 25 years old, and I was very upset," she said.
When I worked in BBC Scotland as a specialist in research and information, the chief said that through my accent from Glasgow, I would never be successful on TV.
I went to London to meet the entire TV team and watch the show before I took up office duties in Glasgow.
I'll never forget the interview with the star of Bette Davis by Anne Diamond and Mike Morris that morning.
I didn't believe I was in the same room with a live legend.
I knew I wanted to stay here.
Before Kelly became a shock correspondent for TV in 1984, she began her career as a local reporter in East Kibride in Scotland.
She then started running programs such as GMTV, ITV Breakfast and Daybreak, to start later with her early "Lorraine", who took the name from her name.
The 35th anniversary of her career is a special program that will bring to mind her best memories of moments and interviews.
The representative said that the secret to her long television internship is “passage and enthusiasm” and “interest”, adding: “We have to work hard.
Be honest and authentic.
Prepare for the programmes and be both interesting and interesting.
When he mentioned the media reports that disturbed her emotions, Kelly explains that "very difficult" for her was the relationship of the attack in Dunblane.
I had no idea that many families of children killed or injured are watching our program live from Dunblane day after the terrible killing of sixteen children and their teachers.
One of the mothers, Pam Ross, whose five-year-old daughter Joanna was murdered, asked me for a private meeting, during which we spoke for hours at her home.
The whole meeting took place quietly, and Pam Ross and I have been friends since the funeral of Joanna, where I took part.
She added that "very difficult" was an interview with Kate and Gerry McCannami shortly after their daughter Madeleine disappeared in 2007 and that "they really admired their strength and courage".
They have to deal with the pain because they don't know what happened to their beloved daughter, and in addition, they have the most terrible comments online trolls.
I'm with them with my whole heart.
The programme will start at 8:30 on Monday, September 30 at the ITV station, on the 35th anniversary of Lorraine Kelly's work.
Zimbabwe: Chiwenga was afraid of imprisonment
The senior state official claimed that Vice-President Constantino Chiweng rejected the offer of taking over the president's office made by the non-living president Robert Mugabe at the top of the coup because he feared imprisonment to confirm the takeover of the military in November 2017.
As the 'The Zimbabwe Independent' presented last week, Mugabe offered the Vice-President of Chiwanze the presidency during the negotiations with the military in turn.
However, the higher rank of state official announced in the community media that Chiwenga did not reject the offers of fear, but because he looked at the Mugabe plan to use it to prove to the world leader and the African Union (AU) that he actually lost during the return.
In the Twitter portal, which confirmed that the 37-year-old leader of Zimbabwe wanted to pass on to Vice-President Chiwand, not President Emerson Mnangagwa, Jamwanda 2, which officials confirmed to the state that he was a senior official in the Bureau of Presidents and the Council of Ministers, it was claimed that there had been intense negotiations on the matter at that time.
The state officials said that Mugabe contacted Chiweng via one of his envoys when he realized that his authority was missing.
The mediation between the military authorities and the former president had, in the view of the higher rank of state official, three stages.
The official stated that among the participants in the negotiations, he was the spokesman of President George Charamba, a person who then played the role of Chief of the Central Intelligence Organization Aaron Nheper and a spiritual representative of the Roman Catholic Bishop Fidelis Mukonori.
They were bank chief Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, Gideon Gono, was another element since Mugabe sent him with a single mission to hand over the offer of the Chiwänze Presidency, who was head of the Defence Forces of Zimbabwe (SOZ).
A man, who was considered more than ever after his death as an African icon, tried to get rid of the U.S. military action by trying to lure other African leaders into intervention.
The President's offer made by Mugabe to the former Chief of Defence Forces (SSO) of Chivanze did not come out of the election.
"It was a desperate act to save a situation that took a dangerously fast pace, removing a part of the deceased's family," the official wrote (Jamwanda).
But there was also some political temptation for which the deceased wanted to reverse the situation in a completely non-deployment way.
It is enough to remind ourselves that the leaders have stated that they have not covered nor covered the constitutional order, which would cause their conflict with the U.S. position on revolutions.
The dead (Mugaba) hoped that then the SSO (Chivenga) would be forced to force, violently interrupting the leaders' claims that they did not cover the constitutional order.
The hope for the dead (Mugabe) was that the UA, which, on the margin, was still highly distracted by the whole situation and the way it was adapted to its theoretical taxonomy of revolutions, would not have a different choice at the same time than to describe it as a coup, so calling for military intervention would be credible.
It was in such a spirit that the offer was made with such a balance.
Officials claimed that Mugabe had made this move when he realized that the defence forces had no longer shown readiness to protect him.
They said that Mugabe was forced to sign a resignation letter after warning the mozart that he was risking a Kaddafi-style lynch.
The Chiefs told him they wouldn't return a shot against the citizens if they moved on to his residence, Blue Roof.
And at the same time, Mugabe had two wishes to save his family and prove that the army had taken over," the officer added.
The early SSOs and the commanders have read the premises correctly.
To the consignor (Gono) carrying this desperate message to understand – through a powerful metaphor – that wemakwapa-makwapa isus (which belongs to the camouflage sect, i.e. the army), we are not politicians or we are not competing with each other at political level, has claimed a higher rank of state official.
State officials say that the military has informed military commanders in the region through attacks that have been in Zimbabwe that they do not intend to cover Mugabe, but to deal with his "criminalists".
Mugabe tried to use the same strategy to re-engage Mnangagwa from a short exile in the Republic of South Africa so that they could talk about revolution and success.
In addition to negotiations with the army, Mugabe also sought assistance in the region.
The inhabitants of the South African Republic, which is a key element of the process – not only because of their economic and regional power, but also because the former President Jacob Zuma was president of Sadc – rejected the intervention, but clearly indicated that if the army finds the Mugabe house, as it has repeatedly feared, the troops of the South African Republic will immediately appear in Harare.
"It didn't work because Putin and African leaders didn't choose this route," said the Independent.
China needs a strong leadership or they're going to "depart" as a policy document
China needs a strong, unified leadership of the Communist Party, because otherwise the country will be "distorted" – the government stated in a document on the policy issued on Friday in the early 70th anniversary of the establishment of the People's Republic.
The Chinese government's Press Office reported in the White Paper that the country's success since the Communists took over 70 years ago led to the party's leadership.
The Chinese occupy a large area, they have complex national conditions, but the administrative difficulties are rarely seen here.
The document mentions that without the uniform and strong leadership of China, they will move towards divisions and divisions, which will be disastrous for the world.
The Chinese authorities have been applying a policy of long-standing strength when dealing with problems, as in the case of a wave of pro-democratic protests in Beijing in 1989, and thus justifying the need to maintain the stability of the country.
President Xi Jinping, who has been holding a strong hand, will be at the head of the business of the second-largest world economy on Tuesday, from the time he took over the office by the end of 2012 to strengthen the party's governments and impose sanctions on those who can question the authority.
Xi also oversees the military modernisation programme, which has disappeared from the region's balance.
The document stated that China did not attempt to export its development model or want to import any foreign models, seeking only peace, rather than "hegemony".
The Chinese do not have the genes of other nations or domination over the world.
In modern times, China has been oppressed by great power, and wars and unrest have left deep impression on them as a result of the suffering they have experienced; China will never cause the other suffering they have experienced.
China covers this year in times of uncertainty for the country affected by the bitter war on trade with the United States and facing challenges due to the decommissioning economy, as well as anti-government protests in China in Hong Kong.
The document says that China never "negotiates" its most important interests, nor will it allow anything to damage their sovereignty.
With regard to the country's trade dispute with Washington, it was found in the document that "the danger of trade wars and the further increase in customs tariffs do not lead to a solution to the problems".
China is a mature economy with a full industrial system, a complete industry chain, a large market place and a strong pace of economic development.
The document added that "military trades will never weaken it".
The Chinese are certain that they are able to face difficulties, the crisis to replace and open up a new world.
It has also been added that the United States should take a reasonable look at the development of China, because China does not intend to question the position of the United States, nor does it want to replace the United States.
The United States cannot control China, and even less likely to stop the development of China.
The limitation and weakening of other countries and the transfer of national border misunderstandings do not provide the United States with a strong position.
World Jack Pulkiewicz: Dubai, real faces
Dubai's emigration is a place that still seeks its own identity, scattered between the Bedouin tradition, the religious radicalism of Islam and the extremism of progress.
This marked new trend of world tourism leaders will stir up imagination and desires, leading to the emptyness of wealthy snobist hotels and attracting the fortunes of investors and traders to the status of the tax haven.
Websites are enthusiastic about this city of dreams, which is an exciting celebration of luxury and concentrated architecture in the 21st century.
They grew up in the rich wasteland of sand emirate became Eden for those who love the rest, five star hotels, a beautiful weather and a pool set hundreds of meters above the earth.
It is a great pleasure to experience the universal gap, the appreciation of creative hyperactivity and the hysterical pursuit of avant-garde.
This is the city whose motto says everything: “Walk, shame, and horrified.”
And it's almost every step.
But there are also those who can look at Dubai critically, calling it a city of no character.
According to British writer Lawrence Osborne, “the full range and contrast of the metropolis has taken the size of the dental grotesque.
It turned into a futuristic nightmare, completely dominated by the Guinness Book of Records, an unofficial constitution of emigration.
Because everything here has to be bigger and more beautiful than anywhere else in the world.
However, there is a lack of something in the old Europe that may be a little transparent, but important for the quality of life.
In Wrocław, Berlin or Madrid, everyone feels like in their home.
I'm sure not in Dubai.
Running away from the magic world, I broke his gold mask, revealing the other faces of the artificial paradise.
It's a numerator that doesn't speak or write.
I'm showing an Asian nest that contrasts with the basic living conditions of the divine caste of the ethnic Dubains, the illiterate Bedouin grandchildren.
I leave in a place of extreme poverty, such as a ghetto on the edge of the city, where under harsh conditions the army of Asian workers lives.
This is exactly what they built in one generation under the slave conditions of the desert of Manhattan.
They came here with good wages and the ability to provide a decent life for their families, and they were left with nightmares.
The tourist will never see it because it could blow up in the air created by the years of Mit Dubai.
More and more the criticism of the international community makes the topic of modern labour very difficult for the emir.
Mel C of the Spice Girls team has banned in their home talks about diets after their fights with eating disorders
Melanie Chisholm, of the Spice Girls team, admitted that there was a ban on the use of diets in her home, after she had been struggling with eating food disorders for years, eating only fruit and vegetables.
The sport of Spice has for years not come and "abscessively practised" as a result of the pressure associated with being a famous member of the pop group all over the world, which later caused depression and eating disorders.
She now reveals that her experiences affect the way she educates her daughter Scarlet, so she “does not allow her home to talk about diets. ”
"Scarlet is now 10 years old and I start to realize that he is more aware of his appearance," Mel said.
“I think that one of the best ways to experience eating disorders is to be very aware of how I speak to her.
The use of a positive language has now become my habit.
In an interview for the Women's Health Mel magazine, which was celebrated in the 1990s as a member of the Spice Girls team, she said that in the days before the creation of social media, the "absorbing" press commented on her topic had created complexes.
"I began to look at myself in an inappropriate way, rejecting some groups of food products, practicing more and more obsessively until I began to have a problem," he says.
"I was sick and it probably lasted a few years."
A picture that has shaken the world
The Polish girl and American documentaryist gave the world a witness about the atrocities of war.
Legendary picture of Julien Bryan can be seen at the World War II Museum in Gdansk
"Listen to my story.
I'm talking from the crowded city of Warsaw.
I can and must speak on behalf of the Polish people about what happened here.
America must act, must help!", began his radio presentation documentaryist, photographer, Julien Bryan.
In the tragic, September 1939, he was in the capital of Poland, seeing the drama of the bombed city and its inhabitants.
His relationship turned out to be a wide-ranging equestrian in the West.
The president of Warsaw, Stefan Starzyński, first helped him, lent him a car, but then asked him to leave immediately for his own safety.
Bryan wrote a farewell letter to his family in the United States, deposited it in the embassy safe, and... he stayed.
For the next four weeks, he tried to be everywhere where the guards were.
400 aircraft and artillery almost stopped attacking the city.
Bryan spent his life in pictures of death, suffering, a struggle to survive in the ruins of the city.
Just before the capitalization, he and the embassy workers had a negative impact on the ocean.
He didn't stop talking about Hitler's crimes.
He appealed to the world: “What Warsaw met, Paris, London, and even New York”.
His shocking chronicle was watched by President Eleanor Roosevelt.
Soon the United States began preparing for war.
“Dad showed the truth and thus fought German propaganda.
They were making films that glorify their wealth.
They said they didn't attack women and children, and people believed them," says Sam Bryan, son of Julien.
Report before the jury against the former sportsman accused of numerous rapes
The process of violence committed to the former baseball team of the University of Delaware, which is accused of numerous sexual assaults, is before the jury.
On Friday, after 10 days of reporting and hearing the arguments, the jury members joined the 23-year-old Clay Conaway.
A woman who was 21 years old says Conaway raped her when she went to his home in June 2018.
The event took place three weeks after the two acquaintances were closed to the Bumble meetings site and the woman was sent by the man of the photo on which he was naked.
The woman is one of six Conaway's sexual assaults in the years 2013-2018.
In the view of the prosecutors, the woman’s consent turned to violence, which met with her opposition.
The defenders call on the opposite sexes of women and husbands in memory and claim that the woman probably regretted that it had come to an intimate close.
Gold on two wheels: Polish bike for a million gold
A gold bike worth a million gold could be viewed on the anniversary, the 10th edition of the International Biike-EXPO Rives.
This is an extraordinary vehicle printed on a 3D printer.
His constructor, 30-year-old Adam Zdanowic, just got him on the Oscar bike at the World Exhibition of Custom Wheels in Las Vegas.
An unusual specimen made a furor on the markets.
It's an unusual coating made by my colleague from Jór.
"It's a seat, it's a pedal, it's a driver, it could be a normal ride.
It can develop speeds of 50 kilometers per hour.
It's an electric bike," he says.
‘The bike car was printed on a 3D printer.
It's six types of virus.
I came up with this model on my first bike home a few years ago.
I drew it on the card and hid it deep into the suffocation.
Snick's been waiting for five years to realize.
Sam's bike was set up for three years," adds Adam Zdanowicz.
“It was extremely difficult to hide all the elements under the body.
There are batteries, wires, building elements.
This is hidden under the body of 11 elements on the steel frame of the bike.
There's also a motor hidden there.
The driver to this bike was set up a week before my departure to the United States at the World Rover Exhibition.
I couldn't finally decide what this manager was like.
She's a transporter.
Rover weighs 90 kilograms," he sums up.
The gold-covered bike was rated in Las Vegas as the most important competition category "Best amazing single custom sample".
Film material shows strong pollution of popular tourist sites
The Sydney Park surrounded by the opera building, the Circle Quay Port, the Luna Park entertainment park and, of course, the famous Harbour Bridge bridge make an important contribution to the amount of $21.9 billion, annually pumped into the Australian economy by tourists visiting Sydney.
But under the bridge there's a bad truth.
The well-known Sydney Bay is one of the most damaged waterways in the country, to which the volume of pollution affects about 15 Olympic pools each year.
These horrifying statistics make one of our biggest tourist acts at the same time one of our most brutal waters.
According to the new film material entitled "Zatoka Sydney – up and down", the waters around Australia’s most popular city are full of garbage, plastic nets and bottles, lost shoes and parts of clothing, and even dead animals, all of which flow into the bay with rain showers.
However, the most important part of the breathing system of our marine canals is plastic.
“I would call this paradox” – says Dr. Katherine Dafforn, director of the Sydney Harbour Research Program, published on 27 September, with the publication of this film in full line with the World Tourism Day.
This Akwen looks beautiful, but it is one of the most altered and damaged to enter the river along our coast.
The CSIRO Agency estimates that every hour about 1560 kg of plastic is presented in our waterways, and most of it affects the bays by means of rapid sewerage.
"After such powerful fall of the trap... it seems rather tragic," said Dr. Dafforn.
Two thirds of the pollutants come from rainwater.
However, as in the case of a mountain of ice problem with Sydney’s pond, it is much more serious under the surface of the water, as 70% of the plastic that is present in the ocean hits the bottom of the sea.
“In my opinion, unless time is spent under water, you can’t really realize what’s at the bottom of it,” said Richard Nichols, owner of the Dive Centre Manly, pointing out that he and his team draw about 500 kg of plastic from the water each year.
I think if more people knew (what's under the water), they'd just be scared.
It's overwhelming... over half what we find at the bottom are plastic nets.
The remaining 50% are the things that are at least made of plastic.
When you look at the pot, it looks beautiful, and people can't believe that all this plastic and all the other trash we're getting right under the surface.
Jeremy Brown, co-founder and CEO of Ocean Protect, found that there are ways in which people – both local and tourist alike – could help reduce the amount of plastics and the rest of our waterways.
"It must start at the source," he said.
We need to reduce the amount of plastic used by us, better conduct material feedback and have a greater awareness of what we're pouring into the streams that eventually hit the oceans.
If we destroy the ocean, we're starving because 50% of the oxygen we breathe comes from the ocean.
It contains 30% of the carbon dioxide and our food source.
However, we can arrange this curtain and restore it to the former glory, which is very simple.
If we die our oceans, we'll kill ourselves too.
The film material financed by the TOMRA recycling company as part of its wider efforts to educate Australians in the field of environmental protection and reduce the negative impact of containers on the environment, which often affect the environment, shall be carried out during the study on the relationship between artificial and mental health products published this month.
The new survey carried out among 546 children aged 12 to 18 years found that 82% of respondents feel vulnerable to plastic waste, and 25% of adults’ blame for the problem of waste from one-time plastic packaging.
The study revealed that plastic wastes were also the fourth to the size of the concerns of parents, and 93% of the 551 surveyed parents said that their concerns related to the amount of plastic waste that is present in the oceans are increasing.
Many people who took part in the study said that they wanted to do something about plastic waste, but they just don't know how to make significant changes that led to environmental fear.
Poland – Slovenia.
Memies after the match of sitters in semifinal ME
It wasn't an easy match.
The Slovenians had a natural public on their side, which effectively deconcentrated Polish netizens.
A lot of controversy has also been raised by judges who in one of their actions have not been able to take four steps on the economic side.
It happened at the key moment of the first set, when the underprivileged Vital Heynen had a chance to get rid of the rivals and win the first party.
However, this did not happen, and the Polish finally had to recognize the height of the race, which after winning 3:1 in the final tournament.
Ghana: Kaneshie Dealers Support Psychiatric Hospital in Accra
The members of the Kaneshie Market Association provided a diet worth 30,000 GH yesterday? The Psychiatric Hospital in Accra during a short ceremony that took place in Accra.
This is an element of the 40th anniversary of the Kaneshie Market Complex.
Various food items, fruits, non-alcoholic drinks, teasing, clothing, funerals, bananas, maniocs and water works were included.
During the visit, the group also spoke with several local patients.
The event was attended by members of the Accra Markets Limited staff, the Directors of Association and the Queen's Mothers.
In presenting the items, Mrs. Mercy Naa Afrova Needjan, president of the Women's Association of the Great Accra Region, announced that generosity is an element of the regular activity of the welfare group within the framework of social responsibility.
She noticed that the support for care for the patients in the camp was necessary to show them love and to allow them to feel part of the community.
Mrs. Needjan promised hospital support from the association and invited other associations to follow this gesture.
Taking gifts, Dr. Pinnaman Appau, the hospital director, praised the support association and promised that it would be well used for patients.
She called on other hospital support organizations.
Google creates a cloud in Poland.
PKO BP partner
The State cloud operator, PKO BP and PFR, has launched a strategic partnership with Google.
Cooperation will help Polish companies to implement and exploit the potential of cloud computing technology.
Google Cloud Platform products will be included in the offer of the National Cloud Operator, and Google will open in Warsaw called the Google Cloud region – i.e. the loss of technical infrastructure and software dedicated to customers from Poland and the Central-East Europe region.
The Google Cloud region will be the first global, public computing cloud installation in Central Europe.
The numbering of Polish companies was one of the key assumptions underlying the project of establishing the National Cloud, initiated and developed by PKO Bank Poland and by the Polish Development Fund, the participants of this company.
The Country Cloud Partnership and Google are another important step on the way we led a failed year ago, announcing the launch of the State Cloud Operator.
The objective remains unchanged – the digitisation of the Polish economy and the dynamism of its growth.
"Now Polish companies get additional, refined tools for its implementation.
By using them, they increase their chances of progress to the world league, which we all care about.
The fact that Google joins them today greatly strengthens our joint project," says Zbigniew Jagieło, President of the PKO Bank of Poland.
The Polish Development Fund notes that it is interested in investment projects that support the development of modern industries and businesses.
“Investment in the National Cloud Operator is ideally incorporated into the PFR strategy as an important element of the country’s digitisation.
It will provide businesses with modern and affordable solutions based on cloud architecture.
"I am convinced that this cooperation will also have a positive impact on the development of the Polish IT market and attract the best specialists to it," adds Paul Borys, PFR president.
Google Cloud offers advanced technologies, products and analytical tools based on leading technical infrastructure, providing computing power and data storage services.
Customers in Poland will find all key Google Cloud Platform products such as Computer Engine, App Engine, Google Kubernetes Engine, Cloud Bigtable, Cloud Spanner, or BigQuery.
The inclusion of Google Cloud services in the offer of the National Cloud will allow Polish entrepreneurs to use exactly the same advanced technologies from which they benefit from global competition.
However, we will remain in Polish jurisdiction and under the control of local regulators," says Michał Potoczek, president of the State Cloud Operator.
It adds that the company will be ready for megatrends, such as IoT, which increase the need for the calculation power necessary to process oblique data collections.
VI General Polish Parade of Seniors
On the same afternoon, August 24, 2019, at Ronde de Gaulle in Warsaw, the VI Parada of Seniors "Growding Speanali" and Piknik Pokoljn, events organized by the Start Foundation began.
“ The Council is an event on a global scale, ” said Wisnijewski of the Foundation.
It has been through the centre of Warsaw for the sixth time to identify how large and diverse communities are elders.
Through Paradise, we oppose harmful stereotypes affecting older people and call for intergenerational solidarity."
The parade was conducted by a special five-star driver serving as a mobile music scene on which the traditional famous Warsaw DJ Wika has already performed.
Participants in the joyful choir, at the second known Warsaw and World War II, passed by the Alejas Jerusalemski, ul. Kručí to Plac Poustančov Warsaw, ul. Mazowiecka to Plac J. Pilsudski and ul.Krālewska and Krakowski.
During the march, where several thousand seniors, representing 300 senior organisations from all over Poland, took part, the colorful delegations were welcomed by numerous groups on the route of the march, the Warsaws and the tourists.
From Legionow, two organized groups in corporate yellow and blue shirts took part in the parade.
The first representative of the University of the Third Century and the Senior Club+ and the second under the name SAGA, the Senior Active Group of Animators.
At the campus of the university, organizers prepared gastronomic and numerous stops of institutions and companies offering seniors services and products to improve their daily life and functioning.
Medical, cosmetic, culinary, recreational, sports and fashions were found there.
For example, at the Stylish Seniors of Seniors' Voice from professionalist Hanny Pekarski and designer Agnieszki Vrwał, you could get tips and information on current trends in fashion 60+.
In addition, Stoisko offered a workshop of the science of movement after the scene and posting to the photos.
It was a pleasure to show the style fashion of the Seniors.
The most recent edition of letters and material on the campaign "Stop manipulation – Do not buy at presentation" was found at the Senior General Voice Station.
Other stands offered cosmetic, moving, plastic and artistic workshops.
Several studies and consultations were conducted with health and nutrition specialists.
Discussion panels were also organized with the participation of Helen Norowicz, Beaty Tadli, Marioli Bojarskie-Ferenc, Tomasz Jacikov or Robert Janovski.
The picnic did not miss the vocal and music attractions.
A legend of Polish song – Krzysztof Krawczyk, and the evening of the intergenerational dance that led the DJ Wika, took place.
Tasmanian devils can provide guidance on cancer treatment
Tasmanian devils may have a key to cancer treatment – researchers have completed a breakthrough discovery that may revolutionize treatment for patients
Medical researchers have discovered how to mask some new cells
Researchers have found that the same process takes place both in the Tasmanian devils and in people.
There is hope that this discovery will bring new methods of treatment for oncological patients
What do the common Tasmanian devil and people have?
New cells that can become invisible.
Researchers, including Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre in Melbourne, have completed a breakthrough discovery that can help to revolutionize the treatment of some tumours if they do not respond to immunotherapy.
It may also contain a key to the treatment of mortal tumors within the face that threaten the future of the endangered Tasmanian devil.
The study established a way of masking some of the new cells in both humans and bagels, using a group of proteins called PCC2, which excludes the marker that would otherwise give the immune system a boost to the attack on the newborn.
This may be the biggest challenge in the treatment of small cell lung cancer, neuroblastomas and type of skin cancer called Merkla cell cancer.
"The great importance of this project is that in patients who sometimes develop resistance to immunological therapy, we may be able to reverse this process," said AAP chief researcher Mark Dawson of Peter Mac.
Existing therapies can be directed to re-injecting markers, proteins called MHCs, which will allow the immune system to detect the tumour cells.
"Possiblely, this has far-reaching implications for people with lung cancer," said Professor Dawson.
“It is one of the most common diseases on earth.
And maybe we'll be able to treat her much better.
Researchers also hope that the discovery will ever be used to treat the faces of the Tasmanian devil, where new cells similarly avoid detection.
"It is unusual that exactly the same process is taking place (in the case of human revolutions and the Tasmanian devils)," said Professor Dawson.
“How difficult it has been to treat the asses of the Tasmanian devils so far.
But if people's drugs can also be used in the Tasmanian devils, there is a possibility that this will help control the disease."
Scientists wonder that around a really small star, there's a very big planet.
Scientists are amazed at the discovery of a solar system 30 years of light from Earth, which undermines our current understanding of the processes of planet creation, because in this system, a large planet like Jowis is surrounded by a small star called red karma.
Artistic illustration of the GJ 3512b gas-type planet surrounding the central star of the red horse, published on 26 September 2019.
In general, stars are much larger than even the largest planets surrounding them.
However, as scientists said on Thursday, in this case the stars and the planet are slightly different in size.
The size of the star called GJ 3512 is about 12% of the size of the sun, but the mass of the planet that surrounds it is at least half the mass of Jowis, the largest planet of our solar system.
"Yes, it's an absolute surprise," said astrophysicist Juan Carlos Morales of the Catalan Institute of Space Studies at the Spanish Institute of Space Studies, who was the head of the research published in Science magazine.
The discovery is surprising because the theoretical models of solar systems suggest that low mass stars are usually the parental stars for smaller planets like Earth or smaller Neptunes.
"In this case, we discovered a planet of a type of giant gas similar to Jowis surrounding a very small star," said Morales.
The planet that, like Jovisz, consists mainly of gas discovered using telescopes in Calar Alto observatory in Spain.
It surrounds its star after a very elliptical orbit, and the full circle lasts 204 days.
Red horses are small and have relatively low surface temperature.
The GJ 3512 star is not only much smaller than the Sun, but to some extent it has a size comparable to the size of a very large planet, as it is only about 35% larger than Jowis.
They emit less energy, so they are lighter than the sun, and their surface temperature is rather low and is about 3800 (degrees) Kelvin (6380 degrees Fahrenheit / 3527 degrees Celsius).
"That's why they have red colors," said Morales.
"There is evidence of the existence of a second planet that currently surrounds this star, while a third planet could be evicted from a star system in the past, which can translate an elliptical orbit of a planet similar to Jowisz," said Morales.
The planets come from the same interstellar disk of gas and dust that produces the star around which the planets surround.
According to the leading model of the creation of a planet called a model of acretion, the object is originally made of particles that are fixed on the disk, and the force of gravity of the planet at the early stage of development allows for the creation of an atmosphere of the surrounding gas.
This unusual system can explain a competitive model called the gravitational instability model.
"In this case, the protoplanetary disk around a young star can be a little more massive than expected and may be cold," said Morales.
This leads to a lack of stability of the disc and may result in some more dense areas.
These masses can grow until they fall and create a planet.
Delicate worker charged with co-administration of phasol dip containing methamphetamine
The sheriff’s office in Marion’s county stopped Cassandra Medinium-Hernandez, 38 years old, for the administration of a Fassol dipu worker containing methamphetamine.
On Thursday, 38-year-old Cassandra Ani Medina-Hernandez was charged with the supply of methamphetamine and the consumption of that substance controlled by another person, both of which are crimes of a second degree.
The complaint was filed on the basis of a 9 September event taking place in the food store Triftway in Jefferson.
In the statement made by the OregonLive.com portal under an oath indicating the likelihood of guilt of 27-year-old employee suspected, Marion's deputy mayor said that during the lunch break she saw Medina-Hernández do a dip of beans, which she then felt.
On the basis of the statement, it is known that the victim of the crime, who, according to what she had reported, never took methamphetamines, said that “she thought that one of the pieces she had eaten tasted strangely, but did not raise any suspicions about it”.
When she got back to work, she felt like she had a stomach spread and couldn't stand her feet.
According to the newspaper Albany Democrat-Herald, she went to a local hospital where it was found that a pheasant dip could contain methamphetamine.
Based on reports from The Smoking Gun, another police officer said that Medina-Hernandez " told her that she was adding drugs to food", while others admitted that the suspect sent her message, claiming that methamphetamine had reached a Fassolian dip by accident.
OregonLive's window informs about the recording from the delicacy monitoring, which is said to show how the back of the Medina-Hernandez camera pulls something out of the biston, stands behind the microwave and goes away.
Then it relaxes, rips off the nose, goes to the table, and lays a Fassolian dip in a small paper dish.
According to the police, the thing that she pulled out of the buston was probably also on the plate.
Oregano Statesman-Journal reports that the officers of the sheriff's office claim that there is no doubt at present that the customers are being given food damage.
Medina-Hernandez is in Marion County prison – a designated bail amounting to $520,000.
According to The Smoking Gun, her extensive police record indicates that the woman was already convicted of assault, robbery, identity theft, the delivery of methamphetamine, theft, possession of methamphetamine and possession of illicit weapons.

What does KAS do about chief NIC?
The rental of real estate at a lower market price is the reservations that arise in connection with the case of the President of the Supreme Chamber of Control of Marian Banasia.
What the treasure store does in this matter we asked at the Treasury Administration Chamber in Kraków and at the Ministry of Finance.
Bertold Kittel, in his report for "Supervisory" TVN, expressed doubts about the statement by the President of the Supreme Chamber of Control of Marian Banasia.
For a few months, the study has been the Central Anti-Corruption Office.
Control is due to end in the second half of October, after parliamentary elections.
According to the statements, Banas was to rent a stone with an area of 400 square meters and two smaller apartments.
In total, he received 65.7 thousand gold each year.
The Supervision report revealed that the hotel was located in the stone rented by him for an hour.
The chief of NIK later explained on state television why he only picked up more than 5,000 gold a month for renting real estate.
"Gazeta Eborcza", referring to experts from the valuation of real estate, has estimated that it should be 15 thousand gold a month behind the stone itself.
"The amount was lower for a simple reason: I concluded a preliminary contract and that the tenant had to buy this stone, which led me to agree on a lower fact that the remaining items would be settled at the sale of the stone," Banas said.
However, doubts arose as to whether such a procedure did not constitute a violation of the law.
Konrad Zawada, the press spokesman for the Court of Auditors in Kraków, informed TVN24 that "this case is directly addressed by the Ministry of Finance".
"All such questions, please address the Minister of Finance," he added.
Zawada explained that in such cases "the State Administration is responsible for the operation".
The press spokesman of the Ministry of Finance, Paweł Jurek, admitted that the Treasury itself is monitoring a number of cases that may raise reservations.
"The Treasury is acting in such a way that it has its own information, as well as it is based in a sense on those information which is publicly available.
On this basis, it decides whether or not to conduct any specific proceedings," the MF spokesman explained.
"But because we are all in the entire financial reserve, we are never talking, because we cannot speak in individual cases of a particular taxpayer, a particular person, or a particular company," said Marian Banasia.
The Minister of Finance Jerzy Kwiecinski stressed that "the treasury authorities do not communicate this kind of message to the public."
"It is known that the whole treasure machine is dealing with a lot of similar cases throughout the country," he said.
Secrets of the royal family: visitors often flying the royal plane were shown
Within the framework of their duties, members of the royal family must travel hundreds of times around the world.
This usually facilitates a royal plane – a private machine that drives a royal family all over the world to important events and events.
It's not surprising that having your own plane is linked to privileges.
Members of the royal family do not have to stand in long rows to recover, do not apply their baggage limits, and, as it turns out, may invite any guests on board – including truly unharmed ones.
According to a recent premiere on Channel 5 of documentary film, not only the queen and Prince Philip often travel by royal plane.
During the program entitled “King’s Secrets of Flights,” a king’s flight navigator revealed that with the royal family, guests often flew.
Bob Shields said: "Sometimes with our very important royal guests could fly very important royal dogs."
It is not surprising that the queen could hire herself to accompany her beloved lovers on her journeys, since she is known for her deep attachment to the dog race of the chorus.
Since the youngest years, Queen Elżbieta has been a lover of these quadruple creatures and has been listening to the fact that since the time of the crown, she has been the owner of more than 30 corps.
It is said that in 2007 she had five bodies: Monty, Emma, Linnet, Willow and Holly.
It joined them with five Spanish cockers: Bisto, Oxo, Flash, Spick and Spain, as well as four dogs that are the crossword puzzle from the basket: Cider, Berry Vulcan and Candy.
The King's crew must have had full hands.
The official of the royal house running the dog was seen asking them to meet their needs before they were taken on board the plane,” says Shields.
It's nice to tell you, there's never been an incident.
The programme also revealed a shocking number of luggage that the queen carries with her on board during the travel of the service obligations.
The film's Narrator stated: “In 1953 the queen took a 12 - ton luggage in her journey of 70,000 miles [70 000 km]. ”
To make it look better, it's less than two huge elephants.
However, the queen is not the only person who has a weakness for fashion.
Similarly, Princess Cambridge also has its own conveniences for the carriage of her wardrobe – it is said that for each of her dresses there is a private seat.
The new law comes into force.
In case of injury, the pension will be paid
On Friday, a regulation will enter into force to ensure that, in cases of serious injury, further interest payments are paid – informs the Financial Account.
The Act of 9 July 2019 on the special rights of injured persons in the event of the expiry of the guarantee amount established on the basis of the provisions in force before 1 January 2006.
It concerns persons who were injured before 1 January 2006.
In some cases, the insurers have already stopped paying the rents.
"I am pleased with this regulation because our institution has been running for many years to create a mechanism that will ensure that, in cases of serious damage, financial support from the communications OC or the farmer's OC is guaranteed, despite the loss of the guarantee sum," says Aleksander Daszewski, a legal adviser at the Financial Office.
According to the Financial Secretary, this was necessary because this is often a very tragic situation, for people in very poor health, who, because of the accident, cannot work, and at the same time have significant costs of accidental rehabilitation treatment.
Some of them have no longer provided a level playing field and for increased needs given the need for further treatment or rehabilitation due to the so-called OC guarantee fund.
Part of it was a threat in the next few years.
By 1 January 2006, the liability of the insurer was much lower than the current one.
This is why the problem of exhausting the guarantee amount in previous years has most often affected people who have suffered injury in the 1990s.
At the time, the guarantee amounts were very low and the economic conditions led to a significant increase in prices.
"We also noted that this problem also affected a number of mostly young people who suffered injury during the period when the amount of the sum amount was EUR 350 000 for each affected case.
At present, this is EUR 5.21 million for the event, regardless of the number of injured.
It is therefore a huge difference in relation to the earlier periods, from which the problem required the intervention of the legislator," recalls Alexander Daszewski.
It explains that because of the fact that the amount is guaranteed at any time by the increase, the legislator has accepted that the upper limit of liability of the Guarantee Fund will be the amount of the guarantee in force at the time of sending the claim to the Fund for the payment of the rent.
This principle applies if the insurance undertaking is not obliged to pay the rent on the basis of a judgment of a court determining the amount of the guarantee other than that laid down in the OC Insurance Agreement.
This shall take place in the event of an increase in the guarantee amount on the way to court pursuant to Article 3571 of the Civil Code, which allows for a modification of the existing obligation relationship.
"In recent days, we have sent letters to people who in the past have come to us with a request for intervention.
We inform them of new powers and of course we will ensure that further support can be granted in the event of any problems,” says Alexander Daszewski.

Brenda Barattini convicted of cutting off the boy's penis
The case concerns events from November 2017.
According to the Buenos Aires Times, then Brenda Barattini found out that her boyfriend showed a familiar sextatism that arose in their bedroom.
The 28-year-old, who is an architect, explained before the court that the partner thus ruined her life and treated her as a “tropheum” that can be praised before friends.
"He violated my intimacy, my life and my career.
He ruined everything," she argued.
The Cordoba resident himself decided to measure justice.
She invited her boyfriend, 42-year-old Sergio F. to bed and told him she had prepared a special surprise.
By means of an axamitous remark, she caught his eye and cut his penis off.
"I felt like I was going to die.
I didn't see anything.
I tried to get up, I pulled down, and I picked up the cell phone to get ready," he confessed.
"I wanted to go out, but she started hurting me.
She caught me for a shirt and hair without letting me go," he added.
Although Barattini explained that her boyfriend had hurt her by revealing sextash, she did not try to escape responsibility.
"Please measure justice," she said in the direction of the jury.
Eventually, she was convicted of attempted murder and sentenced to 13 years in prison.
The former Congressman of Alabama Jack Edwards died at the age of 91.
On Friday, the retired State Congressman of Alabama, under the leadership of the Republican Party, Jack Edwards, who served for 10 terms and belonged to the first wave of Republicans from the so-called Deep South.
The family spokesman said Edwards died in his home in Fairhope after fighting a new puzzle.
Edwards was originally elected to the American Congress in 1965 as one of the first Republicans of Alabama in the Deep South because the party won the favourites here.
In Congress, he served 10 assignments.
According to a family statement in response to a recent question about what the world would want to leave to its lawyers and lawyers, Edwards replied that he would want to return hospitality.
"I hope that my lawyers and my lawyers will grow up in a country where a joint debate and efforts to solve the country's problems will return to prosperity," said Edwards, according to the family statement.
The Governor of Alabama Kay Ivey said that Edwards served his position as well as the country with the highest standards of honesty.
She added that, in his favor, the flag on the Captain of Alabama State will be left to half the mast.
"He was a true civil servant and was the best husband for Alabama.
Our state has lost one of the most important policies," Ivey said in a statement.
Michelle Obama calls Meghan Markle "inspiration" on Instagram
Michelle Obama expressed high esteem for Meghan Markle at Instagram on Thursday, calling Princess Sussex "a treacherous leader who breaks the schemes and makes our world better."
The Prince and Prince Harry, currently traveling ten days to South Africa with their son Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor, participated in a meeting with young people at the beginning of this week, during which they met with the leaders of the Obama Foundation.
“I would like to thank my friend, Her Royal City, Princess Sussex @sussexroyal, “the treacherous leader who breaks the schemes and makes our world better”, wrote the former lady in her enthusiastic position.
“If you meet with the leaders of the Obama Foundation, whether you help girls around the world to gain access to the education they deserve is inspiration for many people,” Obama added, adding a picture showing a smiling Meghan with the foundation leaders.
Meghan conducted an interview with Obama for the September issue of the British Vogue, which was hosted by the former film actor "Suits".
In a sincere conversation, the first lady spoke about parenthood and how it changed.
"To be a mother means to lead to the masters of the art of forgiveness," said Obama in his report.
“Maternity taught me that for most of my time it is my job to give children space so that they can get to know the world and become the one they want to be.
Not the one I want to be or the one I wanted to be in their age, but the one in the heart.
Obama, who knows from experience what the pressure of being on the church is, divided himself into a royal council during his interview with the Good Housekeeping magazine.
“The pressure you feel – thrown by yourself and others – may sometimes push you” she said.
"My advice is, therefore, to relax and not rush into anything.
For the first few months in the White House, I spent most of my time worrying about my daughter, making sure that they were good at school and making new acquaintances before I dedicated myself to more ambitious work.
I think that's necessary, too.
Hotel Trump retains a permit for the sale of alcohol, other than the complaint for the owner's training
WASHINGTON (AP) – The Alcohol Control Commission in Washington has submitted a request to verify whether the local property of Trump International Hotel should be deprived of authorisation for the sale of alcohol because of the equipment of the owner.
The Agency has held that the complaint of three pastors, two retired judges and two rabbines is unfounded because most of them do not live in or have no property in the district.
"The Washington Post" says that the second time these floods are trying to cancel the hotel's permit for the sale of alcohol by referring to the provision in force in the district that applicants for a permit for the sale of alcohol must prove to be "good fit".
In the original complaint filed last year, President Donald Trump was alleged to be breaking the law, and charges of assault and repeated cases of fraud were brought.
The complaint was dismissed because the authorisation was granted before it was filed.
The second complaint was the extension of the permit.
"The Sun": The report acknowledges the scandal of the police service in Cleveland as the worst in the United Kingdom
The inspectors recognized the SCANDALAM SCOMPLEMENTATION as the worst police in the United Kingdom.
In the interim report, the work of the police in Cleveland was considered inappropriate in all areas.
Phil Gormley of the Chief Police Inspector of her Royal City claims that there has been a "significant deterioration" of standards in Cleveland police services.
New calls for police services were made, and over the past six years, five officers were appointed.
According to the report, the police did not try to prevent the crime, arrest the suspects and protect the weakest.
Phil Gormley of the Chief Police Inspector of her Royal City said: "Since our last inspection, there has been a significant deterioration in standards."
Commander Mike Veale resigned in January after a failed year in the face of an investigation into the "significant" and the uninvited, accused of his conduct.
Deputy Commander Adrian Roberts was arrested after the arrest indictees.
Last year, Inspector Simon Hurwood was standing before the commission of an extracurricular staff member for sexual activity.
He's out of service.
Mayor Tees Valley Ben Houchen of the tourism industry said: “It is official confirmation that these services are compromised.
It's time for the Department of Home Office to be involved."
Police Commander Richard Lewis said, "After the improvements, I will take full responsibility for the conduct of police forces through changes."
We've got a skate park visualization!
Do young people finally wait?
Older residents are hampered by young people’s passions to drive on walnuts and turtles, as they complain that there is no suitable place for them in Oław.
Young people have been reminded of the place to ride on rollers, decolorks, hulavingos, bikes.
The subject is still coming back to our fractures.
For 10 years, we've been paying attention to this problem.
Last time, there's been a rumor about the lack of a skate park.
That's why we're going back to the office and asking what's next?
We recall that a few days ago, a woman who was in trouble with a young man in the middle of the night was in trouble.
"I write on behalf of the people of the block at Pl. Pilsudski so that you can be interested in the situation of the Olavski youth," writes Malgorzat.
“The members of the block called several times to the City Guard without success.
I sent photos to prove these everyday situations in connection."
We asked others about this.
Most clearly say that young people simply do not have a place to drive in the city and that they have no place for themselves for years.
Under the Facebook post, a lion made comments.
We already wrote in July that there is a chance that the skatepark will be built in the Olava City.
The mayor informed us that the city was funding for the skate park.
‘The project is ready to be consulted with young people, together with the permits.
On 28 March, an application was made to the Ministry of Sport and Tourism for the financing of the task of “Budow Skatepark in Oław” under the Polish Sport Programme”, we were told in the office.
Total project value: 798 306,00 zł.
Amount of funding requested: 263,440,00 zł.
Now we've asked again what's the point.
"We do not yet have any information on the solution to the application for funding made to the Ministry of Sport and Tourism," Elżbieta Bednarczyk, head of the Department of European Funds UM Olawa, informs.
"From the information received from the Ministry staff, it is clear that the final selection of all tasks under the Polish Sport Programme should take place in October."
We also asked for a visualization of the oil skate park.
We present her below.
The youth informed the editorial that on the next Saturday (September 28th), they would collect signatures on the petition concerning the construction of the skate park in Oław.
"The rebel youth saw the last post on Facebook and came to the conclusion that they were organizing a collection," writes the editor Mikolaj.
The signatures under the petition will be collected from 12.00 a.m. around the Lidl market.
Puchar Polski 2019/20: 1/16 final release.
We know couples, hit years ago
It was one of the most intense rivalizations in the extraclass.
The biggest legend of the 1996/1997 season was the memory match.
On June 18, 1997, Legia took a team at an old stadium in the Lazzykska Shipyard in a previous row.
Both teams divided the point.
The masters had to win, the second of the Polish championships gave the score.
By 87 minutes, Legia was leading 2:0, but for five more minutes, the earthquake hit the ground – the vision shot three goals and enjoyed the title.
The Łódźki club with years of running has fallen into increasing tarapats until it has ceased to count in the battle for the championship and has fallen from the highest class of play.
For the last time, both teams met at this level in the 2013/2014 season.
Legia – along the way to title – took two victories – 5:1 and 1:0 to go.
Return to elite
At present, the ship is fighting to return to the national elite.
These plans were delayed at least a year, as in previous games one of the favorites was unable to advance to extraclasses.
This has led to a dramatic revolution in the club over the years.
The authorities have changed, finally put on coach Marcina Kaczmark, and in taking another step up the club hierarchy they have to help in the league fights Marcin Robak and Mateusz Možžženj.
At the time of the vision is the fourth in Table II of the League, but in Puharze Polski won the victory of the Vice-Chairmen of the Słąsk Wrocław 2:0 on Tuesday.

Nancy Pelosi: William Barr "has broken" and the investigation under impeachment has to deal with his tower
We never know where we're going.
In my view, we are now taking part in an attempt to hide the facts, and the investigation in this matter may take place," Pelosi said in a report to CNN on the Capital Summit.
"They do the work they started, keeping the facts and the time needed to find them," she added.
The protocol issued this week by the White House shows that Trump requested the President of Ukraine to conduct an investigation into former Vice-President Joe Biden, candidate for 2020, and his son.
Trump also asked the Greens to cooperate with Barr and his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, as shown in the protocol.
Trump denied that he did anything wrong.
On Thursday, CNN noted that national security lawyers from the Department of Justice notified the complaint about the Trump's proceedings with Ukraine more than a week before the formal notice.
After receiving a complaint in the form of a complaint from the Community Intelligence Officers, the Justice Department found that Trump's phone conversation did not provide criminal investigation into the financing of the campaign.
Asked whether Barr should testify, Pelosi found that on Friday Intelligence Committee decided to call a witness.
She added, however, that in Barr's view, "he has broken himself".
It's been a long time.
"But (Barra) is exchanged in all this," added Pelosi, referring to Trump's reference to his attorney-general during a July interview with the Ukrainian leader.
It is interesting that he made decisions on how to deal with the complaint.
Pelosi announced that "very much feared" about the signal informants that Trump attacked on Thursday as spies, suggesting that in the past, it was different with spies.
I think the President's words go beyond accountability, it's dangerous.
Our signalers play an important role in discovering – sending out updates in our government," Pelosi said, adding "The President's words about people who can provide information, signalers seriously underestimate the integrity of the government".
On Tuesday, Pelosi took a historic step towards a formal investigation into the conduct of an act that was illegal on the basis of an alleged attempt to put pressure on the leader of a foreign country in order to gain political benefits.
The telephone conversation was included in a complaint published on Thursday, in which the signaler claimed that Trump had abused his authority to "crush Ukraine into interference" during the upcoming 2020 elections.
The signaler also proposed that the White House's lawyers have asked the officials to delete the computer system's chattel record and to place it in the information system that is particularly sensitive.

Possible ban on driving too fast for the attacker Crystal Palace Christian Bentece Club
The Prime Minister League's Christian Bentece Star, which has been caught twice in the last two months, threatens to prevent the driving of vehicles.
The attacker Crystal Palace, 28 years old, was granted a Bentley brand drive at 80 miles per hour on the ground with a limit of 50 miles per hour on the A3 road in Richmond in south-western London on January 20th.
Then, in March of Putney’s photorader in south-western London, Belga was registered at 89 miles per hour, which is the double limit of 40 miles per hour.
Bentece from Kingston Hill from Surrey doesn't have to be in court this morning at Lavender Hill.
He admitted to both proceedings at the beginning of July in the context of a simplified procedure, on the basis of which the offences were more likely to be brought at a meeting held by a judge of peace.

Ghana: Kofi Manu is concerned about the structure of the Intergovernmental Commission
Kofi Manu, football manager and club representative Second Hasacas, expressed doubts as to the composition of the Intergovernmental Commission on the need for upcoming elections to the National Football Union in Ghana (GFA).
He questioned the involvement of the President of the Commission, Frank Davies, and added that he was not pleased with his participation.
In a report from GNA Sport Manu, he expressed doubts as to whether the President of the Commission would be honest, as the outcome of the verification process lies in his interest.
The Verifacion Commission should consist of neutral persons from outside who do not have links with any of the members and who have not previously shown interest.
For example, Daviesa hired NC as a lawyer who wrote to Osei Kwaku Palmer for 10% payment.
He's also a well-known fan of the Olympic Games.
For these two reasons, he should not be allowed to take up his position in the Intergovernmental Commission because he is interested in it," he said.
Manu stated that if Fred Pappoe, Director of the Olympic Games, would stand before the Commission, there would be a conflict of interest on the part of the President on the grounds of his relationship with the club, while suggesting that if he stands before the Commission, he would be a subject of prejudice and neutrality.
As expected, members of the Commission were expected to start work since yesterday, following a ceremony at the GFA Secretariat in Accra on Tuesday, 19 September, and to end it on 4 October.
The President of the Commission is Frank Davies, and her members are Consultant of the corporate board and lawyer, Ms Marian Barnor, and Mr Emmanuel Darkwah.
The other members should be Reginald Larya, Marketing and Business Director and Richard Akpokakie, Sport Administrator and Lawyer.

Now, however, the condition of the Prime Minister's health has deteriorated considerably.
Cornell Morawiecki went to the hospital, and the doctors determine his condition as severe.
The family of the senior marcher has transmitted "SE", that the policy is open and fully aware.
The new pancreatitis is not the only disease that Cornel Morawiecki is dealing with.

Israel: There is no agreement on the unity government
Two major parts of Israel, the Alliance of White and White, continued on Friday negotiations on the appointment of the unity government.
The meeting, which took place after the chairman had commissioned the formation of the Benjamin Netanyahu government, did not bring any results.
The discussion considered the possibility of a rotating leadership of both parties in the government and remaining Netanyahu at the Prime Minister's office, but, as the Israeli newspaper Haarec writes, there was no convergence of views.
The talks will be resumed on Sunday.
The Central Alliance of the White Sky reported in the communication that it presented the initial posts.
He accuses the Lawful Likud of being “defeated in his positions”, demanding that his leader and former Prime Minister, Netanyahu, remain at the head of the government, and in the office of the cabinet, which was previously part of his ultra-orthodox policy.
"From the very beginning, it was known that the Blue-Beials would not agree to these conditions," they said.
Because, acting solely in the interest of Netanyahu, I would like to "lead Israel to the second round of elections".
The heavenly-White Benny Gantz leader refuses to support the government that would run Netanyahu until they bear charges of participation in three corrupt cases on which the prosecutor could formally challenge him on the basis of the meeting.
"The Likud and the Blue-Bial had received a sufficient majority in elections on 17 September, which would allow them to join the common governments as natural allies, but it forced them to negotiate which none of the parties wanted," writes the EFE Agency.
President Reuwen Rivlin has been trying to bring their positions closer in recent days and has proposed that the "rotation government" call, suggesting that the Prime Minister temporarily suspend his functions, which would allow Gantz to take this position if the charges against Netanyahu were maintained and formalised.
There are no Israeli analysts who think things have been stuck in a blind hole.
However, half of the Israelis, as a result of the survey published on Friday on public television, want to unlock the political situation in the country by calling on the government of units under the rotating leadership to exchange Netanyahu and Gantza.
This is the case with 50.6% of the Israelis, and 32.1% of the respondents oppose such a solution.
The survey shows a deep division in the Israeli society – on the question who should first stand at the head of the office, 41.8% of respondents speak for Netanyahu, and 40% for Gantze.
In another survey published by the newspaper "Israel Hajam", the percentage of supporters of the unity government has increased to 63%, 60% being opposed to the new elections, which would be third in this year.
In the early parliamentary elections on 17 September, the Gantza alliance won 33 mandates in the 120th local princes, Likud Netanjahu defeated 32 mandates.
Disengagement with its traditional and potential allies may count on the support of 55 ambassadors, while Gantz is 54.
None of the parties have collected 61 mandates necessary to achieve the majority.
Tipuric invites you to fight before the final game with Australians
Justin Tipuric says that "this time for testing", when Valia stands face-to-face with Australia as part of the World Cup, which can shape their fates in the tournament.
The victory of Wallia over the kangaroos would set this team in the position of a certain favorite to win Group D and guarantee its participation in the likely quadruplinal meeting with France or Argentina.
However, if Australia beats Wallia once 14. during the last 15 meetings, Tipuric and his team will be sent to England in a flash at the beginning of one eight finals.
"Let's make the case clear, both teams want to try to get through this and get to the top of the group," said the Wall Street Fighter Tipuric.
In the past, there were a few difficult results, but last autumn it was nice to win with them (Australia).
I think they're going to be impatient to take this victory away from us, and we're going to have to take it back.
Before we got here, you knew it was gonna be a big old man.
And now we're here, and it's really time to check it out.
Valia had only one victory over Australia, New Zealand, or RPA in the history of the World Cup – and it was 32 years ago in a third-place match when the kangaroos were defeated.
And their total record under the leadership of chief coach Warren Gatland shows only seven victories in 41 attempts to defeat three teams of heavyweights from the southern half.
Valia represented the course of thirteen lost test matches from Australia last November, and Tipuric prepared to be among the few saved from this 9-6, who will run the stadium in Tokyo on Sunday.
Tipuric asked whether the team had experienced psychotic blockades before the victory, adding: “It’s hard to say.
These games are so balanced that maybe... people expect a mental block to occur, I don't know.
At the end of the last match, we probably left at the match about 15 points, so the final result seems to be a much less advantage than it actually was.
If Valia is a triumph, then the battle of Tipurica with a favorite Australian duo from the third line will be crucial to Michael Hooper and David Pocock during the arrest and release.
Tipuric played 67 meetings in representation colors and met with both winners on several previous occasions, so he knows exactly what's waiting for him.
"These are the champions who play in the position of the seventh absolutely world class," he said.
When it comes to the world class of third line racers, it is always known that it will be a difficult game to play.
These two constants are with the best champions in the world.
You know what games you can expect.
Pocock is one of the best players in the world playing defensively, and Michael is a more attacking seven and probably feels better as he's always in the right place at the right time.
It's better to play against the world's best champions and face challenges than to measure with the third line of moles, which is not so good.
It's worth playing against the best, and by winning with these two, I'm sure you have to be in high shape.
I wouldn't say that Sunday would be almost the end of the spider, but for us this is an important match in this World Cup.
Impet is its important element.
When we build strength and continue to make great efforts, we will fly like on wings, and it will be hard to overcome.

They were supposed to be an elite organization of the 'sex'.
They've taken in their ranges the ones they've been keeping.
Can crime connect more powerful than national identity?
In your hands, we have no further book on the subject of war or military.
We are conducting a thorough international study on the participation of non-Germans in the Waffen-SS.
Historians from different countries of Europe are examining the attitudes and motivations of the volunteers, recalling their activities and observing the recruitment process at various stages of the war.
Did the Danish branches differ from the French?
Where did Ukrainian enthusiasm come from?
Why couldn't we create a division composed of the Poles themselves?
What is the official historical narrative of cooperation in various European countries today?
What happened to the volunteers after the war ended?
Among others, the Waffen-SS book answers these questions on the basis of solid research material.
We have sought to present a more subtle and more balanced, closer image of cooperation in Europe during the second world war, also trying to break the methodological boundaries of historiography and a given period of time by presenting the report of the research authority from different countries. (...) If the main victims of this war are forced laborers, Jews, nuns, Nazi political opponents Germany, Slovenian people - are sometimes presented in comparison and/or transnational terms, so many of them are examined from a national perspective (if they do so).
"Total panic" when the White House is struggling to find arguments about impeachment
White House officials boast of how to resist the repeated pressure on the impeachment Thursday, and one of the speakers who are familiar with the situation describes the feeling of "total panic" that was felt last week due to the lack of a response plan to the new reality.
It seems to me that this is a "disease, uncertainty and fear" – one of the people involved in the White House describes the tension in the western wing in this way – that the accusations of the informant can seriously harm the president and the people around him.
This person said, “There is no doubt that nothing is hidden there.”
White House officials were still uncertain how to proceed, not only because there is no clear plan of action in this situation, but also because they are so serious that standard methods of avoiding effective controversy used by the President in the past may not work. “It does not look like something that will go away with the next cycle of headlines” – this person complained.
Another person who was in the course of the discussion described the atmosphere in the White House as “a state of shock”, accompanied by growing uncertainty that along with the ongoing investigation of impeachment, the likelihood that the president would respond unresponsibly and become “hard to deal with”.
This concern is shared by another speaker claiming that the members of the President's circle expect him to manifest more "continuous" behavior, and the pressure on him will certainly increase with every day of the impeachment investigation.
This raises the concern that Trump can present increasingly unpredictable behaviour and in an unexpected manner – it is in the context of the election year both from the point of view of the Presidency and the elections.
By putting forward the biggest threat in the Presidency, Trump circled from the attack to the defense, once again following a strategy that he assessed as effective during Robert Mueller's investigation into Russia.
He tried to enrich his own request addressed to the Ukrainian president for assistance in investigating his political rivals, to draw attention to and address the actions of the Democrats and Democratic Candidates of Jo Biden and to discredit the informant as a driving force of the party.
But while many people in the White House are being fought after Mueller's investigation, this time something has changed – counsellors and consultants have said.
The president, whose badge is a force, showed the media conference as a victim – one of the people familiar with the situation said.
While Trump was enthusiastically accepting questions about the Russian investigation, he seemed reluctant to answer questions about Ukraine – they said.
Some of the president's colleagues believe that damage can be avoided, and some of them hold that the informant had no first-hand knowledge of this controversial telephone conversation between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zölenski, which they believe undermines his credibility.
And as often as the president is an object of attack, the fact is alive raised by his main supporters in his defense.
But one of the Republican strategies related to the White House shows that the results of the president's support survey are relatively high, and impeachment will not have much effect on obtaining new sympathy.
"There is no point in focusing on the President's impeachment in the next four months," especially if it hinders his legislative programme and prevails in the new cycle of headlines.
Another speaker claims that those who held that the impeachment would help the president did not finally understand how unpredictable his reaction would be.
Concerned White House officials were looking for help from counsellors, completing an impeachment response team.
According to the person who is aware of the plans, taking into account that these efforts are in the early stage, it remains unclear whether any initiative in the form of an enforcement centre will be taken and what form it can take.
This person stated that it was the belief that a coordinated legal and communication strategy was required with a determined leader who was able to carry out an attack on the PR in response to the publication of the edible signal report and aimed at halting the spread of democratic activities on the impact of this report.
The speaker on the situation maintains that the lack of a long-term strategic vision was clearly visible when the Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and the Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin stated that they did not intend to disclose the notes describing Trump's conversation with the Ukrainian president, and then 48 hours later it was possible to feel that there was no exit and that the document should be published.
It is now expected that the pressure will be greater than during the investigation of Robert Mueller, who was mostly silent and spoke only through accusations. One of the people who could be involved in the development of an impact response is Corey Lewandowski, a man from the dirty work Trump and was the head of the election staff – the person who testified to the case.
However, Lewandowski said in a conversation with NBC News that it is not a true suggestion that he will lead this action.
"For the past five years, I have done everything I can to support the president and his programme," he said, "but I have not been involved in any discussions with the president or his team on joining the team in order to reject the false story of impeachment."
Private lawyer Donald Trump from Mueller's investigation, Jay Sekulow, also remains involved in impeachment activities.
"We are responding to the right things" – Sekulow replied when asked by NBC News for a comment.
Currently, the White House feels the lack of a lawyer experienced in the field of impeachment, after Emma Flood, who worked at Clinton's impeachment and advised the White House at the end of Mueller's investigation, left, and the current consultant, Pat Cipolone, has no such experience.
The speaker on the White House's strategy stated that officials in general at no time planned to involve people or create a centre of leadership, but admitted that the need for a coordinated, joint response and the people who could carry out the political struggle.
Visitor Explorer of the Seas linei Royal Caribbean went over repair for 89 million pounds
Explorer of the Seas, belonging to the Royal Caribbean International family, will take this year off, presenting a completely new look.
After renewal, which cost an impressive $110 million (89 million), the ship boasts a wide selection of culinary snacks from all over the world and a rich offer of entertainment for the whole family.
This year, Explorer will stop at the most wonderful ports in Italy and Greece, allowing passengers to feel the taste of Mediterranean Europe.
When the adventure on the ground is over, the crew of the ship promises unforgettable impressions on the sea.
Having a satisfaction offer for each, the Explorer, after renovating the cost of $110 million, about $89 million, moved into a passenger ship that provides a perfect entertainment for the entire family.
The impressive technology means that passengers can surf the board through advanced surfing simulators or watch a favorite family movie using the weather spells, as part of the plenary cinema.
However, the most revolutionary attraction is to add virtual balconies that allow passengers of the interior cabins to admire ocean views without having to leave on board.
Water lovers will be attracted to a new deck at the pool connecting the Caribbean style of the resort with the water park charms.
The pool surrounds beach hammocks and beds that are ideal for sunsets, and the two modernized walkers are in the hands of people who are soaked with strong impressions on the board.
An attractive traveler for passengers of every age imposes the number of activities to be made available to guests while travelling to destination.
Created with the small Adventure Ocean for children, it is a chance for younger family members to have beautiful memories, and the exclusive place to spend free time for teenagers offers super games and a music area prepared with the thought of people over the age of 12.
If this is not enough, the entire family may be able to measure the laser tag in the "Study B" on the ship with the effect of lighting in the dark, which can also be an impressive way to serve as an ice-cream on the ski slopes.
During the trip to the Mediterranean, guests will also have the opportunity to learn exotic tastes from around the world by going to the bottom of the restaurant on board.
The modern Asian cuisine is offered on a ship in the Izumi restaurant, and in the freshly open Giovanni's Italian Kitchen is an excellent meal inspired by the innovative look at traditional Italian cuisine.
Other gastronomic points on board include an American restaurant offering Chops Grille steaks, Latin Bar Boleros, Schooner Bar and Johnny Rockets express bar.
The trip, with the option of a seven- or nine-day route, will come from Rome in May 2020.
As a second European ship on the Royal Caribbean line, it will join the Allure of the Seas, which has recently passed an incredible repair.
After a 58-day Allure metamorphosis, a huge amount of $165 million, the tour operator offered guests who had previously made reservations, vouchers worth $300 to be issued on board the ship.
The tour operator stated: “Explorer of the Seas is the fourth Voyager class ship that will undergo a transformation into the modernization of the Royal Amplified fleet.”
The programme, which requires investment of more than $1 billion, comprising 10 ships and lasting four years, improves every aspect of customer satisfaction and introduces a wide range of possibilities: from unrepeatable attractions and to survive gastronomic life at night.
Devin Nunes accuses the Democrats of calling for "light pictures of Trump"
Congressman Devin Nunes from the state of California is clearly unable to bear the bold truth that President Donald Trump's investigation is under way.
In his Thursday defense, the President accused the Democrats of wanting to receive naked photos of the President.
Nunes, a high-ranking Republican member of the Committee of the Representatives' Committee, put the above proposal in the course of the preliminary statement during the hearing of the alarmist's complaint, as if Trump had turned to Ukraine for assistance in initiating an investigation against the Democratic candidate against President Joe Biden and his son.
The Congressman called the Ukrainian scandal "gross presentation" of the left and their "medial ace" before he found that the Democrats wanted to see the pictures of the president in the neighborhood.
"Democrats in this committee were negotiating with people who thought they were Ukrainians to get naked photos of Trump," Nunes said.
“People can rightly ask why Democrats are so determined to put the president in charge when they have their chance in a year.
When Nunes ended up giving the rapists, the political reporter of the HuffPost website, Jennifer Bendery, decided to see if the Democrats really were trying to... find out.
Until now, only a representative of Connecticut, Jim Hims, has responded, although we suspect that his answer is a sudden truth, which confirms the thinking of many of his colleagues and colleagues.
The Mediaite.com portal assumes that Nunesa's comments on nuances refer to "some more pleasant and unconfirmed information", which is likely to appear in Steele's controversial acts,
It is celebrated by former British spy Christopher Steele's collection of charges against Trump, pointing to the probability of a tape that shows him at midnight watching the violence of a prostitute in a hotel room in Moscow.
Potential studies on renewable biofuels can help reduce emissions
While electric cars and Sami Tesli have dominated information services in recent years, one issue seems to be the removal of renewable energy — airplanes.
However, Professor Alberta has developed a technology that will allow renewable biofuels to be used as a fuel for aviation.
Dr. David Bressler is a professor at Albert University for agriculture, life and the environment, who started work on this project in 2003.
Its laboratory develops carbon fuel from fatty wastes, such as fat from the restaurant, fat from animal origin, and oil from waste.
In contrast to ethanol and other biofuels, this technology may use low-quality oils during production, which makes it considered to be 85% lower carbon emissions than in the case of oil fuels, as well as in the waste process from other industries.
This technology is intended to imitate the hydrocarbons present in oil fuels.
"What our technology did in the first generation," said Bressler, "is [in total] hydrocarbons that are identical particles as in diesel."
While this opens up the new possibility of using biofuels, the previously developed biofuel products had a tendency to destabilize at lower temperatures, which in the case of high-level aircraft was a serious threat.
"The problem with the fuel airport is a bit of a bad circle," Bressler said.
It's really less worth than diesel, but it has higher requirements.
The Bressler Laboratory is currently looking at two options for the production of aviation biofuels.
The first option is a low-risk approach that requires additional processing of carbon dioxide and hydrogen.
The second option is to continue working on partially developed chemical properties that will provide fuel stability, even at low temperatures.
"We can experiment with chemical properties in our reactor to try to change them a little," said Bressler, commenting on another option.
This option is more risky.
The company opened by the University of Alberta, Forge Hydrocarbons, is working on commercializing the product, as airlines, as well as Canadian and American armies are increasing investment in a renewable option.
"They are able to imagine times when the situation can be reversed and carbon tax will be imposed on them," he said.
They want this alternative, which will be an emergency plan.
Forge is currently operating a pilot plant near the Edmonton Waste Management Centre and has recently received a sum of $4 million from Lockheed Martin in an investment to support a costing $25 million in the production plant, which will be located in Sombra in Ontario.
The plant is expected to produce about 19 million litres of biofuel annually.
Bressler also notes that the planned reduction of coal is about 85 per cent, but issues such as transport and fuel production stop further reduction.
“As a technology specialist – Bressler said –
I have the task of developing options that allow conscious decisions and many choices."
CONDITIONAL - DONATION ARRANGEMENT
Eight thousand dollars and 750 euros have lost the property of Zamosta, thinking that it helps his grandson, who caused the accident.
The police reported the incident on Thursday, the son of a cheated replacement.
“He called the woman in the middle of the man who gave himself up for her granddaughter.
He said he had an accident and needed money.
Otherwise he's going to jail.
The senior wanted to help the granddaughter, she transferred 8,000 zł and 750 euros to the fake police officer who came to her house," reports Asp. Dorota Krukowski-Bubiła from the foreign police.
The police are looking for agents, and once again they're calling for caution:
‘Each phone with a request for financial assistance shall be verified.
Do not act under the influence of emotion and in haste.
Remember, cops don't ask for money and don't take money.
If we receive a call asking for financial support, which will stimulate our suspicions, we should respond immediately and notify the police by calling 911 alarm number.
We also appeal to younger family members.
Let's talk to our seniors about threats, let's let them know how they act.
We ask for caution and do not trust those who call and ask for a loan."
Prime Minister Boris Johnson warns that in the event of the British Brexit to be removed, the US is threatened by a threat such as in Los Angeles, and he himself calls for peace
One of the cabinet's prime ministers said last night that the country would be threatened with "a social collapse", if the original result would be questioned by the result of the second referendum.
The British Prime Minister's planners from his immediate surroundings warned that the country was threatened with social problems on the scale of the protests of the "yellow chameleon" in France due to social inequalities and the situation in Los Angeles in 1992.
Johnson called for "the peace of the instruments" during a vicious war on the language of politics, but stressed that he would not stop using the words "to fight".
Despite his call for peace, the cabinet minister said "The Times": "In this country there have never been protests such as demonstrations of "gilets young" ("yellow chameleks") or of residents of Los Angeles in 1992.
People think it's impossible, just because they didn't happen before.
Now they have an example – young Gillets – they use encrypted phones that can coordinate the peaks, and to push people into protest, there are only a few unwanted populist leaders.
The residents of Los Angeles exploded after the jury's execution of four white policemen who killed a black man named Rodney King in 1992.
This year, anti-government demonstrators in France wearing yellow tusks – young yolks – have been in the desert for more than six weeks and have grown up on the streets of Paris.
The minister referred to Johnson's warning in the Gmin Chamber and said that if Britain fails to get out of the EU, there will be a "catastrophic loss of confidence in our political system".
"If we hold a referendum in which 30 million people vote, 66% of them will be left behind by the United Kingdom in the European Union, 10 million citizens will be unhappy," the minister said.
Even if that result ignores 99% of them, so we'll have 100,000 angry people who will write to their post and who won't let go.
A lot of people don't need to see a few thousand people on the street soon.
One of the prime ministers of the cabinet added that the country would be threatened with a "social collapse" if the result of the first referendum would be questioned by the result of the second.
Johnson called for the organisation of the general elections in which voters would have to decide on the fate of the Brexit.
According to the report, the prime minister is faced with the risk of a cabinet grant that wants to reduce the demand for a brief and reach a compromise agreement with the EU.
Hollow, Chubavna and Krosna were admired in Krakow.
Follow us Talk'N'Roll
More than 300 participants listened on Thursday (September 26th) to 11 inspiring sermons by prelegents, including Szymon Holovnia, Kristina Czubovna or Ireneusz Krosny.
This is all part of the talk'N'Roll conference, which took place in Krakow for the fifth time.
Talk'N'roll 2019
Expanding the horizons, talking about the sound of voice and joint discussions that can be an incentive for further development.
These goals were presented by the organizers of the Talk'N'Roll conference, inviting 11 exceptional speakers, representing very diverse sectors and areas of interest, among them among other people known from the media - Szymona Hollovní, Kristina Chubowna and Ireneus Krosno.
This year's issue of Talk'N'Roll was "Crafting the Future, NOW" and around the creation of the future, guests who were invited to participate in the conference were concentrated.
The first session was opened by the director of Sabre Polska, Sebastian Drewicki, who told us how the brand that is built around him could affect our future.
Richard Lucas went to the scene to change the public's perception of the phenomenon of rejection, claiming that it should be accepted if the future is to be created, Chris Badura has taken on the issue of empathy in the achievement of bright technological development.
Paula Mascarenhas (VP Sabre) has been divided into observations and techniques that can help manage careers and increase overall satisfaction by finding an appropriate balance between professional and private life.
The second part of the conference opened a huge conversation with Christina Chubovna, who told others about how her perspective on space for years had changed the course of the lecturer in Poland.
The owner of one of the most popular voices in the country has admitted that, thanks to development technology, everyone today can make a challenge for this profession.
However, he does not think that in the coming years, a person in the position of a lecturer will be completely replaced by technology.
After it, Piotr Nabelec took on the problem of life in times of information, emotional or overloading in the matter of choice, giving the public valuable clues how to deal with it, and Luke Latoch, in his speech, spoke of what might lead to another industrial revolution, known as "Prime 4.0".
Learning fun, learning fun
The conference organizers also took care of artistic impressions, inviting the illusionist Daniel Jedinak to stage.
The third part of the conference was opened by Ireneusz Krosny, who first played the public pantonium, and then, for example, on his own career, told us how he was trying to maintain a proper balance between his career on stage and private life.
Szymon Holovnia also took part in his talk, stressing, above all, the role of time in our lives.
The publicist pointed out that even two minutes can change the situation in a diametrical way and need to be ready to use this time.
In addition, Holvina shared her thoughts on the reality surrounding us, calling for anecdotes that could bring smiles on the faces of the eyes.
Then on the scene Adrian Tvoruszka appeared, who reviewed the history and objectives of several innovation models and referred them to how they are currently being used.
At the end of Marcin Sloviak, for example, the Rubika bone, told about the approach to solving the problems.
Each of the 11 speakers certainly made a new effort to see the reality of all those who had the opportunity to look at the performance, and the physical responses and numerous questions to the guests give evidence of great public involvement.
The organizers provided a transmission for all those who could not personally participate in the event, and the recordings from the lecture are available on the website.
The rule of law instead of the rule of law.
"Despite the lack of sufficient number of votes to amend the Constitution, the ruling majority has introduced a number of changes in the state system, creating threats to the protection of the rule of law and the rule of triple power," the Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights reported on Thursday.
The report 'The rule of law instead of the rule of law' documents, inter alia, changes in the scale of justice and in the area of protection of fundamental rights and freedoms.
The Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights (HFPC) published a report entitled "The rule of law instead of the rule of law.
Threats to the protection of human rights in Poland between 2015 and 2019".
The Foundation estimates that the largest human rights regression in Poland was recorded in the years 2015-2019 after 1989.
“Despite the lack of sufficient number of votes to amend the Constitution, the ruling majority has introduced a number of changes in the state system, creating threats to the protection of the rule of law and the rule of triple power.
By adapting the right to political objectives, the rule of law has been replaced by the rule of law," HFPC experts wrote.
What about the HFPC report?
The report documents changes in the functioning of justice, independent institutions (such as the public media or the Ombudsman) and in the area of the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms (including freedom of assembly, women's rights, LGBT people's rights and the right to a fair trial).
The report also summarises a three-year dispute between the Polish authorities and the European Union.
"In the last four years, for the first time and on that scale, we have observed the use of the right to exercise the partial interests of the parties.
This has led to a lasting legal crisis, as well as a weakening of the entire human rights system in Poland," said counsel Marcin Volny, one of the authors of the report.
Protection of human rights
As indicated in the report, the last four years have been a "systemic period of change both in the country and in the field of the protection of human rights".
Over the past four years, Seim has adopted more than 20 key legal acts in terms of human rights protection.
"The changes have often been adopted at an accelerated pace, without social consultation and despite the reservations of the legal environment, the Ombudsman of Civil Rights or international organisations," said Lawyer Malgorzat Szuleka, co-author of the report.
According to the report, the main trends observed over the past four years have been: "the weakening of independent institutions (including courts and prosecutors), the disregard of binding judgments and recommendations of international institutions and the weakening of the protection of human rights".
State authorities have not responded
In particular, the Helsinki Foundation for Human Affairs has acknowledged "the situations in which state authorities have not responded or have even been aware of cases of aggression".
The Foundation’s experts have noted that some changes have been introduced in the atmosphere of attacks on individual institutions or professional groups or groups affected by discrimination.
The Foundation points out that the result of the State's activities in the field of limiting the rule of law is the ongoing opposition of Polish authorities to the European Union, as well as a number of recommendations by international law actors.
"The lack of implementation of these recommendations weakens not only Poland's position as a leader of democratic change in the Central and Eastern Europe region, but also affects the Polish State for its responsibility for violating European Union or European Convention on Human Rights," we read in the report.
Brother of the Pakistani social media with life for honour killing
Women's rights experts say that investigations of justice are often difficult because of prolonged proceedings, the release of suspected murderers for bail and the raising of cases in public awareness.
“It takes so long for people to forget,” says Farzana Bari, the defender of women’s rights and founder of the first gender study department in Pakistan, and adds that even the widespread murder of Baloch has been resolved for more than three years.
Although reliable data are difficult to establish, the Pakistani Human Rights Commission identified at least 300 cases of so-called honour killings in 2018.
Many activists claim that the real number is much higher, and the network promotes awareness of honoural crimes is estimated to reach about one fifth of the 5,000 honour killings committed worldwide each year in Pakistan.
Polacks on the border record
However, transfers to the country are small, because many immigrants stay outside Poland for a permanent period – the "Rzeczpospolita" is given on Friday.
The latest Euro-Tax report shows that the average Polish earnings in other European countries amounted to over 8,6 billion in 2018, which means that they have grown by almost a thousand gold, or almost 12%.
Euro-Tax "believes that the total income of Polish migrant workers in the Union has reached a record value of 154.5 billion zł in 2018, with only one seventh more than a year earlier", we read.
Director of the Centre for Migration of the University of Warsaw, Paweł Kaczmarczzyk, says that the Polish are better able to work on the international labour market where they use various available options.
"There are also growing numbers of experts and experts who move from country to country in search of ever better conditions, like international corporate workers," the newspaper reports.
Some Euro-Tax customers work in two countries over the year, such as the United Kingdom and Germany.
“This is the largest in the RFN in 2018, because 11% of the total earnings of Polish immigrants have increased (up to approximately 27 billion zł).
However, the Polish made the most of it on the island – almost 35 billion evils," we read on.
The President of the Euro-Taxu considers that despite the improvement of working conditions on the Polish market, the number of migrant workers is not diminishing.
The fact remains that the Western and Northern European countries (in front of Norway) are often more likely to earn more than in Poland.
"It is even at minimum rates in a given country, which, for example, in Germany is EUR 9,5-11,7 per hour," the newspaper reports.
"Rzeczpospolita" suggests that the Polish stay not only because of higher wages, but also because they have settled abroad.
Many Poles leave behind a border of roots, which is also seen after small transfers of money to the country.
These year-olds were the lowest in years.
According to economist Tadeusz Christiani, along with extending the period of stay abroad, a small group of people who transfer money to the country and reduces their height.
"Emigrants draw close to each other," we read in the Friday "Rzeczpospolit".
Prolonged monsoons cause floods and chaos in many regions of India
The monsoon season in India has been extending for almost a month, and unscrupulous rainfalls cause death due to the drying of buildings and the swelling of many crops.
In the North Indian monsoon usually falls at the beginning of September, but the average rainfall in this month exceeded the standard by 37%.
According to experts from the Indian Meteorological Department, if this situation continues for the next few days, it will be the latest monsoon ending in decades.
In many areas of the country, rainfalls are still undetected – in recent times in western India, the cities of Pune and the quarter rain rains have led to the death of several hundred people and the collapse of buildings.
There's been a flooding of houses, people crawling through the streets in the water by the knee, which usually only takes place during the apogeum monsoon.
Large rainfalls also occurred in cities such as Calcutta, Luknow and Hajdarabad.
As a result of the long-lasting rains in the northern state of Uttarakhand many homes were destroyed.
Monsun also started late.
In many areas, there was no water, so farmers prepared for a possible drought.
Too long a monsoon is not well seen by farmers.
That amount of rain is not normal for this year.
“By him my vegetables – and now I have a hat, beans, peaches and tomatoes – will rot,” says Prakash Mehra, a farmer from a small farm in Bhimtal in Uttarakhand state.
For consumers, the late impact, as well as the late end of the monsoon, means a rise in the price of bees, that is, an inconvenient Indian food component.
The Cebula, which normally had to pay 20 rupees (0.23 pounds British), currently costs 80 rupees (about 1 pound British) per kilogram in cities such as Delhi and Bombay.
Feasts and holidays are also at risk.
Another great festival is the 8th October of the Holy Dasar, during which the Hindus raise huge balls as from a comic, representing Ravena, to be with a blizzard and a sleek smile from the "Ramajana" epoch.
Ravany's fire symbolizes the triumph of good over evil.
However, taking into account that similar Ravens were made of paper, if the monsoon continues to last, Ravens will laugh the last.
Implementation of the Energy Synergies Sales Agreement of Energy Technology Sp. z o.o. in restructuring
On 27 September 2019, the Bank account of the Fund affected the sale price of 26,843 shares in Energosynergia Technology Sp. z o.o. in restructuring amounting to USD 100000.
The same ownership of these shares went to INDOS S.A. with its headquarters in Croatia.
The stakes sale agreement was carried out in connection with the refusal of the other participants to take the shares priority and as a result of the withdrawal of approval by the participants to whom it was granted.

Doodle celebrates 21 birthdays Google
It would be hard to imagine a world without Google today.
In the search engine, we're looking for answers to all the questions we're asking.
What are we looking for in Google?
"What is it?", "Where?", "How?" and "How?" are one of the favorite categories sought by Poland.
The data from the giant show that last year, we were willing to ask, among other things, "Where is the bull?", "How to make a spaghetti?" and "How many fingers has the horse?", "How to get rid of the fruit muscle?", "How to eat some?".
Today the search engine is about the twenty-first birthday.
Its users – and up to 96% of people in Poland use Google's Uncle – welcome today to Google Doodle.
It's not animated this time.
Google remembers its births, showing a stationary computer with a monitor, mouse and keyboard, and in the right, bottom corner, a digital date was printed – as on a 90-year-old picture.
Information catalogue
The searcher was created for a specific purpose – to catalogue all possible information and make it available via the Internet.
Her name is a word game.
It comes from the mathematical term Google, which means the number of ten raised to the power of the century.
This title was also intended to reflect the company's intention to index as the largest number of parties from global Internet resources.
Google's search engine was founded by Sergey Brina and Larry Page in 1996 as part of their student project at Stanford University.
It was based on a mathematical analysis of the relationship between the parties that acted better than the normal segregation of the results on the basis of the frequency of the phrase.
At the beginning, the search engine carried the name BlackRub, which refers to the English word blacklink, which means the number of pages referring to the result.
Page and Brin set up a company operating under Google Inc. on September 7, 1998, and soon launched the famous website google.com today.
What's next, Google?
In December 1998, information on the extremely high relevance of Google's search results is published in the PC Magazine.
Then the company's history seems almost like a fairy tale - a brilliant development with every month, a substantiation of other markets and an increase in company value.
Already in June 2000, Google's URL index has over a billion locations, making Page's and Brian's work the world's largest Internet search engine.
Currently, the company founded by Page and Brina is one of the leading players on the IT market.
So is there another field for development?
"The Google mission is an organization of global information resources to be widely available and useful, although we have made enormous progress in this area, it is still a long way to achieve this goal," said Piotr Zalewski of Google Poland.
Common contact with pesticides may increase the risk of heart disease and stroke
The new study suggests that exposure to large-scale plant protection products can lead to a high risk of heart failure in later years.
This has been the case with a group of Japanese-born Americans in Hawaii, which has been studied for more than 30 years.
Scientists have found that compared to men who did not work with plant protection products, those who had the greatest contact with them were 45% more affected by heart disease or stroke.
“This study underlines the need to use personal protective equipment during contact with pesticides at work, and the importance of testing in medical records with such agents at work, as well as to control standard factors that increase the incidence of heart disease,” said Dr. Beatriz Rodriguez.
She's a professor of geriatric medicine at the University of Hawaii in the Manoa area.
The results are based on data from over 6,000 men on the island of Oahu who took part in the Kukini Honolulu cardiological program.
As scientists have pointed out, the results of the studies may not apply to women and other populations because it was only for men of Japanese origin.
Pesticides have long half-life, so the effects of their health effects may be known many years after contact with these substances.
In this case, the most visible results were observed within 10 years of contact with plant protection substances.
In a press release, Rodriguez stated: “After 34 years of male observation, the relationship between exposure to pesticides and heart disease and stroke was no longer significant. ”
It was so likely that more important factors had become associated with aging, which masked possible cause-effect relationships between exposure to pesticide contact and mortality to the disease of the circulation system in later years.
Researchers did not detect a significant relationship between exposure to small amounts of moderate plant protection measures and an increase in the risk of heart disease or stroke.
Phone conversation Zölenski-Trump: Poroszenko offers her three coins
Washington's policy has been a rough week since the start of the impeachment procedure against US President Donald Trump
Getting involved in a political scandal is for political debutant Wolodymir Greene's situation that he would want to avoid.
But what do we really know about the Zełenski-Trump affair, and will it have far-reaching effects for the first one?
Nearly at the start of the call, Trump told Greenland that the United States is doing more for Ukraine than European countries.
Despite the fact that the notes revealed by the White House are not complete, the Trump attack on German Chancellor Angel Merkel is described in detail as the fact that Germany's leaders, together with other European leaders, engage in negotiations rather than present concrete proposals.
The controversy sparked a Green response, which announced that it was not 100%, but 1000%.
Zełenski added that both French President Macron and Merkel are insufficiently trying to help Ukraine.
This exchange of views led politicians, in particular from the Ukrainian opposition, to decide to vote through social services.
Petro Porosenko, former President of Ukraine, said on Twitter that the support provided by the EU was "without precedent".
In other tweets, Porosenko said he is grateful for the EU's support during the "Russian aggression", which included sanctions and financial assistance.
Others expressed their concerns, including Ukrainian politicians Victoria Voytsitska announced: "How can we talk to Germany and France now?".
Then Trump mentioned military aid and asked for the investigation not in one, but in two cases: the first concerning the son of Joe Biden – Hunter – and the second concerning the entry into the DNC server, suggesting that Ukraine was involved in the hacker attack on the Democratic e-mail boxes during the 2016 elections.
It is not known whether it describes this European relationship, or whether the relations with the leader of France and Germany will be broken.
I don't want to talk bad about anyone...
We thank you for all the help we can give us" – he announced after the publication of a telephone interview with Zelenski in New York during the UN General Assembly.
Zełenski will meet with the leaders of Russia, Germany and France at the upcoming “Nordic Square” summit, which will take place in October.
They were the chief inspector legally convicted.
The court cleared Jerz Wisnievsky of his crimes.
After six years, Jerzy Wisniewski was finally cleared of charge.
The District Court of Industry has cleared Jerz Wisniewski, former head of the Trade Quality Inspectorate of Rollno-Food Products in Rzeszow, on the charge of infringement of the powers.
The Lubel court accused him of betraying the former Marshallian voivodship of the control term in the food-producing oil plant.
He recently made a legislative ruling in this regard.
The appeal was recognized on 12 September.
"The Court has held a judgment in suspense," confirmed Judge Malgorzata Reizer, spokesman of the Court of Justice of the Regions.
This is the judgment of 14 February published by the Court of Justice of the Regions.
Jerzy Wisniewski then commented on Facebook: “It has been six years since I was presented by the Appeals Office in Lublin with the alleged violation of the law in a telephone conversation with the Mayor of Podkarpacki on 30 April 2012.
The court clearly found that I was innocent and that I did not break the existing law.
I was convinced that my telephone conversation at the time with the Marshal of Podkarpacki was in line with the existing law.
The version of the events published in 2013 by the Public Prosecutor's Office in Lublin was true and caused irrevocable damage both to the food producer's entrepreneurs and to the loss of the image of my person among my employers, workers and in the local community.
The Court’s opinion contained a number of errors, false facts, inconsistencies of the legal basis, not confirmed in reality.
With the help of CBA in Russia, everything was done to eliminate me from public and professional life.
I was immediately released from work and without financial resources.
I've been staying with my wife for a long time."
Let's remember.
Jerzy Wiszniewski served as a voivodship inspector for the quality of agricultural and food products in the years 2009–2013.
He was acquitted of his position after his charges were filed by the Public Prosecutor in Lublin in 2013.
According to the survey, he had to betray his former Marshallian voivodship in a telephone conversation (Mirosław Karapyta was sentenced to 4 years' freedom of movement) for a control period in a food-producing oil plant belonging to the wife of the former Vice-Chairman of the sub-carpack.
This warning – as prosecutors from Lublin claimed – was to cause the company's owner to know about the control and correct labels on the oils that were incomplete.
Jerzy Wisnievski heard the charges of overcrowding, which threatened him up to 3 years of freedom.
"I feel relieved that this case has finally ended and the court has confirmed my innocence.
From the beginning, I was convinced that I had done nothing wrong, which is now a final confirmation that is a legitimate sentence depriving me of my charges," Jerzy Wisnievski commented.
The White House was trying to hide the conversation with the Green House.
On Thursday's edited report, the signalist wrote that President Donald Trump, speaking with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zełenski, was running a foreign intervention in the U.S. election, and the White House was trying to hide the conversation.
The Presidents of Ukraine and the United States
In an anonymous report dated 12 August, the signalist, who is probably an interviewer, wrote: “I was informed by many members of the U.S. government that the president used his role to ensure foreign intervention in the 2020 elections in the United States”.
‘Trump used part of the conversation (with the Greens) to realize its own interests.
And exactly – he tried to pressure the Ukrainian leader to take steps to help the president in the 2020 revolution," the report quoted by the newspaper "The Hill".
The Ukrainian leader is "given to understand" that contacts with Trump are dependent on whether "will show a willingness to take the game" in matters which the President of Rudy Giuliani had to inform him of more precisely.
The author admits that he was not a witness to the conversation, but stressed that he was informed in detail about its contents by “many white house officials who had direct information on this matter”, and their relations were covered.
“In the following days after this discussion, I learned from many American officials that the high rankings of representatives of the White House have intervened to ‘flame’ all the archived records of this conversation, and in particular the literal record that has been prepared, as usual, in the crisis room of the White House,” we read further.
"The high rank of White House officials told me that White House lawyers "indicated them to delete an electronic record from the computer system in which such records are kept.
The entry was transferred to a separate electronic system, which is usually used to store and manipulate information in particular," the author of the report wrote.
"In my assessment, these steps show that the White House officials were aware of the importance of what happened during the conversation," the signalist assessed.
As the AP commented, this document will probably speed up the proceedings on any impeachment of the president and also contain valuable information on witnesses who can confirm this relationship.
An interview with the Green White House, after the Congress's press, was made available on the inside, but not on the basis of an electronic record, but on the basis of the relationships of the people who witnessed it.
The content of the report, in the revised version, was published by the Committee of Representatives on the following day.
Also on Thursday, Mr Joseph Maguire, who was responsible for the American intelligence director, made a statement before the Committee of the Conference of Representatives and made an explanation of how he had dealt with the report of the intelligence officer.
Maguire said that the signaler had made the right choice and did as the law says.
He also stressed that, in his view, the matter of talking to the Greens is an event "without precedent".
The democracies in the committee of inquiry asked Maguire why he blocked the conference's report of the signalist; the director of the interview denied that he had no right to reveal its content, which is a secret nature guaranteeing the so-called executive privilege.
Part of Maguire's hearing by the Commission was held behind closed doors.
On Tuesday, the President of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, reported that, given the suspicion that the president was putting pressure on the Ukrainian authorities to harm their potential rival in the next presidential elections, the House of Representatives is investigating which could lead to the impechment of Trump.
The day later, she found that the report of Trump's talks with the Greens confirmed that the president of the United States broke the rules on elections and security.
Election law in the United States prohibits the use of foreign aid.
However, the justice resort assessed that the president did not break the electoral law. On Thursday, the spokesperson for the White House, Stephanie Grisham, said that there was "nothing wrong" in the discussion, and in the report, "there is nothing more than a third-hand relationship and shared press guidelines".
"The White House will continue to criticise this story of the media and the false narrative promoted by the main nurturing media," she added.
Ghana receives two ICAO awards
Ghana has won two prestigious awards during the 40th International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) meeting in Montreal, Canada.
The security award was awarded in proof of the recognition that Ghana had achieved the highest number of points in Africa in the area of aviation security surveillance, i.e. 89.89 per cent in the area of the provisional rate of effective implementation (EI).
It came to an end when ICAO completed its ICVM control on 3 April 2019 in accordance with the UN Aviation Agency’s General Aviation Safety Audit Programme.
The protection award was evidence of high country involvement in the implementation of ICAO recommended standards and protocols for protection at airports and in the airspace of Ghana.
The award programme was designed to support the ICAO initiative No Country Left Behind.
In addition to the ICAO Member States, which have improved their safety and safety standards, 16 other safety certificates and 17 safety certificates have been granted.
During the award ceremony for Ghana, he was Minister of Aviation, Joseph Kofi Adda, Director General of Ghana's Civil Aviation Office, Simon Alloy, Ambassador of Ghana in Canada, No Ayikoi Otoo and Director of Ghana Airport Company Limited, Yaw Kwakwa.
In his speech, the President of the International Civil Aviation Organization, Olumuiwa Benard Aliu, stressed the need to maintain safety in the airspace of the Member States.
He said that it is important for us to keep in mind that even in the time of innovation, the security of aviation protection and sustainable development must remain our fundamental priorities.
On his part, Mr Adda noted that the awards were an enormous achievement for the state's efforts, as they complement the hard work and endurance of the industry.
He added that the aviation industry has enormous potential for the country's economy, saying "aircraft has the potential to change our lives.
These are social and economic benefits, but everything comes from the security and protection we have managed to achieve."

Trump nominates Peter Gaynor as Head of FEMA: White House
Peter Gaynor, who serves as the Administrator of the Federal Crisis Management Agency (FEMA), smiles at the meeting of the Senate National Security Budget Sub-Commission on the application of the FEMA budget for the financial year 2020 at the Capital Summit in Washington, U.S.A., on 3 April 2019.
WASZYNGTON (Reuters) – The White House announced that on Thursday US President Donald Trump appointed Peter Gaynor as head of the Federal Crisis Management Agency (FEMA).
Gaynor, the Deputy Administrator of FEMA, is the head of the agency that oversees the government response to such disasters as hurricanes or forest fires.
The agency worked without an administrator approved by the American Senate since March when Brock Long fired that position.
Long rejected the fact that the United States Department of National Security, which is subject to FEMA, found that Long improperly used government vehicles to transport between Washington and his home in the North Carolina.
Another candidate for this position, Jeffrey Byard, was removed earlier this month, when a thorough examination of his past revealed the charges that he had taken part in a bar fight.
Gaynor's appointment was expected.
In order to confirm his appointment to this role, the majority of the Senate will be required.
The White House reported that before Gaynor became a FEMA administrator in 2018, he worked in crisis management in Rhode Island and served in the seabed.
Henrik Ingebrichtsen, Norwegian runner, considering amputation of the thumb
The 28-year-old runner specialized in the distance of 1500 meters, winning the gold medal of the European Championships in 2012 (Helsinki), silver in 2014 (Zurich) and brown in 2016 (Amsterdam).
He is also the European Deputy Master for 5,000 metres since 2018 (Berlin).
He explained that it was not a new difficulty and that one operation had already passed immediately after the games in 2016, but the pain returned and the current season was very violent.
Pain causes me to take a different step, which in turn changes my body system, leads to other unnatural burdens and begins to feel pain in other places, such as biodegradation.
That's why I couldn't prepare enough for the world's championships, and two weeks of pain is so strong that I'm having trouble putting my wheels on – the runner on the NRC TV channel said.
The father and coach of the Žert Ingebrigtsen admitted that after long discussions with his son, the only solution to stop his career and participate in the future Olympics in Tokyo would be amputation.
It seems that this is the only thing, although the drastic solution and decision have already fallen.
"If a part of the body hurts, it should be removed, and in total Henrik does not need this finger so much and in this situation it should be forgotten about the cosmetic aspect," he explained.
Police close illegal e-paper factory with marijuana in the San Gabriel Valley – CBS Los Angeles
EL MONTE (CBSLA) – On Thursday the police closed the illegal e-paper factory with marijuana in the San Gabriel Valley.
At the office building at 9600 Telstar Avenue about 16:37 there was a raid, where the police were looking for illegal for the sale of e-papers containing marijuana and where large layers containing butane hash oil were found – concentrate from Indian mushrooms.
According to Lieutenant Christopher Cano of the El Monte Police, the officers also found a device used to supplement steam deposits.
“This process is very dangerous” – says Cano.
Cano, who used to work in drugs, says the distillation of oil used in vaping products is a potentially easy process.
“The usual electrostatic spark of our clothes can cause the inflammation of these gears, causing not only fire, but also explosions because of concentration,” he says.
“If we have many layers and similar in the room, after one explosion there will be another, causing not only fire, but also explosions that could take away the entire complex from the surface.
The office was called upon to carry out special tasks in order to deal with illegal and potentially dangerous substances.
Currently, the value of confiscated products and equipment is unknown.
The detectives say they received an anonymous guide that allowed them to get a search warrant, which led to the discovery of illegal activity.
The investigators are still trying to get information that is behind this illegal business.
According to them, the person responsible was interested in this place because the office was empty.
The investigation is ongoing and the officers want to be sure that illegal products have not hit the street, taking into account recent articles on the vulnerability of steam.
"People don't really know what products they buy," says Cano.
‘They may be mixed with other harmful chemicals.
This may pose a threat to our society and children, so we always keep them from getting caught up in this kind of thing.
Aphtin's off the market.
GIF has made a decision to use the medicine for plastics
The main pharmaceutical inspector told you to withdraw the medicine from the market for mouth infection.
Aphtin is a medicine that is used to treat pellet and mucous membrane mucous membrane infections of the mouth, Gram-additional bacteria.
It can also be used to treat infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
The product was withdrawn because it did not comply with the requirements for the specification of the quality fragrance and the decrease in the active substance content.
The product was withdrawn at the request of the Galenium Laboratory in Olsztina.
Each month, GIF shall issue on average a number of decisions on the withdrawal of individual series of products from the market.
A series of medicinal products suspended for human consumption in Poland may be placed on the market once evidence of safety has been provided.
If you remove the medicine, you will not be able to do so.
Banknote 19 zł – where to buy a collection banknote about this nominal?
He's wearing 19 gold and he's wearing a picture of Ignac Jan Padrewski.
At the beginning of October, a new collection note will be introduced – the National Bank of Poland reported.
This is another banknote from the "Independence" series.
He is supposed to remember the 100th anniversary of the creation of the Polish Securities Manufacturer.
As stated in the NBP Communication, Ignac Jan Padrewski will be presented on the banknote.
Date placed on the banknote, 25 January 2019, is the day on which the 100th anniversary of the establishment of the PWPW is due.
Also the nominal value, 19 zł, refers to the year of creation of the Manufacturer" - we read in the NBP Communication.
The watermark shows an image of an eagle from the first Polish banknote produced in PWPW after recovery of independence.
The novelty is a holographic bar placed on the window at the ground floor.
The front page presents the portrait of Ignac Jan Padrewski, and a picture of Orla White's order is presented in addition to the inscription "no-subject".
This inscription, reflected in the manuscript by Joseph Pilsudski, is a type of 100-year-old trade logo recovered by Poland's independence.
In the gazelle, symbolizing brotherhood and victory, a security created by PWPW - Umbra4Note, which is a special form of angle effect, was composed.
On the reverse banknote page, the image of the manufacturer on the basis of contemporary Warsaw panoramas is placed.
Next to the PWPW logo is the SPARK Live security and the opalizing bar, also visible in UV in the form of repeated numbers "19" and the "NBP" shortcut - describes NBP.
The banknote is due to enter the range of October 2 to load up to 55 thousand pieces.
One note will cost 80 gold.
All currencies and banknotes issued by the NBP, including those of the special series, are the legal means of payment in Poland.
However, their nominal value is significantly higher than that which can be achieved on the collective market.
The new owner bought it for 500 thousand dollars, more than two million gold, for his parents and decided to move the building to Queenstown in Maryland.
The house was transferred on a special platform to Easton port where it was loaded on a boat.
That's where the river ran 50 miles.
Jarosław Kaczynski votes in favour of Malgorzat Gosijevska
President of PiS Jarosław Kaczynski in the upcoming elections will vote on Malgorzat Gosijevska.
"Please do the same," he appealed.
Jarosław Kaczynski and Malgorzat Gosijevska were invited to take a photo of the banner candidate PiS.
On Friday, Warsaw's "three" boasted in the social media that it received Kaczynski's vote in the parliamentary elections.
"The President of Law and Justice Prime Minister Jarosław Kaczynski supports Malgorzat Gosiewska," we read on her Facebook profile.
The party leader pointed out that he was a sensitive, sensitive person and was always ready to carry help.
"I will give my voice to Malgorzat Gosiewska and please do the same," he appealed.
Gosiewska is running to Sejm from the 19th (Warszawa) and third place on the list.
"One" is Kaczynski itself, and the second is Mariusz Kaminski.
They're coming to the Book Fair.
Before we meet with popular writers and books at exceptional prices.
"We're here to break stereotypes.
The people of Podkarpacia are said not to read a book.
We'll show it's different," she said during the press conference, Marta Halftorak.
And who will support reading in Russia this year?
As we heard, Sister Anastasia, the first chef of the Rzečipospolit, will appear on the markets, as well as: Lucasz Orbitowski, Katarzyna Bonda, Karolina Korwin-Piotrowska and Jakub Čwiek.
This autumn in the Millennium Hall will be a major cultural event – November 22 and 23rd to the centre of commerce, the 3rd edition of the Holy Books Fair, one of the most important reading events in the region.
The most interesting publishing and bookstores from all over Poland will be on the market.
There will be up to 30 of them, and among them will be Ara, Mark, SQN, PWN and Black.
In their positions they present their wide range of publishing offers and hundreds of book news that market participants will be able to buy at attractive prices.
More than that, special meetings with the writers will be held in two days' time.
This time, authors were invited to write about important issues and not afraid to take difficult topics, and they are also award winners and... well prepared.
The list of invited authors is not yet closed.
At this point, the competitions confirmed, among others, the Laureat Orbitowski – the winner of the policy passport, Janusz Leon Wisniewski, the bestselling author of the "Society in the Network", and the king of Poland himself: Katarzyna Bonda.
This year's star will be Anastasia's sister, author of several hundred books (including cooking) sold in more than 4 million copies.
The exhibition of the Lost Dress Elżbiety I in the Hampton Court Palace
The silver thread made of the most important silky camel has been artificially decorated by the flowers, animals, and moths.
For Eleri Lynn, the curator of the Historic Royal Palaces Foundation, it meant only one thing.
She had been hanging for 100 years on the wall of the small rural parish church on which she looked, could only be lost by a part of Elżbieta I wardrobe.
Three years after Lynn hit a case on the altar cloth exhibition in Bacton County, Herefordshire, the missing Elżbiety dress is due to come to the exhibition next month at the Hampton Court Palace, near the same premises where the queen of Tudor dynasty could wear it over 450 years ago.
The extent of this discovery is that the entire collection of royal dress survived only one element of the XVI-century dress.
Although there is no compelling evidence that Elizabeth ever wore this dress, three years of research have encouraged experts to believe that she must have been part of the royal wardrobe.
"Srebroglov", incredibly the road to cloth, was legally reserved only for the most important members of the royal palace, and the virtuoso quality of the dried plants and flowers, later enriched with deer, dogs, motels, fish and bear, indicates that the cover belonged to the most significant of the people.
The dress, when it was heard, could cost the equivalent of Tudor's possession.
“In the 1990s, at the end of Elizabeth’s reign, she felt the threat from other women in the court and would not tolerate rivals with such creative fabrics,” says Lynn.
"As this is a very important statement, I have asked many people from the environment to look at their dress.
It really made me very happy to see the dress, and they also admired it and were practically convinced that we had a royal wardrobe in front of us.
Long, a new life of dress, cut to serve as an altar cloth in the dark church of St Faith in Bacton, is not as unexpected as it might seem.
Bacton is the settlement where Blanche Parry came from, the nearest Elżbiete lady of the palace, who served the queen for her long life and with which the fabric was made available in local legends.
Although the dress was born after her death in 1590, experts believe that Elżbieta had to give it to the Parry family or to the parishes of Blanche before her death in 1603.
After more than a thousand hours of conservation work, four of which flowed into the most delicate hand-made shirt using specially colored silk and dark surgical needles, the altar cloth hits the exhibition next to the exhibition's exhibition's Hatfield House portrait "Rainbow Portrait", one of the most famous contemporary paintings depicting Elżbiet in a similar dress.
"When working with historical fabrics, the art of the people who did it is really beginning to be respected," says Libby Thompson, chief of the conservation work, whose most of it took place in the restored glass at the Hampton Court Palace – the only place that is big enough to accommodate some of the priceless goblelins.
“Looking back and forth, I began to feel great respect for those who made it.
I've never worked on something so elite.
The exhibition "The Lost Dress of Elizabeth" will begin on 12 October at the Hampton Court Palace.
Fitch Agency confirmed Poland's rating with a stable perspective
Fitch confirmed Poland's long-term foreign exchange rating on Friday at “A-” – given in the Communication.
The prospects for the rating remained stable.
"The Fitch Agency points to strong macroeconomic and well-diversified economic foundations, which are supported by sound economic policies and a strong banking sector," we read in the Communication of the Ministry of Finance.
As added, Fitch pointed out that Poland was at the top of the economic cycle, and in 2019-2021 the real growth rate of Gross State Product in Poland will be 4.1 per cent, 3.3 per cent and 2.9 per cent respectively.
The Agency predicts that the level of government and self-government deficit for GDP in the years 2020-2021 will remain below the 3 per cent threshold, 2.3 per cent and 1.9 per cent respectively.
"The government and self-government debt ratio to GDP in 2019 will be 50.5% according to the agency, and in subsequent years it will be lower (average 48.3% in the period 2020-2021)", we read.
Rating Polish
The autumn round of reviews rating Poland will end on October 11th, S&P and Moody's.
Rating Poland in Fitch's evaluation remains the same as issued at the end of March 2019.
At the same time, the agency confirmed Poland's rating at "A-" with a stable perspective.
Among the three largest rating agencies, the creditworthiness of Poland is the highest rating of Moody's – at A2 level.
According to Fitch and S&P, rating Poland is "A-", one level below Moody's.
The prospects of all assessments are stable.
What's the rating?
Credit rating agencies shall be established to assist investors in assessing the risk of their investment activities.
The rating is awarded to companies, banks and countries.
In the case of the latter, each assessment shall be translated into economic attractiveness.
Rating is nothing but a credit rating.
It makes decisions about who and how much to borrow.
Sometimes this information also suggests that it is best not to give credit at all because there is a risk that money will not be recovered.
The lower rating is associated with a higher risk.
On the other hand, higher risk is a high percentage of credit.
Any assessment must be justified and substantiated.
The rating can be manipulated, but in this case the agencies risk losing their reputation.
At the moment, more than 90 percent of the world market for credit rating services are controlled by three agencies: Standard & Poor's, Fitch and Moody's.
Each of them applies its own system of assessments.
"Fifth of the Confederation": First 1000 plus
"Fifth of the Confederation", the main foundations of the electoral programme, were presented in Kosovo on Friday to the Sajm round 40 candidates for the mandate of the KW Confederation Freedom and Independence List.
The leader of the Kosovo letter to Sejm Krzysztof Chmeelewski presented the words “five confederations”.
"For Poland, for Poland, for Poland, for the second fast and fair courts, for the third cultural and educational bonus, for the fourth national security, for the fifth is a healthy life," Chmelevski said.
He pointed out that "Polices must finally start making good money", so the Confederation wants to eliminate income tax and, as Chmielewski said, "the problem with the tax-free amount will be solved by itself".
"Polices need to make a choice where they want to save their money for retirement, that is zero PIT and Voluntary ZUS for all," the list leader said about the "1000 plus program for Poland".
However, Alexander Zadenck, starting from the second place of the list, referred to the "healthy life" program, said that "life is increasingly worse" and to change it, "support Polish farmers, Polish agriculture" should act for GMO-free cultivation.
As she said, the Confederation also refers to the cessation of the "stigmatization of seed mushrooms".
Zadencka declared support to the Confederation for the "development of a building using natural raw materials".
She also spoke on behalf of her group for "good vaccinations".
"The right to consent cannot be violated," she added.
The other candidates to the Sejm from the Koszalin district stressed that the Confederation was "a step-by-step reform of the judiciary", which would include handling the case by the judge "day after day".
They also stated that the education grant would be granted to schools without the means of self-government, which they consider to be free of additional costs related to the maintenance of officials.
The confederation is also a "strong Polish army based on Polish industry and Polish soldiers".
The Sejm candidates stressed the need to increase the number of troops.
They also require easier access to weapons.
In economic matters, they stressed the need for "permanent access to energy".
"We can fire coal, we have a lot of geothermal energy, we also need to consider the return to the concept of nuclear power," said the fifth on the election list Piotr Karpinski.
The head of the Mexican cartel is behind one third of the drugs in the United States.
Chicago – just after sunrise on the West Side in Chicago CBS News reported a morning drive for drugs.
Brian McKnight from the DEA showed in full light what's going on.
Last year, almost 800 people died from drug overdose in Chicago.
McKnight said "probably 90%" drugs in Chicago come from Mexico.
DEA focuses on the Mexican drug lord Nemesio Cervantesie, known as El Mencho.
"It is the most important priority for the DEA and directly for the federal executive bodies in the United States," said Matthew Donahue, chief DEA agent in Mexico.
The reward for El Mencho is $10 million.
He helped discover dozens of El Mencho drug labs in the jungle.
A member of El Mencho Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generacion, CJNG, is responsible for at least one third of the drugs affecting the United States on land and sea.
According to the Department of Justice, the cartel has confused the "tones" of cocaine, methamphetamines and heroin contaminated by fentanyl.
El Mencho's head is waiting for a $10 million reward.
As in irony, he lived in California about 30 years ago, where he was arrested for drug-related charges and eventually deported to Mexico.
That's where he created a brutal cartel.
It has a huge amount of weapons, RPG, 50 caliber weapons.
It basically has its own SWAT teams," Donahue added.
El Mencho protects his empire by using such means as shooting a Mexican army helicopter, killing six people, or participating in the public siege of this year.
In recent years, the brutality of the cartel has led to thousands of murders.
According to Mexican government statistics, about 94 murders come every day.
Mexican drugs in Chicago are so toxic that they cannot be treated without protective equipment.
In the cocaine package laboratory, it means the brand of the switch.
For more than one third of them, the trail leads to El Mencho cartel.
"It is his responsibility to send a poison that kills innocent women and children," said Donahue.
So when someone dies, Donahue says there's a "great chance" that drugs come from El Mencho's organization.
Over 67,000 Americans died last year from overdose.
France: 27-year-old blackmailed the president of France and his wife
The 27-year-old man tried to blackmail Emmanuel Macron and the first lady – says the French prosecutor.
The accused shall ensure that he has documents that compromise the presidential couple.
He asked the head of state, including EUR 300 000 in cash.
The man who was born in Azerbaijan and wanted to work with the police in France claims that he received "explosive" documents from the person employed in the Elisha Palace.
In the course of the hearings, he explained that these documents not only compromise the presidential couple, but that their disclosure in full might threaten the security of Macron and the first lady of France.
In exchange for their return, he asked for 300 thousand euros – he also wanted to get a apartment in Paris.
He contacted one of Brigitte Macron's daughters in the previous marriage.
According to the prosecutor, he refused to report to the police the documents he was talking about.
He said he would pass them through – but at the moment we don't know if these documents really exist.
They were not found during the audit in this 27-year-old's apartment.
The man was subjected to psychiatric studies, but his doctors did not detect any serious disorders.

Run, scrap and fight - Sport
On Saturday, Stomil takes Podbeskide and wants to win.
Stomila's balls from three colleagues are inconvenient.
The Zöneszkowski's followers won seven points at the time because they won with Stalma Mielec and Chojniczanka Chojnice, and in the last match, the free remix fell in Suwalkak.
Now the Olsztian team will take Podbeskide on Saturday at 18 a.m., which is listed as one of the favorites to advance to the Extraclass.
The closest Stomilla rivals take the fourth place in the table and have a top priority over the Olsztina team.
The podbeskid on the trips this season played six times and counted after two victories, remissions and defeats Natomiast Stomil feels very well on his site – at the stadium near Al. Pilsudski 69a team Peter Zhenjezkowski won three times and lost once.
A total of 17 points were collected in ten rows, and they are at the top of the table, although after two failures at the beginning of the game, there was no guarantee of that.
"Every change takes time to be a result," explains Piotr Skiba.
"Well, we finally got something to do, we believed in ourselves, and we could work under normal conditions.
We just got together to play ball.
They're clean heads, they're a good atmosphere and everyone knows what to do because we have a strong training staff."
On Tuesday, Stomila had been eliminated from the Polish Movement of Chorz, but they needed to do this as well as a series of prosecutions.
In southern Poland, Piotr Skiba, Grzegorz Lech and Janusz Bucholc did not leave because Coach Zönezkowski allowed these key leaders to rest before Saturday's event with Podbeskid.
In Croatia, however, he played back after the conjugation of Jacob Mosakowski, who finally shot his long-awaited gate.
“It’s always nice to get a goal, and I’ve come at a time where we can continue to play the puchars (Mosakovski was equal to 3:3 in 119 minutes – red).
Dad often bit me and laughed that I couldn't get a doorbell, and I always told him I'd shoot at a time when he wasn't expecting."
Now Moscow counts back to the main warehouse, more than due to the yellow cards it cannot play Oleh Tarasenko.
"For this, I have a hard time working on training so I can play in the first composition," says Moscow.
"I did my best to present myself in Chorzow.
However, if I'm going to play or sit on the reserve bench, I'm going to support the team as much as I can.
Because the most important is the team and three points in the game with Podbeskid.
We are sure to be faced with a difficult meeting in which victory will have to run, scatter and fight."
In the middle of the Olsztian defense, Rafał Remisz can still play, who has recently also gained the honor, so if it happens, we'll find out on Saturday, more than that Zänjezkowski's coach traditionally tries to keep himself in the dark until the end of the strike.
The man raped and murdered his sister.
"You will never see the light of the day.
You'll never breathe fresh air again," said Judge Kevin K. Allen, returning to Alex Whipple.
"What you did was so reprehensible and sad that you have to spend the rest of your life in prison," he added.
Five-year-old Lizzie disappeared in May.
Her search lasted five days, until Whipple pointed out where she was hiding her body.
"How could anyone do this to his own sister?" asked Dejay Smith, a girl's uncle.
"You are the worst person humanity has to offer," Alexa Whipple said.
"I would give up everything to meet her again, hug her," said the murdered girl's mother.
"Our life will never be the same again," added the contrite woman.
As Fox News reports, 22-year-old Whipple didn't show any emotions during the interview.
In the past month, he admitted that he had kidnapped, used sexual violence, and murdered a girl.
The male lawyer found that his client was raised as an "inperfect family".
He was supposed to be tortured as a child.
He also added that Whipple was aware that he had committed a terrible act and was willing to bring the punishment.
The man was sentenced to life without being able to apply for parole.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced that he would transfer almost $100 million of additional funds to the affected communities.
The programme providing the money to farmers affected will be expanded and the criteria for granting additives to farmers will be simplified.
The aid package covers nearly $34 million for the support initiative for the affected communities, so that the eligible for economic aid can receive up to $3000 in urgent cases.
Each of the 13 local self-government areas under the drought relief programme will receive up to $1 million in infrastructure and disaster relief.
The new support package is an addendum to over $7 billion for the government to the drought fund.

In the Name of Love China's Mistress Busters
documentary film: In China, the number of divorces has increased twice in the last decade.
The reason for this state of affairs was in general a third person.
More and more men maintain foreign relations, which has led to the formation of a particular industry in the country – a professional hugging of lovers who want to save the marriage of betrayed women.
Let's make a sound scan: Ma-te-usz!
A bid to welcome the Prime Minister in Słuski Squares
A special general attempt was made before the election meeting with Prime Minister Mateusz Morawieck in Słuski Squares.
"The honourable state, louder, louder, so we do not welcome the Prime Minister here!
Let's shout out loud: Ma-te-usz!", he encouraged the leaders.
Unfortunately, the enthusiasm of the leadership did not produce the expected result.
The campaign is in progress.
Politicians go all over the country, convincing the voters.
An intensive campaign is also run by Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, who is a frequent guest in the region as a leader of the PiS.
Each meeting shall be exactly scheduled, including the appropriate repair.
It was also, rather – it was supposed to be, in Słu's Squares.
It is well known that a special guest should be welcomed.
Prior to the meeting with the Prime Minister, he decided to conduct a general trial in the Chamber.
Nothing in the water was trying to encourage the crowd to scandalize the name of the government chief.
"This will not be an invitation to me, only to Prime Minister Mateus Morawiecki!
Also louder, louder than my dears!", he encouraged dissatisfaction.
Unfortunately, the crowd was not able to take full advantage of the hot leaser and reluctantly responded to the Ma-te-usz, but the recording of the enthusiastic leadership makes a furor in the network.
Ronald Lee Haskell: A man convicted of murdering his ex-wife in Texas
Ronald Lee Haskell, 39, was sentenced to death in 2014 by Stephen and Katie Stay and four of their five children in Spring in Texas.
According to the authorities, he went into the house of the State on 9 July 2014, demanding disclosure of his wife's residence, Melannie Haskell, with whom he was in separation.
She wasn't there, but she was her sister, Katie Stay and her family.
Stephen Stay, 39, Katie Stay, 33, two boys aged 13 and 4, and two girls aged 9 and 7, died when Haskell opened fire, as Harris's Sheriff's Office said.
There was only one family member, 15-year-old Cassidy Stay.
The authorities said she was badly injured, but she managed to recover completely.
On Thursday, members of the jury rejected Ronald Lee Haskell's defense on the basis of illiteracy.
The left of the sworn will be gathered again on Monday to issue a verdict.
Quantum Internet ever closer to reality – ScienceDaily
The U.S. Army's results move the quantum internet a step closer.
Such an Internet could offer military security, detection and accuracy of the time being inaccessible in a traditional network approach.
The Centre for the Advanced Quantitative Processing of Military Information Research Laboratory for the Development of the U.S. Army's Capability of Conduct was seen by researchers from the University of Insbruck, who managed to achieve a record transfer of the state between the material and the light – 50 kilometres away using light cables.
It's a correlation that can occur between quantities such as cubes.
When two cubes are split and one of them is measured, it will have an impact on the measurement made on the other of them, even if the other cube is physically remote.
"These [50 kilometres] are two rows of sizes beyond the previous possible and it is a long distance to start building the inter-urban quantum networks," said Dr. Ben Lanyon, an experimental physicist at the University of Innsbruck and the main researcher in the project whose discovery was published in the Nature magazine, the Quantum Information section.
Intermediate quantum networks would consist of distant connections of physical cubes that are intertwined with each other despite a large physical distance.
Researchers have found that this distribution of cross-states is necessary for the creation of the quantum internet.
"This demonstration is a slow step forward to achieve a large-scale widespread state," said Dr. Sara Gamble, co-authorizing the military programme supporting this research.
The quality of the state of the second end is also so high as to meet some of the most difficult applications of the quantum networks.
The research team began experimenting with an atom of calcium trapped in ion capture.
With the help of laser bonds, researchers entered quantum status in jon while encouraging him to emit the photon in which quantum information was recorded.
As a result, the quantum state of the atom and the particles of light have been destroyed.
The challenge is to send photon with a light cable.
"The photon emitted by ion of the calcium has a wavelength of 854 nanometers and is quickly absorbed by the light," Lanyon said.
That is why his team initially sent a piece of light through a non-linear crystal with a strong laser beam.
The length of the photon wave has been converted to the optimal value from the point of view of the transmission to a long distance – the current standard telecommunications wave length is 1550 nanometers.
The researchers then sent the photon through a 50-kilometre light-emitting cable.
Their measurements show that the atoms and particles of light were still scattered even after the transformation of the length of the wave and the passage of that distance.
"The decision on the choice of calcium means that this result leads directly to the creation of a complex network of atomic clocks at large physical distances, because calcium can be combined with a high quality "magic" cube.
The army is very much interested in the large-scale integrated watch networks due to the application of precise position, precise navigation and time synchronisation," said Dr. Fredrik Fatemi, a military researcher who also co-operates with the program.
