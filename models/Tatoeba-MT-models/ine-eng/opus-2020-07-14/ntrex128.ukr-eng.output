The members of the Wells Assembly are concerned that they will "connect with maps"
Some CAs are threatening the recommendation to change the name of their post to "member of the Wells Parliament" (MWP).
This recommendation was based on plans to change the name of the assembly to the Parliament of Wells.
THE whole political spectrum is concerned that it can cause smiles.
One C.A. of the Leborists claimed that his group would be troubled by the Romans with both Twp and Pwp.
For readers outside Wells: in Welsh, "twp" means "unintelligible", and "pwp" means an act of defecation.
A.K.A. from the Wells Party said that his group was completely "not satisfied" and offered alternatives.
One of the Welsh conservators said that his group was "unpredicted" about the name change, but pointed out that MWP could quickly become a map.
In this context, the word “w” is similar to the word “u” in Yorkshire.
The Committee of the Assembly, which is currently drafting legislation to change the names, noted: “The final decision on the new name of the members of the Assembly will certainly be taken by the members themselves. ”
The Law on the Self - Control of Wales from 2017 allows the Welsh Assembly to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public discussion of the proposals, and the re-election of the assembly in the Wells Parliament received broad support.
With regard to what is called the CA, the Commission proposes to call them "members of the Wells Parliament", that is, WMP, but the MWP has received the highest public support.
Of course, the C.E. offers alternatives, but the attempt to reach agreement can cause problems to the head of Elina Jones, who has to pass the bill on changes for several weeks.
Reform legislation will include other changes to the work of the Assembly, including the rules of the CA and the structure of the committee system.
THE final vote on their new name will take place when the legislation is discussed.
Macedonians are going to vote on a referendum to change the name of the country
On Sunday, the polls announce whether to change the name of the country to “the Republic of Northern Macedonia. ”
The vote was organized to resolve a long - standing dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
The Athens have long claimed that the name of their northern neighbour is a claim in Greece, and they have repeatedly opposed Macedonia's membership in the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President George Ivanov, who is opposed to holding a name change referendum, said he would ignore the results of the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zayev, claim that the change of name is just the price to be paid for entry into the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's calls are silent, because Harlem's churches are experiencing difficult times.
“The old people I was talking to say that there was a bar and a church in every corner,” says Mr. Adams.
Now there's nothing to it or anything else."
He believes that the disappearance of bars can be understood:
"Today people are socializing differently.
Bari is no longer a local guest room where they go regularly. ”
As for the churches, Adams is afraid that money from the sale of assets will not be as long as the leaders expect, and “early or late they will be found where they began. ”
The churches, he added, could replace houses with condominiums, and there would live people who would not help the saints who remained nearby.
“Most people who buy condominiums in these buildings will be white, ” Adams explained, “so this will speed up the day when all these churches are closed, because it is unlikely that the majority of those who move to condominiums will become their own. ”
Both churches were built by white communities before Harlem became a black metropolis: The Metropolitan Community Church was built in 1870, and St. Martin was ten years later.
The white Methodist community left here in the 1930s.
The black community, which was operating nearby, had the right to build.
Saint Martin went to the black community under the direction of John Howard Johnson, who headed the Boycotts of Disrupted Traders on 125th Street, Harlem's main trade street, and they didn't want to take on the work of blacksmiths and raise them in service.
In 1939 the fire had severely damaged the building, but Father Johnson’s parishioners wanted to restore it and set up a carilion.
The famous David Johnson, son and successor of Johnson’s father in St. Martin, proudly called the Carolina “the call of the poor. ”
The expert who played the carilion in July called it the “cultural treasure” and the “unchangeable historical instrument”.
This expert, Tiffany Ng, from Michigan University, also noted that it was the first carilion in the world to be played by a black-skinned musician Dionysius A. Lind, who went to a larger carilion 18 years ago in the Riverside Church.
According to Mr. Merriever, he had no replacements in Saint Martin.
What's happening in St. Martin over the last few months is a difficult story about architects and subcontractors, some of which have been joined by church leaders, others by the bishops.
The Council, a governing body of the parishioners, wrote in July that the Eyparchy is concerned that the Eyparchy will “success to spend” the joy of not taking part in the hire of the architects and subcontractors sent by the Eyparchy.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the emperor.
The shark was traumatizing a 13-year-old boy who was stalking lobsters in California.
According to official figures, on Saturday, the shark attacked a 13-year-old boy and injured him, and the boy went after the Lobsters in California on the day of the opening of the Lobster season.
The attack took place almost 7: 00 p.m. near Bikon Beach in Ensinitas.
Chad Hammel told the KSWB-TV channel in San Diego that on Saturday morning he had been out of bed with friends for about half an hour when he heard the boy likes help, and a group rushed to him to get out of the water.
At first, Hammel thought it was just a catch from the ledger, but then he realized that the boy was shouting, "I've got a taste!
They have tempted me."
As soon as he got to the boy, he saw that his key was completely broken.
"I cried out to everyone that they should go out of the water, "In the water of the shark!" he added.
The boy was delivered to the Gvintocrile at the Children's Hospital of the Council in San Diego, where he is in critical condition.
The type of shark that has made an attack is unknown.
Captain Larry Jails at the media briefing told us that a few weeks ago the shark was spotted in this area, but it was established that it did not refer to dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim had been damaged by trauma at the top of the hall.
In search and security for 48 hours, the authorities closed access to the beach from Ponto in Casablanca to Swami in Ensinitas.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to go to the British cosmetic market
Sainsbury's is going to compete with Boots, SuperDrug and Debenhams with islands with cosmetics similar to those in universities.
In the context of the enhanced entry into the British cosmetic market, the value of 2.8 billion pounds of sterlings (continued to increase when the volume of sales of clothing and household goods decreases) increased islands with cosmetics will be protested in 11 stores across the country.
Investments in cosmetics are related to supermarkets looking for ways to use local space that used to be used on television, microwaves and household goods.
In Sainsbury's, they say they double the range of cosmetics and offer up to 3,000 products, including brand names like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing L'Oreal, Maybellline and Burt's Bees are getting more space: there are brand zones like those in Boots stores.
The supermarket also updates the cosmetic assortment of Boutique: Most of the goods presented will now not be tested on animals, as young buyers are increasingly demanding.
Moreover, a fragmentary perfumer Fragrance Shop protests its batches in two Sainsbury's stores: the first batch was opened in Craydon, Northern London, last week, and the second is opened in Sellie-Ouk, Birmingham, later this year.
Internet shopping and going to buy small quantities of food every day in small stores makes supermarkets make additional efforts to attract visitors.
Mike Cupe, executive director of Sainsbury's, said that their stores would become more like the universe, because the supermarket network is trying to resist Aldi and Lidl's discounters using more services and unsolicited goods.
Sainsbury's opens the Argos department in hundreds of its stores, also opens up a number of Habitats departments. Sainsbury's bought both networks two years ago and claims that it increased sales of food and made both networks more profitable.
The previous attempt to update the supermarket’s cosmetics and pharmaceutical products was unsuccessful.
Sainsbury's tested cooperation with Boots in the early 2000s, but she ended up arguing about how to separate the revenues from the pharmacies in supermarkets.
The new strategy came after Sainsbury's sold their pharmacy business (281 pharmacies) Celesio, the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy's network, for 125 million pounds of sterling three years ago.
They agreed that Lloyds would help by adding an expanded range of luxury brands to care for the skin, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hex, commercial director of Sainsbury, said: "We have changed the appearance of our islands with cosmetics to make the atmosphere more pleasant for customers.
We also invested in specialized consultants who could offer advice.
The brand assortment presented to us is called to satisfy any needs, and the pleasant environment and convenient location means that we are now an attractive place to buy cosmetics, which is a competition in the old way of buying."
Peter Jones "disposed" because Holly Willowby made a deal worth 11 million pounds of sterling.
The Light Dragon star Peter Jones "sends" because TV leader Holly Willowie has come out of a deal with his brand of goods for life (the value of the deal is 11 million pounds sterling) to focus on new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willowbie doesn't have time for the brand of Truly's household clothes and accessories.
The business of the money was related to the brand Goop Guineat Peltro.
The 37-year-old leader of this Morning program announced his entry to Instagram.
Holly Willowby brought Peter Jones' Light Dragon star to a shock when she finally left their profitable business of goods for life to focus on new profitable contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
The sources report that Jones "dissented," when a golden girl from the TV confessed during a busy meeting on Tuesday at the Johns Empire headquarters in Marlow, Bakingemshire, that her new contract worth 1.5 million pounds of sterlings means that she no longer has enough time to devote it to their shared brand of household clothing and accessories Truly.
This business was related to the Goop Guineat Peltro brand and was to double the Willowby stock, which is estimated at 11 million pounds of sterling.
When 37-year-old Willowbie reported in Instagram coming from Truly, Jones flew from Britain to one of his holiday homes.
The source said: “Truly, no doubt, was the main priority of Holly.
He was to become her long - term future in the next few decades.
Willowby's decision to get out of the business surprised all the interested parties.
No one could believe what was going on on on Tuesday, almost on the previous day.
In Marlow's headquarters, a full set of things ready for sale.
Experts believe that the entry of this Morning leader, one of Britain’s most highly paid stars, could cost millions of firms because of large investments in goods (from pillows and candles to clothing and household clothing) and create further delays at the start.
It can also mean the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three Willowbie and her husband, Dan Baldwin, were close to Jones and his wife, Tari Kapp, for ten years.
Willowbie and Kapp created True in 2016, and 52-year-old Jones joined as head of government in March.
The couple held a party together, Jones owns 40 percent of Baldwin’s TV - based stock.
Willowby becomes an ambassador of the brand M&S and replaces Anthony McCartlin as leader of I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
The source, near Jones, said last night, "We won't comment on him."
A cruel conversation, "and then we fell in love"
He was joking at the criticism he received from the news media for a comment that someone would consider as "unpresidency" and for a very positive attitude towards the North Korean leader.
"Why did President Tramp go into such a big deal?
Tramp said, imitating the voice of the leader. —
I didn't go on any actions."
He noted that Kim was interested in the second meeting after Tramp called their first meeting in Singapore in June a big step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
But the negotiations on denuclearization have gone into a deaf corner.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, the leading diplomat of North Korea, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the UN General Assembly that North Korea does not see a "responsibility" from the United States on its first steps towards disarmament.
Instead, he noted that the United States continues to apply pressure - support sanctions.
In his speech at the meeting, Tramp was much more optimistic.
"We have a good relationship with North Korea," he said.
We were going to fight with North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
Now we have such a wonderful relationship."
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim led to positive results: the completion of the missile tests, the release of hostages, and the return of the remains of American military personnel home.
He also protected his unusual approach when talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to behave more Presidentially, but instead of 10,000 people on the street who are trying to get into this battle of the winning stadium, we have about 200 people standing right there," Tramp said, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
The tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia destroyed hundreds of dead islands
In particular, after the earthquake in Lomboca, foreign NGOs were told that they did not need help.
Although more than 10 percent of the Lomboki population have been affected, the national disaster has not been announced, which is a prerequisite for international assistance.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they made it clear that they are not looking for international help, so it's a bit difficult," said Mrs. Sumbung.
Although "Let's bring the kids back," he's picking up a team to travel to Paul until we know if foreign personnel can work on the spot.
Mr. Sutopo, a representative of the national disaster relief agency, said that the Indonesian authorities appreciated the situation in Pala to determine whether to allow international organizations to provide assistance.
Considering that earthquakes continue to occur in Indonesia, the country remains horrendously unprepared to the wrath of nature.
In the province of Aceh, the caves are built from the tsunamis, but they are not typical of the other coasts.
The apparent absence of the siren’s warning about the tsunami in Paul, although the warning was effective, likely contributed to the death.
Moving between numerous Indonesian islands is not just the best time.
The natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
The medical ship that was in Lomboca to treat the victims of the earthquake is floating to Pala, but reaching the site of a new disaster can be at least three days later.
President Joco Weidodo has improved Indonesia's infrastructure on the basis of his election campaign and has increased the cost of roads and railways.
But the lack of funding created problems for the administration of Mr. Joco, who plans to change the next year.
Mr. Joko also prevents the duration of an interconfessional enemy in parts of Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority chose a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people died, tens of thousands of displaced persons from their homes as a result of the opposition of Christian and Muslim gangs on the streets using swords, bows, arrows, and other primitive weapons.

The number of tsunamis in Indonesia increased to 832
The number of deaths from earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia increased to 832, reports the Indonesian agency for the eradication of disasters early in the morning.
A lot of people were left in the trap of buildings destroyed during the Friday earthquake by 7.5 balloons, which caused a wave of six meters high, the press secretary of Sotopo Purvo Nugroho told the press conference.

The murder investigation began after the woman’s body was found in Birkenhed, Mercisside, this morning.
A 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. with knee wounds in Grayson-Museum, John Street.
The police called for a response from people who saw or heard something.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan commented: "The investigation is at an early stage, but I'm asking everyone who's been near John Street in Birkenhede and has seen or heard something suspicious, to contact us.
I also ask everyone, especially the cab drivers, who could take something off the video recorder, to contact us, because information on these videos can be very important for our investigation."
The police officer confirmed that the woman whose body had been found was the residence of Birkenheda and was found in the house.
Today, in the second half of the day, friends who think they know a woman came to a crime scene to ask where they found her this morning.
The investigation is ongoing, and the police have stated that they are informing the victim’s closest relatives immediately.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson-Museum just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police said that no one was allowed to go into the house and get out of it.
When he learned what had happened, he lost his gift of speech.
People are now told that hours will pass before they are allowed to return home.

The Statue of Cromwell, near Parliament, is a new memory that suffers from the "rewrite of history"
The removal of the statue would be due to the destruction of many of England's cultural and religious artifacts by its fantastic Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society called Mr. Creek's proposal "stupid" and "to rewrite the story".
John Goldsmith, head of the Kramwell Society, said: “Concerning the current debate on the withdrawal of the articles, what the statue of Oller Kramwell at the Westminster Palace was inevitable. ”
An iconocracy during English civil wars was not carried out by Cromwell himself or by his order.
It is unlikely that Cromwell would have been sacrificed for the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century.
The great statue of the sculptor William Hamo Tornichroft is a testimony to the mood of the 19th century and a part of the story that many think is still worthy of honor.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Many are probably more likely to be in the late 19th century than are now known as the Cromwell defender of Parliament from external pressure, in his case, of course, monarchy.
Is such an idea entirely accurate — the subject of historical debates that take place?
There is no doubt that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has determined the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is one of the well-known figures that represents one side of this conflict.
Its achievement as a Lord-Protector should also be marked and respected."
A Chinese farmer's pig-killer died.
According to local media, the farmer was attacked and killed by pigs on the market in southwestern China.
The man, identified only by the name of Juan, was found dead in blood with a broken artery near a pig market in Lippanšu, Gujjou province, reported the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
In Sinina, China, on May 30, 2005, pigs are to be vaccinated in pigs.
It is reported that on the average, he went out with his twin brother from the neighboring province of Greece to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, the brother found him dead and saw that the pig’s door was open.
The brother noted that there was a large shed with blood on his foot in the pigs.
The medical expert confirmed that the 249-kilogram cab had killed the farmer to death.
"The feet of my cousin were in the blood and distraught," said a twin brother named Wu, quoted as Guiyang Evening News.
The security footage showed that John entered the market at 4:40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed a man was not the property of Joanna or of his twin brother.
The market manager told Evening News that when the police collected evidence at the scene, the pig was locked up to prevent its attack on people.
Seven are reported to be Yuan and market administration discussing compensation for his death.
Even rarely, however, cases of swine attacks have been reported before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts and struck a man with a fatal injury.
Ten years before that pig weighed 295 pounds [295 kg] of the wheeled farmer pressed to the tractor until the farmer’s wife frightened the animal.
After a farmer from Oregon ate his own pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but blood taste can be a trigger.
"They're just playful.
They're like children, very curious... they don't want to harm you.
You just have to treat them with proper respect, ” he said.
Residues of Hurricane Rosa bring widespread floods to the southwestern United States
As foretold, Hurricane Rosa is weakened by more colder waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
But in the next few days, Rosa will bring rains with rains north of Mexico and south-west of the United States.
Rose had a wind speed of 137 km per hour (this hurricane category 1) at 5 a.m. on Sunday, and was 620 km south-west of Punta-Evgenia, Mexico.
Rose is expected to go north on Sunday.
In the meantime, over the Pacific, there begins to be an investment that moves east to the western coast of the United States. On Monday, Rose approaches the peninsula of Lower California as a tropical storm, and it starts to push a strong tropical humidity north to the southwestern United States.
On Monday, Rosa will bring up to 25.4 centimeters of rain in some parts of Mexico.
Then, in the near future, a tropical vegetation that interacts with the nearby vegetation will produce strong floods in the southwestern part of the world.
In this area, between 2.54 and 10.2 cm of rain will cause dangerous floodwaters, garbage streams, and desert droughts.
Strong tropical humidity will increase the number of droplets by 5 to 7,6 cm per hour, especially in some parts of south of Nevada and Arizona.
5-10.2 cm of rain is expected in some parts of the south-west, especially in the vast area of Arizona.
The rains are possible when conditions are severed because of the scattered nature of tropical rains.
We strongly advise not to go to the desert of the foothills, for possible tropical floods.
The strong rain can make the canyons stormy, and the forests will bring the winds and dust storms here.
The closeness of the depositary will cause strong rains in some parts of the northern coast of California.
The number of wastes may exceed 1.27 cm, which may cause insatiable waste streams and waste roads.
This will be the first left in the region in the rainy season.
Some scattered tropical torrents will begin to approach Arizona late on Sundays and early on Mondays, and on Monday evenings and Tuesdays the rain will increase.
The strong rain will go over For-Corners from Tuesday to Wednesday.
In October, intense changes in temperatures across the U.S. territory can be observed, since the Arctic is getting colder, but the tropicals remain rather warm.
At times, this results in severe changes in the temperature at short intervals.
A fine example of a severe drop in temperature in the central United States can be seen on Sunday.
It's almost a 7-degree temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis and De-Mays, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the summer heat will try to return and spread again.
It is expected that in a large area of central and eastern U.S. will be warm before October, and the temperature from the south to some parts of the north will be 27 degrees Celsius.
The temperature in New York can reach 27 degrees Celsius on Tuesday, which is about 12 degrees Celsius above the average temperature.
According to our long-term weather forecast, there is a high probability of an average temperature being exceeded in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Cavano’s hearing
On Thursday, more than 20 million people on six television networks observed the exciting testimony of a candidate for the post of Supreme Court Judge Brett Cavano and Christine Blaise Ford, a woman who accused him of sexual violence, as it were in the 1980s.
Political opposition continued, channels interrupted planned programs to report on the latest Friday news: an agreement prepared by Senator Arisoni Jeff Fleic, on a one-week investigation by the FBI on charges.
Ford informed the Senate's judicial committee that she was 100% confident that Cavano was making her drink and trying to get her clothes off at a party in the senior school.
Cavano, in his emotional testimony, said that he was 100% convinced that it was not.
It's quite likely that on Friday, more than 20.4 million people were watching what Nielsen's research company reported.
The company calculated the average audience of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
It was not immediately possible to get numbers on other networks that also showed listening, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Also, Nielsen has a problem with measuring the number of people who watch television in the offices.
For comparison, such an audience in size is similar to an audience that looks like a player in the play-off series or Oscar prize.
Fox News Channel, whose leading thought show strongly supported the assignment of Cavano, was a leader among all the channels during the day’s hearing, with an average attendance of 5.69 million in Nielsen.
ABC was the second of 3.26 million viewers.
According to representatives of Nielsen, CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million.
The interest remained high after listening.
Flake became the central figure of the Friday drama.
The office of this moderate Republican published a statement that he was going to vote for the Kawano, and then, on Friday morning, CNN and CBS recorded how protestors shouted at Fleke when he was trying to go to the elevator to hear the Court's committee.
He stood with his eyes down for a few minutes, during which he was lashed out, which was broadcast in a direct ephere to the CNN.
“ I’m standing right in front of you, ” said one woman.
You think he's telling the truth to the country?
They said to him, “You have power over women, and you have no authority over them.”
Fleke reported that his office had published the application and, before the elevator was closed, added that he would say more on the hearing committee.
All cables and broadband channels were broadcast directly hours later when the Judicial Committee had to vote on the nomination of Kawano to the Senate in full.
Fleke said he would do it only if he knew that the FBI was going to take a case against the candidate next week, which a democratic minority demands.
Fletka was partly convinced of the conversations with his friend, Senator Chris Kuns.
After talking to Kuns and then with several senators, Fleke made a decision.
Fleka’s choice had an impact, since it was obvious that the Republicans would not have a vote to appoint a candidate for Cavana without an investigation.
President Tramp initiated an FBI investigation into Kavano's accusations.
British Prime Minister Teresa May blames critics for "the games in politics" around Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times Prime Minister Teresa May blamed her plans for leaving the European Union for "political games" with Britain's future and for undermining national interests.
On September 29, 2018, British Prime Minister Teresa May came to a Conservative Party in Birmingham, Britain.
In another interview, which took place next to Teresa's interview on the first page of the paper, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson criticized her so-called "Checkers Plan" by Brexit, saying that to propose Britain and the EU to impose the charges on each other "indisputably absurd".
Who shot Wade Sims: The police arrested Dayton Simpson for suspicion of the death of a player at Louisiana State University
The police arrested a suspect in a shooting that led to the death of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player from Louisiana State University.
20-year-old Dayton Simpson was arrested and sent to prison for the second-degree murder charge, declared in the Baton-Ruz police department.
The authorities published a video of the conflict between Sims and Simpson, and the police said that Sims had lost his glasses during the fight.
According to an affiliated CBS TV channel WAFB, the police removed glasses from the crime scene and noted that they had found Simpson’s DNA.
After asking Simpson, the police reported that he confessed that he had shot Wade.
According to the lawyer, he was assigned a deposit of $350,000.
The East-Bonton-Russia coroner's office published a previous report on Friday, stating that death is the cause of a fire wound to the head and neck.
The Department expresses its appreciation for the special department for the search for Louisiana State Police, the State Police Criminal Laboratory, the South University Police, and local citizens for the assistance of the investigation that has led to the arrest.
The sports director of the University of Louisiana Jo Alleva thanked local law enforcement authorities for “old age and desire for justice”.
Samsu was 20 years old.
A 198 cm growth for Forvard grew up in Baton-Ruz, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at Louisiana State University.
In the past season, the average score was 5.6 points and 2.6 sets.
On Friday morning, a basketball coach at the University of Louisiana Will Wade said the team was "depleted" and "shocked" by Wade's death.
"This is what worries you all the time," Wade said.
The volcano throws ash into Mexico
Popocatepetl, a dusty volcano, reached the southern regions of Mexico City.
The National Disaster Warning Center on Saturday called on Mexicans to stay away from the volcano, since there was activity on the floor and 183 gas and ashes were recorded in 24 hours.
The center was followed by numerous noises and currents.
The pictures on social media show fine layers of ash on the lobbying of cars in Mexico’s neighborhoods, such as Quimilko.
Geophysics have observed an increase in the activity of the volcano at 45 miles (72 km) south-east of the capital, after an earthquake of 7.1 dances in central Mexico in September 2017.
Vulcan, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police met with Catalan separatists the previous year's vote for independence
Six men were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after the protestors who came out for independence met with a special police department, and thousands of people joined protestors' demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's vote on the division.
The proseparatist group in the masks held by the specials threw them into the eggs and powder, creating dark dust clouds on the streets that usually filled with tourists.
The clashes took place and later that day, the police used their thumbs to stop the aggression.
In a few hours, a group of independence supporters who were scandalous, "Don't forget, we won't forgive!" met with supporters of the country's preservation, who shouted, "Hai lives Spain!"
According to the local press, fourteen people were helped to cope with the mild injuries they suffered during the protests.
A year after the October 1st referendum, recognized by Madrid as illegal but marked by Catalan separatists, the tension in the region that wants independence remains high.
The electorate decided largely to vote for independence, but the appearance was low, since the majority of those who opposed the division were voting.
According to the Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in violent clashes last year as a result of police efforts to stop voting at polling stations throughout the region.
Independence groups spent the night in tents on Friday to prevent demonstrations in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place, but it was forced to take another route.
68-year-old Narsis Termes, an electrician who took part in a separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer had any hope that Catalonia could gain independence.
"Last year we experienced one of our best moments.
I watched my parents cry out with joy that they can vote, but now we're going to the deaf corner," he said.
Despite the important but very difficult victory of the regional elections in December last year, the Catalan parties, which stand for independence, were unable to preserve the momentum of this year, because many of their most well-known leaders are in voluntary expulsion or imprisonment for their participation in the referendum and further declaration of independence.
Hoan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who took a protest on the support of the police on the phone, said that the conflict was caused by politicians on both sides.
“Treatment is increasing, ” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Hunkeras, one of the nine Catalan leaders, who are in the wake of the isolation of last year's end, announced that the next year he will be on his way to the European Parliament.
"The status of a candidate in the European elections is the best way to condemn the regression of democratic values and repression that we see from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: The men were arrested after the car went into the house.
Three men at the age of 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after the car drove home several times in London.
The incident occurred at Ballinagard-Crescent on Thursday at 7:30 p.m. in British standard time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blammings noticed that the door was damaged and the house itself.
At some point in time, the car was fired from the arabeleta.
Mangy's strike won the Lionstone over Rangers with an account 1-0.
The first goal of the Dolly Menge in the Lowington compound became the winner
Raised in Lowington, he surprised Rangers and brought Stephen Gerard's second 18-game defeat as Ibrock's club manager.
The Dolly Menge hit proved crucial: Harry Holt's command rose to one level per second from "Hibernian".
The Gerard team won no victory at the premiere of this season, and the next week, it's playing with the Harts leaders, from which it stays at eight points.
Before that, the Rangers will accept Rapid Vienna as part of the League of Europe.
Meanwhile, Lowington continues his invincible walk to six games in the division, and Chief Coach Holt has not yet won the defeat since Kenny Miller was replaced last month.
Lowingston misses the chances of unhappiness.
The Holt team was supposed to be ahead of them long before they were killed, because their straightness creates Rangers all the problems.
Scott Robinson broke through the defense, but he struck along the gate, and then Alan Litgou went through the door after he rebelled and accepted Craig Halket's strike along the door that he had made his head.
The masters were satisfied that they allowed Rangers to play in front of them, and they knew that they could cause problems for guests from their standard position.
A decisive target was killed.
Rangers missed a free shot, and Lowington made the opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson took over Manga, who took the ball and killed it from the police station.
By this time, Rangers had been dominated by the power of the ball, but the protection of the housewives had proved to be unbreakable for them and Liam Kelly's doorkeeper was largely unwarranted.
This trend continued in the second time, although Alfredo Morelos was able to hit Kelly.
Scott Pittman's hit was the football player, Allan McGregor, who hit Litgou by the door in another standard combination of Lvivington.
The Navis regularly flew into Lvivington and were constantly neutralized, and two applications at the station — after the attack by Halckett on Glenn Midlton — were rejected.
Lowington: analysis
Alsdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Toni Makaroni Arena Stadium
This is a great game and the result of Lvivington.
They all played a great deal, and they continued to surpass expectations on this high-end trail.
Their style of game and composition has not changed virtually after returning to the highest level, but must be given to Holt for how he mobilized the team after his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett played tremendously, organized very well, and Menga forced Connor Goldson and Joe Warral to keep on the watch.
Rangers, however, had no inspiration.
They used to play very well under the direction of Gerard, but now they are not very much drawn to those standards.
They didn't have the last ball -- only once they broke the housekeepers' defense -- and that was something like the Rangers Awakening, which was in the middle of the table.
Erdoğana received in a number of different ways in Kella
On Saturday (September 29th), when Turkish and German leaders met in Berlin, there was a smile and a blue sky.
This is the last day of a controversial visit by President Erdogan to Germany to restore relations between NATO allies.
Among them were some disputes about human rights, the freedom of the press, and the accession of Turkey to the EU.
Then Erdogan went to Kelno to open up a huge new sword.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police did not allow 25,000 people to meet in front of the mosque, but many of the President's supporters came close to see him.
Hundreds of Protestants against Erdoğan — many Kurds among them — also made themselves heard, condemning the politician Erdoğan and the German government’s decision to invite him to the country.
Bilateral protests testify to the inconsistency of the guest, which some German Turks called a hero and others as a dictator.
Road accident in Depford: The biker died in a car crash
The bike driver died in a car crash in London.
Avarya happened near the crossroads of Bejudd Street and Evelyn Street on a live road in the district of Deptford in the south-east of the city about 10:15 a.m. after the British standard time.
The car stopped, and the paramedics arrived at the scene, but the man died.
This accident took place a few months after another biker died after the driver escaped from the apartment at Childers Street, about 1.6 km from the accident on Saturday.
The London police said that they were working on establishing a man to inform his closest relatives.
Bus routes are also banned, and drivers are recommended to avoid this area.
Long-Lartin Prison: Six Prisoners Imprisoned in Incest
Six prison staff were injured as a result of a man's incarceration, the prison administration reported.
The excitement of her Majesty's Long-Lartin prison in Woostershire began at around 09:30 a.m. on Sunday and still persists.
The special section of "Tornado" was called for to stop the movement, initiated by eight prisoners and located in one wing.
The officers were provided with medical assistance in connection with light facial traumas received at the scene.
The prison representative commented: "For the trial of the incident in her Long-Lartin Majesty's prison, specially trained prison personnel have been involved.
Six employees received medical assistance in connection with injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we make it clear that those responsible will be sent to the police and the bars of their refuge behind the fence can be subjected."
Her Majesty's Long-Lartin prison has more than 500 prisoners, including the most dangerous offenders in the country.
In June, it was reported that the jailer was sent to the station after the prisoner's attack.
In October last year, a special police department was called into prison to stop serious disturbances in which prisoners were attacked with billiards.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenician, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City with olive groves.
Tropical depression rarely strikes Arizona, but this may happen at the beginning of next week, since the remains of the hurricane of Rosa are heading south west of the desert, creating the risk of floodwaters.
The National Weather Service has already issued a warning of the rainy rains on Monday and Tuesday in the territory from West Arizona to South and East Nevada, South-East California and Uti, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rose is expected to go straight through Phoenix on Tuesday, and Monday night will be rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted in Twitter that only ten tropical cyclones have saved the status of a tropical storm or depression within 200 miles (322 km) from Phoenix since 1950.
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles (64.4 km) of Arizona.
According to the latest forecasts of the National Hurricane Centre, in the Mogollon-Rim region in Arizona, it is estimated that between 5.08 and 10.16 cm and 15.24 cm of waste.
Other areas of the southwest of the desert, including the central part of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, are probably getting from 2.54 to 5.08 cm of waste, with places up to 10.16 cm.
Where there is no risk of drought, the rain of Rosie may be a blessing because the region suffers from drought.
Although floodwaters are a very serious problem, some of these angers will probably be useful because the south-west is now experiencing drought.
According to the American Dry Monitor, some 40 percent of Arizona’s territory suffers at least from extreme drought, which is the second highest category of drought, reports weather.com.
First of all, the path of Hurricane Rosa leads to a shift in the Mexican peninsula of Lower California.
Rosa, on Sunday morning, still in force with a maximum wind speed of 137 km per hour, is 620 km south of Punta-Evgenia, Mexico, and moves north at 19.3 km per hour.
Storms meet with colder water in the Pacific and thus weaken.
Thus, the tropical storm is expected to cause a drought in Mexico during the day or in the evening.
The number of wastes in some parts of Mexico may be significant, creating a significant risk of floods.
"It is expected that the total number of wastes from the Lower California to the north-west Sonora will be 7.62 to 15.24 cm, possibly up to 25.4 cm," reports weather.com.
Then Rosa will go north through Mexico as a tropical storm, reach the border of Arizona early in the morning as a tropical depression that will continue through Arizona and arrive late at midnight at South Uta.
"The main danger expected of Rosa or her remains is very strong rains in southern California, the north-west Sonora and in the south-west of the American desert," reports the National Hurricane Centre.
It is expected that these rains will lead to life - threatening floods and waste streams in the deserts as well as droughts in the mountainous region.
Midsomer Norton's attack: four men were arrested who were intent on murder.
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested for suspecting murder after they found a 16-year-old boy with a knife wound.
The early teenager was found in the Excleratory Terras area in Midsomer Norton about 4:00 a.m. on the British standard time on Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital where he remained stable.
17-year-old, two 18-year-old and 20-year-old man were arrested at night in the Radstock area, police reported on Evin and Sommerset.
The cops are asking to answer everyone who can have any video of these events on the phone.
Tramp says that Kawano's "tolerance and anger" of the Democratic Party
"The vote for Judge Kawano is a vote against the ruthless and offensive tactics of the Democratic Party," Tromp said at a meeting in Wilingu, West Virginia.
Tramp said that Kawano had been "suffering and angry" by the Democratic Party during the entire hanging process.
Cavano witnessed to the Congress on Thursday, indiscriminately and emotionally, denying the charge of Christine Blaze Ford that he had committed sexual violence against her several decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also gave a witness at the hearing of the accused.
On Saturday, the president stated that on that day, “the American people saw the brightness, the nature and the courage” of Kawano.
"The vote for the Kawano judge is a vote for one of the most advanced lawyers of our time, a lawyer with an inexhaustible experience in government service," he said to a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president took note of the release of Kawano when he spoke of the importance of the Republican populace in the Middle East elections.
"In five weeks, one of the most important choices in our lives will take place.
I’m not running, but I’m really running, ” he said. —
That's why I fight for great candidates everywhere."
Tramp claimed that the democratic mission was “to resist and prevent. ”
It is expected that the first key procedural vote in the Senate on the Kawano candidacy will take place not later than Friday, a CNN assistant from one of the Republican leaders reported.
Hundreds of people died from earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia, the number of victims increased
At least 384 people died, many lost their lives in the ocean when the giant waves crashed on the beach as a result of intense earthquakes and tsunamis on the Indonesian island of Sulavesi, the country’s government declared on Saturday.
Hundreds of people were resting at a beach festival in Pala on Friday, when waves up to six meters (18 feet) in the woods fell on the shore, killing many to death and destroying everything on their way.
The tsunamis took place after the earthquake by 7.5 degrees Fahrenheit [7.5 ° C].
"When the tsunami was threatened yesterday, people were still doing their own business on the beach and they didn't run away right away, and they became victims," said at a briefing in Jakarta Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, a representative of the Indonesian disaster relief agency (BNPB).
"It wasn't just tsunamis, it was moving cars, trees, buildings, it hit everything that was on the dry," Nugroho said, adding that before hitting the beach line, the tsunamis went through the open sea at 800 km/h (497 miles/h).
To get rid of the tsunamis, some people went into the trees and survived, he added.
Nearly 16,700 persons were evacuated to 24 centers in Pala.
The aerophotos published by the disaster relief agency show that many buildings and stores are destroyed, bridges destroyed and destroyed, and seabed surrounded by water.
The traffic in the coastal city continued on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes occurred in an area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) stated that the energy emitted by a severe earthquake on Friday was 200 times greater than the energy of the nuclear bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geographical location of the city at the end of the long, narrow bay could contribute to the force of the tsunami, the agency stated.
Nugroho called the “wide - scale” loss and noted that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers, and hotels were destroyed.
The bodies of some victims were found under broken buildings, he said, adding that 540 were injured and 29 were missing without a message.
Nugroho noted that the victims and damage could be greater than 300 km (190 miles) along the coast line north of Pala in the area called Dongala, which is closer to the quake.
"The lines of communication were completely damaged, and we didn't get any information," said Nugroho.
More than 300,000 people live there, said the Red Cross, as well as his staff and volunteers have gone to the affected areas.
“ It’s a tragedy, but it can get much bigger, ” the report said.
On Saturday, the agency received broad criticism that it had not reported that the tsunami had hit Paul, although officials said that the waves had come at the time indicated in the warning.
In the amateur frames that people shared in social networks, it is evident that a man on the top of the building calls for a mad warning of the approaching tsunamis of people on the street under the building.
After a few minutes, the wall of the water was cut to the shore, taking with it buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to verify the reality of the cameras immediately.
The earthquakes and tsunamis have caused a serious power failure, which has disrupted connections around Paul, which has made it difficult to coordinate rescue operations.
Military personnel began to send cargo from Jakarta and other cities, the authorities reported, but evacuated people still need food and other necessities.
The city’s airport has only been opened to help, and it will be closed by October.
President Joco Weidodo was to visit the evacuation centres in Pala on Sunday.
The number of tsunami deaths in Indonesia is over 800.
It's very bad.
The world Vision of Donggali’s co-workers arrived well into the city of Pala, where they are hiding in the court of their office, but along the way they saw the scenes of desolation, said Mr. Doseb.
"They told me they saw many ruined buildings," he said.
It's very bad.
Even when relief groups began to take decisive action to eliminate the consequences of the disaster, some complained that workers of foreign humanitarian aid with great experience would not be allowed to go to Paul.
According to Indonesian rules, funding, supply and provision of personnel abroad can only start if the disaster area is declared a national disaster zone.
This hasn't happened yet.
“ It is still a disaster at the province level, ” noted Aulia Arriani, a representative of the Indonesian Red Cross.
As soon as the government says, "Okay, it's a national disaster," we can accept international help, but this status until it's given."
It was the second night after the Friday earthquake and tsunami, and the friends and families of those who had not yet found it were still hoping that the appearance of their loved ones would become a miracle that would adorn these clouds to cover natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was taken from the sewer.
On Sunday, the rescuers got a woman who was lying under a stone for two days with her mother’s body next to her.
Hendon Subandono, a coach of the Indonesian national team of paraplanarism, trained two missing paraplanners to participate in the Asian games that had taken place earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other paraplanetists who had fallen into a trap at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his disciples.
"As an elder in the field of paraplanarism, I have my emotional burden," he said.
Mr. Hendon relates how a few hours after news of the destruction of the Roa Roa Hotel, which spread among the paraplanetary community, he sent a message desperately about whatsapp opponents of Paul who took part in the beach festival.
However, his messages were marked only by one gray branch, not by a double blue branch.
"I think that means that the messages were not delivered," he said.
The thief took $26,750 while filling in the ATM at Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, the thief stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who ran a ATM at Newport on the Levee, reports the Newport Police Department's news.
The car driver emptied the ATM in the entertaining complex and was about to add more money, wrote Detective Dennis McCarty in the news.
While he was busy, another man “runs behind the Brink employee” and stole a bag of money to fill.
The Witnesses noticed a number of suspects fleeing from the scene of the crime, but the police did not indicate the number of participants.
Anyone who has information about these people should contact the Newport police number 859-292-3680.
West Canyon: rapper changes its name to E
Reper Kanye West changes his name to E.
On Saturday, he announced a change to Twitter, and he wrote: “It was previously officially known as Kanya West. ”
41-year-old Westa was sometimes called E, and he used this shortcut as a name for his album released in June.
The change took place the morning before his appearance at the Saturday Night Live show, where he was expected to present his new Yandhi album.
On the show, he replaces the singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled her participation because of the “emotional reasons”, the show's author said.
This is not just a summary of the current professional name, West used to say that this word has a religious meaning for it.
"I believe that "is" is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means "you," said West early this year, discussing the name of his album with a radio-leading Big-Boy.
So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
The canyon, which means "one", has been shortened to just E, it's just a reflection of our good, our bad, our confused, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are."
The canyon is one of several famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs, formerly known as Paff Deedi, P. Deedi and Deedi, announced this year that he had chosen the name Lav and Braser Lew.
A former Westa colleague, JEY-ZY, also experimented with defies and large letters.
Mexico President Andres Manuel Lopes Obrador promises not to use the army against civilians
The newly elected President of Mexico, Andres Manuel Lopes Obrador, promised never to use an army against civilians.
On Saturday, Lopes Obador promised “never to use an army to oppress the Mexican people”.
On October 2, 1968, the military shot a peaceful demonstration in the field, killing about 300 people, and the entire Latin American movement began to be formed.
Lopes Obrador promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly grants to the learners and opening up more expensive state universities.
He noted that unemployment and lack of opportunities for education lead young people to criminal groups.
U.S. should double funding in the field of artificial intelligence
Since China is increasing activity in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States should double the amount they spend on research in this area, consider an investor and practice in the area of the Shi Kai-Fu Lee, which was working on Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These comments were made after various parts of the U.S. government made statements about the CIA, although there is no formal strategy in the U.S. area.
Among other things, China presented its plan last year: it wants to become No. 1 for innovations in the area of HIV by 2030.
"The appropriate research budget for the SH would be a good start, considering that all other countries are far away from the United States, and we are preparing for the next break in the SH," said Lee.
Double funding can double the probability that the next major achievement in the area of S.H.I. will be made in the United States, Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book "The States of China: The Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the Director General of the Synovation Ventures Foundation, which invested in Face++, one of the most famous companies in China.
In the 1980s, he worked at the University of Carnegie-Mellon on the S.I. system, which played the best American player in the Otello, and later was the executive director of Microsoft Research and the president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee noticed previous advances in technology from the U.S. government, such as the Robotics Challenge Agency's front defence research projects (DARPA), and asked when the next will be available to help identify future prospective participants.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to win government grants, Li said.
"It's not China taking academic leaders, it's corporations," he remarked.
Facebook, Google, and other technology companies in recent years have been hiring lights from universities to work on HIV.
According to Lee, changes in immigration policy can also help the United States to increase its efforts in the area of HIV.
"I think Green Card should be offered automatically to students in the field of science in the area of S.I.," he said.
The National Council of China published its Plan for the Development of the artificial intelligence of a new generation in July 2017.
The National Natural Science Fund provides funding to individuals working in academic institutions, just as the National Science Fund and other US government agencies distribute money to American researchers, including the quality of academic work in China below, Li says.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Ministry of Defence set up a Joint Art Intelligence Centre, which aims to involve partners from industry and academic circles, and the White House announced the creation of a Special Art Intelligence Committee.
Also this month, DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in the AI Next initiative.
With regard to the National Scientific Foundation, he now invests in the survey of over $100 million a year.
Among other things, the U.S. legislative authority, who wanted to create the Commission with national security of artificial intelligence, did not take any steps for several months.
Macedonians vote on a referendum to change the name of the country
The people of Macedonia voted on Sunday in a referendum on whether to change the name of the country to "the Republic of North Macedonia", which would allow for a long-term dispute with Greece, which blocked Macedonia's possibility of membership in the EU and NATO.
Greece, whose province is known as Macedonia, asserts that the name of the northern neighbor is a claim on its territory, and has put a veto on Macedonia's accession to NATO and the EU.
In June, two governments made a deal based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents of the agreement claim that this change undermines the ethnic identity of the Slovak majority in Macedonia.
President George Ivanov said he would not vote on the referendum, and because of the campaign of the boycott, there are doubts as to whether a minimum of 50% voters would be able to see the referendum as effective.
The question in the referendum is: "Do you support NATO and the EU membership in terms of acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
The name changers, including Prime Minister Zoran Zayev, claim that this is the price Macedonia, one of the countries created after the collapse of Yugoslavia, should pay for the intervention of bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"I have come today to vote for the future country, for the young of Macedonia, so that she can live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us," said 79-year-old Oller Georgievska in Skopje.
Although the outcome of the vote is not legally binding, enough Members of Parliament have stated that they support it in order to make it decisive.
To change the name, two thirds of Parliament will be required.
The State Election Commission stated that by 13:00 a.m., there were no reports of violations.
However, only 16% compared to 34% in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of registered voters threw their ballots into the poll.
"I came to vote for my children, our place in Europe," said 62-year-old Chose Tanevski in Skopje capital.
On September 30, 2018, in Strumica, Macedonia, Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zayev, his wife Zorica and his son Duško gave their vote in a referendum on the change of name of the country, which will open the way for accession to NATO and the European Union.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Volodymir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage and placed chairs in front of the tents organized by those who would boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to come there with pride, not through the service door," Kavardrakov said.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can address others, such as China and Russia, and become part of European-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev believes that NATO membership will bring much needed investment in Macedonia, where unemployment is more than 20%.
"I believe that the majority vote because more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zayev said after the vote.
He noted that the result of “yes ” would be confirmation of their future.
According to a poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Political Research, 30 to 43 percent of voters will participate in the referendum, which is the most necessary event.
According to another survey conducted by the Macedonian Tele canal Telma, 57% of respondents are scheduled to vote on Sunday.
70 per cent of them said they would vote for it.
In order for the referendum to be effective, the appearance should be 50% plus one vote.
The defeat at the referendum will be the first serious blow to the policy of the Western government from the start of its work in May last year.
Look, Sergio Aguaro from Manchester City is going through all of Brayton's defenses and is killing the goal.
Serchio Aguero and Rahim Sterling went to the Bryton defense and brought Manchester City victory with a 2-0 on Saturday at the Etihhad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Hall Aguaro at the 65th minute of the match looked ridiculously simple.
The Argentine attacker received a dog at the center of the field at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran between the three Bryton defenders and found himself in the open field.
Then Aguero realized that he was surrounded by four greens.
He went to one of the defenders, and then he ran a few more to the end of Briton's fine.
He then made the dog left when he saw Sterling.
The English Forward made the first touch on the fine to give Aguero a ball, which with his right butt turned it into the right part of the gate, defeating the Bryton Galliper, Matthew Ryan.
"Aguero has some leg problems," said the reporters of the City Manager Pep Gardiol.
We agreed that he would play 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We're lucky he killed a goal right now."
But the initial advantage of the blue sky in this premier-legged masquerade has secured Sterling.
This goal took place in 29 minutes.
Aguero got a ball deep in Briton.
He sent a beautiful passing dog along the left flank of Leroy Sane.
Leroy made a few dots, and he continued to make Sterling’s dog in the direction of the distance.
The sky-blue foreman threw a ball in the door just before he went outside.
"Citi" will meet with Hoffenheim in the group stage of the League of Championships at 12:55 on Tuesday at the Rain-Neckar-Arena Stadium in Zinsheim, Germany.
Shercer wants to pick up the dots in Rokys
Since Washington Nassionals was out of playoff, there were no major reasons to wait for a turn-off.
But Shercer's tendency to compete is to go out to the Pitcher mountain on Sunday in a fight against Colorado Rockys, provided that Rokys is still in trouble with going out to playoffs. Now Rokys is on one of the front games of Los Angeles Dodgers in the West National League.
Rokys has at least the Wild Card for winning with an account 5-2 over Nashionals on Friday night, but they still want to strengthen the title of the first division.
"Despite the fact that we play for nothing, at least we can leave the ball, knowing how the viewers here in Denver are doing, and the other team will probably play at the highest level that I've seen all this year.
Why would I not want to participate in this contest?
"Nashionals" is still saying who's going to be the first painter on Sunday, but it's reported that they're moving to what it's going to be Shercer.
The Shercer, for which this is going to be the 34th start, took place at a pizza session on Thursday and could play on Sunday, it usually comes out.
Washington's right has a result of 18-7 out of 2.53 ERA and 300 slots in 220 2/3 inches this season.
Trompings in West Virginia
The president boldly mentioned the situation around his candidate to the Supreme Court of Brett Cavano when he spoke of the importance of the presence of Republican supporters in the Middle East elections.
"All we've done will be put on the map in November.
Five weeks later, one of the most important choices in our lives will take place.
It's one of the big, big ones — I'm not running, but I'm really running, so wherever I can, I'm fighting for great candidates," he said.
Trump continued: "You see this terrible, terrible radical group of democrats, you see what's happening right now.
And they're firmly set up to restore power, using any means you see vanity, greed.
They don’t care who suffers from them, who needs to be violated to gain power and control, they want power and control, we don’t want to give them.”
The mission of democracy, according to him, "resist and prevent."
"And you see this for the last four days," he said, calling the democracies "evil and vile, ugly and false."
He mentioned the Senate Judicial Committee, calling Senator Diane Finnstein, on behalf of the audience, to raise the voices of discontent.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you get the document?
Well, that's it.
No, uh, no, I'm waiting -- it was really bad body language -- the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Laborist party is no longer a large church.
It is intolerant to those who express their opinion.
When the Momentum activists in my local party voted in favour of condemning me, it almost turned out to be a surprise.
Finally, I'm the last of the Parliament's lobbyists who have been told they're not happy, and that's all because we're expressing our opinion.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was almost the same because she strongly opposed antisemitism.
I was convicted for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbin.
As for the importance of responsible economic policy, for national security, for Europe, these issues are ironically similar to those that Jeremy did not agree with earlier leaders.
The report on the Nottingham East lobby meeting said on Friday: "We want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
Most of the Friday evening meetings of the General Committee in my eight-year-old capacity as a local member of the Parliament were the same.
Unfortunately, today many meetings have a very different tone, and the promise of a "more kind, softer" policy has long been forgotten if it has been started to be implemented.
It becomes increasingly evident that the Labour Party does not allow different views and that every opinion is appreciated by the position it is acceptable for the party's leadership.
This started shortly after Jeremy became a leader, and colleagues, who, as I once thought, had similar political views, began to expect me to turn 180 degrees and accept the position I would never agree with, whether it was national security or the only EU market.
Whenever I speak in public — and it doesn't matter what I say — this is followed by a series of social network attacks called for, a central policy conviction, and I'm told that I shouldn't be in the Leborist Party.
And that's not just my experience.
I know that I've been happier than some of my colleagues, because I've usually had political comments.
I am attracted to the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face the daily stream of sexual or racist attacks, but they never give up.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is that levels of abuse have become a norm.
Jeremy Corbin said last week that the Leborist Party should cultivate a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we're no longer such a broad church, and with every movement of "untrusted" or change of party selection rules, it's connected.
Over the last two years, I have received much advice, and I have been asked not to speak, not to speak so loudly, so that “everything is fine”.
But I didn't get involved in politics.
I joined the Laborists 32 years ago, because because because of the lack of attention on the part of the government of Tetcher, my class in high school has been literally distracted, since then I have been trying to improve the quality of government services for those who need it most, whether it's a local councillor or a government minister.
I never hid my politics, including in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East was concerned about my political views and differences with today’s leadership.
For those who have contributed to Friday's events, I just want to say one thing: on the condition that the country moves towards Brexit, which will harm households, businesses and government services, I don't understand the desire to spend time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Laborist Party.
In fact, I have another message, but not for the Nottingham "Momentum," but for my voters, both members of the Leborist Party, and not for me: I am proud of what I serve you, and I promise that there is no danger of calling me back and no political advantage will make me act according to what I consider to be the best interests of all of you.

"Eir" 38 - 17 "Melrose": Undeserved "Eir" climbs up
The last two attempts, perhaps, were somewhat distorted by the outcome, but, no doubt, the Air won the triumph in today's great fun match of the Premierschip of Scotland.
Now they're heading the table, it's the only unbeatable team of ten.
Finally, a fine defense and an improved ability to use the opportunity gives Peter Merci’s hosts and coaches the full right to be satisfied.
"We've been trying our games today, and we're still unattainable, so I have to be satisfied," he said.
Robin Christie from Melrose commented: "I see the right "Eyre," they'd better use the odds than we do."
Grant Anderson's attempt at 14 minutes, realized by Frasier Clemo, led by Air, but a yellow card for Scottish Captain Rory Guez, published by Verriers, allowed Melrose to show the figures, and Jason Baggot used an unrealized attempt.
Klimo strengthened the Air leadership by using the Penalties and immediately before the break, made and implemented the solo test, which gave the 17-5 account for the Air.
But Melrose had a good start with the second time, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, which was realized by Baggot, reduced the gap to five points.
Then there was a delay due to the serious trauma of Ruarid Knott, which was taken out of the field on his nose, and from the Eir restaurant, they went ahead by trying Stafford McDawell, who was implemented by Clemo.
Captain "Eir" Blair Mcferson then had a yellow card, and once again "Melrose" forced another player to pay for the unrealized attempt by Bruce Colvin under intense pressure.
The masters returned, but when Stroan Hatchinson got a yellow card for the clip without a ball from the criminal scene line, McFerson made a tatdown behind the "Eir."
Klimo did the experiment he did almost every time after the restaurant, then Kyle Row got a hit from David Armstrong in the box and sent Gregor Henry to the fifth test of the master's team.
It looks like a whole new career star in the restaurant area.
It looks like the Ford Kiran's "all play" series star is set up for a new guest career, and this conclusion can be made after it has become known that he is the director of a licensed restaurant company.
A 56-year-old actor, Jack Jarvis, is playing in a popular BBC television series, a script he writes about, and in which he is filmed with a former comedy partner, Greg Hemfil.
Duet announced that the future nine series would be the last in the series, and it seems that Kirnan is planning a life after Craigling.
According to the official record, he is the director of Agrindingmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on this story, although the source in the Scottish Sun suggested that Kirnan wants to enter the glazing restaurant business.
"Our sea," interior camera Bolivia hopes the court will open its way to the Pacific
Marines are patrolling an armed fleet headquarters in La Pasi.
Public buildings hang the ocean blue flag.
Sea bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are painted by a poem: “Ours is right.
We have to get him back."
In Bolivia, which does not have an exit to the sea, there is still a memory of the loss of a coast line that has left Chile in the 19th century's curved conflict through natural resources, and there is also a desire to sail again in the Pacific.
These hopes are probably the strongest in recent decades because Bolivia is waiting for an international court ruling on October 1st after five years of trial.
"In Bolivia there is a impulse, there is a spirit of unity and peace and, of course, it expects a positive result," commented Roberto Calsadia, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many of the ills will observe the announcement of an ICU decision on large screens throughout the country, and they expect the Hague tribunal to take a decision for Bolivia that, after decades of Chile's dialogue, will force negotiations on Bolivia's sovereign exit to the sea.
Here Morales, the charismatic president of Bolivia, who faced opposition to his conversion the following year, also puts great hope in a decision announced on Monday.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court will hardly make a decision for Bolivia, and if that happens, there will be little change.
The United Nations body based in the Netherlands has no authority to condemn the territory of Chile and has noted that it will not determine the outcome of the negotiations.
The decision taken only six months after the final arguments were made indicates that the case was "not complicated", said Pas Zarate, a Chilean expert from international law.
Bolivia's case has not been resolved, and the last four years have been able to make it back.
“Requiring access to the sea was used by the current Bolivian administration,” Zarrate said.
The military rhetoricist Morales subverted the rest of Chile’s kindness, and she admitted.
Bolivia and Chile will continue the dialogue at some point, but then it will be very difficult to discuss.
Two countries have not been exchanged since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltz, a representative of Bolivia in the Hague, disagreed with the fact that the court’s approval was unusually rapid.
On Monday, Bolivia will be given “an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations from Chile and the opportunity to end 139 years of differences with a mutual advantage, ” he said.
Calsadia also denied that Morales, another of the most popular presidents of Latin America, used the maritime issue as a political force.
“ Bolivia will never deny its right to access the Pacific, ” he added.
This decision is an opportunity to see that we have to leave the past behind."
North Korea says nuclear weapons won't be safe if it can't trust the United States.
Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea, R. Yong Ho, says that his country will never give up its nuclear weapon first before it can trust Washington.
Rí spoke on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to fulfill the promises made at the summit in Singapore by the leaders of the rival countries.
His comments appeared when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompey appears to be on the threshold of relaunching nuclear diplomacy, which entered a deaf corner more than three months after the Singapore summit with Kim Chen In.
Ri says that the belief that the continuation of sanctions and the U.S. declaration of the end of the Korean War will once put North Korea on its knees is a “inconvenient dream. ”
Washington is afraid to adopt a declaration before the Pyrenees take significant steps towards disarmament.
Kim and American President Donald Tramp want a second date.
But there is widespread skepticism that the Pyrenees take seriously the rejection of their arsenal, which the country probably considers to be the only way to guarantee their safety.
Pompey plans to visit Pyrenees next month to prepare for the second summit between Kim and Trump.
In the Paris fashion shows, the latest trend of massive main costumes is on the main streets of your city.
If you want to increase your collection of hats or completely hide from the sun, you've found what you need.
The designers Valentino and Tom Brown have demonstrated a number of eccentric main outfits in the summer - summer 2019 collection in the segments of the brilliant Paris weekly fashion.
Very unpracticed chapels have filled the Instagram of this summer, and so - called designers have already sent out their memorable creations beyond the horizon.
Valentino saw an extravagance of a runaway hat with wide beautified feathers that covered the heads of the models.
Among other accessories are decorated with precious brown stone, chaplain hats and even hats-anas, but they're not to keep their head warm.
Tom Brown also demonstrated an assortment of original masks — very early in front of Halloween.
Many of these different color masks had protected lips and reminded Hannibal Lecter more of them than of a high fashion.
One creature reminded the underwater navigational equipment with the tube and the glasses, another looked like a frozen rice that fell.
And if you support this serious fashion application, you're lucky.
The stylists say that huge hats can go out on the main streets of your city.
Overseas hats came into the mode by Le Bombie, a solo hat with a width of 60 centimeters that they saw on all: from Ryan to Emily Ratajkovsky.
A cultural brand standing behind a very impractical hat that could be seen everywhere in social networks gave peace another creation: a salty beach bag of almost the size of a model in the bathroom that carried it.
The sum of the yellow-red raffia with a raffia bacrum and a white leather handle was the central element of the La Riviera Spring summer summer 2019 brand Jacquemus in Paris's weekly fashions.
Familiarist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "The next summer, I expect to see large hats and beach bags on the main streets of the city, because the influence of the designer is so huge that it will be difficult to ignore demand for over-exhaustion".
John Edward: Knowledge of the Language Mandatory for the People of the World
Independent schools in Scotland support high standards of education, and in 2018 the results of studies that complement individual and collective success in sports, art, music, and other fields were re-established.
These schools, where more than 30,000 students are taught throughout Scotland, are represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SHRS), and they want to provide the best level of service for students and their parents.
Independent schools are intended to prepare students for the further and higher education they have chosen to pursue, as well as to make them the citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can develop and implement an individual school program, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable subject for choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: “If you talk to a person’s language that he understands, he understands it with his mind.
If you speak to her in her native language, she will take it to heart. ”
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot use only English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the recent results of this year’s studies, we see that in independent schools, languages are led by the best - rated ratings.
In general, 68 percent of students who studied foreign languages received higher A.
Data gathered at 74 SRNS schools showed that 72% of students received higher A from China and 72% of German students, 69% of French students, and 63% of Spanish students also received A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland view foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will no doubt need in the future.
Language as an object of choice is now presented in the same way as NTIM (scientific, technical, engineering, and mathematics), in independent school programs and in other institutions.
A survey carried out by the British Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 showed that 17% of the reasons why employers cannot close vacancies related to the lack of language skills.
Thus, language skills become increasingly necessary in the preparation of young people for future careers.
Since more and more prospective positions are needed, these skills are needed in a globalized world.
No matter what career you choose, if someone learns another language, he's going to have a real advantage in the future, because it's a lifelong lesson.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives a person who has several languages an advantage over competitors.
According to a survey by YouGov, conducted among over 4,000 adults in Britain in 2013, 75% could not speak foreign language well enough to support the conversation, and the French is the only language spoken by a double percent (15%).
That is why investment in language teaching is now important to modern - day children.
Knowledge in a number of languages, especially in developing countries, will give children more opportunities to find full - time jobs.
In Scotland, each school will study its language.
A number of schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered the most important for Britain from the perspective of 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
Regardless of your child’s interests in independent schools, you can always choose a number of languages to study them with qualified teachers.
Scotland’s independent schools try to create an educational environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills needed to achieve success regardless of what the future holds.
We cannot now deny that in the international business environment languages continue to have a vital role to play in the future country, so it must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should really be regarded as “the skills of international communication. ”
Independent schools will continue to give this choice, variety, and perfection to the Scottish youth.
It's a good thing to do.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish School for Independent Schools
Lebron debuts from Lakers in San Diego.
Fans who want to see the first start of Libron James for Los Angeles Lakers almost waited.
Lakers Coach Luke Walton announced that James would play Sunday in the first preseason match against Denver Nagets in San Diego.
How many minutes he'll play, it's not decided yet.
"It's going to be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on Lakers' official website.
The Lakers reporter, Mike Trudell, announced that James would play a limited number of minutes rather than anything.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for six preseason games of Lakers.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need preseason games," he answered.
Trumpetings in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Tramp today launches a series of pre-election meetings in the city of Willing, West Virginia.
This is the first of the five scheduled for the next week's Tramp meetings, including meetings in friendly, configured states, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
The final vote for the candidacy offered by him to the Supreme Court is postponed, and Trump wishes to form support for the future Middle East elections, as the Republicans risk losing control of the Congress after the November vote.
What time is it going to be today's evening meeting of Trump in West Virginia, and how to look at him on the Internet?
Meeting Trampa in the city of Willing, West Virginia, scheduled for 19 hours east today, Saturday, September 29, 2018
You can watch the Tramp meeting in West Virginia online below in the direct ephere on YouTube.
Tramp probably refers to the tensions of hearings that took place this week from the application to the Supreme Court of Brett Cavano, charged with sexual harassment, and to the postponement of the Senate's vote for the week while the FBI is investigating.
But the main purpose of this series of meetings is to help Republicans acquire popularity before the November elections.
President Trampa's representatives said that these five meetings next week aimed at "the activation of volunteers and supporters, because the Republicans are trying to save and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives," Reuters reports.
"Congress control is so critical for his day order that the president will go to as many states as possible, because the tense pre-election campaign season is approaching," said Reuters, a representative of the Trump campaign, who did not want to call his name.
Today's meeting of supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as the Pittsburgh TV, reports West Virginia Metro News.
The Saturday visit will be the second in the last month of the Tramp visit to West Virginia, the state in which it received more than 40% of the votes in 2016.
Tramp is trying to help a candidate from the Republican to the Western Virginia Senate, Patrick Morris, whose rating is lagging behind.
“ It’s not good for Morris to come to the president to raise his rating in the polls, ” commented Reuters Simon Heder, a politician at the University of West Virginia.
Rider's Cup 2018: U.S. team set up to fight and hopeful ahead of Sunday singles
After three sessions, which have ended with a unilateral victory, the afternoon’s forces can be the same as that of the Rider Cube.
An emergency pulser is a fully invented sports concept in which players really believe, especially in similar competitions.
So when do they say the impulse works?
"They were ahead at six points, and now at four, so I think we'll take it a little bit as a impulse," said Jordan Spite when he left.
Europe has an advantage, of course, on four fronts and twelve more in the game.
The Americans, as Spit says, feel a little wind in their windows, too, they are encouraged, not in the last place, the shape of Spita and Justin Thomas, who played together all day, and each of them made three eyes out of four.
The sleep with his killer hits from the tee-mind to the branch shows an example.
These grumbling screams of celebration became louder when, in the course of his round, he made a decisive path and compared the account to the fourth match after he and Thomas were standing on two sides.
His patent, which allowed them to win a match on the 15th of August, met with a similar scream, which tells you that the American team does not seem to be.
"You really just have to try very hard and worry about your own match," Spit said.
It's all that each of these players has left right now.
18 moons to become known.
The only players with more eyes than Spyt and Thomas in the last two days — Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fletwood, the undisputed story of Kubka Rider.
It is unusual, but a wonderful couple from Europe have four out of four and cannot make mistakes.
Molovud was the only couple who didn't make the gods on Saturday after lunch, they also managed to avoid the gods in the morning on Saturday and after lunch on Friday and at the nine last lunches on Friday morning.
This run and how their energy seems to flow back and forth to this noisy crowd, makes them believe that they win Sunday and that there will be no more popular players except Flethwood or Molinary to strengthen the Europeans' potential victory when the sun goes over Le Golf National.
He wants to be both at the same time in different holes.
However, talk about the triumph of Europeans as early as possible.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson argued with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning's piano when he was in a couple with Alex Norren.
One god and two dolls on the first nine holes led the Spanish and the Swedish to the hole from which they could never get out.
Sunday, however, no one will help you get out of the hole.
It is very interesting to observe closeness between the participants, the advice they give, the advice they do not give, and how the strategy can change at one time.
While Europe is playing better than a team and has a great advantage over the last day, this session of the Forsoms also showed that the US team is going to fight what some, especially Americans, are in doubt.
Europe leads 10-6 on the last day of Kubka Rider
On the final day, the Cuban Rider Europe will have a solid advantage, because after Saturday's Forbolts and Forsoms it's ahead of the United States with an account of 10-6.
The inspired duet of Tommy Flethwood and Francesco Molinari won two victories over the retreating Tiger Woods, and now they have four battles at Le Golf National.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, who was trying to return the trophies that they lost on Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the American team in the morning papers with an account of 3-1.
The U.S.A. had made greater resistance in the forsoms and won two matches, but they were unable to cut the break.
Jim Furick's team needs eight points in 12 Sundays to save the trophies.
Flethwood, the first European novelist to win four rounds, while he and Molinary (also "Mollwood") after the sensational outputs are only the second pair that picked up four points in the first four matches in the history of Kubque Rider.
After spending Woods and Patrick Reid in the formbolt, they joined together to win the wild Woods and the American-American Bryson Deshambo with even more effective 5th4.
Woods, who pulled out two matches on Saturday, showed a random flash of genius, but immediately he lost 19 of his 29 matchmates in the pianos and forsoms and seven matchmates.
Justin Rose, who did not take part in the morning fights, returned to Henry Stanson's partner in the forsoms to get a 2t1 discount from Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who are the first and third in the world ranking.
Europe has not been able to do everything in its own way on this pleasant fresh day in the south-west of Paris.
Three major winners Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas set the standard for Americans on Saturday with their two eyes.
They won a decisive victory over the Spanishmen John Ram and Ian Poulter in the Forbulbs and later they won Poulter and Rory McClroy with an account of 4th3 in the Forsoms, losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of Kubka Rider, the team returned with a deficit in four singles, although the Furik team is only needed to save the trophies.
However, after the second place for two days, the contraction on Sunday seems to be out of control.
North Korea says "no" will be unarmed in a unilateral order without confidence
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of North Korea informed the United Nations on Saturday that the continuation of sanctions would increase confidence in the United States, and that under such circumstances the country could in no way refuse its nuclear weapons.
R. Yong Ho told the United Nations Annual General Assembly that in the past year, North Korea had used "essential measures of good will", such as stopping nuclear and missile testing, dismantling a nuclear testing environment and not distributing nuclear weapons and technologies.
"One day, we don't see a corresponding reaction from the United States," he said.
"Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we will never be the first to disarm in a unilateral order."
And even though Ri repeated the well-known North Korea complaints about Washington's "step-by-step" approach to denuclearization, according to which North Korea would be rewarded by progressive steps, his statement was important that it did not prevent unilateral denuclearization, which was done by Phanyan in the past.
Ry made a joint statement by Kim Chen In and Donald Tramp in the first story of the summit between the real president of the United States and the North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, when Kim called on him to work on the "declarement of the Korean peninsula", and Tramp promised to guarantee the security of North Korea.
North Korea wants the formal end of the Korean war from 1950 to 53 years, but the United States has stated that the Pyrenees must first reject nuclear weapons.
Washington also opposes calls for a reduction in severe international sanctions for North Korea.
"The U.S. insists on "declaration at first" and increases the level of pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal violently, and even opposes "the declaration of the end of the war," Rí said.
"It is considered that sanctions can put us on our knees," the unreal dream of those who don't know us.
But the problem is that the continuation of sanctions deepens our confidence."
Ri did not mention the plans of the second summit between Kim and Trampo, which the U.S. leader stressed in the United Nations at the beginning of the week.
Instead, the minister drew attention to the three meetings of Kim and South Korean leader Mún Chêin in the last five months and added, "If South Korea, not the United States, would be a party to this issue of denuclearization, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not go to such a deaf corner."
Nevertheless, the tone of Ri's speech was quite different from the one he told the General Assembly that the goal of North Korea's missile on the US property was inevitable after "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim a "human rocket", who wants to commit suicide.
This year, in the UN Trump, which threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea, Kim praised for his courage in the use of disarmament measures, but said that there was much more to be done and sanctions should remain in force until North Korea's denuclearization.
In mid-Tramp, he noted that he did not set a time frame for this: "It will take two years, three years or five months -- it doesn't matter."
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should reward Pyrenees for their steps.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompey stated to the UN Security Council on Thursday: “The implementation of the Security Council sanctions should continue energeticly and incessantly until we see complete, final, confirmed denuclearization. ”
The Security Council has consistently increased sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in order to block the financing of nuclear programmes and ballistic missiles in Pyrenees.
Pompey met Ri in the basements of the United Nations General Assembly and then said that the following month he was visiting the Pyrenees again to prepare for the second summit.
Pompey visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was a failure.
He left Phanyan in July and commented that progress had been made, but after a few hours North Korea condemned him for “gangster requirements. ”
During this month's meeting with Moon, North Korea promised to break down the missile complex, as well as the nuclear complex, if the United States is using the "relevant measures".
He said that Kim said he needed "relevant measures" as security guarantees that Tramp promised in Singapore, and steps to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students are taking a course on how to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has given all of his students more sleep, and it's an attempt to fight the growing culture of the harsh learning all night after cooking caffeine.
The teacher found that students at the university number one in the world are often uneducated when it comes to the very foundations of how to care for themselves.
Charles Chesler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at the Women’s Hospital Brigama, developed a course that he believes is the first such course in the United States.
He decided to start the course after he gave a lecture on the effect of falling asleep on learning.
At the end of the day, a girl approached him and said, "Why are you telling me this right now, in the final course?"
"She told me that no one had ever told her the importance of the dream that surprised me," a lecturer from The Telegraph shared.
On the course that was first introduced this year, the students are given the basics of how good sleep habits help to achieve academic and sports outcomes and improve overall well - being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatric science at Harvard Medical School and executive director of medical services at the university, said that the university decided to introduce a course after it was found that students were seriously deprived of sleep during the week.
An hourly course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section there is a picture of a room in a group room where students click on coffee cups, dishes, trainers and books to learn about the effect of caffeine and light, the effect of the sleep deficit on sports indicators, and the importance of the routine associated with sleep.
Another section tells participants how long - term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression, and cancer.
Next, a compass map with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
"We know that this will not change the behavior of students immediately.
But we think they have the right to know, just as you have the right to know the consequences of smoking cigarettes for health," added Professor Chesler.
The culture of pride for "sleeping all night" still exists, he added, and he noted that modern technologies and constantly increasing pressure on students mean that the problem of sleep deprivation is growing.
A sufficient sleep of good quality must be the “secret weapon” of a student to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety, even with a set of extra weights, because sleep deprivation translates the brain into a mode of hunger that causes constant physical hunger, he said.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chesler to develop a course after he enrolled in one of his other courses last year in Harvard.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to create a new course for the entire campus.
The next step, he hopes, will be addressing all the graduates with a request for a similar training program for the arrival of a competitive institution.
Professor Chesler recommends that students be reminded of the need to sleep, as well as to put a home and be in a harmful effect of the blue light, which is emitted by electronic screens and light-emitting lamps, and can disrupt the circular rhythm that leads to sleep problems.
"Livingston" 1 - 0 "Randers": Mengy's goal was to upset Gerard's boys
Rangers survived a series of road accidents: Dolly Mengi hit a different team, Stephen Gerard, with a 1-0 loss from Lowington.
The ibrox team wanted to win its first victory in a foreign match after the February triumph over St. Johnton with an account of 4-1, but Garry Holt's team won the second defeat as a 18-game manager. The Gerard team remained at eight points behind the Scottish Prime Minister Harts.
Manga was killed in seven minutes before the break, and the Rangers, who had a lack of inspiration, didn't seem to be able to balance the bill.
Now, "Renders have fallen to the sixth position, and "Liveston" has risen to the third, and by contrast of the balls, they are promoted only by "Hibernian".
In addition, Rangers may encounter another discomfort, as Linenman Calum Spence was forced to treat the head wound after it was dumped by the host sector.
Gerard made eight changes to the team that once passed over the Air in the semifinal of the Scottish League's Cup.
And Holt released the same set of "Levia 11", which took one eye to "Harts" last week, and was attracted to the fact that his forced boys pushed rivals on each step.
The Rangers may have been dominated by a ball owner, but Lowington was more involved with the ball he had received.
They had to kill everything in two minutes of the game, when the first dog Menga in the free zone allowed Scott Pittman to hit the door of Allan McGregor, but the half-guard had lost this great chance by sending the ball over the door.
A deep, free blow by Keagan Jacobs caught up with Craig Halket, but his defense partner, Alan Litgou, hit in the back of his coat.
Rangers really got control, but in the last third there was more hope than faith in their game.
Alfredo Morelos, of course, felt that he should have the right to a four - hour sentence after he met Stephen Louless, but Stephen Thompson’s reference to the Colombian.
Rangers were only able to make two hits on the front door in the first time, but the former ibronx doorkeeper Liam Kelly hit Lassani Kulibali's head and the Ovija Edjaria's calm hit almost unattainable.
And even though the Lionington goal was 34 minutes away, maybe the game was in conflict, no one can deny that they deserved it only by their hard work.
Rangers couldn't handle Jacobs again.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Gallagher sent a ball to Scott Robinson, who quietly chose Mang for a simple ending.
In the end, Gerard replaced the Kulibali on Ryan Kent, and this change worked almost immediately when the hunter broke through to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly pulled him out of his line to lock him up.
However, Lowington continued to force guests to play the game that they like when Litgou and Halket make one long pass after another.
The Holt team could have improved the result at the last stages, but McGregor well opposed Jacobs before the Litgou hit the corner.
Glenn Midlton, an alternate in Rangers, made a later application for a fine when he met Jacobs, but Thompson re-examined his views.
Almanac: Geiger's Entrepreneur
And now the page from our Sunday morning almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago this day, and time goes... in Germany, the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactive radiation, the invention that eventually evolved into a device known as the Geiger counter.
Since then, Geiger has become one of the key elements of science, as well as one of the key elements of pop culture, for example in the 1950s, "Call Kornado" movie with Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, who play suspiciously like cowboys.
The man said, "What is this?"
Rogers: “It's the Geiger counter that's used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.

A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to see bad cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to "see" the malignant cells and kill them.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize the malignant cells that are part of the treatment
The method predicts the removal of immune cells in the patient and their change in the laboratory
Then these cells are able to "see" the proteins that are common to many types of cancer, and then these cells are reintroduced to the patient.
The test vaccine shows promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
In one woman who received a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells, ovarian cancer has disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method includes removing immune cells in the patient, changing them in the laboratory so that these cells can "see" the same for many types of protein cancer (HER2) and then reintroduce these cells into the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute Bethesda, Maryland, noted: “Our results show that we have received a very promising vaccine. ”
"HER2 "stimulates the growth of several types of cancer," including breast cancer, ovaries, legends and colorectal cancer," he explained.
A similar approach that involves removing the immune cells in patients and “teaching” them to target cancer cells, has worked to treat one of the types of leukaemia.
After the SNL show in the MAGA canyon, the West, with a sharp speech in support of President Tramp, appeared in the SNL's baseball studio.
what caused the negative reaction of viewers
SNL (Saturday Night in the Straight Ephere) was attended by the viewers after his sober speech, during which he praised the U.S. President Donald Trampa and claimed to be in a presidential position in 2020.
After performing a third song called Ghost Town in a baseball game with the title "Let's Return America's Former Fame," he exploded with a terror in which he criticized the democracies, and once again declared his support for the Trump.
"Sometimes during the conversation, white people ask me, "How can you like Tramp? He's a racist."
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
The show SNL began with Matt Damon's sketch, in which a Hollywood star smiled at Brett Cavano's testimony that he gave to the Senate's Legal Committee on the Call for Christine Blaze Ford on sexual assault.
Although the speech of the West was not broadcast in the direct ephere, the video with its tirade was released on the social network of the comic book Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock wanted to lick the West by placing this post.
Vest also complained to the audience that he had a bad situation behind the scenes because of the main suit.
As Washington Examiner reports, West said, "When I was behind bars, I was rude.
I was told, "Don't go out to the audience in this baseball game."
They were angry with me!
And then I'm told that I'm in a place where the depressed are silent."
Wet continued, "Do you want to see where the depressed are keeping quiet? I'm going to wear my superman baseball because no one can tell me what to do, do you want the world to keep moving forward?
Then try to treat each other with love."
According to the weekly Variety, his comments at least twice caused a negative reaction to the audience in the hall, and the SNL actors seemed to be lost.
In the last minute, we received an invitation to replace the singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, Reper Macmiller, died a few days before the fall.
Vest was surprised by the song I Love it (I love it) in Perrier’s water bottle suit.
The news was supported by the head of TPUSA Candez Turner's conservative organization, who wrote in Twitter: "One of the most courageous: I'm referring to what's been happening to NATO."
Instead, Karen Hunter's lead show wrote in Twitter that West is "who he is, and it's just great."
"But I won't reward it (by buying his music or clothing or by supporting his "art") who, in my opinion, testifies and utters an ideology that harms my community.
He is a free man.
Like us," she added.
In front of the show, the rapper announced in Twitter that he had changed his name: he is now "the one who had known as the West Canyon."
The West is not the first performer to change his name; he follows the example of Didi, also known as Paff Didi, Paffi and Pi Diddi.
Snipe Dog has been called Snipo Lyon before, and, as you know, the musical legend of the past decades, Prince has changed his name to a symbol, and then became "Artist, formerly known as Prince."
Indictment for intentional murder after a knife attack at the Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man is accused of attempted murder after another man was injured in one of the restaurants in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The police reported that the incident happened at the Belligekamor restaurant.
The defendant is expected to be brought before the court of Belfast Magistrates on Monday.
The prosecutor's office is investigating the charges.
Kit Herington's star series "Game of thrones" condemns the idealization of brutality.
Keith Gerington became famous for the role of a warrior with John Snow's sword in the brutal medieval fantasy series "Game of thrones" of the HBO company.
However, a 31-year-old actor who condemned the stereotype of hero-mach, asserting that because of such heroes on screen, young boys often seem to have to be cool to be respected by others.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture Kit, he said, "something went wrong," and asked how to solve the problem of the idealization of brutality in the age of #MeTo's popularity.
Keith, who recently married his colleague on the Grey thrones, 31-year-old actor Rose Leslie, noted that he was "very determined" to deal with this problem.
"I'm set up pretty firmly at this point, when did we get on the slippery path of idealizing brutality?" he asked.
"Why do we teach future men if we look at their growth because of the problem we see now?"
Kitt believes that television is partly responsible for the popularization of brutality through the image of extremely brave heroes.
He went on, "What's natural, and what are we being planted?
Why are television and street teaching that young boys feel pressured to be the same men?
In my opinion, today's really important question is, How do we change it?
Because it's obvious that the young guys got out the right way."
In an interview, he also noted that he would not be filmed in any precipices and cycles of "The Games of Prestals" after the show of the series next summer, because "he's done with battles and horses."
From November, Keith will play the game "The Real West" Sam Schepard, a story about a movie producer and his brother-in-law.
As the actor recently confessed, he respects the meeting with his wife Rose the best she's ever had in the "Game of thrones" series.
"After the film in this series I met my wife, so he gave me a future family and determined my next life," Keith said.
In a fantasy series that got Emmy's prize, Rose played Irrittt, a hero named Gerington John Snow.
The ceremony took place in June 2018 in the territory of Leslie’s family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reported a sharp increase of 14% of new cases of disease
In China, a sharp increase of 14 percent of the population in HIV and AIDS is reported.
According to health authorities, more than 820,000 patients are accounted for in the country as a whole.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, 40,000 new cases of disease were reported.
In most cases, the disease has been transmitted by means of a sexual procedure that indicates a change in the previous trend.
For a long time, in some regions of China, HIV spread rapidly through infected blood during transfusions.
However, according to official health authorities at a conference in the province of Yunan, the number of people infected with HIV this way has fallen to almost zero.
Compared with the previous year, however, the number of HIV and AIDS patients in China increased by 100,000.
The transmission of HIV through time is a serious problem for the Chinese LGBT community.
The decriminalization of homosexuality in China took place in 1997, but the LGBT community often suffers discrimination.
According to the survey, between 70 and 90 percent of men who have sexual relations with other men are further married to women because of the country’s conservative values.
In most cases, transmission of disease occurs as a result of improper use of protective devices during sexual contact.
Since 2003, the Government of China has promised to provide free access to HIV drugs, thus partially solving the problem.
Maxine Waters rejects the anger of the Republican senators on the network by its staff member and exposes the harsh criticism of "dangerous lie" and "the theory of conspiracy"
On Saturday, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, Maxine Waters, condemned the public statements that one of her staff had posted the personal data of three American Republican senators on their websites in Wikipedia.
The Los Angeles Democrat claims that these statements are spreading ultra-right political viewers and websites.
"A lie, a lie, and then a more disgusting lie," said Waters in Twitter.
It is reported that the public information contained home addresses and telephone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Greema from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Getch from Uti.
The data appeared online on Thursday, and they were posted by an unknown person from the Capitol during the hearings of the Senate commission of charges of an anti-sexual act against Brett Kawano, a candidate for the position of the Supreme Court of the United States.
The outcome came some time after three senators questioned Cavano.
The Hill reported that on conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, information appeared that the IP source of the output was linked to the Waters office and that it was able to find data from its staff.
"These baseless statements are absolutely false, they don't fit in," said Waters.
"The employer of my office, whose personal data and security were put at risk as a result of these manufactured and false claims, has nothing to do with the outcome of this information.
These baseless statements are absolutely false, they don't fit in with reality."
Waters' statement was quickly criticised in the network, and among other things, the former White House Press Secretary Ari Flyerser.
"It's a denial of anger," Fliesher wrote.
"It suggests that with that nature she cannot be a member of the Congress.
When someone is accused of what he has not done, there is no need to be angry.
The accused should not behave abusively.
He should not question the motives of the accused.
He must remain calm and unmoved."
It seems that Fleischer had a parallel between the reaction of Waters and the criticism of the democracies at Judge Cavano, who was accused of looking too angry at the Thursday hearing.
Omar Navarro, a candidate from the Republican Party who is struggling to take over Waters after the results of the interim elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"That's the news, if it's true," he wrote.
In her application, Waters noted that her office had already informed "the relevant state authorities and law enforcement authorities about these false statements".
"We will do everything possible to find the guilty," she continued, "and they responded to the law for their actions that are harmful and dangerous to all my employees."
A review of the film "Agent Johnny English: New Mission" - a facilitator for spy fighters with Rowen Atkinson
It has become a good tradition to look for ideas in every new British movie called Brexit. They are also part of a new series of comedy parfamilies about Johnny English. The first film called Johnny English came out on the screen in 2003, and later the series was resumed in 2011 by saying "Johnny English: Restart".
Is it going to be a ridiculous and ironic self-satisfaction to what we are short-lived, the new export potential of the nation?
By the way, Johnny English with his moving face and his eye-blown second time was given the opportunity to make trouble, with his name being more than anything else indicating that this comical character was created for viewers in non-English countries.
As is well known, Johnny is a very funny secret agent, in which, despite his strange efforts to be talented and charming, he is a little bit from Inspector Clouseau, a little from Mr. Bin, and a lot of things, from the guy who played one note of the song from the film "Fired Wheels" at the 2012 opening ceremony of the London Olympic Games.
The pattern of personality is also a guide and a mystery of the international scale that always left behind the disorder that Atkinson once played in Barclaycard’s long-lost television commercials.
In the last film about Johnny English, there are a few beautiful moments.
I liked the scene when Johnny English in the men's equipment approached the helicopter, and the gypsum shovels made a day out of his shell.
In the film, the Atkinson talent is well-discovered to set up a buffoon, but humor is passing, and in some moments it's too much, especially when it's compared to "serious" movie brands, such as "Agent 007" and "Mission is impossible," one of the "integrants" which is also a comedy.
The impression is that the jokes are more about children than adults, and I don’t see the ingenious and thought - provoking behavior of Johnny English in the late Atkinson movies about Bin.
As always, the film begins with a serious threat to Britain.
The British supersecret network of spies penetrates the hacker and exposes the names of all field agents, which became a complete surprise to the active agent. ( Unfortunately, Kevin Eldon played only an epic role in the film.)
This was the last drop for the Prime Minister, a proud person who has already suffered a destructive criticism and is in deep depression because of the loss of popularity (Emma Thompson was trying to convey the very best image published by Teresa May, but the script failed to fully reveal it).
The researchers informed her that all active agents had been compromised, and she had to be taken away.
The selection falls on the unscrupulous Johnny English, who now works as a teacher in a supermodern institution and informally teaches children operating undercover (in this part of the Spanish "year school" English for teenagers was a few long jokes).
English is quickly delivered to Witgol for a term briefing, where he meets again with his long - suffering friend Buff, who plays Ben Miller in turn.
Buff is now married to the captain of a submarine (the role of an excellent nurse is not entirely in line with the talent of Vicki Pepperdin).
So, when everything in the Secret Service of Her Majesty went to hell, "Betman and Robin" returned to the string and suddenly met the fatal woman of Ophelia Pistoletov, who is playing by Olga Kurilenko.
And at this time, the Prime Minister comes under the guise of a charismatic billionaire who has earned his technical and technology asset and claims that he can remove the problem with the British network, the charismatic Jason Walt, who played Jake Lacey.
English and Buff go on a trip and they make their fun out of it again: rediscovered by the officers, they burn in a ski français restaurant; they continue to sow chaos, illegally going abroad on the beautiful island of Walt; English is making real trouble when trying to use the helmet of virtual reality to get to know the planning of Walt's house.
All the stops lead us to the last episode, but with his goodness and modesty, he reminds us of a movie for children.
It's a passing movie.
As with other filmmakers on Johnny English, I asked myself the same question: Can't the British film industry offer Rowen Atkinson a role that really matches his talent?
Laborists refuse to prepare a plan that says that British will work four days a week, but they will get a paycheck in five days.
The Labour Party of Jeremy Corbin has to discuss a radical plan that British people will work four days a week, but they will be paid in five days.
It's reported that the party wants to force the company's managers to transfer the costs saved as a result of a revolution of artificial intelligence, to the workers, giving them an additional output.
In this way, workers will have a three - day weekend, and they will bring home the same pay.
According to sources, this idea will respond to the party’s economic program and direct the country’s resources to support the working class.
The four-week shift was approved at the British Congress of Trade Unions, and it is expected that workers will be able to benefit from a change in the overall economic situation.
The Labour Party's source reported the Sunday Times saying: "The policy review will be announced at the end of the year.
It's not going to change in one night, but the idea of a four-day working week is the way the party's approach to changing the balance of the economy in the interests of workers, as well as the general industry of the party's strategy."
The Laborists did not first approve this idea, as the Green Party promised to introduce a four-day work week even during the 2017 pre-election campaign.
However, not all members of the Leborist Party now approve of such a desire.
"The party's political programme doesn't provide for a four-day work week, so we're not dealing with this idea right now."
"Tinow" Chancellor John McDonnell introduced his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy at the pre-election stage of the Labour Party last week.
Mr. McDonnell said he had set up to take back power from the "uncertain directors" of municipal companies and "seekers".
It also means that water supply company shareholders can not get their share of the capital if the lobbyist government conducts a "record" on the basis of imaginary violations.
He also confirmed the intention to include employees in company governance and create inclusive equity funds to transfer 10% of ordinary shares to private sector firms, where annual dividends are expected to be up to 500 pounds per year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell us at the 60 minutes show if the Kawano case, led by the FBI, can change their mind.
In connection with the investigation of charges against Judge Brett Cavano, who is led by the FBI, the final vote for his appointment to the Supreme Court is postponed for at least a week.
On Sunday's 60-minute show, correspondent Scott Pelley asked Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Greema if the FBI could find something that would change their mind.
Kennedy was more open than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Yes, of course," said Kennedy.
During my hearing, I told him that I had a conversation with Judge Kavano.
I phoned him after everything happened and the charges came out, and I asked him, "Did you really do this?"
He was determined, firm, uncompromising."
It seems that Greema's idea will not change anything anymore.
"I think the Kavano indictment is a provocation," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know what: Brett firmly denied everything," added Graham, addressing Christine Blaze Ford.
And anyone she calls can't confirm it under oath.
This happened 36 years ago.
I don't understand what can change."
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and how can it affect poverty reduction?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival (the World's Citizens' Festival) – an annual event in the music world with an amazing number of star performers and at least a thrilling mission – to combat poverty worldwide.
At the seventh Global Citizen Festival, tens of thousands of people will flock to the Grand Hall of the Central Park, not only to enjoy the talks of Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Sean Mendes, but also to draw attention to the real purpose of the festival – the organizers will want to combat the extreme form of poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is the continuation of the Global Poverty Project, an international public organization that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people who will actively fight it.
To get a free ticket to the event (if you don't want to pay VIP tickets), visitors must do a lot of tasks or "actions" like learning in a volunteer project, writing an e-mail to the world leader, making a phone call or anything else to help you focus on the organization's goal of eradicating poverty.
So are there any results already, since the goal of Global Citizen organizers has been 12 years?
Is it really an idea to reward for doing a free concert -- a great way to convince people to demand action, or is it just another case of so-called "clitivism" when people feel that something is really changing by signing an electronic petition or making a publication on Twitter?
According to Global Citizen, since 2011, they have recorded 19 million "acts" of their supporters aimed at achieving different goals.
The organization claims that these actions have moved world leaders to declare planned financial allocations and programs of more than $37 billion, which will help to change lives by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group provided an example of the results of its 390 financial commitments and public statements, with at least 10 billion already being collected and spent.
The group estimates that the cost has already directly affected some 649 million people worldwide.
One of the main financial commitments is the The Power of Nutrition Fund, which is territorially related to the United Kingdom. Under the project, investors and realists have committed themselves to "helping children grow" and have promised Rwanda $35 million to help deal with the problem of malnutrition after receiving more than 4700 messages in Twitter from the Global Citizens organization.
"In support of the government of Britain, the Mezenites, the governments of other countries and citizens of the world, such as you, we can make a social problem of undernutrition by a minor fact of history," said The Power of Nutrition Tracy Ulman, representing the public during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The organization also stated that after 5,000 "actions" that called for better nutrition for mothers and children, the UK government announced spending on the The Power of Nutrition project aimed at improving food for 5 million mothers and children.
In answer to one of the common questions on your website, "Why do you think you can tackle the extreme level of poverty?"
Global Citizens wrote: "This is a long and difficult path, so sometimes we will fall and fail.
However, just as civil rights and apartheid are involved, we will succeed because we are stronger together."
Janet Jackson, The Weekend, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, Jeannell Mona, is just a part of the star performers that will be held this year at the New York Festival, and will be hung by Debor Lee Ferness and Gu Jackman.
Minister of Interior stated that the United States could use military and maritime forces to prevent the export of Russian energy
According to the U.S. Minister of Interior, Ryan Zinke, quoted in Washington Examiner, "for necessity" Washington can be approached by military and maritime forces in order to prevent the outflow of Russian energy into markets, including the Middle East markets.
Zinke claimed that Russia's involvement in the conflict in Syria, especially where it operates at the invitation of a legitimate government, is a means of exploring new energy sources.
"I think they're in the Middle East because they want to become an intermediary in energy trade, as they already do in Eastern and South Europe," he said.
According to the employer, there are ways and means of solving the problem.
"With the U.S. military and maritime forces, it can ensure free passage through sea routes and, if necessary, block them so that Russian energy resources do not reach the market," he said.
Zinke addressed the participants in the initiative, which was conducted by the Consumer Energy Alliance (Energy Consumer Alliance), a non-commercial organization that positions itself as "the voice of every consumer" in the United States.
He went on to compare trade approaches with Russia and Iran, noting that they were actually similar.
"The economic strategy for Iran and Russia is generally that we effectively use energy and replace them with alternatives," he said, calling Russia "one-sidedly developed," because its economy depends on mineral energy.
While these claims were being made, the Trampa administration aimed at increasing the export of compressed natural gas to Europe by pushing from the Russian energy market a much cheaper version for Europeans.
For this, the officials of the Tramp administration and President Donald Tramp themselves are trying to convince the German government to reject the "inviolable" project of the North Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Tramp, will make Berlin an adviser to Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North Stream 2 gas, which is worth 11 billion dollars and which doubles the existing gas capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin believes that Washington is very much opposed to the project only for economic reasons, which is an example of unfair competition.
"In my view, we share the idea that energy can't be a pressure tool and a consumer should be able to choose suppliers," said Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak after meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry, who took place in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position triggered a negative reaction from Germany, which confirmed its support for the project.
The German lead organization, the Federal Association of German Industry (BDI), urged the United States not to interfere with EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I don't like it when a third country gets involved in our supply of energy," said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federal Association of German Industry, after the last meeting of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Senator of Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren's "seriously thinking" about the president's post in 2020
The Senator of Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that he "seriously thinks" about the President's post after the interim election.
At a meeting with the public in Goliak, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering the possibility of attending his candidacy.
As reported in The Hill Warren, she said, "It's time for women to go to Washington and set up a government, and for that to be his head, there must be a woman."
"On November 6th, I'm seriously thinking about issuing my candidacy as president."
At a meeting with civil society, Warren expressed his appreciation of the presidency of Donald Tramp, saying he "did not lead his country in that direction.
"I am extremely concerned about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy," she said.
Warren was open, criticizing Trampa and offering him a candidacy at the office of the Supreme Court judge, Brett Kawano.
In a Friday tweet, Warren wrote, "No doubt the FBI has to investigate before voting."
However, according to the polls published on Friday, most Voorren voters do not believe that it should be fought in 2020.
In line with the results of the polls conducted jointly by the Political Research Centre at the University of Suffolk and The Boston Globe, fifty-eight percent of the potential voters of Massachusetts expressed opposition to the release of their candidacy by the senator.
Thirty - two percent supported the expulsion.
The survey showed that the former governor, Deval Patrick, was more supportive. He was 38%, compared to 48%.
During the discussion of the nominations of other well-known democracies, which can be fought in 2020, also called former Vice President Joe Baiden and Senator of Vermont Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Byden announced that he would make a decision by January.
Sara Pailin mentions the Trek Pailin Pt.R. at the meeting in support of Donald Tramp
The 26-year-old Trek Paylin spent a year in Iraq after entering the military service in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence, and the incident took place on Monday night.
"This is what my son is going through right now, what he's going through after his return, can only understand other families that are experiencing the consequences of the PTSD and other health problems that our soldiers are returning home with," she said before attending a meeting in support of Donald Tramp in Tals, Oklahoma.
Pailin called Trek's arrest a "problem that no one pays attention to" and said that her son and other war veterans "are not returning home as they used to be, more cruel, and want to know if they respect here what they have done to their own soldiers, pilots and other military personnel for this country."
According to a spokesman for the Vasil Police Department, Dan Bennett, Treka was arrested on Monday in Vasil, Alaska, and was accused of domestic violence and assaulting women, as well as of obstructing reports of violence and carrying weapons in a state of alcohol abuse.
18 States and the District of Colombia Supports the Defamation of Homeland Policy
Eighteen states and the Colombian district support the appeal of a new U.S. policy that the victims of gang persecution and domestic violence refuse to provide refugee status.
According to NBC News, representatives of 18 states and the district sent an analytical note to a court adviser in Washington to support a summons who needed shelter and accused the above - mentioned policy in court.
The full name of the appeal in the case of Grace v. Sechens, after the call of the American Union for the protection of civil rights, in which federal policy is being challenged, which was filed in August, is not being disclosed.
The caller said her partner "and his cruel son-in-laws" were her, but the U.S. officials refused her when she asked for a shelter on July 20th.
She was illegally held in Texas.
State prosecutors supporting Grace said that the people of El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala (those who often ask for shelter in the United States) often face serious problems such as gangs and domestic violence.
A new refugee status policy has been reversing the decision of the Immigration Appeals Council in 2014, according to which non-documented immigrants who have escaped domestic violence could apply for shelter.
The District Attorney General, General Carl Reisin, said in his speech on Friday, that the new policy "is ignoring dozens of state, federal and international laws."
"Federal law requires a decision on the application for refugee status to be based on the facts and circumstances of the application, and the prohibition violates this principle," says the Court's consultant.
The prosecutors further state in the analytical report that a policy that prohibits immigrants from entering the United States would harm the economies of the country, as they could potentially become entrepreneurs and "fill the necessary labour resources".
In June, Attorney General Jeff Seshns issued an order for immigration judges, claiming that they could no longer give refugee status to those fleeing from domestic violence and bandits.
"The title is given to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear of persecution in connection with racial affiliation, religion, nationality, membership of certain public groups or political views," Seshns said in his speech on 11 June.
The provision of shelter was never intended to solve all the problems, even the serious problems people all over the world face each day.
Rescuers desperately try to find those who are left alive, while the number of dead in Paul’s home has increased twice
For those left alive, the situation continues to deteriorate.
"The situation is very tense," says a 35-year-old mother, calming her boy with a disaster in the evacuation center of the destroyed city of Pala.
"Every minute a quick help brings the body.
Pure water is not enough."
Some people return to their ruined homes, take advantage of the heat, and try to save what they have found.
Hundreds of people are traumatized, and hospitals, damaged by earthquakes, with an estimated 7.5 - inch - long [7.5 - meter] power on Richter scale, are overcrowded.
Some of the wounded, including two Geriss with a break in the back and shoulder, rest at the building of the army hospital of Paul, where patients are helped under the open sky through constant repeated mails.
His eyes were filled with tears when he remembered how a strong mailman slammed the hotel room on the fifth floor, where he was staying with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time for salvation.
I think I'm stuck in the middle of the wall," said Geris, associated Press correspondent, adding that he and his family had come to the city for a wedding.
"I heard my wife praying for help, and then she cried out quietly.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe."
The US Ambassador accuses China of "making psychological pressure" through "advertising propaganda"
A week later, after a Chinese government newspaper posted on the four pages of the daily U.S. newspaper advertising material about the mutual benefit of trade between the United States and China, a US ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread the propaganda.
The U.S. President Donald Tramp sent the last Wednesday's payroll supplement to China Daily in Des Moines Register, the most popular newspaper in the state of Iowa, after accusing China of trying to influence the elections to Congress on November 6th. China rejects these charges.
According to the U.S. agency Reuters officials, Trampa, in which he accuses Beijing of attempting to engage in American elections, means a new phase of escalation on the part of Washington, the target of pressure on China.
Although foreign governments may place a commercial to boost trade, the escalation of trade wars between Beijing and Washington over time has resulted in an increase in import duty.
According to experts from China and the United States, at the beginning of this war, the purpose of China's repression was to strike exporters from states such as Iowa, who supported the Republic's Tromp Party.
Terry Brenstead, a US ambassador to China and former governor of the state of Iowa, the largest exporter of agricultural production to China, claimed that China had done harm to US workers, farmers and companies.
China, as Brensted wrote in a column on the Sunday issue of Des Moines Register, "is increasing pressure by publishing an advertisement containing propaganda in our independent press."
"To spread the propaganda, the government of China uses a tradition of freedom of speech and the independence of the press for the American people, placing a pay ad in the Des Moines Register," Brenstead wrote.
"On the contrary, on the street schedules here in Beijing, you will only find different voices, and here you will not see a true picture of what the Chinese people actually think about the direction of the Chinese economy, which is causing concern, which can lead to the conclusion that the Chinese media is under the control of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He also added that "one of the important Chinese editions offered to publish" his article, but he didn't call it the same.
Analysts warn that by the failure of Kawano Republicans set up against themselves female voters before the intermediate elections
Since many well - known Republicans support and protect the candidate for the post of the Supreme Court of Brett Cavano after several charges have been brought against him in sexual harassment, analysts warn that this may cause an unwanted reaction to the future interim elections, especially in women.
In this situation, prejudice is rampant, and most Republicans publicly claim that they would like to go to the poll.
These things can't just be played back," said The Hill, published on Saturday, Grant Ridger, professor of political science at Maxwell University of Syracuse.
Ryger expressed doubts that the FBI investigation, at which the last minute Senator Jeff Fleeck (Republic of Arizona) began to insist, would be sufficient to calm the angry voters.
According to Washington, D.C., the chief adviser and spokesman of the Progressive Group MoveOn (Continue) Katrin Jean-Perry said on Friday: "Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget about it tomorrow or November."
According to Mic, on Friday morning, protestors sang "Listopad is approaching!" during a demonstration in the Legal Committee, when the Republicans decided to move to the approval of the Kawano candidacy, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blaze Ford.
In an interview with the news site St. Rottenberg, a party political viewer, said, "People will be extremely interested and motivated."
"They're saying that that's right now, and that's true.
However, motivation can be enhanced, especially in women voters 18 to 29 years of age, with priorities that have not yet been defined and often do not vote unless they like the president."
Before Ford gave a witness in connection with the charges against a candidate in the High Court's office in a sexual offence, analysts forecast a negative voter response if the Republicans insist on a statement.
According to NBC News, earlier this week the former head of the National Committee of the Republican Party, Michael Steel, said, "This is an unpleasant story for the Republican Party."
In an interview with the news channel, the director of Priorities USA (U.S. Priorities) (a group that assists in the pre-election campaign for Democrats) Guy Cecil, "the case is not in the committee's vote, the final vote, or the fact that the Kawano was in the lobby of the defendants, and how they responded to this situation and how they acted on it."
However, the American’s views on who the testimony of Ford or Cavano is divided have a little more support for Ford.
As a result of a new survey by YouGov, 41% of respondents believe in or believe in the testimony of Ford, while the testimony of Kavano believes or believes 35%.
In addition, 38 percent of the respondents noted that they thought that Cavano had given or had given false testimony rather than anything else, while Ford had said the same thing about 30 percent of the respondents.
According to The Guardian, after Fleke F.B.R.'s pressure, he conducts a review of the charges brought by Ford and another caller, Deborah Ramirez.
Last week, Ford gave a witness under the oath of the Senate's Legal Committee about how Kawano attacked her while she was in a state of alcohol abuse when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez stated that a candidate for the position of a Supreme Court judge showed her his genitals at a party during their education at the University of Elsa in 1980.
The inventor of the global Internet is planning to launch a "new Internet" to create a competition for Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Li, an Internet-wide inventor, launches a new startup to create Facebook, Amazon and Google competition.
The latest project of the world's technology legend, the Inrupt company, is developing a platform with an open solid source code, the idea of which belongs to Berners-Li.
The Solid platform allows users to choose where to store data and who to access that or other information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company Berners-Li, he joked that the goal of Inrupt was "world domination".
"We must do it now," he said about the start-up.
It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to enable users to create "Personal Online Data Storage" or POD.
It contains lists of contacts, lists of current tasks, calendars, audio recordings library and other tools for your own use and work.
It's like using Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify in one browser at a time.
The unique feature of this personal online data repository is that it fully meets the needs of the user who can access any information.
The company calls it "the expansion of personal capabilities through data".
According to Director General Inrupt John Bruce, the company aims to operate resources, processes and appropriate skills to make the Solid platform accessible to everyone.
Currently, the company is made up of Berners-Li, Bruce, security platforms acquired in IBM, several state developers hired to work on the project, and volunteer software companies.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own autonomous applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Li said he and his team don't negotiate with Facebook and Google on whether to make a full replacement when all their business models are undergoing radical changes within a short period of time.
"We don't ask their permission."
In a Saturday publication on Medium Berners-Li, the Inrupt mission said that it "provides commercial energy and ecosystem and helps to protect the integrity and quality of the new network created on Solid platform".
In 1994, Berners-Li transformed the Internet network by establishing a World Poultry Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In the last month, Berners-Li is an influential figure in the debate on net neutrality.
Even at the start of the Inrupt Berners-Li, he was the founder and director of the World Spider Consortium, the The Web Foundation Foundation and the Institute of Open Data.
"I look very optimisticly at the next era of network development," said Berners-Li.
Bernard Vann: Celebrating from the ceremony of the church's envoy of the Order of "Christ Victoria" in the Year of World War I
The only representative of the Anglican Church who received the Order of "Christ Victoria" for participation in the battles during World War I is honored in his home town 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann received a prize for his participation in the attack under Belgium and Leoquor on September 29, 1918.
However, he died four days later from the sniper tower, never knowing that he had received the highest military award in Britain.
On Saturday, his two grandsons discovered a monumental stone during a parade in the town of Rashden, the county of Nortgemptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, called it "very symbolic" that the discovery of a memorial stone took place about 100 years after his grandfather accomplished the feat for which he was rewarded.
According to London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Colonel Vann transferred his battalion through the San Katten channel "through a very dense fog and under the intense fire of field fires and bullets".
Later, he rushed to the fiery border, and with the "extensive courage" he took a string forward, before that one burst into the field heat, and destroyed three of the enemy compartment's heat.
Lieutenant Vanna shot a German sniper on October 4, 1918 — a little more than a month before the war ended.
72-year-old Michael Vann said his grandfather did what he could never do himself and deserve respect.
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, put the poison after the parade under the leadership of the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that "he feels very proud of being involved in this parade" and added that "the courage of a real hero is showing him the honor that so many people show him."
MMA fans didn't sleep all night to watch Bellator 206, and instead they showed them "Peppo pig"
Imagine that you don't sleep all night just to look at the exciting events of Bellator 206, and you're being denied the opportunity to look at the main event.
There were 13 battles in San Jose's tournaments, including six main program units that were broadcast live in the nighttime in Britain on 5 channels.
At six o'clock in the morning, just before Gegard Musasi and Rory McDonald were getting ready to get together, the TV viewers in Britain died of a miracle when Peppa's pig appeared on the screen instead of broadcasting the fight.
Some observers were not attracted to this because they did not sleep until the morning before waiting for the battle.
One of the fans wrote in Twitter that switching to a child's movie was "some kind of bad joke."
"According to a government decree that was broadcast at 6:00 a.m., it was inappropriate, so they were forced to release a baby transmission," said Dave Schwarz, the senior vice president of marketing and public relations with Bellator, when asked about the TV,
"Peppa pig," yes."
Bellator Scott Kocker, president of the company, promised to work on the broadcasting schedule in order to capture future audiences in Britain.
"I think if we talk about retransmission, we'll be able to fix it," Kouker said.
"But now there's Sunday, 6 o'clock in the morning, and we can't do anything until we have Sunday, and they have Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the broadcast was off, we received a lot of the messages we responded to, and the text of these messages was not very friendly.
We thought it was a technical error, and we tried to remove it.
However, it was found that it was not in conformity with government regulations.
I can promise you this will never happen again.
We're going to cut the tournament down to five fights instead of six, as usual, and we were trying to reinstate the signal for the fans, but until we dropped these attempts.
It's a really unpleasant situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daily felt worse than others because of his sexual orientation
The Olympic stripper in the water, Tom Dale, tells us that he grew up feeling worse than others because of his sexual orientation, but it gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old sportsman said he didn't understand that "not all look like him," until he went to high school.
Taking part in the Desert Island Discs transmission on Radio 4, led by Lauren Lavern, he noted that he spoke openly about the rights of gays to give "hope" to others.
He also stated that because of his parents, he became less concerned with winning the Olympics.
For a long time now, Kirsty Yang has gone to the hospital for a few months.
When he came as a couple for the first Lavern program, Daley said he felt worse than others when he was a child, because "the society didn't accept when someone liked boys and girls."
He said, "By this time, the feeling of inferiority and difference was what gave me strength and strength to achieve success."
According to him, he wanted to prove that something was "precious" so that he wouldn't disappoint anyone who finally learned about his orientation.
A double bronze Olympic champion became a well-known fighter for the law of the LBGT community and took advantage of this year's Society Games in Australia to call for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke openly about his views because he felt happy that he could live openly without any consequences, and wanted to give this "hope" to others.
The world’s triple champion admitted that his feelings for a man, American film director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, had become a real surprise to him.
Daley took Oscar’s award winner, who was 20 years older than him, last year, but he said that the difference in age was never a problem.
"When you're going through so much of this young age" (in the first Olympics he went to the 14th, and in three years his father died of cancer), it's hard to find someone of his own age who would also survive similar floods and falls.
In June, there was a son named Robert Rey Black-Daily, and since then, according to Dale, his "conception" has changed.
"If you asked me last year, I'd just think about what to get the gold," he said.
"You know, things are much more important than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold is Robbie."
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after he was diagnosed with brain cancer.
Dale said that his father could not agree with the idea of the end, and before he died, he asked if they had bought the tickets at the 2012 London Olympics because he wanted to sit in the first row.
"I couldn't tell him "you won't sit in the first row because you won't be there anymore," said Daily.
"I held him by the hand when he stopped breathing, and only after he actually stopped breathing and died, I finally realized that he wasn't invincible," he said.
The following year, Dale participated in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze.
"I knew that this was what I had been dreaming about all my life: to pry in front of my fellow students at the Olympics, and there was no feeling better than that," Daily said.
This feeling also inspired him to choose his first song — Proud (Gordi) in Gizer Small — which he resonated with in preparation for the Olympics and still provokes ants.
Desert Island Disks program goes to BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11.15 a.m.
On Saturday with a tournament match for the Rider Cup, Mikelson, who was not in shape, was released.
American Phil Michelson will set a record Sunday, playing his 47th game on the Rider Cup tournament, but he has to restore the form so that this event does not become a failure for him.
Mikkelson, who took part in a two-year-old tournament on record 12th, was released from the game by Captain Jim Furick at the time of the Forballs and Forsams.
Instead of staying in the center of events, as he often did, playing for the United States, a five-time winner encouraged the team all day and trained on the side, hoping to cope with emotions.
Since Mikelson was not famous for his good hits even while he was in his career, a 48-year-old sportsman did not come up with a difficult field for the Le Golf National golf course, where the Raf usually punishs the wandering hits.
And if that's not the case, on Sunday's ninth match, Mikelson will have to meet with the Open Championship champion and the right-wing champion of Francesco Molinari, who won all his match this week in a pair of new Tommy Fletwood.
If the Americans who stay three points after the 12 single match start well, Mikelson’s match may be decisive.
Furik expressed confidence in his sportsman, and he probably had nothing to add to it.
"He finally understood his role today, blew me in the back, hugged me and said he'd be ready tomorrow," Furick said.
"He doesn't doubt his powers.
Mikkelson, a member of the Hall of Glory, who did so much for the teams last week.
I probably didn't think he'd play in two matches.
I was predicting more matches, but that's what happened, and that's why we decided to do it.
He wants to be there, in the field, like anyone else."
If Michaelson goes out on Saturday, he's gonna beat Nick Faldo's record, who played the biggest match in the Rider's Cup tournament.
He may have finished his career at the Rider Cup tournament, which has never responded to his individual achievement.
On the count of Michaelson 18 wins, 20 defeats, and 7 null results, however, Furick said that his presence could play a crucial role for the team.
"He's funny, he's fat, he's kind of hot, he likes to joke with others, he's a guy who's a good guy in the team," Furick explained.
"I think the younger players were having a good time looking at him, and this week, and it was interesting to observe.
He's more than just a player."
Captain Thomas Bjorn of the European team knows that the big break is not going to work.
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that a sensitive break before the single match on the last day of the tournament for the Rider's Cube is not yet a guarantee of victory.
Datchanin debuted in 1997 in a match at the Valderram Club, where a team in front of his Ballesteros beat the Americans five points, but won the match with a minor break with a 141⁄2:131⁄2.
"You remember that we had a big break in a match in the Valderram field; a big break in Bruklein where we lost, and in the Valderram field where we won the violence," Bjorn said after reviewing the winning games Class 2018 with the result of 5:3 on Friday and yesterday at Le Golf National Stadium, after which the break is 10:6.
So history teaches me and every team player that nothing has been decided yet.
I'm gonna have to play with the maximum payout tomorrow.
Get out of the field and do whatever you need to do.
The game will be finished only after the result appears on the table.
We have the goal of getting this trophy, and that's what we want.
As I said earlier, I focus on the 12 players of our team, but we are well aware of who is opposed to us as the best players in the world."
Satisfied with his players' speech in the difficult field, Byrne added, "I'll never run ahead.
It'll be different tomorrow.
We're expecting individual matchups tomorrow, and that's something else.
It's nice to play in a field with a partner when it's all right, but it's just when you're standing there alone, and you can check what you're worth as a golfer.
Here's how to set players to show tomorrow: on the edge of the opportunity.
You leave your partner with no support, and now he has to show you what he's capable of."
Unlike Bjorn, the opposite number Jim Furick expects his partners to play a better game on an individual level, with the exception of Jordan Spyta and Justin Thomas, who took three of the four.
For the last day, Furika's fate was returned by various sides: he was among the winners in Brukleny, but he was defeated when a team from Europe created the "Miracle in Medina".
"I remember every curse word," he said in answer to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, the commander of the 1999 team, organized the players before the last day of the match.
"We have 12 important players tomorrow, but we need to start successfully as it was in Brooklyn and Medina.
When the initiative moves towards someone else, players in the middle of the distance experience a special pressure.
We put the players in the team, like we're going to, like, do something amazing tomorrow."
Thomas was assigned to try to lead a counter-attack against Rory Makilroy, and then in the first half of the European team, Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fletwood, and Ian Polter.
"Only these partners and in this order I have chosen because I want to make a balanced effort throughout the game," Bjorn commented on his choice of players for individual matches.
The introduction of a new German warship has been postponed
Germany's most modern fleet of military and maritime fleets had to be put into action in 2014 instead of the old war courts of the Cold War, but the local media have reported that this will not happen at least until next year because of bad systems and a sharp increase in costs.
According to Die Zeit, a military intelligence dictionary, the Rhineland-Pfalz ship, the main ship of the modern-day "Baden-Württemberg" series, was postponed until the first half of 2019.
This ship was to join the rest of the fleet in 2014, but the problems that arose after the delivery had damaged the implementation of the ambitious project.
Four Baden-Württemberg ships, which were ordered by the military-marriage in 2007, have to replace the old bridges of the Bremen class.
It is understandable that they will be equipped with a powerful magnet, a set of anti-aircraft and anti-aircraft missiles, as well as some of the technologies to reduce sensitivity, such as radiolocation, infrared and acoustic.
Another important feature is a longer period of technical security, which is expected to be able to keep the new brakes from returning to the base port for about two years.
However, journalists Die Zeit caution that because of the constant delay in the use of modern military ships that were intended to strengthen Germany’s military power in the sea, they will also become obsolete at the time of entry into service.
The F125 heavy-duty frigate entered the headlines of the turk, when the German military and maritime forces officially refused to enter the ship and returned it to the Blohm + Voss Verf in Hamburg.
This is the first case of returning the military ship to the shipyard after delivery.
The reasons for the return were not known, but the German media mentioned significant "programm and equipment defects", through which the warship became inadequate for military operations.
The lack of software is particularly important because the Baden-Württemberg ship consists of about 120 sailors — only half of the army that served on the old Bremen frigates.
In addition, it was found that the vessel has a significant excess of weight, which impairs its operational characteristics and limits the possibilities for further modernization.
It's considered that the Rainland-Pfalz frigate is twice as heavy (7,000 tons) as ships of the same class used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to wrong equipment, another problem has become the total cost of the project, which also includes the cost of equipment preparation.
The expected 2.2 billion euros were converted into a total of 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion U.S. dollars).
The problems of getting new frigates have gained special weight in the light of recent warnings of the defeat of the German military and maritime forces.
At the beginning of the year, an authorized Bundestag from the Hans-Peter Bartels armed forces reported that the WMS had "remained on ships capable of carrying out military tasks".
The officer claimed that the situation had worsened for some time, since the old ships were out of operation and the new ones were not coming.
He expressed his deep regret at the fact that none of the Baden Württemberg frigates could fill the military-sea fleet.
National Trust to Watch the Secret Life of the Bats
A new survey carried out in the territory of the landowners of Scotland is aimed at establishing how bats use the landscape in search of food.
Scientists expect that the data received will help to shed light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals in order to carry out their conservation measures in the future.
In the Inver gardens in West Rossi, scientists of Scotland's National Trust will observe such species as netoper carlic and netoper pigments, as well as common and watery nightfalls.
Special registrants will be placed in strategic locations in the land area to observe the behavior of bats during the season.
Workers and volunteers of Scotland’s National Trust will also conduct mobile studies using hand detectors.
An expert analysis of all recorded sounds will help to establish the frequency and the type of noise of the bats.
Then it's planned to develop a detailed animal residence map and prepare a report to link animal behavior to their environment.
Rob Duar, an expert on the protection of nature in Scotland's National Trust, is expected to help determine what areas of life are most important to bats and how they are used in each species.
This information will help to assess the effectiveness of environmental care measures (e.g. the formation of people) and to identify optimal forest conservation methods for bats and other related species.
During the last century, the population of bats has decreased considerably in Scotland and in Britain.
They are threatened by the active construction and exploitation of territories that deprive them of their places of nesting.
Among other negative factors are wind installations and lighting, rock paper for flies, chemical processing of building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
It's not actually blind.
However, by hunting in the nighttime, their ears are more effective than their eyes.
They use a complex ecolocation method to detect insects and obstacles to the flight path.
In Scotland’s National Trust, which is cared for by over 270 historic buildings, 38 special gardens, and 76,000 acres [76,000 ha] of land throughout the country, the problems of bats are very serious.
Ten specialized experts regularly conduct research, check sites, and sometimes even rescue operations.
The efforts of the organization have even created the first and only battalion reserve in Scotland, which is located in the territory of Triv in the Damfris-and-Gallow area, and has found refuge in eight of the ten battalions living in Scotland.
David Thompson’s manager said that it was a perfect place for them.
"There are three beautiful conditions for bats in the territory," he assures.
"There are old buildings, lots of giant trees and other pleasant living conditions.
But we still need to learn a lot about the bats, and thanks to the research we're doing here and elsewhere, we can learn more about what they need to thrive."
He insists that it is very important to check the area for the presence of bats before any technical work is done, because because of the sudden destruction of one nesting site for young people can kill up to 400 cells with babies, which is likely to cause the destruction of the entire local population.
They are told and their nests are protected by law. Animals are forbidden to kill, torture or torture.
Elizabeth Ferrell, an officer of the Scottish Conservatory, called for public participation in the organization’s efforts.
She said, "We need to learn a lot more about our bats, and we haven't yet discovered the characteristics of the populations of many species."
Ronaldo rejects charges of rape, and his lawyers prepare appeals against the German edition
Kristian Ronald called charges of rape "incendiary" and claimed that people "try to draw attention to themselves," using his name.
His lawyers are ready to file a call against the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published information on suspicions.
U.S.A. Kathryn Majorga accused a Portuguese collective foreman and a Uventus football club in a rape in 2009 in the Las Vegas lobby.
According to Der Spiegel's magazine on Friday, Ronald seems to have paid her $375 000 for silence.
A few hours after the charges were filed, Ronald addressed 142 million of his fans in a videocast in Instagram, calling them the "accelerated" message.
"No, no, no, no, no!
Today's charges are clumsy," said a five-time gold ball owner.
"They want to draw attention to themselves, using my name.
It's natural.
These people want to live with me, but similar situations are part of my work.
I'm a happy man and I'm all right," added the footballer, smiling.
According to the information agency Reuters, Ronald's lawyers are preparing calls against Der Spiegel for published accusations, which they called "an unacceptable report of suspicion in the field of private life".
Lawyer Christian Shertz said the footballer would demand compensation for "moral damage to the extent that corresponds to the seriousness of the breach, which is probably one of the most prominent cases of personal rights violations in recent years."
It is claimed that the recorded incident occurred in June 2009 in the Palms Casino hotel in Las Vegas.
It is reported that after a meeting at a nightclub in Ronald and Majorga, they returned to the player’s room, where he seemed to have raped her, such a witness was handed over to the district court of Clarke County, Nevada.
Majorga claims that after Ronald's incident described, he fell on his knees and said he was a "99 percent good guy", which he raised "one percent."
As noted in the documents, Ronald confirmed that he had sex with a model, but with a mutual agreement.
Majorga also claims that she went to the police, and then to the hospital where her injuries were photographed, but later she agreed to a post-trial settlement because she was afraid of revenge and warned of "public humiliation."
Now a 34-year-old woman wants to cancel the previous deal, because she continues to suffer because of an incident that she said had a place.
At the time of Ronald's recorded incident, he was preparing to move to the Royal Madrid FC with Manchester United FC, and this summer he became an Italian football gang player, Ywentus team, for 100 million euros.
Brexit: Britain will "damaged forever" about the loss of car manufacturers
Britain "will suffer forever" if it loses its world leader's status in the field of car manufacturing after Brexit, which is what the Minister of Economic Affairs, Greg Clarke, warns.
He added that he was fascinated by the statement by Toyota UK, who reported to BBC journalists that in the event of Britain leaving the EU without a contract, the company would have to suspend its production and operation in Bernastan, near Derby.
"We need a deal," says Minister Clark.
The Japanese auto manufacturer claimed that the consequences of the delays on the cordon in Brexit could cost jobs without a contract.
The Toyota - model factory in Bernaston, Auris and Avensis, has released about 150,000 cars, 90% of which have been exported to the rest of the European Union.
"In my view, if Britain is going to leave the EU at the end of March, production at our plant will be stopped," said Marvin Cook, Director General Toyota in Bernaston.
Other car manufacturers, such as Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, are also concerned about how Britain comes out of the EU without an international trade agreement.
For example, BMW stated that a factory from the Mini factory in Oxford would be closed in a month after Brexit.
The main concerns of car manufacturers are that Brexit can risk supply chains without a contract.
Toyota's manufacturer is operating in order to supply the details and materials as needed – the details come every 37 minutes from suppliers in Britain and the EU for the cars that are produced on the order.
If, on March 29, Britain leaves the EU without a contract, there may be a gap in the supply of details that will lead to delays and a lack of material.
According to Toyota's company, you can place no more than one day at a time, so the production will have to stop.
Greg Clarke noted that the EU's Chequers Plan "is designed to avoid problems on the border" in an effort to organize relations with the EU.
"We need an agreement, we need to make the best agreement, which, I think, will enable us not only to achieve success at the present time, but also to benefit from the prospects that have arisen," he said during today's BBC Radio 4 radio program.
"In view of Toyota's testimony to representatives and other car manufacturers, we need to keep the high-efficiency supply chains in place."
Toyota has not been able to report how long production will be halted, but in the long term it is expected that an increase in costs will lead to a reduction in the competitiveness of the plant and, as a result, to reduce jobs.
Peter Covalaris, head of the U.S. trade union at a factory in Bernston, which worked here for 24 years, said that other participants were extremely concerned: "I can say from experience that the short jobs are not being restored."
The representative of the government said, "We have put out an accurate and reliable plan to shape our future relations with the EU."
Trampa and Rosenstein can be repatriated, marked in the White House
As representatives of the White House reported on Sunday, Donald Tramp's meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be "deposit for another week" while the debate on Brett Kawano's candidacy is ongoing.
Rosenstein controls the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Muller, who investigates Russia's involvement in the election, the links between Tromp and Russia's assistants, and the potential violation of justice by the President.
For months in Washington, D.C., there is a discussion of the possibility of release of the Deputy Attorney General, who will endanger the independence of Muller.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein spoke about the use of microphones to record talks with Trampo and the possibility of a brief suspension of the President's office as a 25th amendment.
Rosenstein did not confirm this information.
But last Monday he visited the White House on the ground reports that the official is about to retire.
Instead of this meeting with Trump, who was then in the United Nations headquarters in New York, was assigned to the fourth.
Tramp said "I wouldn't want" to release Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a coincidence with the Senate's Legal Committee, on which to testify to the Kawano and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blaze Ford.
On Friday, Tramp arranged to conduct a weekly FBI investigation into allegations against Kawano, which further suspended the vote in the Senate.
Press Secretary Trampa, Sarah Sanders, appeared on the Fox News Sunday TV show.
When she asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said, "The date of the meeting is not scheduled, and maybe it will take place this week, and I expect it to be postponed for a week, given all the events associated with the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, I'm constantly looking for the latest information in the press."
Some reporters disagree: Sanders did not have a briefing for the media at the White House on September 10th.
Leader Chris Walles asked why.
Sanders replied that the frequent briefings were not about the innocence of the public games on the part of TV reporters, although she added, "I won't be able to deny what they're playing on the audience."
Then she assumed that Tramp himself would communicate more with the press.
"The President answers questions more often than any president," she added, without referring to the source, "Statistics are talking about themselves."
Sanders said the briefings would be held anyway, but "if there's a chance in the press to ask the president, it's better than talking to me."
We're often trying to communicate with the press, and this should be particularly noticeable over the last few weeks, and the possibility of talking to the President of the United States is not worse than a press conference."
The tramp regularly answers the questions when taking action outside the White House, open meetings or press conferences for the participation of high-level guests.
Press conferences are rarely held.
In New York this week, the president may have shown why this is so, in the face of journalists being disappointed and sometimes amazed.
The State Secretary for Health Protection of Scotland addressed EU workers in a letter in connection with fear through Brexit
The Secretary of State of Health has sent a letter to citizens of other EU countries who work at the Scottish National Health Service to express their appreciation for their work and to ask for it to continue after Brexit.
Jean Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before Britain left the EU.
The government of Scotland has already assumed its obligation to cover the cost of the application for the status of a permanent residence for EU citizens working in autonomous state services.
In her letter, Mrs. Freeman said, "Over the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on the issue of exit took place.
But the British government is making preparations for a possible non-conventional outcome.
I know that this period may be very anxious for you.
That is why I would like to stress again how much I appreciate the contribution of every employee, regardless of nationality.
Fellows from all over the European Union and countries within it share valuable experience and skills, strengthening and improving the health care service for the patients and communities we serve.

Cristion Ebercromby has completed a term operation after head injury
The commander of the Tennessee State Tigers team, Kristion Ebercromby, transferred the term after receiving a head injury in a Sunday match against Vanderbillt Komodores, who lost his team with an account at 31:27.
The chief coach of the Tennessee State Tigers team told the reporters that the player was injured shortly before the break.
"He came to the side line where he got sick," said Reid.
On the side line, coaches and medical personnel gave Ebercrombie oxygen before taking it to carry out further examinations.
The official representative of the Tennessee State Tigers team reported to Chris Harris from the WSMV channel, Nashville, Tennessee, that Ebercromby was operating at the University of Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "until there's a witness about the type and severity of the trauma." In the Tennessee State Tigers team, they're trying to find out when the player got the trauma.
Ebercrombie, a second-class student, spent his first season in Tennessee State Tigers after moving from the Illinois team.
He did five rounds of ball on Sunday before he got out of the game, so for the season he had 18 rounds.
Foreign buyers will pay more government taxes if they acquire real estate in Britain
Foreign buyers will pay more charges if they acquire real estate in Britain.
This West neutralizes all Corbin attempts to attract young voters
A higher tax rate will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes in Britain
The Ministry of Finance expects an additional 120 million sterling pounds per year to help homeless people
As Teresa May announced today, foreigners who buy real estate in Britain will pay more taxes, and additional costs will be spent on helping the homeless.
This step can be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbin's efforts to involve young voters in making promises to provide more affordable housing for highly-paid workers.
The increase in customs applies to physical and legal persons who do not pay taxes in Britain.
The additional fee, followed by the increase of two - year - olds in the second house and the real estate assigned to the rent, may be three percent.
The Ministry of Finance is expected to add an additional 120 million pounds per year.
According to experts, 13% of the new real estate built in London is owned by foreign citizens, which leads to higher prices and makes it difficult for those who just dream about their own home.
Many rich areas of the country, especially in the capital, are empty because a large number of foreign buyers spend most of their time outside the country.
The new plan of action appeared only a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in government customs to make the home more accessible to young people.
He accused large construction companies of maintaining high prices for real estate by collecting land without any further use of it, and he urged Teresa May to refuse the quota for real estate in order to correct the "disgusting situation on the housing market" in Britain.
Mr. Corbin announced a series of important reforms in the area of real estate, including the control of rents and the possibility of a safe settlement.
He also proposes to expand the authority of local councils in the area of the construction of a new home.
Theresa May said, "This year I promised that I would dedicate my premierity to the restoration of the British dream - for every new generation of life should be better.
This calls for changes in our imperfect home market.
Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work, and build their future here.
However, it is not fair that individuals who do not live in Britain as well as foreign companies purchase housing under the same conditions as British citizens.
For too many people the dream of their own home has become unattainable, and the problem of living under the open sky is still very painful."
Jack Ross: "I want to be the chief coach of Scotland."
Chief Coach of the Sanderland FC Jack Ross claims that "more than anything" would ever be the head of Scotland's assembly.
A 42-year-old Scottish took to restore the club from the north-east of the country, which now holds the third place in the First Football League, at three points away from the leader.
Ross moved to the Stadium of Light this summer, returning the last season of the Saint-Mirren FC to the Premier League of Scotland.
"I wanted to represent my country as a player.
I went to Scotland's second assembly, but it all ended," Ross told the BBC Scotland radio station during the Sports Sound program.
"When I was a kid, my father and I often watched Scotland's game at the Hampden Park Stadium, which always attracted me.
The only hope for me remains to be successful at the station of the club's chief coach."
The predecessors of Ross at the Sanderland FC, including Dick Advocate, David Moes, Sam Allardis, Martin O'Neill, Roy Kin, Gustavo Poet and Paolo De Canio.
A former FC chief coach Alloa Atletic said he did not feel the excitement of going to a big club after such authoritative names, previously rejecting proposals from FC Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"At the current stage, I'm going to think that it's a success if the club comes back to the Prime Minister.
Because of its structure and material security, this club no doubt corresponds to the Prime Minister's level," he noted.
"It will be a difficult task, but another result I will hardly consider to be successful."
Ross only builds a coach career for three years, he worked as a second coach at the D.M.C. and spent 15 months at the G.C. Training headquarters.
And then he helped Alloa to make the announcement after the FC got to the third division, and in the next season, St. Mary ran from the stage of the flight to getting the title of the first division winners.
According to Ross, he now feels more comfortable than ever during his game career at Clyde, Garthpool, Folkerk, St. Maryren and Hamilton Academy.
"I've been on a break," he says, talking about moving to the Alloa FC.
"I sincerely believed that coaching was more suitable to me than playing.
That sounds strange because I was successful, and I made a good profit on it, and I reached certain heights.
But playing is not easy.
There are many challenges each week to cope with.
I still face them with stress and stress, but as the principal coach, I feel at my place.
I've always been interested in coaching, and I've never felt so comfortable with my adult life since I chose this profession."

Research: 17:30 on Sunday is the perfect time for a beer bowl
Summer heat has helped to increase the pressure on British pubs that survive the worst times, but it has increased the pressure on the restaurant’s network.
The sales figures in the pubs and bars in July increased by 2.7 per cent, while the revenues of the restaurants decreased by 4.8 per cent.
The author of Peter Martin, from CGA, who is consulting business development, said: "Because of the sun's weather and longer than expected, England's participation in the World Championship, July passed the same scheme as the previous month, when the pubs grew by 2.8%, and from the restaurants, things went even worse.
The decrease in redness by 1.8% in July was increased.
The pubs and bars, focused on drinking while having the best performances, are increasing their profits at the same time as the losses of restaurants.
The pubs in which they feed also suffered from heat, but not as severe as restaurants.
It seems that visitors are interested only in drinking.
In the under-control pubs and bars, drinks per month increased by 6.6%, while food sales decreased by 3%."
Paul Newman, an analyst at the RSM's Department of Legal and Commercial Affairs, said, "We've been watching similar trends since the end of April.
Weather and social or sports events remain the main factors that affect domestic sales.
It is not surprising that the groups of restaurants continue to lose their profits. The annual sales drop of 4.8% causes particular concern over the need to cut costs.
The long hot summer was not the best time for food-supply establishments, and we'll see if we can get a more moderate temperature that we've seen in August to give them such a necessary start."
The overall increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new deposits, was 2.7% in July, reflecting a slowdown in the market for new brands.
The gallus indicator of the Coffer Peach Tracker sales volume in the pubs, bars and restaurants of the UK is a picture of the assembled and analyzed productivity indicators of 47 working groups, a total of more than 9 billion pounds of sterling.
Every fifth child has a social network account hidden from his parents.
As research has shown, every fifth child, at times under 11 years of age, has a social account record hidden from parents and teachers
Studies involving 20,000 high school students showed an increase in the number of fictitious pages in Instagram
This news has raised concerns about the possible placement of sexual content
Twenty percent of students reported having a "basic account" showing their parents.
Every fifth child, at times under 11 years of age, creates an accountant in social networks that hides from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed an increase in the number of fictitious pages in Instagram — a social network for the exchange of photographs.
This news has raised concerns about the possible placement of sexual content.
20% of students reported having a clean "basic" account showing their parents, as well as one or more privates.
Mother, who happened to be on the secret page of her 13-year-old daughter, saw the call "violate me."
A study conducted by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters' and Headmasters' Conference (HMC) in private schools showed that 40% of children between the ages of 11 and 18 have two profiles on social networks, and half of these children have recognized that an additional account is a secret.
The head of HMC Mike Bukenen's Association said, "We're very concerned that many teenagers feel a desire to create online spaces where parents and teachers can't find them."
Ailid Doyle will be "a representative of athletes' interests" at the Scottish Athletics Council.
Ailid Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Council as an independent director during the annual general board of members of the government.
Doyle, Scotland’s most famous light plane, has been called this step a great opportunity for those leading the sports movement to take advantage of its wide-ranging experience at the international level over the past decade.
"Eilide is used with great respect among the athletes of Scotland, Britain and the world, and we are convinced that by joining the team, athletic sports in Scotland will be of great benefit," Bettie said.
Doyle said, "I'm going to take the lead in the role of an athlete's representative, and I hope I can really benefit and contribute to the development of sports in Scotland."
An American, a four - time Olympic champion, who won a 200 - and - 400 - foot [200 - 400 m] victory in 1996 in Atlanta, and now a sports viewer for BBC, lost his chance to go through a transitional ischemic attack.
He wrote in Twitter, "I had an stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that it would only be time to see if I could recover and how much.
I learned to walk again and to do dynamic exercises today!
Thank you for your support!"
Women's milk-flavoured advertising compared to cows – Internet user opinions were divided
The manufacturer of milk confectioners met with an inconvenient reaction of Internet users to advertising where young mothers are compared to active cows.
To mark the release of a product called "the first silent, full-blown milker in the world", the technology company of the consumer goods Elvie released an advertisement in the style of a humorous music video to demonstrate the freedom provided by the mother of a new vacuum cleaner.
Four real mothers dance in the blue root under a song containing the words, "Yes, I feed myself, but I don't have tails" and "If you see it yourself, it's not the blood, it's my chest."
And then he sings, "Smooth, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, don't waste the milk."
However, the advertising role, published on Facebook’s page, has led to a noisy online discussion.
The video received 77,000 views and hundreds of comments. However, the Internet user's reaction has proved to be inconsequential. Many have noted that advertising has underestimated the "horrible organization" of milk production in industry.
"It's not very wise to use cows for advertising this product.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and be born to give milk, but their children are taken in half a few days after birth," said one of the users.
Elvie can easily be hidden in the food bottle (Elvie/Mother)
Here's another comment: "It's understood that it's traumatic for both mother and child.
But why don't you bring them in for the milk-flavourers' commercials for women who need to feed their babies?"
Someone else said, "This advertisement is very far from reality."
Other users took the role of advertising. One of the women turned out to be "very fun".
"I think it's a brilliant idea.
I'd definitely get that thing if I were still breast-feeding.
When I was milking, I really felt like a cow.
Advertising was kind of crazy, but I didn’t look for a hidden meaning in it.
It's a wonderful product," someone wrote.
And here's another comment: "A typical advertisement, oriented to a mother who sucks milk (often at work or in the toilet) and feels like cows.
This advertisement is not aimed at highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, the women show the milkers hidden in their buttocks.
The advertising campaign’s concept is based on information that many women who use similar products feel like cows.
However, Elvie's smoker works very quietly, has no wires or pipes and is easily hidden in the kitchen for food. This allows women to move freely, keep children and even go out the street.
Anna Balarin, partner and executive creative director of Mother's advertising agency, commented on the situation: "The Elvie fan is so revolutionary that he demanded a clear and provocative presentation.
Having put together a parallel between women who are breast-feeding and real cows, we wanted to draw attention to the characteristics of breast-feeding, in an exciting and interesting way, demonstrating the incredible sense of freedom that a new smoker will bring.
Elvie's smoker doesn't get the headlines for the first time.
As part of the London Fashion Week, the mother of two children appeared at the store with this product when she showed the clothes from the Martti Jacobovski model.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to the tent town on the Thames border
The number of children detainees has grown sharply, although the number of monthly border crossings remained relatively unchanged, partly because of the harsh rhetoric and politics of the Tramp administration made it difficult to place children in care facilities.
Traditionally, in most cases, caregivers have issued their own immigrants without documents, and now they are afraid to endanger their own ability to stay in the country by offering to take responsibility for the child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential caregivers and other adult members of their households would be obliged to give fingerprints and that these data would be transferred to immigration services.
Last week, Matthew Albens, the senior executive of the Bureau on immigration and customs control, testified to the Congress that the Bureau staff arrested dozens of people who applied for care for minors without escorts.
Later, the Bureau confirmed that 70% of the detainees had no criminal history.
"Approximately 80% of the people who are caregivers or members of their households are illegal in the country, many of whom are foreigners who have committed a crime.
So we continue to persecute these people," said Mr. Albens.
According to the workers of the shelter, to discuss matters of children more quickly, officials introduced new rules that would require some of the children to appear in court during the month after detention, not after 60 days, as before.
Many of them will be able to use videoconferencing rather than go to court on their own to prove their legal status before immigration judges.
Those who do not have the right to receive asylum will be deported quickly.
According to employees of shelter and official data from responsible officials in recent months, as long as children remain in custody, the more likely they will be to feel anxiety or depression, which may cause the flames of violence or the attempts to escape.
Travelers claim that these problems are reinforced in larger institutions, such as Thornillo, where it is more difficult to keep track of children’s psychological status.
They added that by moving children to a tent town and not giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or to make friends, we risk strengthening the trauma that many of them have already experienced.
Syria ordered the U.S., France and Turkey to expel the troops immediately.
Also, speaking before the UN General Assembly, the Foreign Minister, Valid al-Mualam, urged Syrian refugees to return home, although the war has lasted for eight years in the country.
The museum, which also serves as the deputy prime minister, has stated that foreign forces have been illegally staying on the Syrian land in the cause of combating terrorism, so "their attitude will be appropriate."
"They have to go immediately and not put the conditions," he said to the assembly.
The museum insisted that "war on terrorism is actually over" in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have died since 2011, and millions have left their homes.
He said Damascus will continue "this sacred battle until we clear all Syrian territories" by terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence."
The United States has deployed some 2,000 military personnel in Syria, mainly teaching and consulting Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs, who are protesting against President Bashar al-Assad.
In a devastated war country, France sent more than 1,000 soldiers.
With regard to refugees, the Mualem made sure that the country had the right conditions for their return, and he also blamed "some Western countries" for the fact that they "extend unwarranted fears", which do not force refugees to return.
"We have called on international co-operatives and humanitarian organizations to help people come back," he said.
"We're watching an attempt to put together a humanitarian problem."
The United States and the European Union warn that Syria will not be helped to rebuild the country until the political agreement between Assad and the opposition to the war ceases.
The United Nations diplomats report that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the creation of a buffer zone around Idlib, the last large number of rebels, has made it possible to continue political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkey Agreement has prevented the massive rise of the Syrian forces supported by Russia in the province where three million people live.
However, the Mualam stressed that the agreement had "clear terms", and expressed hope that military action would be directed against the Georgians, including the Al-Qaeda Front, who would be "destructed".
UN Emissar Staffan de Mistura is expected to call for the first meetings of a new committee to be held by government and opposition representatives to develop a post-war constitution for Syria and to create conditions for elections.
The museum set out conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, stating that its work should be limited to "reviewing articles of the actual constitution", and warned against interference.
Why Trampa Will Be Reelected
According to this logic, Trampa can be re-elected in 2020 if, as many liberals are likely to expect, it does not constitute powers until after the scandal and imprimement.
Without a doubt, it would be the most dramatic completion of the presidency at all times!
At the moment, viewers do not give a hint of fatigue.
Since 2014, the number of viewers in the premium has doubled more than (up to 1.05 million) on the CNN channel and has actually tripled (up to 1.6 million) on the MSNBC channel.
According to Nilsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in the prime, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and The Rachel Maddow Show on the MSNBC cable channel was at the top of the rating of 3.5 million audiences in the evening when the main news is being discussed.
"It's a fire that attracts people because it's out of our understanding," said Neil Ber, a filmmaker with "Last Candidate" on the ABC channel, about a state secretary who becomes president after a devastating attack on the Capitol.
Nell Skowell, an experienced Gumourist writer and author of the book "More funny moments: as well as a few harsh truths about entering the Hollywood Men's Club," suggests another theory.
She recalled a taxi trip in Boston before the 2016 election.
The leader told her to vote for the Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
"Because he's making me laugh," he said.
Chaos is entertaining.
Of course, unlike any other content on TV, Washington's stories are capable of identifying the future of Row versus Wade, the possibility of joining immigrant families and the state of the world's economy.
It is a luxury that can be afforded only by the most privileged viewers.
And yet you can't say that you're just trying to stay informed by citizens when you watch a group of experts discuss using Bob Woodworth's "well-known" sources for his book Strah, the short Paul Manafort from the Straus skin for $15,000 (the "wear for the Various" -- as written in The Washington Post) and the shocking results of Mr. Tramp's anatomy, published by Storm Daniels.
For me, for example, Super Mario will never be a former.
"The reality of the show is partly related to the fact that you get something new every night," said Brent Montgomery, Chief Executive Director of Wheelhouse Entertainment, and the author of the "Stars of the Lamb's" television program, about the rotations in the actor's composition and the daily affairs of the "Tramp" show.
If you allow yourself to miss a single episode, you can be hopelessly lost.
When this week I was able to meet Mr. Fles in his house on the northern coast of the island of Cauai, a warm sunny weather (27 degrees Fahrenheit) stood, but he sat at home looking at the MSNBC and writing the CNN.
He could not get rid of the TV — not when Brett Cavano was put before the Senate's Legal Committee, but the future of the Supreme Court was hanging on his hair.
"I remember how we created all those crazy shows in our time, and people said it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization," Mr. Fles told me.
"I took it as a joke, but it looks like they were right."

External impact of the cost in Congress's toughest intermediate election
It's not surprising that in Pennsylvania's 17th district, there's an additional cash impact, because two actual congressmen are being asked for one chair through the polling districts.
In the struggle for this primitive region of Pittsburgh, whose borders have recently been changed, a democracy enters, a member of the House of Representatives Connor Lemb, who won the victory in another district in the additional elections last spring.
Lemb opposes another actual congressman, the Republic of Kitt Rottfs, now representing the 12th district of Pennsylvania, whose borders are largely related to the new 17th.
The cards were recast after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in January approved the decision that the old borders of the region were designated for the benefit of the Republican against the Constitution.
The pre-elections in the new 17th district sparked fierce opposition between the financial divisions of the main parties, the U.S. Democratic Party Committee of Congress elections (DCCC) and the National Committee of the Republican Party (NRCC).
Lemba's name became very famous in Pennsylvania after winning the 18th district's minimum victory during the Congress's additional election in March, which was used by the general public.
This place belonged to the Republicans for over a decade, and President Donald Tramp won a 20-point victory in this district.
Political experts have given little priority to democracy.
In the United States, El Salvador's punishment for China's support was considered, but it was reconsidered.
The diplomats recalled the weak opposition from Washington to the actions of the Dominican Republic and Panama, who had previously supported Beijing’s position.
In June 2017, Tramp had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela. Tramp had also had a hotel in Panama before the partners removed the staff hired by Trump Organization.
Officials of the State Department decided to call back U.S. diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama through "the recent decisions on Taiwan's ignorance," said the Press Secretary of the Department Geser Noiert early this month.
But sanctions were only directed against El Salvador, who received about $140 million in American aid in 2017, particularly in the field of drug control, as well as in support of social and economic development.
The proposed fines, which provided for the reduction of financial assistance and the limitation on the issuing of visas, would be painful for this country of Central America with its high level of unemployment and murder.
As a result of the internal councils of the North American and Central American states, the conference was postponed at a high level, dedicated to security and economic prosperity, and the similar development took place last year, and it was assessed as a step forward in the efforts to keep the flow of migrants in the United States.
But by mid-September, the high-level representatives of the administration had made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place. In fact, the question of sanctions against El Salvador was stopped.
According to diplomats, Vice-President Mike Pens is now planning to attend a conference scheduled for mid-October, a sign that the administration considers this development to be very important.
The three American envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic, for there was no new harsh news or punishment on the part of Washington.
Mr. Bolton’s representative in the White House refused to comment on the details of the internal discussions, which were reported by three American officials, two of whom were diplomats, on terms of anonymity.
The information they provided was confirmed by a foreign analyst near the administration, who also spoke on the terms of anonymity.
Learn History
The following discomfort may be the report of Special Prosecutor Robert Muller on possible violations of the justice of Trampa, the weight of confirmation of why public information can now be found.
As reported, the Müller investigation examines the possible link between the Trump campaign and the attack on our Russia voting system.
If the influence of the Congress is to go into other hands, the Trump will have to report to conventioners, as well as to the voters and finally to the allies.
In this case, a lot of 'if', and I don't want to say that the fall of the Trump is imminent, just like his colleague in Europe.
All of us on both sides of the Atlantic must make a choice that determines the duration of the struggle.
In 1938, German officials were ready to set up a coup against Hitler if only the West began to oppose him and supported the Chechnya in Munich.
We have failed, and we have lost the chance to avoid bloodshed.
The wave of history is defined at such critical moments, and the unsustainable movement of democracy is accelerated or slowed down.
The Americans are now waiting for a few of these breakthroughs.
What will we do if Tramp is fired by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the person who is responsible for Mr. Muller's fate?
Rosenstein came into the hall as soon as there was information in this paper that he proposed to secretly record talks with the president and shared his views on the issue of the failure of the Tromp post.
Rosenstein called the information in The Times incorrect.
"How do we react if the investigation against Brett Kawano, who recently started the FBI, is not fair enough, or if Kawano's candidacy is confirmed in the Supreme Court, despite convincing charges in sexual harassment and false testimony?
And, first of all, are we going to vote in the middle of the year for those members of the Congress who will be able to bring about the responsibility of the Trump?
If we fail these tests, there will be bad times for democracy.
But I don't think we're going to do it because of the lesson I took in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew who was deported to Osvencim by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my post office.
She survived, immigrated to America, and for 60 years, she sent me to burn the candles on the table with a satchel.
With such a legacy, can I not look to the future with optimism?"

Gram Dorrans from Rangers with optimism awaits meetings with the Vienna Rapid.
The Rangers FC accepts Rapids on Thursday. After an impressive nobody in Spain in the game of Villareal at the beginning of this month's victory over Austrians will provide the Scottish club with a good chance to get out of the G League of Europe.
Because of the trauma of the knee, the semi-trailer, Grem Dorrans, for the first time in the season, was able to play for his team only in the whale with the "Villareal", which ended with account 2:2. However, he believes that the FC "Randers" can use this result as a trampline to achieve greater.
"It was a good result for us because "Villarreal" is a strong team," said a 31-year-old player.
"We went out to play with hope to get something and got one point.
At the end of the match, we might be able to move forward, but no one at all is likely to be justified.
In the first time, the opponent was better, but after the break, we corrected the situation for our benefit.
There will be another major opposition in Europe on Thursday.
I hope we can get three points, but it's not easy. Our future opponents have shown a good result in their last game, but we can count on the support of the shooters, and I'm sure we can win the fight and get the positive result.
Last year, of course, it was difficult, starting from my trauma and ending the changes in the club itself, but now the situation has been normalized.
We have a great store, and all the boys are happy.
I hope we can move on, leave behind the past season and succeed."
Women lose their sleep because of the threat of retirement
Despite the fact that the interviewers had a clear idea of how they wanted to organize care for themselves, few had talked about it with members of their family.
Nearly half of the people who participated in the Nationalwide survey said that they talked to their husband or wife about the value of long - term care.
Only 10% of the respondents talked to the children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't rush to have a conversation on this," said Holly Snyder, vice president of the Nationalwide Division of Life Insurance.
Here's what we need to start with.
Talk to your husband or wife and children: your family can't provide you with the care you need if you don't tell your loved ones in the past.
Consult your consultant and your family to determine where and how to get care, because this choice can be an important factor in determining the value.
Include a financial adviser: He may advise you on how to cover your expenses.
The sources of long-term care include the traditional insurance policy, the hybrid life insurance policy, or the self-sustainment of your own funds.
Carefully prepare legal documents: This will enable you to avoid the legal burden in advance.
Prepare for your representative who will monitor your medical care and monitor your wishes if you are unable to do so personally.
We also recommend that we build trust in money management.
Choose a trusted person who will make a financial decision for you and pay the bills if you are unable to do so.
Do not forget about minor details. Imagine that one of your parents is in need of immediate medical attention, so he is being taken to the hospital.

In Ilfrakum, a man shot several times from a pneumatic gun
The man fired a few times from the pneumatic gun when he returned home from the party.
A 40-year-old victim was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfrakum, Devon, when he was shot in his chest, his life, and his hand.
The officers described the shooting that took place at 02:30 in British summer time as "accidentality."
The victim didn't see the attacker.
His wounds pose no threat to life, and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people died as a result of a powerful earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian city of Pala on Friday, reports government officials, but the number of victims may rise.
As a result of getting out of the system of liaison, officials dealing with humanitarian aid are unable to obtain any information from Dongal Regency, a region north of Pala, which is located closer to the magnitude of the magnitude of the magnitude of the magnitude 7.5 points.
After a natural disaster, 16,000 people were evacuated from Pala.
Let us consider a few basic facts about the location of the island of Sulavesi in the city of Pala and the regency of Dongal.
Pala, capital of the province of Central Sulavesi, located at the end of the narrow bay on the western coast of the island of Sulavesi, with a population of 379,800 according to the 2017 data.
When a tsunami struck, the city celebrated its 40th anniversary.
Dongala is a regency that extends more than 300 km (180 km) along the coast line in the northwestern part of the island of Sulavesi.
According to the 2017 Regency Report, about 299,200 people live in the administrative region located in the lower part of the province.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main sectors of the economy of the province of Central Sulavesi, especially the Dongal Coast.
Nickel’s income is also important in the province, but mainly concentrated in Morovala, on the opposite coast of Sulavesi.
According to the Indonesian Agency for Natural Disaster Mitigation, over the past 100 years, Paul and Dongal have suffered from tsunamis several times.
As a result of the tsunami in Dongal, more than 200 people died in 1938 and hundreds of homes were destroyed.
In 1996, the tsunami also covered the western part of Dongal, and nine men died.
Indonesia is located in a seismicly active Pacific fire ring and is regularly affected by earthquakes.
The following are some of the largest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years.
2004: On December 26, a strong earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceg, located in northern Sumatra, caused tsunamis that struck 14 countries, resulting in the death of 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in the province of Aceg.
2005: At the beginning of March, a series of powerful earthquakes broke out on the west coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias near the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of 6,8 inches south of Java, the most densely populated island of Indonesia, caused tsunamis that devastated the southern coast, resulting in the deaths of some 700 people.
2009: Near the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra, an earthquake of 7.6 points.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: The 7.5 - inch - high earthquake struck one of the Mentawa islands near Sumatra, causing tsunamis to reach a height of 10 metres, resulting in the destruction of tens of thousands of lives and the death of about 300 people.
2016: A weak earthquake has broken down on the Regency of the Acheg province, causing a disaster and panic related to the fact that people have not yet managed to forget the devastating earthquake and tsunamis in 2004.
This time, there were no tsunamis, but more than 100 people were killed under the collapse of buildings.
2018: Strong earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia, resulting in more than 500 deaths, mainly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed countless homes, and thousands of tourists could not immediately leave the island.
The oldest son of Sara Pailin was arrested for domestic violence
Treka Pailin, the eldest son of former governor Alaska and the candidate for the post of Vice President Sara Pailin, were arrested for the charge of the attack.
According to a report published on Saturday by the Alaska State Police, 29-year-old Pailina from Vasily, Alaska, was arrested for suspected domestic violence and accused that he had obstructed the report on the incidents of violence and had objected during the arrest.
According to a police report, when a known woman tried to call the police to report possible crimes, he picked up the phone.
According to KTUU, Pailin is currently in charge of Matanuska-Susitna's tracking insulator with the right to make a 500-dollar flag.
He put before the court on Saturday, where he declared himself "innocent", when he was asked if he admitted his guilt, reported online.
Pailina is accused of three Class A offences, which foresees a term arrest of up to a year and a fine of $250,000.
He's also charged with Class B violations, which is punishable by a prison day and a fine of $200.
For the first time, Pileen has been charged with criminal charges.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Paylin.
His mother, Sarah Paylin, called the police and reported a possible attack.
The case is now before the Court of the veterans of Alaska.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, as well as of obstructing reports of domestic violence and carrying arms in a state of alcohol abuse when this incident occurred.
His girlfriend said he hit her face.
In 2016, Sara Paylin was criticized for justifying her son’s cruel conduct with post - traumatic stress after serving in Iraq.
In Indonesia, an earthquake caused hundreds of tsunamis to die
At least 384 people died after the earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulavesi on Friday.
A 7.5 - ball earthquake caused tsunamis and destroyed hundreds of homes.
Networks of connections and power supply are out of power, and the number of victims can increase in the next few days.
The earthquake took place near the center of the island of Sulavesi, located on the north east of the capital of Jakarta, Indonesia.
The video that spreads on social media shows a moment when a disaster struck.
Hundreds of people gathered at a festival on the beach of Pala, when the tsunami broke down on the shore.
Federal prosecutors demand a rare death penalty for a suspect in a New York assault.
In New York, federal prosecutors demand the death penalty of Saifllo Saipov, suspected of being a terrorist in New York, resulting in the death of eight persons, a rare punishment that has not been applied in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
As they say, in October, 30-year-old Saip, a driver hired at the Home Depot pickup went on a bicycle track along a road in the West Side, Lower Manhattan, and started killing bikers and pedestrians that hit him on the way.
In line with the report of the intention to help the death of the state of New York in order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors must prove that Saip was "unreasonably" killing eight persons and "unreasonably" seriously injured the body.
According to court records, each of these charges provides for the possibility of a death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, the Federal jury filed Saikov's charges for 22 counts, including eight counts of murder for the purpose of prosecution, which are usually carried out by federal prosecutors in cases involving organised crime, as well as charges of violence and the destruction of road transport.
According to the prosecutors who described Saipov's crime as "a cruel, cruel and cruel one," this attack is the result of "a thorough planning and a preconceived thought."
The victims of Saiflla Habibulaevic Saipov's injuries, injury or murder, became Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, Ann-Lora Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlich, Ernan Ferro, Ernan Diego Mendos, and Alejandro Damian Pagnukko, as described in the report of the purpose.
Five of the dead were tourists from Argentina.
It's been ten years since there was a last-minute criminal case in the South of New York County, which is being punished with a death penalty.
The defendant, Khalida Barnes, was found guilty of the murder of two drug providers and was finally sentenced to eternal imprisonment in September 2009.
For the last time, the death penalty for the federal case was committed in New York in 1953.
On June 19, 1953, the Rosenbergs died.
According to Saipov’s court records, the Uzbek native showed no remorse in the following days and months after the attack.
According to the police, he said to the investigator that he was not harming the scene.
According to Saipov’s indictment, the authorities told him that he was inspired by the video IDI that he was viewing on his phone.
The police report that he also asked to hang the IDI flag in his hospital room.
He did not blame himself for the 22nd sentence.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "very disappointed" with such a decision by the prosecutor's office.
"We believe that the decision to seek a death penalty instead of accepting confession of guilt and condemning eternal imprisonment without the possibility of release, will only strengthen the psychological trauma caused by these events to all the victims," Patton said.
The defense party of Saipov also earlier asked the prosecutors not to demand a death penalty.
MP from the Conservative Party believes that NAYJELA FARADJA needs to be appointed the responsible for the Brexit negotiations
Today, during a protest campaign at the Conservative Party, Nigel Faraj promised to "mobilize the People's Army".
The former leader of the UK Independence Party stated that politicians should "see pressure on themselves" Eurosceptics, since one of the MPs in Teresa May proposed their candidacy for negotiations with the EU.
A member of the Conservative Party Peter Bowe said on the march in Birmingham that the United Kingdom would "have come out" if Mr. Faraj was Secretary Brexit.
Attention to May's problems, trying to reconcile their deep-seated ranks, has further led to the fact that Members of the Conservative Party, who stand against the exit, joined a special protest campaign in the city against Brexit.
The prime minister is trying to put a compromise plan on Chequers, despite the attacks on Brexit's supporters, those against the exit, and the EU.
The Allies insist that they will not let themselves be able to deal with Brussels, despite the negative reaction, and will force Eurosceptics and Laborists to choose between what they propose, and the chaos.
At the Leave Means Leave meeting in Seoul, Mr. Bowe said he wanted to "response to the Chequers."
He invited Mr. Faraj to leave the shadows and assume responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he had answered for it, we would have come out," he said.
Parliament MP Wellingboro added, "I will support Brexit, but we must reject the Chequers."
Speaking against the EU, he said, "We fought in world wars, not for subordination.
We want to adopt our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bowe rejected the assumption that, after voting in 2016, the public opinion changed: "The idea that the British have changed their mind and do not want to go out is totally inconsistency."
A member of the Conservative Party and Brexit Andrea Jenkins, who was also on the march, said to the reporters, "I'm just saying, "Minister, listen to people.
The Chequers plan is unpopular among the general public, the opposition is not going to vote for it, it is not supported by our party and our activists, who actually walk the streets and fight for the voters' votes.
Please reject the Chequers and start listening."
In reference to Teresa May, she added, "Ministers keep their position when they make promises."
Mr. Faraj said politicians should "see pressure on themselves" if they were to refuse the decision taken at the 2016 referendum.
"Now it's a matter of trust between us, people and our political elite," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell them it won't come out of their hands."
In a message to the full enthusiasm of the crowd, he added, "I want our political elite, who is planning to betray Brexit's idea, to feel pressured.
We are mobilizing the national army of this country, which will lead us to the victory in Brexit and will never be satisfied until we become an independent, self-government, proud United Kingdom."
In the meantime, the opposers of the exit went through Birmingham and then held a two - hour meeting in the center of the city.
Several activists blew the banners against Brexit when the group launched these outputs.
The Lebanese Lord Adonis smiled at the conservatives because after the conference, security problems arose because of their party program.
"These people who tell us that they can use the IT systems and technologies needed for Canada-plus, well-organized border, free trade with Ireland," he commented.
"It's a complete farce.
There's nothing good in Brexit," he added.
Warren's planning to "consider seriously" about the President's role as the president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said that after the November elections, she "will think seriously about going to the president's office."
The Boston Globe reports that on Saturday during the general congregations in Western Massachusetts, a representative of the Democratic Party of Massachusetts told about his future.
Warren, who often criticises President Donald Tramp, battles in November in the second term against a member of the Republic's Jeff Dil Party, who was the leader of the Tromp campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
It is considered to be the main candidate to fight Tramp in 2020.
On Saturday afternoon, her 36th meeting with the electorate was held in the form of general congregations since Tramp entered the post.
The participant asked her if she was planning to take part in the presidential election.
Warren said, "It's time for women to go to Washington and set up a government, and for that to be his head, there must be a woman."
They arrested a suspect in the murder of a basketball player named LSU Tigers.
In Baton-Ruz police, Louisiana, on Saturday, it was reported that on Friday, the suspect was arrested for murder by the LSU Tigers, a basketball player, Wade Sims.
The Baton-Ruz Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Diton Simpson at a press conference at 11 o'clock in the morning.
On Friday, they published a video shoot asking to help identify a person on it.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot at the campus at the University of Southern on Friday morning.
"Vade Sims got a fire wound in his head and died as a result," said reporters on Saturday 247sports police chief Murphy J. Paul.
Wade joined his friend, and Simpson shot him.
The survey found that Simpson was in a crime scene, had a gun with him, and was shooting at Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody in East-Bonton County Police Department.
Sams, who was 6 feet and 6 inches tall and who was in the junior league, grew up in Baton-Ruz, played 32 games with 10 stars in the past season, and spent on the average of 17.4 minutes in the field, picked 5.6 points and 2.9 choices.
Gran-Fri Russia: Lewis Hamilton cut off the world champion's retreat after the team decided to give him victory over Sebastian Fettel.
Since Walter Botts left behind Louis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that Mercedes’s command decisions would play a significant role in the race.
Botts had a bad start with a pul-post and almost went to Gemilton, who was trying to keep his position on the first two turns and gave Fettel the opportunity to attack his friend on the team.
Fettel went to the pit stop first and left Hamilton on the track in the tail of a race that had to be decided.
The pilot of the Mercedes team went another round and went after the Fettel, but Hemilton broke out in the leader after a certain wheel-to-wheel maneuver, resulting in the Ferrari driver reluctantly left the inner space because of the risk that he would be stuck, after the double manoeuvre had been able to pull forward on the third turn.
On his 21st birthday, Max Ferstappen started from the rear row of the network and remained in the seventh place until the end of the first round.
Later, he led most of the race because he did not change the tires so that he could quickly come to the finish and contain Kimmy Rykconen from fourth place.
In summary, he stopped at the pit stop on the 44th round, but could not increase the pace of the last eight, because of the fact that Rickkonen planted the fourth place.
"It's a difficult day, because the Walters were teaching full on all the exits and showing the glory when he gave me the opportunity to go.
The team carried out an exceptional job to sit first and second," said Hemilton.
The language of the body was not impressed
At a meeting on Saturday, President Donald Tramp smiled at Senator Diane Finnstein for her firm position that she had not declared the contents of Christine Blaise Ford, who accused a candidate for the Supreme Court of Brett Kawano of sexual violence.
At a meeting in West Virginia, the President did not address directly the statement given by Ford before the Senate's Legal Committee, but instead expressed his opinion on the events in the Senate, which, he said, demonstrated human "fate, shame and falsehood".
"The only thing that could happen, and all the wonderful things that's going on in the Senate in the last few days, is anger, you see the evil people who demonstrate vanity, shame and falsehood," he said.
"You look at the publications and the information published, and then they say, "Oh, I didn't.
It's not me."
Remember?
Diane Finnstein, have you announced the information?
Remember her answer... have you announced the contents of the documents? "What?
Oh, no.
I did not declare it."
Wait a minute.
No, we didn't," he added, copying the senator's behavior.
In July, Finnstein received a letter containing a detailed statement of the charges brought against Mr. Ford against the Kawano, and its contents were announced in early September, but Finnstein denied that the information had come to light in her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusation, I didn't disclose the information she had received," The Hill told the Finnish Committee.
"She asked me to keep it secret, and I didn't break my promises."
However, her rejection seems to have been unpopular to the president who commented during the Saturday meeting, "I'll tell you, the language of her body has not been impressed at all.
Maybe she didn't do it, but I haven't seen anyone holding down the worse."
As he continued to defend the candidate to the Supreme Court, whose three women were accused of sexual violence, the president admitted that democracies were using charges for their own ends.
"They are determined to restore power in any necessary way.
You see vanity, shame, they're all the same, they're going to be offended, they're going to have to go through it to get power and control," the President quoted Mediaite as saying.
Elite League: "Dandy Scar" - "Belfast Giants", 5:3
The "Jeants" player Patrick Duyer threw two sharks in a match against "Dandy"
Dandi Schar was rehabilitated for a Friday break in an elite league from Belfast Giants, winning a match-response with account 5:3 on Saturday.
"Jeants" were given an early advantage in two shabby due to the kidnappings of Patrick Duyer and Francis Bowley.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney compared the account in the home match, and then Douayer took the Giants out again.
The player "Dandy" François Bushar compared the bill, and the two goals of Lucas Lundwald Nielsen secured their victory.
This is the third in the season of the elite league defeat of Adam Kiff, who won a volleyball victory over Dandi at 2:1 a.m. on Friday in Belfast.
This is the fourth team meeting in the season.
The first showbub of Dweyer was released at 4 p.m. (3:35) after Kendal McFol, and four minutes later, Boville, who received the show from David Rezerford, doubled the bill.
After the first tense period for the fourteenth minute (13:10) Sullivan returned the owners of the field to play, and for the sixteenth minute (15:16) Connie, having received a knife from Matt Markardt, compared the bill.
Dwyer won the Xiants advantage before the first break, throwing his second show at the end of the first period.
The masters of the fields were regrouped, and the Busher reassessed the account at twenty-eight minutes (27:37) and threw the ship off when his command was numerically out of control.
Thanks to the efforts of Cooney and Charles Corporan Nielsen at the end of the second period, Dandi was the first to win his team in the fifth half of the last period.
On Friday, the Giants team, who has lost four of the last five matches, is playing an escape match against Milton Kines.
The air inspector died so that hundreds of people on the plane could escape the earthquake
A planeman in Indonesia was declared a hero after he helped fly hundreds of people at the price of his own life.
Over 800 people died and many disappeared after a severe earthquake that caused tsunamis on the island of Sulavesi on Friday.
Strong underground currents continue to penetrate this area, and many people have been trapped in the city of Pala.
However, unlike his colleagues who fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunavan Agung refused to leave his post in a dispatch tower, which was badly damaged, at the airport of Muteira SIS Al-Juffre in Pala.
He remained in place to make sure that the 6321 Batik Air airline, which was then on the air, was safely up in the air.
Then he burst out of the dysliptic tower when he thought he was ruining it.
Then he died in the hospital.
A representative of the Indonesian air navigation service provider Johannes Siruit stated that this decision could save hundreds of lives, reports the Australian ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan, which had to be delivered to a larger hospital in another city.
Sadly, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Paul.
"We're very sorry to hear about it," he added.
Meanwhile, the authorities are afraid that the number of victims can reach thousands, as the agency, with the mitigation of the country's natural disaster, claims that access to the city of Dongal, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The number of victims can grow, because many bodies are still under break, and many of them cannot be reached," said a representative of Soutopo Purvo Nugroho.
The six - foot - high [6 m] - high - high [6 m] was devastated by the city of Paul, where the mass burials will take place on Sunday.
Military and passenger planes provide assistance and food.
Riza Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute a quick help brings the body.
Clean water is not enough.
The mini-markets are robbed everywhere."
The head of the International Committee of the Red Cross in Indonesia, Jan Helfand, told CNN: "The Red Cross of Indonesia is speeding up to help people who have survived this tragedy, but we don't know that they will be there.
It's a tragedy, but it can get much worse."
The president of Indonesia, Joco Ovido, came to Paul on Sunday and asked the country's military personnel, "I ask you all to work day and night to do all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?", reports CNN.
At the beginning of this year, Indonesia suffered earthquakes on the island of Lombok, resulting in more than 550 deaths.
A plane crash in Micronesia: As stated in Air Niugini, after a plane crash into the lagoon one man disappeared unconscious
The airline that was carrying out a voyage that had suffered disasters in the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia now claims that one man had disappeared unconsciously, although it had been reported that all 47 passengers and crew were successfully evacuated from a ton aircraft.
In Air Niugini, it was said that one passenger could not be found by the state on Saturday.
The airline reports that its representatives are trying to find a man and are working with local authorities, hospitals, and prosecutions.
The airline did not respond immediately to a request for further information about the passenger, such as his age and nationality.
Local boats helped to rescue other passengers and crew after the plane crashed when it tried to land at Chuk Island Airport.
On Friday, officials reported that seven men had been taken to the hospital.
In the airline it was reported that six passengers stayed in the hospital on Saturday, and all of them were in stable condition.
The cause of the disaster and the precise sequence of events are unknown.
In the airline and the U.S. Air Force, it was said that the plane landed in the lagoon not far from the flight deck.
Some witnesses believe that the plane has crossed the flight deck.
U.S. passenger Bill Janes said that the plane was very low on the ground.
"It's very good," said Janes.
Janes told me that he and others managed to get to an emergency exit on a ton of water while they were in the water.
He told me that the stewards were panicking and shouting and that he had a slight headache.
In the U.S.U., it was reported that sailors working close to modernization also helped in rescue operations by transporting people to the shore by means of an airship before the plane sinked at a depth of 30 metres (100 feet) of water.
According to the Aviation Safety Network data for the last two decades, 111 people have been killed in aircraft accidents related to the PNG aircraft, but the list does not include Air Niugini.
The analyst restored the chronology of the night the woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecution violated the case against a man accused of burning women from Mississippi alive in 2014.
A U.S. Ministry of Justice analyst Paul Roulette witnessed as an expert in operational development for several hours.
He told the jury how he used cell phone records to replay the movement of the 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim of Jessica Chambers on the night of the murder.
Roulette, as reported by The Clarion Ledger, reported that he had received location data from a number of mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers that night when she died that she would object to his previous claim.
When the data showed that his cell phone was next to Chambers, even though he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to the last.
On Saturday, Sanford gave a witness and claimed that he was not in town that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said that that night was in the Sanford pickup, Sanford said he was "false, because my pickup was in Nashville."
Another incompatibility was that Tellis claimed that he knew Chambers about two weeks before her death.
Phone records indicated that they only knew each other for weeks.
Roulette explained that after some time after the death of Chambers Tellis, he sent text messages, calls, and contact information from Chambers on his phone.
"He stared her from his life," said Gail.
The defense must set out its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge expects the trial to be handed over to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: what is a conscious hip-hop?
Three hip-hop executives want to challenge a negative view of the genre, filling their music with constructive messages.
The High Breed Group in Bristol claims that hip-hop has changed its nature – has gone away with political ideas and struggles to solve social problems.
They want to go back to the sources and make a conscious hip-hop popular again.
Such artists as The Fugees and Commons have recently witnessed the restoration of this direction in the United Kingdom by such groups as Akala and Lowkey.
One more dark-haired?
In New York, she gave a call to a couple for release after receiving a "racist" message.
In New York, she made a call for a couple for a discriminatory release after she received a wrong-addressed message from a mother with a complaint that she was "one more dark."
The couple denies that they're racist, comparing the calls to "request."
Lucy Plasco-Flackman, having two children, expressed concern when she saw that a new bride, Giselle Morris, who came to her first working day in 2016, was a black girl.
"We'll have one dark," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flackman to her husband in a message.
Instead of sending him to her husband, however, she sent him to Miss Morris twice.
As New York Post reports, when she realized her mistake, Mrs. Plaxon-Flexman felt uncomfortable and released Ms. Morris, saying that their previous African-American bride was doing her job badly and that instead she was expecting a Filipino bride.
Ms. Morris paid for one day's work, and then they sent him home to Uber.
Now, Maurice is putting a couple in court, hoping to get compensation for the pay-off that she would get in six months of living with the marriage that she was first hired, even without a contract, and she had to pay $350 a day.
"I want to show them what they don't have to do," she said on Friday and added, "I know it's discrimination."
In response to the accusation that they were racists, the couple stated that the release of Morris was a wise decision, for they were afraid that they could not trust her after being insulted.
"My wife didn't mean what she sent her.
She's not a racist.
"We're not racist," said the Post of her husband Joel Plasco.
"But would you leave your children with the man who was rude, even if it wasn't intentional?
Your baby?
'Bye.'
Comparing the call with the "request," Plasco said his wife had only born a child two months ago and "was not yet informed."
"Would you blame someone after that?
It's a bad act," added the investment banker.
Although the trial is still ongoing, the court of public opinion quickly condemned this couple in social networks, criticizing their behavior and logic.
According to the New Letter, the publishers of Paddington were afraid that readers would not understand the idea of a bear capable of speaking
The daughter of Bond Karen Yankel, who was born almost immediately after the book was agreed to print, said about the letter: "It's hard to put herself in the place of the one who reads the book for the first time before it was published.
Now it's funny, because we know of the huge success that has been achieved by the story of Paddington."
Speaking of her father, who worked as a BBC operator, before a little toy bear inspired him to write a child's book, optimizingly put his job down, she shared, as at the 60th anniversary of the book's release, she felt "happy and sad," because her father died a year ago.
With regard to Padington, whom she describes as "a very important member of our family," Karen added that her father quietly boasted that the book became so popular.
"He was quite a humble man and didn't like to boast," she said.
"But Padington was as real to him as his own child! For when the children reach something, we boast of them, although it is not theirs, not our victories.
I think he was looking at the success of Paddington just like that.
Although Sandington was the creation of his imagination, he always attributed success to him."
My daughter died, and I had to make a phone call.
After her daughter was buried, she was transferred to a hospital called Louis Pastera in Nice, where doctors were unsuccessfully trying to save her life.
"Nada used to call regularly, said everything was really bad that she shouldn't have done it," said Mrs. Eden-Laperuz.
"And then Nad called me and said she would die for the next two minutes and I should say goodbye to her.
And I did it.
I said, "Dash, dear, I love you very much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you."
The doctors who gave her to keep her heart beating gradually stopped acting and left the body.
She died for a while before everything was off.
I just had to sit down and wait, knowing what was going on at that time.
I couldn't sue, scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really should've held my hand."
Finally, Mrs. Eden-Laperus, who was burning up because of the loss of her daughter, sat on the plane with other passengers, not paying attention to the severe trials she had to endure.
"No one knew," she said.
"I dropped my head and couldn't stop tears.
It was hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I began to feel deep compassion for Nadu.
He needed my love and support.
I knew how much he loved her."
Two women who have suffered grief leave their letters to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women who have lost their loved ones by suicide work to prevent others from putting their hands on themselves.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Hamfris are left on the Wall Street bridge with telephone numbers that people can turn to for support, as well as messages that they would ask to inspire.
Miss Davis Tyler’s son was 13 when he began to suffer from depression, and at the age of 18, he laid his hands on himself.
"I don't want other parents to feel the same way I do every day," she said.
45-year-old Miss Davis, who lives in Lidney, told me that her son was a prospective chef with a beautiful smile.
"Everyone knew him for a smile.
They always said that this smile made any room brighter."
But he quit his job before he died because he was "like in the dark."
In 2014, Brother Tyler, then 11, found his brother’s body after he laid his hands on it.
Miss Davis says, "I'm always afraid that this will have consequences."
Miss Davis created the letters, "that people know there are those they can talk to and talk to, even if it's just a friend.
Don't shut up, you need to talk."
Miss Hamfris, who has been associating with Miss Davis for many years, lost her husband, Mark, who lived with him for 15 years, shortly after his mother’s death.
"He didn't say that he felt depressed, that he had depression or something," she said.
"In a few days before Christmas, we noticed that he changed."
And on the day of Christmas, he was completely disturbed by the spirit, and when the children opened their presents, he didn't look at them at all."
She told them that his death had become a huge trauma to them, but they had to survive it: "It's a devastating blow.
I'm supposed to be with my family.
But we must continue to live and fight."

The future of Brett Cavano depends on the hair: the FBI starts investigating
"I thought that if we could get what we asked, - limited in the time and nature of the investigation - we might have reached some agreement," said Mr. Fleke on Saturday and added that he was afraid that the committee would "resolve" on the basis of the unprecedented loss of the loyalty of the political party.
Why didn't Mr. Kawano and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
It's their desire for time.
The mid-elections will take place in five weeks, November 6th, and if the Republicans are expected to face problems, it will seriously complicate their attempts to hold their own people in the Supreme Court of the country.
George B. Bush phoned the senators with a request to support Mr. Kawano, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush's rule and who made him meet his wife Ashley, who worked as Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI prepares its report?
In the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are now sitting, a vote will take place.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Cavano can have at least 50 votes at the Senate meeting, which would enable Vice-President Mike Pens to resolve the problem with the same number of votes and approve his candidacy in the position of the Supreme Court.
During the reign of Kima, the number of refugees from North Korea "has been cut"
After Kim Chen In came to power seven years ago, the number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea was reduced, the South Korean legislator said.
Pion Seug, referring to the Ministry of the Republic of South Korea's merger, stated that last year the number of refugees was 1127 compared to 2706 in 2011.
Mr. Pack said that the key factors were strengthening border control between North Korea and China, and that illegal smugglers now demand more money.
In Phanesh, they refrained from public commenting.
The vast majority of North Korean migrants finally offer South Korea citizenship.
In Seoul, it was reported that more than 30,000 North Koreans illegally crossed the border after the Korean War ended in 1953.
Most run through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, and it's easier to cross than the well-protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreans.
China views refugees as illegal migrants, not refugees, and often repatriates them.
The relationship between North and South Korea, which is still formally at war, has improved markedly in recent months.
At the beginning of this month, the leaders of two countries met in Pyrenees and discussed the issues of denuclearization that had been discussed.
This happened after a red historic meeting of the U.S. President Donald Tramp and Kim Chen In in Singapore, where they generally agreed to cooperate on the nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, the Foreign Minister of North Korea, Ri Jon-Ho, in the background of the sanctions adopted, blamed the United States for the lack of progress since then.
"Without confidence in the United States, we cannot be sure of the security of our country, so under these circumstances there can be no speech of unilateral disarmament," Ri Jon-Ho said in his speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Cavano "a hysterical" and says he's not fit for work in the Supreme Court.
The leader of the minority in the Palace of Representatives Nancy Pelosi called the candidate the Supreme Court judge Brett Kawano "historic" and stated that he was not suitable for work at the Supreme Court.
Pelosi expressed her thoughts during an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I always thought that if a woman had ever spoken that way, she would be called "historic," "Pelosi commented on his reaction to the testimony of Kawano before the Senate's Legal Committee on Thursday.
Cavano was emotionally opposed to charges of sexual violence against Dr. Christine Blaze Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his introductory speech, Kawano acted very emotionally, sometimes almost screaming and coughing, discussing his family and school years.
He also openly condemned the Democrats in the committee, calling charges against him "absolute and coordinated destruction of the reputation", organized by the liberals, who were angry that Hillary Clinton had lost presidential elections in 2016.
According to Pelosse, the testimony of Cavano proved that he could not work in the Supreme Court because it showed his prejudice toward the Democrats.
"I think that by these statements, as well as his statement against Clinton and the Democrats, he will take his candidacy on his own," she said.
Pelosi was upset when she was asked if she would try to declare the Kawan empire, if his wine was confirmed, and if they were given democracy most of the representatives in the House.
"I'll say so: if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he doesn't only deserve to work in the Supreme Court, but also in the court where he works now," said Pelosi.
Now Kawano works as a U.S. Court of Appeal judge in Colombia.
Pelosi added that as a democracy she was concerned with the possible decisions of Kawano against the law "For accessible medical services" or the case "Rou v. Wade" because he was considered a conservative judge.
In his hearings on the question of the approval of the Kawano position, the party asked whether he would cancel some of the Supreme Court’s decisions.
"Now is not the time when the judge will become a hysterical, prejudiced person and we'll say how wonderful it is," said Pelosi.
Women should own this weapon.
These are just words that have been in their midst for months and years of anger, and she could not express them without tears.
"We cry when we're angry," she said to me 45 years later, Miss Stein.
"I don't think it's unusual, do you?"
She said, "A woman who worked for the executive director and helped me a lot, said that she was crying when she was angry, but she had her own method, and when she was angry and started crying, she said to the interviewer, "You can think I'm sorry, and that's why I'm crying.
I'm evil."
And then she just kept going.
I thought it was amazing."
The tears are considered an acceptable way of getting angry in part because they are perceived differently.
One of my most obvious memories of the first job in the office, where most men worked, was the situation when I once cried out of unexplained anger, and the older woman was the unwelcome manager I was always a bit afraid of, and she grabbed me for a cell and pulled me to the front of the cell.
"Never let them see how you cry," she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They'll think you're sad, and they'll be glad they got to you."
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic Congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Garth at the presidential elections.
In 1987, when Mr. Garth was engaged in an extra-marriage ship called Monkey Business, after he left the race, Ms. Schroeder, deeply disappointed, decided that there was no reason why she couldn't fight for the president's office.
"It was not a very thoughtful decision," she said with a smile 30 years later.
"There have already been seven other candidates in the race, and another candidate is the last thing they needed."
Someone called the situation "Biloshika and seven gnoms."
Since it was at the end of the campaign, she stayed in the congregation, and she made a promise that she would not participate in the race unless she made $2 million.
It was a hopeless struggle.
She found that some of her supporters, who did not harm men for $1,000, gave her just $250.
"They think they'll give me a discount?" she was surprised.
When she gave a speech and announced that she would not be conducting an official campaign, she was caught by emotions — the gratitude of the people who supported her, the disappointment of the system that made the collection very difficult and forced her not to focus on voters, as well as members of the Chamber of Deputies, and the anger of sexism, and she was ready to cry.
"You'd think I had a nervous breakdown," Miss Shredder recalls the press reaction.
You'd think Kleinex was my corporate sponsor.
I've been thinking about what they're going to write on my graveyard?
"She cried?"
How a Trade War Between the United States and China Can Benefit Beijing
Experts believe that the first steps in the U.S.-China trade war were desperate, and although it was far from over, the long - term gap between countries could benefit Beijing.
The president of the United States, Donald Tramp, made the first warning shots at the beginning of this year, taxing the basic Chinese export goods, such as solar batteries, steel, and aluminium.
The biggest situation this week has been compounded by new tariffs for goods worth $200 billion (150 billion), which actually covers half of all goods coming from the United States to China.
Beijing paid the same coin every time, recently putting a dollar of between five and ten percent on American goods at $60 billion.
China has pledged to use similar US measures, and the second largest economy in the world will hardly, at the earliest, miss the opportunity to keep this promise.
Making Washington withdraw means agreeing with the demands, but for the president of China, China, public worship of the United States is too shameful.
However, according to experts, if Beijing is properly used, the pressure in the US trade war can bring China a long-term advantage by reducing the link between the two economies.
"A quick political solution in Washington or Beijing can create conditions that will lead to a severe economic downturn in any of the countries, and this is actually a more threat than observers have previously recognized," said an analyst Abigail Grace, who is dealing with Asia-related issues at the Center for New American Security.
Foreign Minister said Syria is "ready" to return refugees
In Syria, it is said that refugees are ready for voluntary return and are called upon to help rebuild a country that has been devastated by war for over seven years.
Speaking before the United Nations General Assembly, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Valid al-Mual, said that conditions in the country are improving.
"Today's real situation has become more stable and safer because of the progress made in combating terrorism," he said.
The government continues to restore damaged areas so that people can return to normal life.
All conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to a country that was forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and restricted their livelihoods.
According to the United Nations, over 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the beginning of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moual said the Syrian government would be pleased to receive assistance in the reconstruction of the war-damaged country.
But he stressed that they would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that support the siege.
Europe Strengthens Victory at the Rider Box in Paris
The European team won the Rider Cup in 2018 when it won the U.S. team with a score of 16.5:10.5 on Le Golf National in the suburb of Paris, France.
The U.S. team has already suffered a six-fold defeat on the territory of Europe and has not won the Kuok Ryder tournament since 1993.
Europe returned to its crown when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn’s command picked up 14.5 points that they needed to win over the United States.
The American star, Phil Michaelson, who tried most of the tournament, went through his first long shot on the 16th spring of Par-3 in the water and went to France's millinary.
The Italian golfer Molinari won all rounds and became one of the four players who had ever passed an account between 5 and 0 and 0 from the beginning of the modern-day tournament in 1979.
The U.S. Jordan Spit was defeated at 5:4 a player with the lowest score in the European Turbière Olesen team in Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, who is taking the first step in the world ranking, took account of 2:1 John Poulter from England, who may have taken part in the last time's "Cook Rider's" tournament.
Spanish Serchio Garcia, a veteran of the Rider Cup, who had already participated in the tournament eight times, became a European who won the most in the tournaments all the time, bringing 25.5 points in his career.
"I don't usually cry, but I can't do anything today.
It was a difficult year.
Thank you, Thomas, for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to come back.
It's a team's merit, and I'm glad you could help," said Garcia, without stopping your emotions after the victory in Europe.
He's handing over the esophagus to his associate John Rem, who won the American golf legend of Tiger Woods on Sunday in a single game with an account of 2:1.
"I feel incredible pride in winning over Tiger Woods, I grew up watching this guy," said 23-year-old Ram.
In France, Woods lost all four matches and now has a career record on the Kuok Rieder 13-21-3 tournament.
Amazing statistics for one of the most prominent players of all time who won 14 major tournaments, only Jack Niklaus.
The U.S. Assembly throughout the weekend tried to reach the ferry zone, with the exception of Patrick Reid, Justin Thomas, and Tony Fino, who showed a high - class golf course throughout the tournament.
The U.S. Captain Jim Furick said about his team after the unfortunate speech, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning, we dominated Europe for a short time.
We fought.
I'm taking my hat off before Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All his 12 players played very well.
We're regrouping, I'm going to work with the Association of Professional Players in the U.S. Golf and the Rider Club tournament committee, and we're going to move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You can't praise them.
They've lost me."
