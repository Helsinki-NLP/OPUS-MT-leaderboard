The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, signed a law on administrative liability for the violation of the time and order of payment of goods (work, services) in the implementation of procurement for public and municipal needs.
This law is intended to address the very acute problem of failure to comply with its obligations by contracting authorities in the implementation of public and municipal procurement.
Another two years ago, the situation where entrepreneurs were unable to receive payment for already completed public and municipal contracts was widespread.
At that time, the President of Russia instructed the Office of the General Prosecutor of the RF to take over the issue of special control.
Because businessmen themselves were unable to deal with unfavourable contractors who had concluded unfavourable contracts, they tried to avoid payment obligations and included illegal terms in contracts.
The problem was systemic in the country as a whole.
Since 2015, 9.7,000 submissions have been made by the Public Prosecutor's Office to protect business rights, with the result of their consideration of disciplinary responsibility, 4.5 thousand officials, 533 administrative, and 75 criminal cases have been brought to the investigative authorities for the organization of the trials, 46 of which have been initiated.
As a result, more than 66 billion rubles were owed to entrepreneurs.
These huge amounts have not been so high as a result of the non-payment of multibillion-dollar contracts.
The basic debt has resulted in numerous systematic delays in the payment of services to entrepreneurs at which lower amounts have been made.
This is a typical case.
The manager of a small company won a social transport service competition for several million rubles.
A person has invested all his trading assets, has fully fulfilled his obligations, but has not received the money in due time.
The result is a growing financial debt fund, taxes, loans that would lead to bankruptcy if the employer did not seek assistance in the prosecutor ' s office.
The problem has now been tackled as much as possible in a number of regions.
However, as of the first half of 2017, the total debt for public and municipal contracts identified by the prosecutors of the Russian Federation amounted to some 27.4 billion rubles.
In regions where debt rates continue to reach critical values, the Public Prosecutor ' s Office is working in an anti-crisis management system.
The Attorney-General shall personally hold a meeting with representatives of the local authority, which shall be subject to a substantive understanding of all alleged violations committed by the prosecutors and measures to eliminate them immediately.
Such operational meetings have already been held in Yaroslav and Ekaterinburg this year.
Qualitatively improving public procurement discipline will be able to implement Federal Law No. 189-FZ "To amend the Code of Administrative Offences of the Russian Federation to the administrative liability of the contracting authority for the violation of the time and order of payment of goods (work, services) in procurement for public and municipal needs", which the President of Russia signed last week.
The draft law was developed by the Ministry of Economic Development of Russia on the initiative of the Office of the Attorney General.
The new law will supplement the Code of Administrative Offences of the Russian Federation, which provides for a fine of 30,000 to 50,000 rubles for the violation of the contracting authority of the time and order for the payment of goods, works and services in public and municipal procurement.
And if an official has already been subject to administrative punishment for a similar offence, he is expected to be disqualified for a period of one year to two years.
All the prosecutors of the Russian Federation have already been commissioned to ensure the application of these legislative novels in practice.
The Civil Rights Protection Group has announced a warning on the movement in Missouri
The National Association for the Promotion of the Progress of the Colored Population has published a warning for colouring people travelling to Missouri due to discriminatory state policies and racist attacks.
The Group's statement reads: “Providing for the Traveling National Association to promote the progress of the colouring population, effective before 28 August 2017, calls for the African-American travellers, guests and citizens of the state of Missouri to be particularly careful and to be more cautious in travel by the State in connection with a number of suspicious incidents on the racist ground recently occurring throughout the territory of the state and brought here”.
According to the National Association for the Promotion of the Progress of the Colored Population, the movement warning group has been called for a recent law in Missouri, which has made it more difficult for people to overcome discrimination-related claims and the fact that state law enforcement authorities are disproportionately elected by minority representatives.
"You are being subjected to human rights violations.
They remain on the roads because of the color of the skin, they are killed and killed," said Rod Chapell, president of the National Association for the Advancement of the Colored People of Missouri.
"We hear complaints often, as never before."
This is the first kind of warning announced by the organization regarding the United States.
The Panel referred to incidents such as the reduction of black students on a racial basis at the University of Missouri and the death of twenty-eight-year-old Tori Sanders, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in suspicious circumstances earlier this year after he had finished his gas during his trip to the state, and the state police arrested him without charge.
The warning also mentions the recent report by the Attorney-General of the state of Missouri that the probability of being stopped on the road for black drivers is 75 per cent higher than for whites.
“The aim is to warn people about the situation and to warn their relatives and friends and colleagues about what might happen in Missouri,” Chapel said.
“People must be prepared in a way or otherwise, whether they will take the money for the bet or tell their relatives what they are travelling in the territory of the state.”
According to the FBI's latest hate crimes report, 100 hate crimes were registered in Missouri in 2015, making the state sixteen in the State for such violations.
The prevention of movement is also a response to the new state law of Missouri, which will make it more difficult to bring the case against the legal person in relation to housing or employment discrimination.
Previously, the American Union for the Protection of Civil Liberties (ACLU) announced warnings to travellers on Texas and Arizona after these states had adopted new immigration control laws, under which local law enforcement authorities were ordered to arrest people for violations of immigration laws, which, in ACLU ' s view, had to increase the number of racial checks.
Prevention of movement is usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but recent public organizations have responded to certain laws and trends within the United States.
Two people were killed as a result of a police patrol shooting in Egypt
The unknown were shot by a police patrol in the Egyptian city of Isna, Reuters reports with reference to the Ministry of the Interior of Egypt.
At the time of the shooting, two people, including one police officer, were killed, three were injured.
All the wounded were delivered to the hospital.
According to the agency, the police stopped the car, and two of the men in the machine of the armed men were found on fire by law enforcement officers.
One of the criminals was arrested, the other managed to hide.
Rosturism supports the law on the abolition of free baggage for non-return aircraft
The head of Rusturism Oleg Safonov said in an interview with the RBK TV channel that "positive" refers to the adoption of the law on the abolition of the free movement of baggage in non-return aircraft.
"It is necessary to create the conditions under which a person with no luggage can buy a ticket rather than a person with a luggage," he stressed (TASS quote).
Mr. Safonov noted, however, that despite the fears of the citizens, there would not be a need to pay for the carriage of the top-of-the-board clothes and mobile phones in the handcuffs.
"It would be right to calm down all our citizens and tourists and to say that it's for the top of our clothes, for the zontics, for the mobile phone, for the iPod or even for some computer to have no relationship," said Rusturism chapter.
Former Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law that allows airlines to rule off the free movement of baggage in return for the aircraft.
It is true that airlines can themselves determine the number of seats and the weight of baggage included in the non-return tariff.
Vladimir Putin ordered the elimination of Baikal pollution
The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, at the Baikal Protection Meeting, reported that significant lakes have been contaminated in recent years.
He had been instructed to identify sources of funding, plans and implementation for the elimination of pollution.
Mr. Putin also ordered the full recovery of the contaminated territories.
“Most of them have clean facilities,” quoted the President as saying, “RIA News”.
He also added that the Russian Attorney-General ' s Office should carry out an environmental check.
According to him, there were problems in the lake area related to the occurrence of natural debris and a number of environmental violations by recreational organizers.
"I would like to stress this: it is not always easy to check, but it is illegal and environmentally harmful activities and appropriate measures," he stressed.
In the past, the Office of the Gen procurator reported a reduction in fish stocks in Lake Baikal and proposed an increase in the number of facilities under environmental supervision.
He recalled that on 15 June, Vladimir Putin, in the direct line, stated the need to amend legislation to ensure the rights of citizens living in the natural territories of the special security regime.
The people of the island of Olhon, which is part of the Baycala Natural Territory, told him about the problems of economic activity.
The head of the Municipality of Sergei Donski immediately proposed to address the problem by defining the boundaries of the Baycala Water Conservation Zone, but the Burratiya Government recalled that such a change was not sufficient as restrictions were linked to a number of regulations.
Earlier in the Ministry of the Economy, they proposed to address the problem by amending the Land Code and the Environmental Protection Act.
A new temple will appear in the U.S.
In the village of Soswa, members of the community of the indigenous minority of the North of Rachtinja, and the inhabitants of the Berzev region, participate in the construction of the Orthodox temple in honor of the saint Nikolay Chudovartz.
Its location is the river bank, the temple will be well seen from far away, so it will serve as a trip for the fishermen.
According to community representatives, the construction work will be completed this year, which has now been established, there are churches.
The playwright REB of the fleet has provided transportation.
The temple is named after the Holy Nicholas of the Miracle, since it is regarded as a patron of travelers, including fishermen.
In the Congo, the fishing industry gives the settlers work, feeding them.
Locals are waiting when the temple opens its doors, and children even write about it in school halls as a matter of local dignity.
Designed with the death penalty.
Why do the laws apply in Singapore?
I'm talking to local businessman Chang, sitting in the open air.
Commenting on the situation in Singapore, Chang smokes one cigarette after another, the circus accurately stores a box of iron attached to it from the office.
After the interview, the businessman is sent to the nearest hour - a hundred meters - and picks up the bull.
The cost of bribery in public places is 500 local dollars, says Chang.
You know, I've just had a reflex since I was a kid, so you can't just throw a ghost out of a confectionery on a bridge, right now.
And now all over the video camera.
And indeed, Singapore's sidewalks in the center of the city are clean, as it were in the museum.
Chang relates: Three months ago, his 18-year-old son had carved out the wall of an old colonial building.
The court recognized the boy as guilty of vandalism and sentenced him to death.
What?
Imagine yourself.
He had ten strokes of a wooden stick on his shoulders and spent a week in prison.
We don't usually have physical punishment.
As Singapore combines the highest standard of living and incredibly strict laws, the Aif viewer has been discussed.
No one here is thinking about canceling the death penalty, says lawyer Victor Lee Hong.
The Government has long been in favour of both the European Union and the United States.
If a person carries a large portion of the drug or trades it, he will be hanged.
In 2002, a 22-year-old Australian citizen was detained at Changi Airport, bringing 400 g of cocaine.
The Australian Prime Minister has been defending him, threatening sanctions, international human rights defenders and even the pope of Rome.
But the guy was hung up anyway.
After that, the drug addicts have taken our country by force.
The following is the case: Singapore states that the laws are required to comply with the SCE's agenda, not only with the modest and poor.
It doesn't matter who you are, a millionaire, a prime minister, a famous artist or a euro union resident.
The variant in this case is one: if you're going to find half of the cocaine, you're going to be hung up.
When you go to Singapore and you meet a bunch of warning cards everywhere, you're just wondering how many laws there are in this city.
For example, a chewing gum is sold only in the pharmacy and can be bought strictly by a doctor.
The tourist will not take the chewing gum, but it's worth attaching a "cut" to the subway, a fine of $1,000.
In four days, I met two people with white plates on my neck, "I've fucked up."
In addition to the fine, the walnuts are often awarded a “link to the yard”: a week to clean the parks and beaches.
$6,000 is paid by a "criminal" who forgets to water himself in the public toilet, and when attempting to make a small need in the elevator of the house, a special detector works, blocking the doors and sending a signal to the police.
Among all exotic laws are the prohibitions on the feeding of pigeons on the street, the public performance of songs and even the excessive field of room plant (!): it is considered that the water cover attracts mosquitoes.
In order to avoid the fires of the smokers, it is not possible to carry lighters in the subway, otherwise they are charged with 5,000 Singaporean bags.
In general, there's a thought: no matter how hard you try, you're bound to break something.
It's not like that. It's trying to convince me of Muhammad Kabir-Kajaria, the owner of the local tour agency.
Especially fantastic laws exist only on paper, and in the last twenty years, I haven't seen anyone get attracted to them.
Why are they preserved?
So that the citizens don't relax.
The basic rules are closely followed.
For example, if a minor is sold in a kiosk, he will be punished in a chain: the store owner will pay a huge amount, the offender himself will be struck with sticks on the back, and the seller will also be executed and put in prison.
That is because of the so-called strict laws of the offence in Singapore very rarely.
Is that right?
In the 1970 ’ s, we had trouble on the roads, car drivers ignored the lights, drove as they wanted, and got drunk.
After the fines were imposed, everything calmed down.
Now the driver, after drinking a lot of whiskey, knows: if they stop, the police won't let them go, they'll charge a fine to the value of the apartment and they'll take it for years.
Many foreigners in South-East Asia seem to be a variety of conclaves.
In 1993, American writer William Gibson called Singapore "Disneland with the death penalty" -- the guests from the U.S. had led to the horror of the entire population's wealth, the fearsome "pure airport" and the "ocultural nature".
It's not supposed to look artificial, and it's not supposed to be like that.
The first days in Singapore, and you're really afraid to throw a paper on a sidewalk, you're gonna take it if it gets to the subway with the freezer.
But then you're coming to the Little India area, and the other one is "distortion of the template": the bus stops are running plastic jars.
"How's that?" you're surprised.
And so, the Singaporeans smile.
It's all happening.
Not for every such "crime," but you must know, if you're being counted, you're not remarried, because you've violated the law.
Most of all, it's enough for a person to be normal.
The authorities in Singapore, of course, are quite authoritarian.
But you know what?
In Vietnamese, I made a very cautious move, and motorcyclists often come out of the hands of tourists, smartphones and cameras.
In the centre of Paris full of dirty bombs and demands.
They're not all trying to throw garbage in the oven on our streets, either.
Singapore, however, was the calmest, cleanest and safest city on earth, thanks to the collection of dragonnish fines and cruel (including the death penalty).
You're thinking.
Such a human nature: remember, and in Russia, no one has been able to stand for the role until they have been penalized.
Although Singapore is not the main offence, it is the voluntary enforcement of laws.
And we should think that in Russia, people would also be happy to have a clean street, a lack of garbage in the subway, and welcome the arrest of those who have a public toilet elevator.
Here's the body punishment, thank you, no need.
In the rest of Singapore's laws, at least there is a need to look at them.
Nothing sacred?
Now the White House of Tramps has aimed at the Statue of Freedom.
The most reliable sign of the change of regime is when it starts to fight the statues.
The Americans understand that this is not worse than all others - from here, the playroom of Saddam Hussein's statue on the Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Steven Miller, one of the key ideologies of the Trampa Government, no doubt knew what he did when he brought a symbolic coup over the Statue of Freedom during a fierce dispute with CNN journalist Jim Akstant on the President's proposals for a sharp reduction in legal migration.
Let's be honest, Miller didn't try on his own.
The sexes of the owners of the prolific ships and artists representing the Statue of Freedom would be lewd if he tried to do so.
But he tried for her, and especially for the meaning she was assigned in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument when the verses of Emma Lazarus were added to the Pedestal.
As Miller pointed out to Acosta, "I don't want to go deep into history, but the Statue of Freedom is... a symbol of American freedom, which is the world's dawning.
The invention you are talking about was added later and is not part of the original Statute of Freedom."
Miller correctly presented the facts, but as he himself said, it's really not about history.
This is about the current sound of the devastating words of Lazarus, the only ones in which the State invites not all immigrants, but the poorest: "Your dead, your poor, / your crowds dreaming to breathe freely, / Unhappily throw away your vast shores."
"Unlucky wastes" have never been seen on our screens.
Miller didn't do literature - he made it clear that these people aren't waiting in America's Trap.
This dispute about the meaning of the statue is part of a broader political and cultural war: it is indeed a dispute about the meaning of America.
Lazarus and her friends, who fought to place her words on the statues after her death, were very well aware that they were doing a totally political act.
The sculpture was intended to form a link between the French and the American republics by means of the banal classic figure, the image of Freedom.
Lazarus changed her mind: the woman’s figure is no longer abstract, and she has a voice.
And she's got a very different name: Mother of the Dispersed.
The combination of poetry and the image was a brilliant feminist movement and a destructive attack on American nativity.
And as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the right to change it back.
Rash Limbo, his kind John the Baptist, who brought about the coming of Tramp in 2010, decided that Freedom does not invite anyone, rather it is an early neo-conservator carrying the fire of America in the darkness of the world: "Freedom is on the move.
It holds the flag of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The flag doesn't need to light the way to the U.S.."
I mean, against Limbo's habit, he really fell at the point.
The meaning of the statue depends solely on the angle of view.
The great creative achievement of Lazarus was to see her as she would have been tempted, unhappy, but full of hope for the people on the decks of ships after a long and often heavy voyage.
This literally means looking at the world with the eyes of people who seek refuge and the prospect of a better life.
We answer her statue with the words of hope and hospitality that they dream of hearing.
And, of course, it's not the prospect that Miller and Tramp will ever want to admit.
Their jaws should not be used to illuminate the path, but to fuel hatred, which is the only source of their strength.
2017 World Championship: Neil Blake appreciates Scottish members of the British Assembly.
Elid Doyle remembers the time when there were only two Scottish people in Britain.
Neil Blake, the director of the Federation's game, said that a 16-person Scottish party to the World Championship would make a "significant contribution to the team's game".
The record number of Scottish light athletes was selected for the 2017 London Championship starting on Friday.
Blake believes that in Scotland “something special is born” and that the Federation should take this into account by a light British athlete.
"We know that and we're trying to understand and support while they have the potential," Blake said.
"I spoke to people at the Scottish Sports Institute, and they think it's related to what they did.
The Scottish Federation of Easy Athletics thinks that what they did has to work.
The British Federation is an easy athlete: what they did must work.
And people on the street think the same way.
I don't know why things have happened, but it's so brighter."
Some of the Scottish light athletes claim medals, including Laura Moore and Andrew Bachert, who will compete with Sir Mo Farah at a distance of 5,000 m; and Elid Doyle chose his captain.
"Elid is modest.
Her Captain's speech was great," Blake says.
"Many light athletes, regardless of whether they are Scottish or not, and where they live or are trained, have left this room feeling proud and eager to win.
The passions and sincere feelings that Elid had put into her were remarkable."
The owner of the silver medal championship of the Commonwealth, which, on its fifth World Championship, will run 400 metres away with obstacles, says that 16 Scottishs in the British assembly are "incredibly."
The previous record of the number of Scottish World Championships was seven, in 1983 and 2005.
Laura Moore, who has been on the run for medium distances and who has had five British and two European records last year.
She'll run 1500 and 5,000 meters.
Chris O'Her, who will take part in the 1500-m strike, is another Scottishman who is to be noted: behind him is a successful season in which there was a victory at the British assembly and the Annual Meetings.
Doyle remembers his first world championship, when besides her, the only Scottish team in the team was Lee McConnell.
The captain of the team said that she was “incredibly proud” that so many of her fellow citizens had not only entered the assembly, but in some cases they would claim medals and fight for the final.
"The captain of the team elects other members of the team, so it was a great honor in any case, but knowing that your friends voted for you and you elected, it's a very special thing to me," she added.
"Finally, I'm very proud of all the Scottish people who went into the assembly.
This shows how much we have accomplished.
And they're holding all the light athletes who're trying to get to the pedesters of the beginning.
What about my captain's word?
Yeah, I think she was not bad.
I just drew attention to the fact that we were very happy to receive the World Cup home.
So it's just about how important it is to get support from the sick and take advantage of what we're going to see again at the Olympic Stadium.
I've got another chance to go to his arena and participate in the contests, and the atmosphere will just be remarkable."
Blocking criticisms on Facebook: You don't have to go to public unless you're ready to listen to the voter criticism
The founder of our country found this to be a critical press.
The Americans loved George Washington, but this did not prevent them from criticizing him for everything from domestic politics to his political principles.
The criticism of him, of course, irritates him.
But he didn't shut his mouth to his critics.
Because in 1783, Washington said, "it is possible to take away our freedom of speech, and we, the deaf and our own, will be led as sheep to war."
Now I'm going to go to Governor Maryland Larry Hogan, who should try to be more like Washington.
The Hogans have blocked and killed at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.
And this week the American Union for the Protection of Civil Liberties has handed him over to the court for this.
The subordinate governors called this claim null and void, and the comments on the internet were written in the spirit of "well and what".
"It's just Facebook," many will say.
But it's important, too.
And that's especially important when it comes to Hogan's guy.
He is an amazingly popular Republican governor in the democratic favour of the state.
He was second in the country's 50 governors' approval ratings.
Hogan's not a stubborn reaction.
He demonstrated a strong hand in the administration of the state and commitment to his principles.
He also uses Facebook hunting as a primary way of communicating with his voters and with jokes shows on his page his void after his head chemotherapy.
Therefore, to block people who come to the Governor's page, which is declared an official public forum and conducted by the taxpayers' money administration, is unnecessary and ultimately harmful.
In a Washington post interview, press secretary Amelia Ches defended the governor's actions, claiming that blocking comments is simply their modulation.
But it's too easy to use the images of trolleys, spammers and hackers that are evil on the Internet.
"Post" spoke to some of the real people who blocked Hogan.
And these are real people, not trolls, teachers, businessmen, pastors who turn to their elected leaders.
They all say that their comments were respectful, meaningful and not rude.
The pastor quoted the Bible and appealed to Hogan as a Catholic.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Raman from Bowie, Maryland, did not express hatred, but asked about hate crimes.
"I have written a strong comment that I have been disappointed by the lack of response to the crimes committed on the grounds of hatred and other recent news," she wrote in the section of the comments to the post.
"I also don't like the idea that when many people leave comments on the same subject, some immediately say it's a so-called riot, rather than admitting that they have a problem with a large group of people who are not enough."
What the subordinate governors call a "concentrated spam attack", others would probably call a "active life position".
In a Facebook era, it is easy to edit your image simply by blocking criticism or casting negative comments.
It's a much less dusty job than before, when that's what it takes to send people, to collect and burn the papers with critical precautions or to arrest and hit the mouth with a protest.
But that's exactly what's going on right now, just in the figure.
Hogen is not the first official to be criticized for not wanting to listen to Facebook and other associates.
President Trampou has been sued by Twitter users who have been robbed of his Twitter account.
One of the first, reverse decisions on this issue was taken this week in Virginia.
According to a U.S. district judge from Alexandria, James K. Kasheris, the chairman of the County Supervisory Board of the county of Laudon violated the First Amendment by plunging the elector into his facebook account.
And in Kentucky, Republican Governor Matt Bevin made claims by the American Union to protect civil liberties for his conduct on Facebook and Twitter.
It's not that hard.
In Washington, D.C., the cost of mail was about the same as today’s Internet.
From 1776 to 1800, the number of newspapers increased by four, and the authors of anonymous letters greatly violated its authority.
And even then Washington was dealing with anonymous controls.
People under the pseudonyms "Uricola", "Valerius", "Belizerius" and "Porcius" wrote letters in the newspaper derogating from Washington's decision.
According to historical documents collected by George Washington's online project documents, his office was seized by petitions criticizing his position under the Treaty on Friendship, Trade and Maritime Affairs.
But he didn't try to keep them quiet.
Freedom of speech, inconsistencies and statements is the very foundation of our State.
And true leadership means agreement.
Ronan Rafferti looks forward to the home facilities at the Renaissance Club
The former European champion Ronan Rafferti is looking forward to home comforts for the next three days when the Renaissance Club in East Latvia will host the twenty-fifth open Scottish golf tournament for older athletes.
The native of Northern Ireland, who was a member of the Archerfield Links Club, and moved to the final round last year until he lost Paul Ils, joined the new place and served as a tour representative on behalf of the founder and director of the Jerry Sarvadi Club.
"I have seen how the Renaissance Club was built, and we will see how it succeeds with this event," said Rafferty.
“The players will see this field at its best moment, it is in a magnificent state.
Jerry did a great job with this place.
He is jealous of the commitment of this game and proud of his achievements here.
This is a great demonstration for this field."
Anglican Ills is looking forward to the first opportunity to stand up for the championship, despite the fact that he won his 32-year career in the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour.
“It’s a really special feeling,” said a game from Southport.
“I was unable to try to win Extremadura Open again, because it was removed from the calendar year after I won it.
Returning to this corner of the world is magical.
This is a great place to play golf.
The memories of last year are coming back, and for me and my wife, Sharon, it was a very special impression to win last year.
It was a truly special time, and we will always remember it.”
Returns to the struggle on the home land of Gary Orr, who joined the European Tournament for the elderly after his 50th birthday this year.
This event will be the first public event in Scotland during the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open tournament in 2013.
"When you play at home, it's always more important," said the resident of Helensboro Orr.
"You want to speak well, but you feel that extra burden."
I was very happy to play again, and I showed a bad golf course.
I am pleased with the way things have been achieved."
The three will be joined by the former winner of Masters Ien Wussam and the champion champions for the elderly sportsmen Paul Brodherst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNally.
Orr and former Captain Ryder Cup Sam Torrance, two of the six Scottishmen in the field; the rest are Andrew Oldcorn, Steven Macalister, Bill Longmuier and Ross Drummond.
Attendance in the tournament is free, and the park is worth 5 pounds an hour if one person is in the car, and 10 pounds if a person is two or more.
All incomes go to the British Prostate Cancer Fund.
British Roads Learn to Overcome Harmful Emissions
The corresponding tunnels above the highways capable of absorbing carbon dioxide emitted by cars are already being tested on the roads of Great Britain.
The country ' s transport agency reported that Autocar had reported the positive results of the 100-metre tunnel tests on one of the country ' s cheeses in the north of the country.
The 6-metre tunnel is built from some of the latest polymer materials that can absorb harmful substances contained in car outlets.
However, the establishment of a whole network of such tunnels is only part of the large measures that British authorities are going to take to improve the atmosphere.
In addition to the tunnel network, English are going to expand the charging station network for electric cars, carry out a number of road traffic reduction activities, expand the use of commercial transport on the electric train and modernize heavy-duty fleets.
According to official statistics, four of all air pollutants are transportable, and the unsatisfactory air quality is due to up to 40,000 premature deaths per year.
Violent has changed the punishment of the disabled Mamaevu for the punishment
Mosgorsud changed the punishment of the disabled, Anton Mamayev, sentenced to four and a half years in the colony, to a fine of 200 thousand rubles.
That's what the TAS reports.
The prosecutor's office had previously asked the court to replace the term for parole, explaining its request that Mamayev's disease "is preventing him from being found in prison conditions".
The 28-year-old Anton Mamaev was sentenced to four and a half years imprisonment with the execution of a sentence in the general regime for the murder of a victim of an ex-fight.
On 19 July, the Court of Justice delivered a man from prison at a meeting in SISO.
Poverty and death in the Indonesian “Golden Land”
Ready for dinner, Bardina Degei doesn't use the plate.
She doesn't even use bitter.
In his wooden house in Enortali, the capital of Paniai, in the medieval Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually carries a sweet potato, which is called “note”, directly in the eye.
After half an hour of plowing, they get and eat with impatient, unwashed hands.
Degei sits on the ground floor – she has no furniture – and this is where she is doing her homework at home, such as a glass of water of mutated water from a nearby mud.
The laundry serves the air in the room without a roof.
She was the youngest of four wives to her husband, so she was not ordered to work in the field.
Multiplicity is distributed here.
Of course, working late may be dangerous: many men in this village are unemployed, many are drinking, and there are still soldiers.
“No one decides to walk through the village after five dinners,” she says.
This is a rare opportunity to look at daily life in the high mountain of Papua, the former Dutch colony, which had joined Indonesia in 1969 after a questionable referendum, when only 1026 elders were forced to vote publicly before the occupying forces.
The current movement of independence from the Netherlands has quickly provoked the Jakarta Government, which maintains strict control over the region, without allowing foreign journalists and human rights defenders.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua and the independent State of Papua New Guinea occupied the eastern part of the island.
Enorthal is a city as far away as abandoned; the road here includes a half-hour flight from Jaapoura, the administrative center of the province, in Nabira, and then a five-hour drive to the hired car.
There's no public transport here.
The town with a population of about 19,000 is made up of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences; the roofs of the fence have been decorated with a vertebrae in various red carpets.
A few of the Indonesians, they don't talk about journalists anymore, and almost none of the foreigners.
Prior to the arrival of the Christian missionaries, the popes worshipped the god named Uga Tamea.
There were other changes.
“We used to wear this clothes,” Degei says, showing on his bright, thick hand turban, dark jube and bright robe.
“We used to carry only leaves on the body.”
Papua is the poorest province of Indonesia, 28 per cent of its population live in poverty, while children's mortality and literacy are among the worst in Asia.
But it's still Indonesian gold land.
The world's largest gold mine in the world and its most profitable mine, Grasberg, owned by the Phoenix Freeport McMoran, is only 60 miles from Pania, a high province of about 153,000 people living in New Jersey.
Only in 2015 did Freeport obtain gold and media here for about $3.1 billion.
In addition, Papua can be credited with forest stocks of $78 billion.
These riches, however, bring one calamity to the popes, guaranteeing that powerful Indonesian armed forces remain here in a stunning presence.
According to New York Times, between 1998 and 2004, Freeport paid nearly $20 million to local soldiers and units, including up to $10,000 to one officer.
The demands for greater autonomy on the part of the popes threaten the existence of this gold house and are unforgivably exacerbated.
According to human rights defenders, more than 500,000 popes have been killed by the Indonesian military since 1969, and thousands more have been raped, tortured and deprived of liberty.
According to the Asian Commission on Human Rights, the mass killings in the indigenous peoples of the high mountains of Papua in the 1970s could be considered genocide.
Only last year did the Indonesian police arrest more than 3,900 peace protestors in the region.
“We are losing everything”, the report published in 2016 by the Brisbane Fair contains evidence of crimes committed in the previous year, such as executions without a court, torture – especially in part, as stated in the other report, rape and defeat by the electric current – and the brutal repression of peaceful demonstrations.
“It’s hard to count the number of victims, because the incidents take place every week,” says Andreas Harrison, a researcher in Indonesia for Human Rights Watch.
The Haitians have been delayed because the resources of Papua have attracted immigrants from other parts of Indonesia.
The 3.5 million population of the province is 83 per cent of the population, but demographics change as Muslim economic migrants arrive from the densely populated Indonesian islands, Java, Sumatra and Sulavesi.
The Javans, Varungi, sell a burnt chicken and a mixture of gado-gado fruit, which is supplied with aarhus sauce.
Locals are trying to maintain competition.
“Migrants began selling cigarettes and vegetables on a traditional market, rather than the indigenous people of Papua,” explains Abet You, a 20-year-old native of Pania, moving to Jaapour, the administrative center of the province, because of work.
“Because of this, the indigenous people of Papua – the mother of Papua – lost their market.”
The President of Indonesia, Joko Vidodo, known as the People of the Republic of Indonesia, vowed to address the inequality and violations of the rights of Papua during his presidential campaign in 2014.
On his way to the Presidential Court in Jakarta, the former plot was supported by 27 of the 29 Papau districts, including Paniai.
But almost nothing has changed in Papua, and locals feel betrayed.
"Our hearts are broken because in 2014, we voted for Jackov, expecting him to fulfill our hopes of restoring justice," Jou said.
In fact, only two months after the October inaugural, Jokovi Pania survived the tragedy.
On 7 December 2014, a group of 11 children were on the street and sang Christmas hymns in Enortali, when two Indonesian soldiers were out of the darkness on motorcycles.
Scared children told them that they should include the Pharaohs.
According to local pastor Javed Tebai, one of the soldiers was injured in their tone and, after a while, returned with four soldiers.
According to victims and eyewitnesses, the soldiers who were drunk were chasing the children and being their examples of guilt.
Then one of the soldiers shot a group of children.
One child, sixteen-year-old Julianus Amo, was so badly beaten that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, someone burned the nearby government building of the electoral commission, and the situation worsened the next day.
About a thousand Papuan men, women and children gathered in the football field in front of the local police station and the military command center to demand justice.
They brought with them ritual lunatics and filled out the wind, the dance of the papua tribe of Meo Pago: they ran round and painted the bird’s drink.
Some protestors began turning stones into police and military bases.
When the situation got worse, internal radio forces were told: “If the crowd shows opposition more than three times, shoot them,” he sounded as stated in the official document, which saw the correspondents of the TIME magazine, but which was not published in local media.
Fifty - six - year - old Jeremiah Kayame, head of the Kygo Koto region of Enorthal, felt a sense of danger and called for peace, asking the crowd to break up at home.
No one wanted to listen to him.
“When I returned, the bullet suddenly fell into my left pocket,” he told the magazine TIME, standing on the wing of his brightly decorated wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who shot, but he says the bullet flew by the sheriff's assembled soldiers.
"It was a crowd, shooting was a lot," he adds.
In the local village of Alfius Joua, he fell three times as his cousin, who witnessed the shooting.
“I ran to him and looked at his body to make sure he was there,” said the magazine TIME Johannes, darkly, which, like many Indonesians, is used only by one name.
"I saw him dead... I kissed him."
General Yotge Mande, Chief Inspector of the Police of Papua, told reporters that his officers were only "protecting" their base because it was under attack.
"We must protect ourselves when people threaten us," said Commissioner Pujo Sulistio, police representative of Papua Police in 2015.
“This is the question of life and death.”
According to the Human Rights Watch, five young protestors were killed and much more wounded.
The news of the murders reached Jakarta only the next day.
Three weeks later, Jacobi spoke in Jaapura, expressing his condolences to the families of the victims and swearing to deal with the historical abuses by the authorities in Papua.
"I want this situation to be resolved immediately so that it will never be repeated again in the future," he said.
In October 2016, the Minister of Security said that he would establish a non-judicial organization to put an end to the historic human rights violations.
But we're almost there.
“Most of the violations occurred a long time ago.
Some of them were in the nineties or at the beginning of the zeroies.
The point is that we certainly want to deal with these violations, but there are procedures that need to be made," he said.
Viranto then refused to speak with the magazine “Time” on 5 June in Jakarta, and said that he did not plan to establish an organization to deal with complaints in Papua.
Rather, he said, ‘All will be judged by the judgement.’
Viranto, accused by the United Nations of “crimes against humanity” of the death of more than 1,000 people during the bloody vote on the independence of East Timor in 1999, said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua had already been settled, including an incident in Pania.
The families of the victims from Pania have found such statements with a dark mistrust.
“For the last three years, I have been questioned four times, but there has been no change,” Johanez said.
"I'm tired."
He says that years later, he still lives in fear.
"I'm scared," he says.
"I'm afraid the military will arrest me, I'm afraid they'll shoot me."
His brother James also expressed the view that the people of Pania were afraid to discuss the incident.
He said that he was beaten by soldiers after he helped to bury four victims.
"After we buried the bodies, the soldiers followed me," he said.
The shooting's not over.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police shot village residents in a neighboring Deiyai district.
During the clash between the wood dwellers and the construction company manager, who refused to help the man who was unconscious, the hospital, the death of one person, and another 17 were injured, including children.
A man, twenty-four-year-old Ravianus Dow, who drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
The angry villagers protested at the construction site office of the company.
According to the police, the village people had turned stones into officers who had responded to warning shots.
But locals claim that the mobile brigade (indonesian expert) started shooting at the crowd and killed one man.
"We were in such a panic, we're afraid of revenge," reported the magazine TIME, a 20-year-old Domingu Badia, who lives next door to the hospital, and saw how the wounded were quickly delivered.
"I've been hiding at my house for two days."
The Deiyai Parliament required officers involved in the incident to call for an answer and to withdraw the mobile police force from the region.
Panama has always been a sick place for the Indonesian Government.
The lack of significant development is due to the dissatisfaction of the tribes, monks, data and women scattered throughout the territory of the central highlands of Papua.
Many have joined the “Free Papua Movement” (OPM), a rebel army that claims to protect the rights of the popes by resorting to radical attacks and attacks on the kidnapping of people by Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders come from Pania, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Judes Kogoya.
As a response for the past few years, thousands of people have been arrested in Pania and have been unjustly detained by the military under the pretext of “protection of national independence”.
Some didn't come back.
Among the people of Papua Pania is considered a “painful, forgotten place”.
Poverty increases dissatisfaction.
The small proportion of rice sold in Enortali is too expensive for locals.
The bread is not available to the same degree.
People here grow everything they eat: mostly notes, as well as some fruits and leaves.
Agriculture is the work of women, each of which can be used for four or five fields of sweet potatoes.
They usually keep most of the family’s harvest, and the rest are sold on the local market.
Ten of the largest notes are about 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, the economic inequality between indigenous peoples and new migrants has increased, which has come in large numbers since the introduction of new aircraft at Nabire Airport.
Few existing vacancies are usually provided to more educated and sustainable migrants.
Popes rarely have the money or skills needed to run their own competitive business.
"Young people don't want to stay in the village... because there's neither work nor money here," says John Gobai, president of Pania's tribal council.
The isolation keeps Papua away from the views of the rest of the world.
Moreover, restrictions on the work of international media remain fierce.
Earlier this year, French journalists Frank Escudy and Basil Lonshan were deported from Papua for “inadequate coherence with relevant organizations” despite the fact that they had been granted rare videoconferencing permits.
According to Felima China, Asia's Deputy Director of Human Rights Watch, the promises made during the Jockov pre-election campaign to abolish media restrictions in order to promote transparency and development have not been fulfilled.
“Now foreign journalists attempting to report from the medieval eastern Indonesian provinces, Papua and the West Papua face new dangers: refusal of visa and entry to the blacklist,” he said in a statement.
Lack of attention from the press means that the international pressure on the Government of Indonesia is largely limited by the direct neighbours of Papua.
In March, six Pacific States, Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands, requested the United Nations Human Rights Council to investigate “diversity and widespread violations” in Papua, including shooting in Pania.
The same countries in the past supported OPM.
The representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Indonesia, Armanata Nasir, withdrew from the group's statement, informing reporters in Jakarta that “In Indonesia there is still a democratic system and there is a free press, so it would be difficult to hide the evidence of the episodes of human rights violations”.
Locals want more foreign Governments to focus on the situation.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by the Dutch human rights Ambassador, Keiss Van Baaram, visited Jaipur on 4 May, locals violated silence, saying, “We want freedom”, as the source, who was also present at the meeting but wished to remain anonymous.
In Indonesia, a new presidential election will take place in 2019, but the popes say that they are hardly voting again for Jackov.
“Jokovi is a man with good intentions, but he surrounds people involved in shooting at Pania,” said Gobai, president of the tribal council.
He wants Jokovi to know that the people of Pania, in addition to living in the shadow of threats by the alpine army, are in poverty, and education and health are in a pitiful state.
Gobhai says that the people of Pania, like other popes, consider their vote to be a duty to pay for the Jacks.
"They don't need money, they just want justice," he said.
Despite threats and intimidation, the families of the victims of the shooting in Pania have committed the last symbolic act of non-refoulement: they have buried one of the victims on the ground directly against the police and the military.
Knowing that justice is probably never done, they will at least not allow the guilty to forget their crimes.
"They killed a member of our family," says Jacobus, not raising his head.
"What else were we supposed to do?"
The second time a fire covers the Dubian Neboskrabhn "Fakel"
The fire covered one of the world's tallest residential nebula in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of residents to quickly abandon the seventies-year-old construction in 337 metres high.
It is already the second fire on the high building, which is called "Fackel" for two years.
The building had been evacuated, the victims had not been reported, and there was no operational news about the cause of the fire.
“We slept and woke up from the fire alarm and screams of people.
We ran down the ladder, and we needed about ten minutes to get down from the fiftieth floor," Reuters reported to a non-screwnite agent named George.
According to the administration of the civil defense of Dubai, the fires were extinguished at approximately 4:00 a.m. on local time (00:00 a.m. on Greenwich) and cooled the building.
The Government reported that it was working on providing asylum to the victims.
The incident can bring back to the agenda the security issues of materials used in offshore high buildings around the world.
In an investigation by the Fakela post-fired administration, it was found that the most affected was the posters - the external panels used to form and isolate.
In the United Kingdom, the police stated that they believed that the system of isolation and the Grenfell Tower building posters in London could speed up the spread of the fire that occurred there in June, resulting in the death of about 80 people.
The increase in tourism in Ida Virumaa in June was minimal
According to data received by the correspondent of the rus.err.ee portal in the Department of Statistics, in June 2017, the hospitality services of North-East enterprises benefited a total of 20,519 local and foreign tourists, which was 125 or 0.6 per cent higher than in the same period earlier.
The number of local tourists has decreased, and the number of foreign tourists has increased.
Thus, the foreign turban increased by 7.3% in June (544 people) to 7994 tourists.
The number of local tourists decreased by 3.2 per cent from 12,944 to 12,525.
The number of Russian tourists in the region increased by 8.9 per cent or 318 compared to June 2016.
All in June 2017, Ida Virumaa's guests stayed for the night of 3885 RF guests.
Andrei Malachov gave the worshipers the idea of the guilty in his care
Andrei Malahov has turned his worshipers into Instagram, who are guilty of his departure from the First Channel.
He has not yet commented on any of the hearings, but today he has placed a piece of the article on the "Leadership" on 1 August.
Photo Malahov signed the "boss milkcoss."
The article on how to prevent and address the worker ' s “outbreak”.
If you recall the numerous reports that the leader was unable to find a common language with the newly arrived producer who had begun to transform “Let’s Speak”, it becomes clear that he has so clearly turned on, writes “KP”.
It has been reported that the TV leader Andrei Malahov is currently on vacation and has not signed a statement of release from the First Channel.
The situation of dismissal can be clarified in the coming days.
Five soldiers were killed in Afghanistan when the car exploded
At least five soldiers died in an explosion in the province of Gilmand in Afghanistan, RIA News reports.
According to the police, a derailed car was blown off by the military station in Girishk before evening.
It's about 20 dead people.
On Friday morning in Girishka, there was a new C.P.I.
Armed criminals attacked the currency exchange point.
Reshoot between attackers and security forces continues.
Diver took a video of the shark trying his camera.
Diver and researcher Greg Skomal sealed on the video shark that tried his GoPro ex-camera.
The role of the American Maritime Fisheries Agency in Massachusetts, Scomal, was presented on Facebook.
The incident occurred on 2 August in the coast of Cape-Cod peninsula in the north-east of the United States, specifying the Necn portal.
During the underwater voyage, the man tried to remove the shark from the camera that he held on a special pole.
When a man noticed that the length of the animal was more than three feet [3 m] deep.
The shark tried to bite the camera, but it did not try to attack the scientist.
Scomal explained that the predator did so in order to determine whether the boyfriend was compatible.
The researcher added that the shark could easily destroy the device.
He also noted that such behavior of the marine animal was for the scientists in the news.
It became known as the cause of the mass battle at the Ural Military Center
A working group of senior military officers from the Central Military District to investigate the circumstances of the incident came to the Elan Training Centre, where a massive dragon occurred.
Some details have already been made known.
According to the fact that the Mash, appearing on the UContact page, the Ural military contractors were severely injured because of uninjured beds.
It all started with the fact that, on behalf of Sayan, a series of demonstrably ignored the officer's order to have the prairie.
The officer's men stood on the side of the guard from the sixth floor.
Saena supported the first mouth.
In the mid - hour, 140 young men were burned in a bed and a coffin, and glass was thrown out.
In the mass battle, more than ten people suffered.
In the CWC, the information on the footing was rejected.
The study showed that at least one fifth of the passengers in the United States carry prohibited items on the aircraft.
The study showed that more than 20 per cent of air passengers deliberately or accidentally carried into the baggage of the aircraft through the inspection points of the U.S. Transport Safety Administration, including at least 6 per cent of the aircraft, with prohibited knives or other sharps.
Almost 1 per cent reported that they later discovered that they accidentally had firearms, ammunition or explosives.
The study conducted by Stratos Jet Charters, Inc. and more than 1,000 people, also showed that young passengers are more likely to break the rules.
Of the respondents who acknowledged that they deliberately tried to fly from something forbidden to ATB, 19.7 per cent were millionaires compared to less than 15 per cent of the X-generation.
In addition to ATB staff, food and water are most often passed.
More than 3 per cent were recognized as having undergone a special examination of sharp objects and 2.2 per cent of respondents and 3.7 per cent of respondents recognized that they had deliberately carried forbidden drugs to the aircraft.
The company stated that it had studied passengers throughout the country to find out how many of them had been smuggled by an airport inspection and how well they had done it.
We expect that most often, consciously or unconsciously, smuggling is done by checking those who fly the most.
As the company points out, the ATB rules are rather complicated and confusing.
People often do not know exactly what fluids they can carry and what amount they can carry.
It is not surprising, therefore, that most of what is chosen by the ATB is illegal fluids.
Some time ago, people thought that ATB could consider books prohibited.
The liquids are allowed on domestic voyages, but not on international voyages.
EPA Pruitt's head refuses to postpone implementation of both emission reduction rules
The next day, following the request of 15 states, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency withdrew its decision to postpone the implementation of the rules adopted by the Obama to reduce emissions of air pollutants and power generation.
Pruitt explained his decision that his agency was now more responsive to the needs of environmental regulators of individual states than in previous administrations.
He did not mention an appeal against his previous position before the Federal Court of Appeal.
The phase was extended around 1 October, to which states were required to comply with the 2015 ozone standards at the ground level.
In June, Pruitt announced that it would postpone their compliance for one year to give its department more time to study the plan and avoid “incompatibility with local decisions or obstacles to economic growth”.
Pruitt, which had long been known as a consistent adversary to the tightening of environmental standards before President Trampov was appointed as President-in-Office of the State of Oklahoma.
After moving to Washington, Pruitt repeatedly blocked or postponed the introduction of rules that were contrary to the chemical or gas oil industry.
The unexpected change in the course on the environment is the regular legal defeat of the Pittsburgh course in return for the previous rules.
Last month, the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington decided that the head of EPA had exceeded its mandate to try to postpone the implementation of the rules adopted by Obama by oil and gas companies to track and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement issued on Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that, having made a sharp change in the course of the ozone standards, he was simply obliged to cooperate with the states in an integrated process of timely implementation of the new standards.
“Epa’s previous administrations often failed to rely on the deadlines, then expected demands from groups of activists and others and discussed the deadlines in the settlement of the case”, Pruitt said, who filed more than a dozen claims against EPA at his previous position.
"We do not believe in regulation through trial, and we are serious about the deadlines.
We are also serious about our constitution and the authority that he gives us."
However, the EPA statement said that Pruitt could at some point re-use his “delay authority and other authority data” to ensure that the rules “jcyjdfys in a clear and accessible manner”.
The Republicans of Congress insist on a broader revision of ozone regulations.
The bill, approved by the House of Representatives last month, seeks to postpone the implementation of the 2015 rules for at least eight years.
The Senate has not yet voted in favour of this issue.
New York Attorney-General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that filed a complaint against EPA this week, said that the group was planning to continue legal pressure.
"The changes in the EPA course - following our demands - are an important victory in the fight against health and safety of 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans, who have a direct influence on the power to cover their city," Schneiderman said.
New York joined California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Man, Massachusetts, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, as well as Colombia.
The ground-level ozone occurs when conventional pollutants from machinery, power plants, oil processing and chemical plants and other sources enter the atmosphere in reaction to sunlight.
The triggering of this can cause serious breathing problems in people who are sensitive to it, leading to thousands of premature deaths a year.
Health and environmental defenders welcomed the unexpected change in the Pruitt course.
"It's a shame to think about how much pressure it takes to achieve this perfectly logical step from a person to protect the air we breathe," said Lori Ann Bord from the Centre for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to resist the ideological campaign of the Tramp administration and to protect those who pollute the air and their special interests."
The IAAF Congress extended the removal of the Federation of the Allies with light athletics.
The Congress of the International Association of Light-Athletics Federation (IAAF) voted to extend the removal of the Universal Federation of Light-Athletics (WFLA).
The Congress thus supported the IAAF Council for the Restoration of WFLA, which issued a report on Monday, in which it recommended the withdrawal.
For the extension of the removal, 166 people voted against 21 against the TAS.
The report of the IAAF Board stated that WFLA had made significant progress in achieving the conditions established by the Board of Membership, but these conditions had not yet been fully met.
Due to the disqualification of WFLA at the London World Championship, Russian light athletes were forced to stand under a neutral flag.
There were 19 people in the team who were admitted to the IAAF.
WFLA was subject to an indefinite disqualification from IAAF in 2015.
At that time, the report of the independent expert of the World Anti-Fraud Agency (WADA) Dick Pounda, which mentioned numerous violations of the WADA regulation by Russian officials and sportsmen, was published.
For more details on the last report of the IAAF Board, read "U" "IAAF has extended sanctions against VFLA".
Injurious defeat
As part of the 3rd tour of the Russian Fonbeth-PfL teams, the New-Moscian "Hymik" was taking a flight match against the Kaluga FK.
More than 10 days ago, the rivals played together in the Russian Cup, but this time the game was completely different.
The chemist didn't give up on the opponent, but the second weakness on the base of the match led to the attempted goal and fiasco.
After a recent defeat by the Colossians with an account of 0:3 many had already foretold an easy victory for the landlords.
However, from the beginning of the meeting, the New Yorkers were forced to consider themselves and act on the defense, but with a position of strength.
In the 1st time, the kalujans were more mastered and had the advantage of the ball.
A very high-quality match was held by Alexie Sirotin, who several times reflected dangerous hits and assured her partners with her actions.
Unfortunately, in the attack of Chimiko, there was no effort and no effort to put the Kalugi defense in a dump and kill the first target on the way out.
After the game was interrupted, the game began to run on meeting courses.
The Novomoscians were more active in the attack.
The alarming bells for our team have become defensive errors that have allowed the nuns to create a number of sharp moments.
In 10 minutes until the end of the meeting, he took over the territorial advantage and carried out several dangerous attacks.
But the experiences of the nuns played their part - they were more literate and colder, spending their time at the gate.
After a dangerous attack, the Chemicals took the ball to the corner, which the owner's field was given without resistance to the door.
The author of the goal became Yury Dubrovin.
In the report meeting, "Chimik" showed a bad game, but he suffered an attempted defeat.
Our team is looking forward to another trip - 11 August at 19 hours in Moscow at the "Torpedo" Stadium, Edward Arrowzov, will meet with the favorite "Centr" FK "Ararat", composed of Roman Pavluchenko, Marat Izmailov, Igor Lebedenko, Alexie Rebko.
Come back to support "Chimik!"
The location and time of the meeting of the New Yorkers - 18.30 a.m. near the Magnolia store (East, D.2, corp.

According to the published phone calls, Tramp pressed Mexico to pay for the wall at the border
The Washington Post has published a telephone conversation between the President of the United States of America, Donald Tramppo, and the leaders of Mexico and Australia.
On 27 January, during a telephone conversation with the President of Mexico, Enrique Penney New Tramp insisted that he stop publicly stating that he would not be able to pay for the planned wall at the border.
The President of the United States appealed to him for his public statement against the wall and, according to the information, told him, “You cannot speak this press.”
Tramp began his pre-election campaign with a promise to build a wall along the southern border of the United States and swore that it would force Mexico to pay for the project.
His first phone conversation with the Prime Minister of Australia, Malcolm Turnbull, was also deciphered.
Tramp said to Ternbull that an agreement that the United States should accept refugees sent to Australia was “mutual”, “reversible” and “tumpoe”, and insisted that because of the agreement concluded by the Obama administration, it would look like an idiot, as it intended to stop the refugee movement in the United States.
Tramp finished the conversation, said Ternbull that "it was the most unpleasant conversation of all day".
The bodies of those who died in Abkhazia were sent by a plane from Sochi to Petersburg
A plane belonging to Russia, on which the bodies of the Russians killed in Abkhazia, flew from Sochi to St. Petersburg in Moscow at 20:15.
At the end of the checkpoint, the board will meet with the staff of the ritual agency, as well as with the city mayors, and told reporters the Deputy Minister for Courts and Tourism of Abkhazia, Astamir Ahba.
Former representatives of the Republic of Macedonia stated that all costs associated with the return of the body to Russia had been incurred by the Government of Abkhazia.
In addition, the official Suhum intends to pay the families of the deceased 500 thousand rubles.
According to Ahba, Abkhazia's leadership was willing to pay relatives who had been killed as a result of travel and residence explosions in the Republic, but the relatives had only sent confidence to the right of local authorities to act in accordance with the established order.
On 2 August, about 16:20 in Moscow time, in the village of Primordgo Gudaut, at the warehouse of the Ministry of Defence of the Republic of the Republic, two explosions began to detonate large-scale weapons and other ammunition.
As a result, the storage space was heated, which caused uncontrollable explosions of shells of various modifications.
As a result, two Russian citizens were killed by Elena Polakova in 1970 and Elena Timofeeva in 1962, who were on vacation near a seropod source.
64 persons, including 35 citizens of the Russian Federation and 29 Abkhazia, were reported to the health institutions of the Republic with various injuries.
Currently, there are seven people in the station, the others are listed.
A study of the Russian influence on the American elections will be a major juror
The Special Prosecutor for Russia Robert Muller convened a large jury in Washington, D.C., to investigate Russia's influence on the election of the President of the United States in 2016, reports The Wall Street Journal and the Reuters Agency.
Many jury members are a group of ordinary citizens who collect evidence of potential criminal offences and have the right to question witnesses under oath.
The collected material will be examined by the Special Prosecutor and will decide whether they are sufficient for the prosecution.
The Grand Jury has given Muller additional powers to collect testimony.
One of these investigations by the jury, which started a few weeks ago, will be the details of the son's meeting, then another candidate in President Donald Tramp with Russian lawyer Natalie Vestelnik.
To verify the details of this meeting held in June 2016, Muller himself promised earlier.
They've been studied by the FBI.
At the end of July, it was reported that the youth Donald Tramp expanded the state of his lawyers.
The youngest tramp had previously said that he was waiting for the compromise at the head of a candidate from the Hillary Clinton Department, but no discontinuing documents had been presented, and the result was adoption.
In early August, a number of media reported that the Trampa youth's statement about the meeting with the Vestelnik was literally addressed to the elderly Trampo.
In the White House, it was explained that the president did not dictate anything, but simply used his authority to do what any father would do.
Vice-Presidents of the Pensions were detained at the workplace
The Deputy Chief of the Pensions Administration, Irina Shiršin, has been detained for 48 hours on behalf of the Investigation Committee at its workplace, reports the RIA News.
Official communications from the law enforcement authorities on this matter have not yet been made, but the CSU press has assured them that they will soon follow.
There's no comment yet on what happened in Pensa.
Irina Shirshina is one of the five deputy heads of the Penz administration.
She has been curing urban issues and land relations since April 2015.
It has long been the manager of the Gosjylstortechnologies in the Pensions area.
Irina Shirshina is raised by three minors, and she has, on a regular basis, turned her back on her retirement and returned to work.
Of course, there's no spacecraft or rockets in Mexico.
But there was a space agency established in 2010 and a desire to develop its own space programme.
And the establishment of the bus of Yuri Gagarina is a tribute to the first person who was in space.
Unlike the Soviets, who bear the memory of Gagarin in some countries, they are “walking on the planet”.
In 2012, the monument was established in Houston, U.S.A., near the former headquarters of NASA.
In London, a memory memory in the territory of the Royal Observatory was established in honour of the 50th anniversary of the first flight to space.
There is a memory of Gagarin in Germany, in the town of Erfut, where our spacecraft lived in 1963.
The monument to Karlovy Varah (Czechia) escaped a comment in 1992 by public protests and was transferred from the city centre to the local airport.
A 70-year-old Gagarina appeared in Riga as a memorial of Yuryus Gagarins.
So the name and the name of the first cosmonaut sounds more Latvian, and it looks like he's 70 years old.
Mors Ford's murder: Activists lose Linch's courts on stage to call for justice
"Ford Mercuri" in 1948 passed by the viewers in Monroe, Georgia, and with a cheer, went to the small bridge of Mors Ford.
When a car with four black passengers and a white driver drove to the bridge, a group of white men with roses crossed her path.
The main man in the middle of the suit in a thin stripe was hanging out with a cigarette and looking through the windshield.
Sitting inside was dreaded.
"We need this nigger, Roger!" cried the man.
"Get him out of the car!"
The slender waves broke the silence when the young black man was pulled out of the front seat.
Fortunately, this terrible scene, which took place on 22 July, was just a stage.
But when Roger's neck was stuck, almost all the viewers and they really were breathing.
Since 2005, activists have returned to the Mors Ford Bridge to play again that night when two black couples, Roger and Dorothy Malcolm and George and Mae Murrei Dorsy, were in 1946.
No one was convicted of these murders.
"It is clear that no one has been arrested for all these years - even though we see them near us; though we know who they are," said Tyron Brooks, who helped organize the order.
"It's five in our history and it's a rock in our souls."
71-year-old Brooks, a former member of the Georgia Congress, who has been fighting for human rights for all his life.
For him, the spectacle is a dramatic call to action and an annual reminder to the people of Monroe that injustice has not been corrected.
"We want investigation, we want completion, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we need justice," he said.
"We cannot go to healing and reconciliation until justice is attained."
The Coroner was found to be the simplest body of one of the lynching victims at Mors Ford on 27 July 1946.
According to the FBI materials received by En-Bi-Ci News, more than 50 people in Monroe and neighbouring districts were suspected of being involved in lynching.
But no one was charged with this.
Although the decades were at stake, human rights defenders said that the city had always known two related motives: politics and sex.
In April 1946, the Supreme Court ' s ruling for the first time allowed black citizens to vote on the premieres to be held that summer.
For example, during the same elections, according to the FBI, black user Roger Malcolm hit a knife with Barnett Hester, a white landowner, apparently because of a woman.
Brooks says that, according to the city, Hester slept with Malcolm Dorothy's wife, and that the child she had to be born was not from her husband.
According to the FBI, on 25 July 1946, Loy Harrison, a great white landowner, paid $600 to release Malcolm from prison.
He went to jail with Dorothy and their cousins, Mai Murrey and George Dorsey.
But when they left the prison and went to the Mors Ford Bridge, a mob of lunatics surrounded the car.
"It is clear that he has organized and ordered the killings of Harrison" - such a conclusion is made in one of the reports of the FBI.
"It is also obvious that there has been a dispute between state and city law enforcement authorities, who not only participated in the killings but also destroyed the streets and hid witnesses."
Brooks calls it a step.
"It was an attempt on electoral rights," he says.
"They were all killed to send a message to a black man in the city. If you register and vote, the same will happen to you."
For almost ten years, Cassandra Green has been leading an annual show that reflects the flux at the Mors Ford Bridge.
Its spectacle is monitored, it captures the viewer, and it refers to the deep racism that many would like to consider is no longer in America.
It's hard to see, and it's harder to turn, but Green thinks it's the main thing.
"We don't want to talk about Linch's courts because they show us our own fertility," she says.
"But I can't build a relationship with you if you don't hear me or hear what I've been through."
This year’s shows began in June, and on the first day, almost 30 actors, a dozen whites, the rest blacks, gathered in the room and listened to the play review.
Wade Marbo was a director with Green.
He has played the lead member for several years, but he says that the role has not become easier.
"I don't think I'm naked because it's not the man I am," says Marbo.
"But I think it's very important to remember this story because we don't want to go back at the time."
In the room of actress Darryus Bradshaw and Nick Rascon, who play Roger Malcolm and Barnett Hester, repeat their roles.
The spectacle begins with Malcolm, revealed by Hester's sleep with his wife Dorothy, screaming and pushing him.
"I said, foot, get out of my house!"
Crichit Rascona in response.
It's a blow.
And at the same time, all (at least all black actors) are scattered by desire.
Green laughs at everyone.
"What's going on?" Ask Ascona.
He's worried and upset.
Am I playing again?
"No," says Green through a laugh.
"I just don't think the whites were saying 'nig' at the time."
"Yes," laughs one of the black executives.
"You have to say 'r'."
Also, energy changes in the room: discomfort changes in the sense of society.
All must do is do the right thing, not only for the play, but also for the memory of the four killed.
The scene begins first.
This time, when Rascona says the word "n", it gets clear and sharp.
No one laughs.
Spectacle ends cruelly and quickly.
The screams, the shots, and then the silence.
A woman in a sad black dress is standing over the bodies of the actors and playing the sad song of Billy Holliday "Strange Fruit".
Her voice is interrupted by a word.
In hundreds of yards of it, half a hundred spectators take their eyes out of their tears and their sweats.
Among the audiences is almost the same number of black and white.
One couple came from Itaki, New York, to see the presentation; many lived very close.
They had to wait almost eight hours for the heavy spirit of Georgia, while Brooks led them to the palace in the tombs of Malcolm and Dorsey.
Until now, the killings have only remained history, but now that they're standing in the same place where people were lusting, their ghosts seem to live here in the air.
When the last note of the song is silenced, Green invites people to come closer and look at the bodies.
Children are drawn to their heads, they are drawn to a bloodless beauty, and they're moving bodies and they're whispering to each other.
"They're not really dead," said one little boy, as if to remind himself of it.
In a few minutes, Green thanks the audience, and the second time it's over.
The actors take off their tails and pull out their tails.
Bradshaw embraces Marbo, the man in the suit who played the main doll.
Nick Rascona embraces two other actors, and the other one, crying, falls into their arms: the emotional load of the spectacle finally fell on him.
"All right," she whispers one of the women.
"We know you have a good heart.
You had reason for this."
Later, the viewers will have dinner with the actors.
On one table, a white couple from Atlanta are revitalizing the show with a black couple they just met.
Denise Dapplinski is hard to find words to describe how she feels after the show.
"It's hard to hear these horrible, sad words and actions... people who look like you and who do it because they look like you," she says.
"After that, I think the lynching is still going on," she adds, "it's just now called that the police are shooting."
In another corner, Tyrone Brooks was given general attention to his work as a human rights defender.
He said that he had already begun planning a presentation next year.
"The situation impresses us because it not only describes not only the horror of what we have experienced, but also teaches us," he says.
"Because if you don't get out of this lesson, it can happen again.
Those who do not study their story and do not know their story are doomed to repeat it."
Court of Ostrafoval for Violations at the “agitation Subsidiary”
The Moscow court ostrafed Alexey Navalov for 300 thousand rubles for a violation of the agenda of the meeting.
The opposition was found guilty of an administrative offence provided for in article 20.2 of the CoAP of the RF “Re-infringement of the agenda”.
The former judge of the Simonov Court of Moscow, Hizir Mussakaev, ended up considering the administrative case against Leonida Volkova, head of the opposition headquarters of Alexei Navaloval, who was brought to justice under the same article as Navalny.
The wolves were found guilty and sentenced to a fine of 300 thousand rubles.
To this end, Judge Mussakaev assessed the distribution of the letters to the “agitation sub-station” that were carried out in Moscow from 8 to 9 July.
In view of the actuarial material that was followed by the participants, the police thought that the organizers had intended to hide its true public action (which had to be requested prior permission from the capital authorities).
Leonid Wolkov and his lawyers Ivan Jjanov and Alexander Pomazev applied for an end to administrative proceedings for the absence of an offence and indicated that the police had allowed some shortcomings in the drafting of the protocol.
Volkova was not detained at the very “agitation workshop” but was given an agenda that would oblige him to appear in the police office to report on his active participation.
The same arrangements were made by the Naval and another fellow of the opposition, Nikolai Laskin.
In Mordvia, a shooting bride and three guests of the wedding are arrested
The court in Mordvia arrested a local man who shot four people at the wedding, including a bride.
This was reported to the Republican administration of the Investigation Committee.
The incident occurred on the evening of 29 July.
During the crash, 42-year-old Saranska shot several times at the guests who came to the village for redemption.
Three women and one man were injured.
A criminal case has been brought under article 213 (a), article 30 (a), article 30 (a), article 105 (e), article 105 (c) (e) and article 105 (e) (i)) of the Code of Criminal Procedure.
According to Interfax, local media reported that the man had opened fire because of the fact that the guests had decided to buy out the water, and had passed through the area to the water.
The miner reinforces the requirements for turbine suppliers for power stations
The Ministry of Energy of the FP will update the rules for providing information to suppliers of critical equipment, in particular turbines for power stations.
At the start of gas turbines, gas turbines, oil pipelines and oil acquisitions, equipment suppliers will be obliged to share access data with the Minergo and the Federal Office for Technical and Export Control.
The draft Government decision has already been prepared and is being held for public discussion.
The new requirements will only be met by “critically important energy equipment” provided to Russia.
Potential threats are identified in the document as information and access to the management of foreign services, criminal elements and structures, non-profit partners and hackers.
The European Union has extended anti-Russian sanctions due to Siemens
On 4 August, the Euro Union Press said that anti-rossion sanctions had been extended due to the scandal surrounding the supply of Siemens turbines in Crimea.
The Week Arguments have been reported earlier.
The EU Press Service stated that sanctions against the RF have been extended due to the Siemens production turbines scandal, which are likely to have been delivered to Crimea in the course of sanctions.
Today, the Council of Europe is considering all possible complaints and proposals by Member States to increase anti-corruption sanctions.
It was previously announced that the final decision would be taken by the end of the present day, and that decision had been taken, sanctions against Russia had been extended.
Person reduces another 3,000 jobs and reduces dividends to bring business back to life
On Friday, the British Educational Group of Pirson announced that it would reduce another 3,000 jobs and reduce the amount of early dividends by 72 per cent in connection with the launch of a regular restructuring programme to address the problems facing their business.
These reductions in jobs, which, according to John Fellona's head, will mainly take place at the end of 2018 and in early 2019, will be added to the 4,000 jobs reduced by previous restructuring.
Person announced that he was planning to reduce the cost of another $300 million ($394 million) in May during the third cost reduction programme to try to return to a business that had hit the fast transition to digital learning.
Last month, the company agreed to sell its share in the Penguin Random House to its partner, Bertelsman, said that its forecasts for the year remained unchanged after it announced an increase of 1 per cent in the first half of the year to 2.05 billion pounds.
Attack on a convoy in Kabul: Private Nato killed as a result of the deadly explosion
According to the information received from official sources, the terrorist was attacking a military convoy in the capital of Afghanistan, Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and wounding several others.
Five soldiers and a translator were injured, as the NATO report says.
According to unverified data from local sources, three civilians were also killed as a result of the accident in the city area of Karabakh.
This explosion was the last of Afghanistan's casualties in this month of bloodshed: more than 30 people died as a result of a war on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people outside the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
According to NATO, an explosion that took place on Thursday evening occurred when a joint convoy with the Afghan army was attacked by a “carried person of an individual explosive device”.
According to the report, all wounded are in stable condition and are treated at the US military hospital at the Bag airport.
Correspondents report that the growing power of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (IG) in Karabakh is a major source of concern to the NATO forces located near Bag.
The United Nations reported that in the first half of 2017 there were at least 1662 civilian victims in Afghanistan, and about 20 per cent of them were in the capital.
At the end of July, a car bomber was the cause of death of at least 30 people in the Shia area in Kabul.
The Taliban claimed that they had made an attack.
On 31 May, as a result of a powerful explosion in the city centre, more than 150 people were killed — the most serious of human casualties in the country since the United States-led troops removed the Taliban from power in 2001.
Violence emphasizes the unsurpassed situation in Afghanistan, while the President of the United States appreciates the need to increase the number of United States military forces assisting troops and police in the country.
According to the correspondents, the attacks in Kabul that took place over the past few weeks have also created a crisis of public confidence in the Government, its conduct, and in particular the reputation of President Ashraf Ghana.
The Agency for the Protection of the Environment, following judicial proceedings, revokes its decision to postpone the adoption of the Air Pollution Act.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has annulled the decision to postpone the adoption of the Obama era law, according to which states should limit emissions of air pollutants within the day after 15 states were brought to court because of this step.
On Wednesday evening, the Environment Agency announced its decision to implement the so-called “zone measurement 2015”, stressing that this step shows the Agency's willingness to cooperate with the states.
"We believe in dialogue with our partners in the states and responsiveness to them," said the head of the Environmental Protection Agency Scott Pruitt.
In June, Pruitt announced the intention of the Environment Agency to postpone ozone measurements where existing air pollution is measured in different parts of the country to determine where it should be reduced to meet more stringent air purity standards for one year before October 2018.
On Tuesday, a group of 15 states, mostly democratically, together with the Federal District of Colombia, filed a complaint claiming that this intention was illegal.
The administration of President Donald Trampa is trying to reverse the wide range of environmental protection orders introduced by former President Barack Obama, as part of a broader programme aimed at the improvement of the economy, according to Trampa.
But actions in this direction have raised resistance from democracies and environmental organizations that are concerned about the possible impact of large emissions on public health.
On the Environmental Protection Agency, it is stated that the use of ozone-containing air can “decreas the function of mild and potentiating respiratory symptoms”, for example asthma.
Association of European Business Against New Anti-Terrorism Sentences
The European Business Association expressed disagreement with US economic sanctions against the RF.
In AEB's view, such measures may lead to a serious reduction in production and the number of jobs.
The AEB statement states that business is an important link between countries and people, so the principles of free trade cannot be limited.
The European business brings together more than 500 companies from the countries of the European Union and the European Free Trade Association.
The Association calls on the Heads of State and Government of the EU, the United States and Russia to develop a new line of conduct that would allow business to be separated from politics and to find a common, mutually acceptable solution in the spirit of peace and agreement.
Members ask the police to restrict the movement on the coast in Pskov
The Pskov People ' s Elections referred to the head of the IMDW in the city of Sergei Surina on the problem of the move on the Great Coast.
The proud Members of Constantine Bolentin, Grigorio Partienkov and Valerie Lesnik believe that motorists are preventing people from playing and resting in this place.
In their view, control of drivers will help to make the territory more peaceful and secure.

Putin asked the investigation authorities not to remove hard disks
The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, suggested that the investigation authorities should not exclude servers and hard disks from operating computers in enterprises.
The Head of State stated this at the meeting on the investment programmes for the development of the Far East.
According to the President, it is necessary to “remove the application for follow-up of measures leading to the suspension of business activities, including the removal of hard drives from work computers and servers”.
Putin noted that if investigators have such a need to “remove copies, assure them and use them during the investigation”.
The Head of State added that there could be no "conditions to prevent the continuation of the business until tax could be paid".

British actor Robert Hardy's death
British actor Robert Hardy, who played the magic minister Cornelius Fadja in the series of novels about Harry Potter, died in the year 92 C.E.
This was reported by the Independent newspaper on Thursday.
His relatives told him about the death of the actor.
According to them, he lived “a great life with success in film, theater and television in 70 years of careers”.
Hardy was born in 1925 in the English resort Cheltenham.
In 1959, at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre, he played with Lawrence Olivier in the "Trage of Coriolane".
Hardy also recalled the repeated role played by Prime Minister Winston Churchill, including in one of Agata Christi's screenplays about Ms. Marple.
For the performance of the role of Churchill in the Bi-bi-si teledrama "Winston Churchill: The Wilderness Years" (1981), he was awarded the award of the British Academy of Cinematic and Television Arts (BAFTA).
Robert Hardy also had to play the role of U.S. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt.
There was something missing in the State of Denmark: Prince Henrik, and in fact Henry Marie Jean Andre, Count de Labord, refused to be buried with his venerable wife, Queen Margrete.
This year, it's a "gold" wedding, but on the agenda, couples are not preparing for the celebrations, but a heated dispute.
His Highness rejected the title of the Prince-Consorth, and he responded to the Queen, that he had never regretted the title of the King-Consorth.
Henrik lives in France, although he remains officially queen's wife.
Mid-Russia called for Washington to stop Shelmwa Moscow
In the Middle East, Russia responded to the statements of the Moscow-based mother Penz in an attempt to destabilize the Balkans.
The relevant statement had been circulated by the foreign policy authority a while ago.
In his commentary, MIDI indicated that the United States was increasingly using cold war stamps, inadequate modern reality.
In addition, the Russian diplomats called on the US authorities to stop the shelm of the RF.
As the "Arguments Weeks" were written earlier, US Vice President Mike Pens accused Moscow of attempting to destabilize the Western Balkans and organize a failed coup in Montenegro.
Mikey Garcia and Vasili Lomachenko meet for the first time, talking about the possibility of a decisive individual
Vasili Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who, according to all, are constantly moving to make the most exciting boxing match worth up to 147 pounds in the near future for the first time on Thursday.
They occupied separate rooms in ESPN's office rooms in Los Angeles, while Garcia, an uncertain champion in the lightweight of the World Boxing Council, did not go through the corridor to welcome the Lomachenko, a World Boxing Organization champion in the second half.
Following the unanimous victory of Garcia over the former world champion in four categories of heavyweights by Irene Broner on Saturday at the showtime channel, the two boxers are among the five best boxers, regardless of the heavyweight categories.
Garcia stretched his right hand and said, "What's up, champ?
Good luck with you.
Lompchenko protects his belt with Miguel Marriego on Saturday at seven o'clock dinner on the ESPN channel.
When the boxers posted for the photo, manager Lomachenko Egis Klimas noticed that the potential decisive struggle between them would be the same.
"I used to be in the middle of the summer," Garcia recalled.
"I'm up to the Bronner category [up to 140 pounds], but I'm not that big anymore.
I'm poor for 140.
I want to go down to the semiconductor.
And he needs to get up to the semiconductor [up to $135], and then we'll set up a unit.
That's what sick people want.
Let's make this work for them."
Lomachenko agreed.
“The box needs this item.”
Klimas asked whether the fight should be broadcast through the PPV service, as part of the strategy that he is required to carry out his initial fight in the team of 135 later this year to mark the next summer meeting with Garcia (37-0, 30 nocauts), which was also interested in meeting the winner of the single winner between Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell after their struggle for the title of the World Cup in the lightweight arena “Forum” on 23 September.
“The fight can be at PPV because all the patients asked for it,” said Garcia, expressing their willingness to meet the channel that would offer the best financial conditions.
“We are the main names.
No other name would be of such interest.
As soon as they are ready.
Garcia said that Lomachenko was considered a "screaming boxer" and perhaps would visit his weekly unit.
But Lomachenko didn't immediately thank Garcia and said that he thought the three-weight champion from Riversaid looked "very slow, sorry, Mikey... you asked for a knockout".
Garcia said he was focused on showing the power of the strike, and then the box.
They both said that they felt that they were getting more tense in front of their own individual.
“This fight must take place.
None of the other battles cause so much interest and conversation.
I'm more than happy to work on it," Garcia said.
Lomachenko said, "I was expecting some of the football boxers, and here he is, Mikey.
That will be a great struggle."
On a number of central streets, Moscow turns the movement to the exits
In these exits, on 5 and 6 August, the movement will be restricted to the capital at the Tver Street from the Nastasian Street to the Triumphal Square, as well as to the 1st Twerk-Jam Street.
In addition, the tour is closed in the Leningrad Perspective, from the Third Transport Circle to the 1st Tver-Yam Street.
In all areas, the cover will operate on both sides, the Information Centre of the Department of Transport of Moscow reports.
The streets will cross from midnight on 5 August to 5 a.m. on 7 August due to their well-being.
The exits will also be closed on the Moscow Coast.
It continues to be the site of the Zaradje Park.
Putin ordered the Office of the Attorney General to check the Baikal.
The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, commissioned the General Prosecutor's Office of the RF to conduct a verification of the Baikal territory for the purpose of illegal and environmentally harmful activities.
"I ask the Gender Procurator to check the Baycal Territory for the facts of illegal and environmentally harmful activities," said Vladimir Putin at a meeting on environmental development in the region.
In addition, the Russian leader requested action if violations were identified.
New test results for the assessment of the age of asylum-seekers in Sweden have been published
The latest results of the asylum-seekers' tests in Sweden, which have undergone a new medical assessment of age, show that more than 80 per cent of those tested have been assessed as persons over 18 years of age, but not all trust the accuracy of these findings.
The Swedish National Judicial Agency (Rätsmedicinalverket) began testing earlier this year.
They were designed to assess the age in the asylum process more precisely after the Swedish Migrationsverket was criticized for not being able to determine the present age of some refugees who claimed to be minors.
The Migrationsverket has now sent 6,880 cases to the test, and the Judicial Medical Agency has now published the results of 2,481 tests between mid-March and 31 July 2017.
Eighty per cent (2002) of those tested were evaluated as persons 18 years of age or older, and in another 25 cases, the judiciary assessed that the tested “probably persons 18 years of age or older”.
In the case of 432 cases, the sentence stated that the person “probably less than 18”.
Tests are carried out only when the age of a person has doubts.
According to Johann Geransson of the Judicial Medical Agency, the results were consistent with the results of last month.
“We don’t see a big difference with statistics in the past few months, numbers are exactly the same,” he said to the “The Local” portal.
The high proportion of cases in which people were assessed as being 18 does not necessarily indicate that asylum seekers lied about their age.
In my agency published the results of the 581 tests and reported that in 442 cases “at the earliest, 18-year-old or older”.
However, after considering 581 published results, the Svenska Dagbladet found that in 243 cases, the person openly stated that he was being paid 18 this year.
The method of medical evaluation of age, consisting of X-rays of the wisdom and tomography of the knee systems, and the analysis of X-rays and X-rays, has also led to criticism in some instances.
One of the skeptics is an endocrinologist from the Karolin Institute, Claude Marcus, whose work is to assess the biological maturity of people to determine whether they have been through sexual creation sooner or later than usual.
"I had reason to think about it, and I don't think I should use the methods of measurement that are being used right now.
The biological age is thus very poorly defined.
If we can't determine it with certainty, we don't have to do what we can," he said, "Metro."
However, Garanssen of the Judicial Medical Agency said in favour of the accuracy of the tests: “In general, it can be said that the risk of taking a child for an adult is mistaken.
We face the greatest risk when a person is about 18, then he is about 10 per cent."
I wonder if I'm going to vote for the president's office.
During his work trip to Burratia Vladimir Putin, who was willing to consider whether he would be the president of Russia in the 2018 election, the interface was handed over.
This statement was a response to the request of the inhabitants of the village of Cheremuški in the Buryat region.
During the video conference on the elimination of the fire in Burratia and the Irkutsk area, the interviewer addressed Putin with the words, "Vladimir Vladimirovic, we ask you: when the next presidential elections will be held, we all ask you to re-enact this post."
"All right, I think, thank you," the president replied.
On 28 July, the President of Russia, Dmitry Peskov, the Press Secretary, commented on the statement by some media that the pre-election headquarters of Vladimir Putin would be chaired by the head of the administration of President RF Anton Vaino.
Peskov called these assumptions “not based on anything, hypothetical reasonings”.
"There are no headquarters until the establishment of the headquarters is far away, until the election campaign is far away," said Peskov.
"Until it is on the agenda," said Peskov.
The Governor of West Virginia said he was moving to another party
The Governor of West Virginia, the representative of the Democratic Party, Jim Justice, announced on Thursday at a meeting with President Tramp, which is taking place in another party.
"You like it or not, but the democracies are far from me," said Governor Justice.
"Today I speak to you with many prayers and many thoughts... today I speak to you, people of West Virginia: I can no longer be useful to you as governor-democratic."
The meeting burst with applause.
"That's why tomorrow I'm going to change my registration to a Republican," added Justice.
"As a coach, I would tell you that it's time to play differently."
Tramp had previously promised that an important statement would be made at the meeting in West Virginia.
Tramp won 42 per cent in West Virginia, and Justice did not support a candidate from the Democratic Party, Hillary Clinton.
Justice, according to Forbes, was elected the only billionaire in the state in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states, because he inherited coal business from his father.
It is estimated at $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, on Thursday evening, the National Committee of the Republican Party issued a statement that “The turn of Governor Justice to another party is another strike on the Democratic Party, which is more likely to interfere than it is working to make our country a big one again”.
“In view of the total of 15 governors and control over the smallest number of state legislative bodies in history, the statement by Governor Justice is just another refusal from a party that does not have leaders above the bottom and is unable to find a positive, uniting message,” reported CBS News, a representative of the National Committee of the Republican Party Ron McDonnell.
Mr. Krasavczyk found his house with his socks.
The Pittsboro City, North Carolina, U.S.A., set up a cat named Mr. Krasavczyk for more than 14 kilograms after he became famous for the Internet.
That's what Mashable reports about.
At the end of June, a photo of the cat was published in the Facebook Pittsburgh account, asking him to find his owner, because "he was clearly fed by someone before."
In the comments, users noted that the expression of the animal morgue could become a new membrane.
The publication received more than 3.2 thousand tears and 15,000 comments.
In the comments, dozens of people expressed the desire to welcome Mr. Krasavčík.
As a result, he was given into the hands of Angela Frazee, who promised to take over his weight.
In an interview with the WNCN, the American woman said that she had already had similar experience: she had taken the cat home for about 10 kilograms, and now she is excited to hear more than five.
In July, Reddit users drew attention to an Australian basket with unusually long paws.
The animal photo post collected more than 68,000 searches.
The commentators noted that she could make a career in the model business.
Who praised Russia ' s apology for a doping scandal
A leading international athlete, Sebastian Kou, praised on Thursday for calling sincere apology from Russia for the doping scandal, but reiterated that it was now a bad time to allow the country to participate again in the sporting contests.
The Russian representative of the Federation of Light Athletics, Dmitry Schlachtin, informed the International Association of Light Athletics, who had recently won the World Light Athletic Championship, that the removal of his country from sporting competitions was fair and that he was determined to fight doping.
He apologized to “all sportsmen who had stolen gold and silver medals at the contests.”
Despite his comments, the Congress of the International Association of Light-Attracted Federations voted in favour of the withdrawal imposed in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) issued a report on the evidence of the State-funded doping.
"I have shown that today's response, today's report, was very sincere," said the reporters, President of the International Association of Light-Athletic Federations, Kou.
“All the council and all the congress liked... that the Russian Federation itself recognized that it was living a very hard time and now doing everything possible to take care of the federal reform.”
He also said that he had been “accompanied”, that Russia had agreed to the criteria for its recovery.
"I think it was a very constructive day and that we are moving forward, but Congress supports the recommendations of the Special Commission that it is not time to restore Russia to rights now," Kou said.
"For the next few months, we have to do everything we can to deal with this situation.
Our guiding principle was our desire to separate clean athletes from the trapped system," he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes, meeting the strict criteria of the International Association of Light-Athletic Federations, will be under the neutral flag of the World Championship on Light-Athletics, which will begin in London on Friday.
The head of the Special Commission of the International Association of Light-Athletic Federations, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that a number of requirements still needed to be met to restore Russia.
As he reported to reporters in London after the report made by the International Association of Light-Athletic Federations Council, drug testing is not yet being carried out in sufficient volume, and removed trainers are still doing their work at ease.
The Court arrested a Ukrainian journalist suspected of being arrested
The detainee of the Ukrainian Security Service (SBU) is a journalist, Vasili Muravicki, who has been arrested for two months, reports the SBU.
The Journal of Zitomira is suspected of public change by posting its publications on Russian sites and in violation of Ukraine's territorial integrity.
However, Russia does not support the actions of the Ukrainian authorities against the journalist, considering it to be a “barbarbar policy” against the media.
Two years after the peak of the migration crisis in Europe, Italy agreed to a limited military operation in the Mediterranean.
The Commandant Borsini patrol ship entered the territorial waters of Libya to then stop the flow of illegal migrants along with the WMS.
The decision to initiate the operation was taken by the Italian Parliament on Wednesday.
Rome agreed with the internationally recognized Government of Libya, which does not control most of the territory of the country.
The opposition cabinet and the Libyan Parliament based in Tobruk accused Italy of violating the sovereignty of Libya.
And the commander of the Libyan National Army, Feldmarshal Haftar, gave his orders against the Italian ships.
In Rome, however, it was stated that they did not believe these threats and intended to send another military vessel to the Libyan territorial waters.
The situation was discussed last week in the negotiations of Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni and the head of the Libyan office of Faiz Saraj, recognised by Europe.
The Italian authorities went to establish a maritime mission to combat illegal migration after statistics on illegal immigration had been published in July: 95,000 people since the beginning of the year.
The Government stated that resources for the reception of migrants had been exhausted.
A massive crash happened in Skype
The global decline in Skype's service was recorded today in several countries of the world.
On Thursday, 3 August, the media began sending complaints to programme developers.
In Microsoft it was stressed that specialists are already working actively to address the problems faced by Europeans and North America, explaining the RIA News.
Let us recall that in June of the year, Skype was also involved.
Users could not receive and send messages for some time.
The two leaders of the Ukrainian Consulate on Easy Athletics have removed from participation in the CMM
Olga Zemlak and Olese Povh, who are in the short run, are excluded from the composition of Ukraine's World Championship 2017 in London.
This is reported on the Federation's website by the country's easy athletes (FLAU).
Such a decision was taken by the Polish organization in connection with the launch of the International Association of Light-Athletic Federations (IAAF) of disciplinary proceedings in respect of light-athletics.
From the Ukrainian delegation, Coach Zemlák Sergei Basenko has also been excluded.
As reported by Sportarena, IAAF is suspected of doping sports.
Povh is the bronze champion of the 2012 Olympics and the 2011 World Championship, the Europe-2010 Championship at 4 to 100 metres, the Earth is the winner of the 2012 European Championship at 4 to 400 metres.
The World Championship for Easy Athletics in London will take place from 4 to 13 August.
How financial rules affect the move of Neimar to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unrestricted costs from European football clubs do not prevent the world record of the transfer of Neimar from the Spanish Barcelona to the French Pari San Germen.
Whatever the consequences may be in the chain, for the Couple of St. Germen by the WEFA, a leading body controlling the European football, in which the authorities prohibit the team from participating in the prestigious tournament of the League of Champions.
According to the Financial Fireplace Regulations introduced by WEFA in 2011, the GSP will eventually have to show that Nimara's transfer was financed without significant losses.
Barcelona paid 222 million euros ($262 million) just to free a Brazilian from the contract, and Naaman will receive a complaint that will reach tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some financial aspects of Neimar's move to France.
The GSP can certainly be used to hire and add it to the galaxy of other stars if it involves funding the team by the rich energy of the Qatari ruling family.
Clubs have the right to spend large amounts on the acquisition of toys, but they have to be balanced against legitimate sources of income in order to reach a level of profitability in their football business.
The FFP was elected by Michel Platini after his election as President of WEFA in 2007.
The former French footballer believed that clubs that were in huge debt in their pursuit of success were, in fact, injuring and risking destruction if the banks or owners had stopped financing.
In 2011, FFP ceased to focus on clubs and instead turned to tracking their losses.
As a result of this change in the business model originally used by Roman Abramovic in Chelsea in 2003, buying a club with good potential and then seriously spending to improve the team and create a world brand became a difficult plan.
During the present three-year evaluation period, which will take place in 2018, clubs can lose 30 million euros.
And despite the fact that platinum was removed from the presidential post in 2015, his successor in WEFA Alexander Cheferin is still determined to stop excessive traffic.
“It is clear that the FFP is alive, and we, moving forward, will strengthen the rules,” Andre Traverso, who was overseeing the FFP in WEFA, told the Associated Press last week.
Although the GSP will pay the purchase of the Nimara contract at the same time, it may allocate that amount to account for the entire duration of its contract.
Naaman signed a five-year contract, so the transfer value can be shown in annual accounts as costs of €44.4 million over the next five years.
During the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, severe sanctions were applied to GSPs, as well as to Abu Dhabi, Manchester City.
A fine of 60 million euros was imposed (the course was $82 million), which was subsequently reduced to 20 million euros, and it was prescribed to limit the composition of its team to the Champions League during the 2014-1015 season by 21 players instead of ordinary 25.
WEFA is tracking clubs that may try to re-assess its financial inspections by disaggregating its income from the company owners.
Even if the Qatari company could offer GSPs, but if the amount of funding was considered to be superior to the standard market prices, WEFA would not allow it to be considered as a legitimate income.
That is what happened in 2014, when WEFA decided that the amount of funding from the Qatar Tourism Office had been distributed.
It was reported that a part of Naaman's salary to the WFP could have been paid by the Organizational Committee of the World Championship in Qatar in 2022.
But PSY and Qatar-2022 deny that Neimar will be the postman of the world's champion, and such a maneuver could easily be found by WEFA inspectors.
The past sanctions imposed on the GSP mean that WEFA will be more careful to track any attempts to circumvent the rules.
As reported in the fourth report on the situation, WEFA did not hold preliminary discussions with the GSP on the transfer of Nimara.
They contacted the Associated Press on anonymity, as they were not authorized to discuss the GSP.
According to the latest published report, in 2015-1016, the GSP received more than 10 million euros in traffic in 542.4 million euros.
The accounts for the last financial year have not yet been published.
The GSP expects the arrival of Nimara to be a favourable ground for sponsorship transactions, sales of attributes and team logos.
In the club, trade is expected to grow by at least 30 per cent as a result of the new game.
Without a doubt, the Spanish League has tried to prevent the transfer of Neimar, claiming that the GSP would violate the financial “fire-play”.
“This is an obvious case of financial doping, with the club and the State,” said the Spanish newspaper “AS” President La Ligi Javier Thebas, meaning that the final owner of the "PSG" is Qatar.
Arsenala Coach Arsenal Wenger, whose club belongs to the American sports magnet, shares La Ligi's doubts about the funding of the club by the State.
“This is all the consequences of the left-hand participation, and this has completely changed the football landscape in the last 15 years,” Wenger said on Thursday.
"When the club belongs to the country, maybe everything.
It would be very difficult to follow the financial framework, because countries could have many ways and many reasons to be represented by such a serious game.
Order and place of oath to be determined by the President
Where and as new Russian citizens will swear to the loyalty of the RF, the President will determine such amendments to the second reading of the law in question had developed the Committee of the Gosswords on Law and Construction.
A week ago, the MPs planned to directly determine the order of the swearing of the law.
From the birth of a solemn oath, children under the age of 18 will be released, as well as disabled, should be included in the amended text of the draft law on the nationality of the RF, which the Committee will consider before the second reading of its meeting on 11 July.
The idea of entering the FF citizenship was supported by President Vladimir Putin on 6 June at a meeting with the speaker, Mr. Vyacheslav Volodin, instead of signing the documents.
The MPs formulated this idea in the form of an amendment to the second reading of a bill to abolish a decision on the extradition of nationality to those who were subsequently convicted of a number of terrorist or extremist crimes: for example, for public appeals to terrorism or its public justification in the media or on the Internet (art. 2, art. 205.2 UC RF), as well as for aircraft, train or water transport, but only if this action is related to terrorism (art. 4, art. 211 UC RF).
According to the bill, the logic of the bill was as follows: by drawing up documents on nationality, a person is under an undertaking to comply with Russian law - he has become on his way to extremism, and he violates that promise.
The bill was introduced in April by the leaders of the political factions Vladimir Vasilev ("One Russia"), Gennadius Zuganov (CPRF), Vladimir Girinovski (LDPR), Sergey Mironov ("Justice Russia") and speaker Mr. Vajeslav Volodin.
On 19 May, he was adopted by the Members at first reading.
Last week, the DG Committee on Housing and Legislation adopted the draft law at second reading, but has now been recast.
It now says that the oath order will be established by the President of the RF.
Earlier, parliamentarians were going to describe the procedure directly in the RF Citizenship Act, indicating that the ceremony should be held in a solemn setting in front of the State Herb and the flag of Russia in the presence of the representative of the IMF.
However, the text of the bill did not make sense where such an event was to take place - a list of places where the RF hierarchy could be located, was regulated by the relevant federal constitutional law.
These include courts, cabinets of heads of authority of entities, municipal education, judges, prosecutors, heads of federal executives, etc.
Most likely, it could be the ZAGS.
Making a solemn oath to obtain the nationality of the RF will be after the officers have checked their documents.
But the Russian passport will be obtained only after the oath has been made, as is the case with the revised text.
A week ago, the draft stated that the oath should precede the signing of the order.
The updated text states that the Russians will swear from 18 years, rather than from 14.
There was a rule on which the oath would be exempted from being made incapacitated or limited, as well as on those who could not speak, read or sign the vow text on their own.
In addition, the President of the RF has the right to exempt from this procedure and to “other persons”,
The updated bill also sets out a special procedure for admission to Russian citizens of Ukraine, who are considered Russian-speaking.
They will have to formally renounce Ukrainian citizenship by making a statement to the competent authority of Ukraine for that purpose.
A notary certified copy of the statement will have to be transmitted to the Russian officials.
Refusal of “foreign” nationality, as it is now, will not be required if it is provided for by an international treaty or if it is not possible “for reasons other than persons”.
The relevant amendment to the law was proposed by a group of MPs, including the first Vice-President of Mr. Ivan Melnikov (CPRF), Natalie Polonski, Pavel Krašeninnik and Irat Farrahov (the only Russian).
I think many of you know that getting a report from Ukraine isn't real, it's just impossible.
Accordingly, very many people are waiting for their decision on the nationality of the FF, explained in advance the head of the think committee on the construction and legislation of Paul Krašeninnik (ER).
In addition, the text made it clear that restrictions on the occupation of certain positions for foreigners would not apply to those who had rejected "other" citizenship in writing and had submitted a former passport to the Russian IDB, but had not ceased to be considered a citizen of another country “on its own grounds”.
Foreigners are now forbidden to hold municipal posts, to be admitted to work on facilities and in organizations related to the security of Russia.
Also, a person with a dual nationality or a type of residence may not become a Member of the Government or a member of the Council of the Federation.
It is planned that the law should enter into force as from 1 September 2017 and that necessary legislative acts should be prepared at that time.
Nostalgia is becoming a ninja in the "Gark American Summer" and "Deputy Detective"
The current iteration of history is notable at the same time about the glorious days of the person in the 80s; about the age of the 90s (e.g. when the distinguished Masters David Wayne and Michael Shawlter made a "State" comedy for MTV); and about themselves, that is, the year 2001, before her stars Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poller and Paul Radd went to more serious news.
As a fact of culture, it is a parallel increase and expansion of our era with its constant reminders from Facebook.
But as a Frenchman, she seems to be an anachronism.
"The first day of the camp" was a surprise, not just because of the absurdistic humor (including the original story of the talking plant bank, which H. John Benjamin sounded).
The result is double the main joke: middle-aged actors play sexually concerned children who have only reached adulthood; this makes it impossible to return to the joke.
"Ten years later," where adults played by adults, they have less deep emotional roots, and their parity is more system-wide and includes riffs from the 1990s steel films of the "Hungary-lifting Bell" type.
In one episode, the person gets Apple Powerbook, four-wheel rollers, and "the house of other things since 1991".
Many topics are the same.
A generous cup (Schoolter), now a writer, has not yet obtained a mutual understanding from Katie (Margerit Moro).
Victor (Ken Marino) has not yet given birth to a virgin.
And there's still a foolish and false conspiracy in which Ronald Reagan (so Shawalter) is now instigating George Bush-Old (the trial parity of Michael Jan Blake's performance).
As always, the best part of the French is a retreat from it.
It's especially fun to see a young Radda singing Matt Dillon's song from "Onenochek", whose character, the former great man Andy now looks old.
The success of this French could lead to random nonsense in the spirit of the recursive series "Seven Up", until it comes to what it might seem to be a logical conclusion: "The hot American summer: 20 years later", where the company would be in the final stage of the movie "The Hot American summer".
The "Deputy Detective" in the Amazon refers to another kind of nostalgia: the memories of the Cold War of the Americans, the Explosive Blonde or even Bleska with its images of the East and West struggle.
This comedy, created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka with director Riz Thomas, is a television show: the Romanian police drama of the 1980s about two policemen in Bucharest fighting for the truth, atheism and Marxist-Lenin road.
The main roles of Gregor and the idealist Joseph are the performance of Florin Piersik-younger and Corneliu Ulic, and their dialogues were heard in English by Chenning Tatum (the same executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a brilliant idea.
But it's just an idea.
There are a few visual jokes (the police are spending time watching chess as Americans could watch football).
The team of famous voices behind the staff, including Jenny Slett, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevini, makes it interesting to play in the "feel the voice".
But "Deputy Detective" is so suspicious of the unencumbered propaganda drama -- there's even a killer in Ronald Reagan's mask -- it often looks like it.
Six long episodes are delayed, and funny is not very often.
If you would do it slowly, "Deputy Officer," you could better deal with your satire in the spirit of the agittopa; for example, every time Gregor and Joseph come to the American embassy, there are two fat men sitting in the lobby, who are squeezing a hamburger's house.
To the imaginable viewer-communist, this image says that Western culture is capable of doing whatever it takes to make a dieter.
The fictional Romanian film authors are not as bad as they were: We are doing so with our own recent history as well as with them.
The Russian Super-Cubbock Football Championship between Spartacus and Locomotiv is about 30 million rubs.
This was reported by the President of the Russian Football League (RFPL) Sergei Pradkin at the press conference.
According to the RFPL chapter, the winner will receive 70 per cent of this amount, reports RT.
He also added that there were almost no tickets to the match to date.
Spartacus match, Locomotiv, will take place on Friday, 14 July, at 21:30.
As TASS notes, Spartak is the current RF champion, and Locomotiv is the owner of the country's Kubak.
Two young twins cleaned up the furniture for 200 thousand rubles.
A 37-year-old plumber with a furniture company came to the police on the day.
The man claimed to be stealing expensive tools from the glass, causing serious damage to his production.
The winning blades became instruments of a total value of almost 200 thousand rubles: two interlocking apparatus, perforator, hydraulic, and bead.
The guards began searching for criminals and soon went to the residents of the Blahoweschen district of Bashcortostan, friends 23 and 24.
According to the media, the Republics had entered the territory of the enterprise, broken the entrance door and issued tools.
Immediately after that, the guys sold the stolen technology of the first stolen car service.
With regard to them, the matter of theft has already been initiated, and lawyers have been able to return only part of the stolen instruments to the rightful owner.
Mr. Medvedev's comments on the relationship between the RF and the United States
The United States and Russia should be able to work together.
This statement was made by the official representative of Mr. Hizer Nawert in response to the words of Prime Minister Dmitria Medvedev on the relations of two States.
A former head of the Russian Government stated that, following the adoption of new anti-Russian sanctions, the United States had put an end to the hope of improving bilateral relations and had declared the FF a full-fledged trade war.
In commenting on those words, Nawert acknowledged that the Russian-American relations were at the "low level", but noted that there was a need to look for "interoperating areas".
"Look at the peace in the south-west of Syria, which has been observed for almost a month."
"And this is an example of good cooperation between the United States and Russia," says RIA's diplomat News.
However, the representative of the foreign political department refused to comment on the statement of the Russian Prime Minister that sanctions were equivalent to trade wars.
The draft law on new sanctions against Russia, Iran and the CDR President of the United States has signed Donald Tramp in the past environment.
He acknowledged, however, that the document was unsuccessful and contrary to the American Constitution.
Dior "raised" roses from amethyst and quartz
The Jewelry department of the French fashion house Dior - Dior Joaillerie - filled the Rose Dior Bagatelle and Bois de Rose collections.
There were five new wheels and three wheels on the barricades.
The Rose Dior Pré Catelan line features two new rings and balloons of amethysts, pink quartz and brilliants performed in gliptic technique (hand cutting by stone) and respect for the 70-year-old home.
The head of Dior Joaillerie Victoria de Castellan was inspired by the roses that grew in its place in Granville by Christian Dior, and by the Paris gardens Baghal and Pre-Catelan.
Tramp found guilty of corruption in relations with Russia
The President of the United States, Donald Tramp, criticized the members of the Congress with extreme criticism.
According to the American leader, their actions have led to a deterioration in relations with Russia.
Our relations with Russia are at a low and dangerous level.
"You can thank Congress, these people can't even give us medicine," the president wrote on Twitter.
Recently, Donald Tramp signed a law on new sanctions against Russia, Iran and the DPRK.
In particular, they will be affected by Russian banks and energy companies.
The White House subsequently circulated the President ' s statement that it indicated that the law would not allow the United States to conclude beneficial transactions and would further close the RF, China and North Korea.
Belorussian entrepreneur refused to buy the Ukrainian daughter Sberbanka
An entrepreneur from Belarus, Victor Prokopenia, withdrew from the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) an application for purchase of the subsidiary of Sberbanka.
His business decision explained the RBC's intention to "focus on the other investments and projects that we are working on."
According to Mr. Prokopani, such a step would be "better time" despite the investment attractiveness of Sberbank's daughter.
Mr. Prokopenia became the main bidder for the purchase of the Russian bank unit in Ukraine after in July the NGO rejected the request of the consortium NorvikBank Grigoria Guselinik and of the Belarusian company Said Gucerieva.
The Russian banks began to abandon the Ukrainian market after the President of the country, Petr Poroshenko, imposed sanctions on their subsidiaries in March.
One such financial organization, apart from the TTB and the Non-Economic Bank, became Sberbank.
Novak called the cause of the Crimea blackout
In the Ministry of Energy, the RF called the cause of the Crimea blackout.
The head of the department, Alexander Novak, made an explanation of what had happened.
According to him, the peninsula remained powerless due to road traffic accidents in the territory of the Krasnodar region.
As a result, Cuban and related Crime Networks have been shut down by the truck that crashed into the DTP.
The electrical failure of major Crimean cities was recorded last week.
Specialists have eliminated the deficiencies for several hours.
It was initially reported that the blackout could have become an anomalous heat.
Bank of England maintains interest rates at 0.25%
It is expected that the Bank of England will then declare that interest rates will not change after weak economic growth and weak inflation have made it possible to hear about a possible increase.
The Bank of England warned that economic growth would remain unsustainable and left interest rates unchanged in the growing pressure on family income.
The Bank ' s monetary policy (MPC) panel members voted against 6 to 2 to maintain rates at 0.25 per cent, with a lower number of members of the Committee expressing increased rates this month, as weak economic growth weakened the support of the increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank limited its forecast to an increase of 1.7 per cent in 2017 and 1.6 per cent in 2018 and warned that family income pressure would continue, while still expected that inflation would rise to about 3% in the autumn.
However, the Bank warned that increased rates in the next few years would be necessary to control the inflation rate, and stated that it was likely that borrowing costs would have to be increased more than expected in the financial markets.
The members of the Committee also voted in favour of rejecting part of the public package of economic development measures launched a year ago due to the break-up.
Since the next February, the Bank will close the emergency financing plan on which it provides the banks with cheap loans, although it has reported that it is now due to provide another 15 billion pounds to 115 billion pounds in the plan.
In the bank's decision-making protocol, “According to the main projections of MPC, the growth of gross domestic product (GDP) will soon remain slow, while the pressure on real family income continues to affect consumption”.
On the issue of rates, he reiterated that in order to stop inflation, there would be a need for “some increase in financial policies” to be “a little larger” than expected by markets.
At this point, markets predict the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another one in 2020.
But the Bank stressed that all improvements would be “steps” and “limited”.
The Bank's forecast for increase this year and next year is below the forecast made in May, which was 1.9 per cent and 1.7 per cent.
The Bank has left its forecast unchanged at 1.8 per cent in 2018.
After these news, sterling fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5 per cent to $1.31 and by 0.4 per cent to €1.11.
The decision not to change the rate was taken after the recent slowdown in growth rates was expected to increase; GDP increased by 0.3 per cent in the second quarter to 0.2 per cent in the previous three months.
According to the representative of the bank, growth will, in all, remain at 0.3 per cent in the third quarter, although it will begin to increase slightly at the end of the year.
The latest inflation report has given little reason for the joy of households, which have hit high inflation and a slight increase in wages: according to the bank, the pressure will be increased before it is reduced.
The Bank added that the financial policy “cannot “prevent” a success in the coming few years, but expects “significant” wages to be restored to the end of its three-year forecast.
The economy is also focused on growth as a result of the growing demand for British goods resulting from the low rate of the pound, which compensates for part of the reduced consumption costs.
The decision was taken a year after the rate was reduced to 0.25 per cent in the past August following the shocking results of the Euros Union withdrawal referendum.
It is estimated that it will take four years to fully influence prices and the economy.
Before the bank made its final decision at the rates, the noise around the expected increase in the rates increased, as inflation was becoming more and more strong in the household: three in the committee requested an increase of 0.5 per cent in July.
Last month inflation fell to 2.6% from 2.9% in July, although the bank reported that this decline was expected and recompensated in the coming months.
According to the Bank, a higher rate than expected 2 per cent is entirely due to the low rate of the pound.
Andrew Montlake, director of Coreko's mortgage brokers, said: "If you take into account the recent decline in the sales price, the mortgage market will become even more competitive again, as creditors demand business opportunities and expect a good year's completion.
The market is particularly favourable to those approaching the conclusion of their existing treaties, since refinancing of loans, often with the possibility of the absence of a commission, as well as with a low rate, is becoming popular as ever.”
The Public Health Service will prescribe HIV 10000 people in the dispute
Since September, patients will have access to a “revolutionary” drug for HIV prevention after a battle in the High Court on funding for the drug from the Public Health Service.
The National Health Service of England announced that the pre-exposure prevention of HIV (PREP), a pre-exposure tablet, which has been proven to reduce the risk of infection in the risk group, by an average of 86 per cent, will now be provided to the health service for the initial three-year trial period of approximately 10,000 people.
She agreed to finance the test after the appeal court supported the High Court ' s ruling last year, which claimed that the National Health Service had the opportunity to pay the PRE, despite its statement that it should be financed by local authorities.
This step announced on Thursday was called “the most important innovation” by the President of the National Health Service of England Simon Stevens, and the National AIDS Control Office (NAT) called it “the turning point”.
Prior to the full launch of the whole of England by April 2018, Veneological Dispensers in London, Briton, Manchester, Liverpool and Cheffield will begin to register people, and even more Dispensers will join the programme in October.
Pre-exposure prevention (PREP) is a course of HIV drugs taken to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
According to the studies, the PREP significantly reduces the risk of HIV infection among people at risk.
When receiving PREP before sex in a human body, the number of specific drugs is sufficient to prevent infection with HIV.
Such medicines may be taken every day or no later than two hours before sex.
Patients entitled to a medicinal product are homosexual and bisexual men, transgenders and people whose HIV partners are positive and do not receive successful treatment.
Distributors will select appropriate participants who have agreed to participate in the study, including men, women, transgenders and individuals whose partners are not aware of whether their HIV status is inhibited by antiretroviral therapy.
People living and prescribed for a doctor of common practice in England will also be able to apply for potential participation in the nearest winery distributor participating in the programme.
The programme will be worth 10 million pounds, and the National Health Service of England signed a drug contract this week after the international tender.
The study is designed to assess all possibilities of the PREP for the collection of clinical data on who is the target auditor of the product, on its ownability and application to a large extent.
“This key innovation should complement and strengthen the widespread and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
This is another wave of more than three decades of success in combating one of the greatest health threats facing mankind.
Deborah Gold, President of NAT (National AIDS Control Board), said: “This is a turning point in the fight against HIV.
The EAP, if it is aimed in writing at people in need of assistance and at risk, provides an opportunity to change the situation of the HIV epidemic in England.
As of September, people in the HIV risk group will be given access to the new opportunities that are open to people to control themselves, without discussing it with a partner, which will lead to the improvement of many lives.
We warmly welcome this news."
Jan Green, president of the Terrence Higgins Fund, said: “The first thing we need to do is to make sure that the test is carried out quickly throughout the country, and that none of the risk groups on HIV are forgotten.
Now that we are provided with the experimental PREP, we are going to protect more than 10000 people in the HIV risk zone.”
Tenevy Minister of Public Health Sharon Hodgson said: “We welcome the start of the PRE test, it has been very late for months of delays and delays by the Government.”
The data show how revolutionary this drug can be as part of our approach to preventing HIV and ending the transmission of this rock infection.
This test will bring us closer to the full understanding of the benefits of the EPR.
It is now important that the trial be conducted as soon as possible throughout the country to protect those at risk of HIV and to move us further towards the end of the spread of HIV in society.
World Tatar Congress adopted a resolution on the support of the Tatarstan and Russia treaty
The Sixth Conference of the World Tatar Congress (WCT) adopted a resolution, which noted the importance of maintaining the President's post in Tatarstan.
According to the document, the post is “positively for the recommended form of organization of the highest government in the Republic and expressing the national interests of the whole Tatar people”.
In addition, the Conference stressed in the resolution the importance of a treaty on the separation of powers between Russia and Tatarstan.
According to the document, he “played a positive role in the ethnocultural, socio-economic and public-political development of Tatarstan and the Russian Federation as a whole”.
The treaty between Moscow and Kazan was concluded for 10 years as from 24 July 2007.
On 11 July, Mr. Tatarstan's deputies asked the President of Russia to extend the agreement and to retain the appointment of the head of the region.
Tatarstan is now the only member of the federation with a treaty with Russia.
The head of the region is the only one whose post is called "the President".
There have been difficulties in obtaining international driving rights in Russia
IDBDDs have a lack of international driving certificates (IMUs).
In order to obtain such rights, we have to wait a few weeks, which has become a problem for vacationers who want to leave for a vacation abroad on their car or take it there for a ride.
It should be noted that the situation with international driving licences remains controversial.
IMUs were introduced to make it easier for foreign police to understand what was written in the national certificate, as information was explained in five languages.
The requirements for international rights are recorded in the 1968 Vienna Convention on Road Traffic, but Russian rights are recognized in the countries ratified by the Vienna Convention.
In fact, however, it depends on specific police or prosecutorial offices: some require IMI, and some people have enough national rights.
In order to ensure that international rights leaders still receive, it should be borne in mind that the non-ratified country convention (e.g., the United States, Spain, Mexico, Indonesia) has the authority not to recognize national rights or ICUs.
The problem with the templates is now being found in almost all IDBD units, reports the Commission, carrying out a study in a number of regions.
So, in Moscow, UGIBDD's talent is simply not issued, and it's not enough for four months.
It is possible to register on the site of the housekeepers, but it has already grown in the middle of August.
In Krasnoyarsk, it is impossible to obtain "for technical reasons", without giving in detail, in the Samara area they honestly say that there are no forms, and the similar situation is also found in other cities.
The problem has already been faced by many mosquitoes, and in short, the following messages are increasingly emerging:
Irina Burmistrova: "Think, why can't international law be obtained in Moscow?"
That's right, because all IDBD offices have completed the forms.
Elena Podkolzina: "Question to the people who know."
International rights need to be obtained very urgently.
In Moscow, they are always far ahead, and there are no hostages in the place (there is a doll, but the doll can't give it).
Some sort of portal of goose servants shows that in Spob's time is free to go.
Did anyone try to get in another city?
Is it working?
As explained in the IMF, the requirements for international driving licences have changed, and therefore the Gosavto Inspection Unit has been responsible for the delivery of new forms.
This may be related to the deficit, and it is true that the changes have not been reported before.
Blanky purchases the Road Safety Special Selection Centre (CSNBDD) of the IMF RF and then transfers it to the IDBD unit.
In recent years, all contracts have been concluded with Goznak OO: in 2014-2015, almost 200 thousand ICU forms have been manufactured, in 2016, 15 thousand forms have been purchased, in 2017, 90,000, but the last contract was concluded with OO on July 18 with the "First Print Court" for the manufacture of 70,000 forms.
There's a version that the SCN just failed to hold the tender in time, which is why the deficit is causing it.
However, there are other versions of the shortage of forms: because of the crisis, many people have become self-employed, not in Europe, but in cheaper Asian countries, China, Thailand and so on.
What rights there are, to the end, unclearly, therefore, people and are insurmountable, and therefore there is a curious demand for international “shorts”.
It has recently become known that professional drivers will have to submit exams to confirm their qualifications.
The proposal was made by Mindrans.
The International Driving Certificate (ITU) of the new model has been in force since 31 May 2011.
Minister of Justice of Ukraine refused to believe in the construction of the Crimean Bridge
The Minister of Justice of Ukraine, Paul Petrenko, said he did not believe in Russia's ability to build a bridge in Crimea.
On Friday, August 4, he said in an interview with the Watchman's portal.
No respectable international company will even put a bull or a goat there, because it is at risk of losing its business in the EU, the US, Japan, in countries that have joined the sanctions against Russia against Crime.
"That is, in my deep conviction, there is actually no prospect of this project," said Petronko.
He added that Russia considered it impossible to implement a major infrastructure project on its own.
Russia cannot normally build less large facilities.
I know that after the Olympics in Sochi, all the stadiums have been destroyed.
"Therefore, I believe that the best instrument in this situation is sanctions against companies that have become so unattainable to join the project," the official said.
On 31 July, the builders completed the construction of the Crimean Bridge car ark.
On the mainland coast, a massive collection of the Kremlin Bridge’s road ark is completed: it will be closed at a height of 45 metres from the base of the construction.
“At the same time, bridge builders have prepared a railway ark to be installed on the ferry stops,” they reported in the project information centre.
In April, President Montrans Maxim Sokolov informed Russian President Vladimir Putin that the site was being launched with a timetable.
The Crime Bridge connects the Crimean Peninsula and the Krasnodar region.
In Spain, a ten-year-old officer was fired
What kind of English patience (or absolute indifference to public service) did the Spanish official Charles Resio have to have?
The permanent walk has grown for 10 years.
However, Mr. Resio was fired.
But not your direct boss.
There's nothing going to happen to bureaucrats in the world.
People seem to have been used to all the jokes of "people's servants."
And yet, officials are always able to admire those whose taxes are not bad.
This time, the "sense" came from Spain.
There, a member of the archive of Valencia Carles Resio has been unemployed for ten years.
However, he received regular complaints.
The whole solid, however, is 50 thousand euros a year.
And here's Mr. Resio's "wonderful times" are over.
He was dismissed by the Valencia Legislative Assembly.
In the investigation, it was found that each morning the malicious walker came to the office at 07:00 to be recorded in the electronic system.
And here he went home.
Once again, he appeared at work at 4:00, to notice again in the system that he left.
That's 10 years old.
It was also known that the walker devoted all his time to drawing comics at home.
The members of the Valencia Legislative Assembly now think how to punish Mr. Resio, who could not know how to "actively work" at his workplace.
The Judges propose to protect against the Presidents
The Presidential Human Rights Council (HR) under the order of Vladimir Putin has developed proposals to strengthen the independence of the judiciary.
The SPC proposes to limit the powers of the Presidents of the courts and to introduce their election.
In the case of the Court of Appeal and the Court of Cassation, the SPC wishes to introduce special districts that will not be associated with the administrative and territorial division of the RF.
The Supreme Court should also submit its proposals under the presidential mandate.
The SPC has completed the development of proposals that will strengthen the independence of Russian justice.
This work was carried out by the SPD at the order of Vladimir Putin of 3 January 2017, which the President gave after a meeting with the members of the Council.
The meeting with members of the Council on 8 December 2016 was discussed, including individual cases of the judiciary, as well as issues of public control at the places of detention (see “U” of 9 December).
The full work of the SPC has become 25 proposals that concern both the independence of judges and the identification of judicial errors and the financing of courts and legal education.
One of the ideas of Kremlin human rights defenders is to restrict the powers of the Presidents of the courts to enhance the independence of the remaining judges.
If a candidate for a judge has successfully passed the contest and has received support from the judicial community, the President of the Court, in the opinion of the SPC, must submit him to appointment without having the right to refuse as the law now permits.
It is also proposed to deprive the President of the right to distribute cases for consideration among judges.
In doing so, experts may be allowed to write a specific computer program.
The SPD also considers that the Chair is not entitled to “predict the results of a judge’s qualification, initiate his involvement in disciplinary responsibility, take decisions on the establishment of additional material payments”.
In this connection, the Presidential Council considers it necessary to move to the "election of the Presidents of the Courts themselves" and to "give them powers for a relatively non-permanent period with binding rotation".
All the presidents of the courts (from the Republic to the districts) are now appointed for six years by the President of the RF Supreme Court.
In order to protect judges from the pressure of regional administrations, the SPD proposes to reorganize appeals and appeals in the courts of general jurisdiction.
Their structure is now linked to the administrative and territorial division of the RF.
The SPC says that “it is necessary to ensure that individual courts of appeal and cassation are organized not at the level of the regional judicial authorities in the FF entities but in the districts of justice”.
Experts are taking the lead in the practice of arbitral tribunals.
There are "judicial districts" that do not correspond to the administrative division in the FP, but which guarantee this great independence from regional officials who have difficulty in using the "telephone law".
The World Courts of Justice of the CHR proposes to strengthen the people's councils to consider, with their participation, some “civil and administrative categories”.
For example, the deprivation of parental rights, the restoration of work, the protection of honour and dignity, the deprivation of driving rights, etc.
"It's just our proposals," explained the "U" member of the SPD, a judge of the Constitutional Court in the resignation of Tamar Morstakow.
She also recalled that the President's mandate was not only for the SPC, but also for the Supreme Court (HR), which had not yet revealed its proposals.
There is still time to carry out the mandate of the Office of the Office of the Secretary-General and the Human Rights Officer of the Office of the Secretary-General of the Office of the Secretary-General.
To report to Vladimir Putin on how effective the RF is in ensuring the independence of justice, the President of Váceslav Lebedev should be until 1 September.
Living a long life: half-life and smart designers have turned this small apartment into an apartment in Earls Court.
Joan Li, a former banker who was refurbished, moved from a space house to the Nightsbridge apartment in Earls Court in 2014.
The apartment is on the first floor of a nice typical house in the style of Queen Anna, and for the benefit of the new design it says that Joan didn't pick up her stuff and move again.
"I used to live with my ex at Nightsbridge in a much bigger place," says Joan.
“I wanted something comparable to my money.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and there were the same high floors.
“I fell in love with her, and I offered her the price of that day.”
Since the first inspection of the apartment in the area at 1000 square feet, it has been completely reconstructed.
It was originally a bedroom with a complicated plan – to get into the bedroom, it was necessary to go through the kitchen – and Joanna wanted to add space to store things and half the space to get the most benefit from the generous height of the floors.
"I wanted high floors, large windows, a lot of light.
Such were my requirements," she says.
To this end, she hired Erfana Azadi from the Notting Hill architectural and design studio “Duck & Shed” to use 12.5 feet high floors and to create a home that would not only be a successful project but would have agreed to life.
It was not high enough to build two rooms over one another, so the architectural task was to create a semitrailer where full growth could be achieved.
Erfan had to think creatively to deal with the bridge.
“Working with permanent structures is very difficult,” he explains.
"We had to have room so that they could be on top of each other, and we didn't have to move.
It was not simply necessary to build a simple platform, but to remove the structures so that they could be at the right height and allow the upper and lower spaces to be used.”
This decision allowed Erfan to set up two fully sized rooms above each other in the remote area – and still very interesting.
With a pudding through an exciting slow light window from “Retrovius”, there is a species of a ski hotel below.
The gold-plated furniture, silver accents, and vintage lighting equipment from Serja Muya set the style of the project.
The use of the mirror plays a role in adding visibility, space and light.
A short corridor covered with mirrors to make it look longer.
In the kitchen, the protective panel looks like a window in another room.
In front of the entrance, the mirrors serve to store the entire John dish.
In order to create a feeling of a brighter space, the beauty of the hotel can be furnished with a kitchen when it is not used.
There's nothing new in the kitchens.
The uniqueness of this kitchen is that it's moving up the door like it's in the garage.
“The engineering industry has been involved here,” Erfan tells of an armed steel shield door wood-volcanist.
“It’s equipped with a counterweight, so when you push the door up, it’s very easy.”
Because of the reasonable use of space and storage facilities, Joan received an additional 16 square metres, an additional bedroom and improved planning.
“At the end of the day, the sex scene is exactly what you will sell, that is, what your real estate is estimated to be.”
“A real estate agent will come and make calculations based on sex.”
Here they have been able to increase the area of sex by using quality materials that contribute to the area of flowering.
“Materials are what we touch, so they help create an emotional connection to the home,” Erfan says.
“No one likes the electric conductor in the walls.
It's important, but it doesn't touch the strings of our hearts."
This is evidence that a good design and an increased metering of the apartment can turn out to be something unusual.
Actually, just like Joan, you can decide to stay.
Government approved the establishment of a commission on cultural policy
The Government of Russia approved the establishment of a public cultural policy commission.
The relevant decision was published on the Government ' s website.
According to the document, the Commission's main task will be to develop and adjust strategic approaches to cultural policy.
The Commission will also develop draft cultural policy strategies, clarify the challenges and prepare new programmes for its implementation.
The Chief Commission is appointed as the Vice-President of the Government of the RF.
The composition of the commission will be approved separately.
Prime Minister Dmitri Medvedev approved a plan to implement the public cultural policy strategy by 2030.
The plan includes 193 activities and measures to enhance the influence of Russian culture in other countries, to preserve a single cultural space and cultural heritage, and will also contribute to creating conditions for the development of culture in the country.
Inflation in G20 countries decreased to a minimum of eight years
The increase in consumer prices in the G20 countries has decreased to a minimum of eight years, reports The Wall Street Journal, referring to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
According to OECD estimates, inflation rates in June 2016 were 2 per cent lower in October 2009, when the price growth index reached 1.7 per cent.
In the past, Rosstat reported a decline in the Russian consumer price index of 0.1 per cent.
The department thus recorded the first weekly deflation in 2017.
The Russian inflation target, according to Minfin, is 4.1 per cent.
The economy, however, believes that the target has already been achieved, at the version of this department, is 4 per cent.
Putin warned against the illegal cutting of the bicycles
Russian leader Vladimir Putin warned against the illegal destruction of forests during the meeting on the environmental development of the Bicalian natural territory.
In the course of the process, the Minister of Natural Resources Sergei Donski noted that a bill had been prepared earlier.
It will allow the forest to be cut off during the fire, and the Government plans to adopt it in the autumn.
In turn, the President said that the project should be followed by monitoring that the cut-off process “does not break all the arrangements”.
Donski noted that the bill implied control by PMS and supervisors.
The media: USU combats secret from the command are negotiated with Colonel Donbass
A regular telephone connection has been established through the Donbasses armed conflict.
The combatants of the opposing parties are constantly communicating with each other on their mobile phones, and they do not know about this in the headquarters.
The U.S.U.S. boys and Colonel Donbass made a secret contact on hundreds of phones from their high command.
On 4 August, Strana.ua reported on this with reference to the participants of the military operation in Donbass.
According to the publication, the commanders of the units know the names of their colleagues on the opposite side of the front and communicate with them on the telephone every day.
The community is not at home: the commanders are trying to achieve some “tactic arrangements”.
The results of such discussions are often a move to a certain area of the front.
Journalists have become aware of the cases when a congratulation on the day of birth was received by an officer on the basis of the front line by his formal enemy.
The U.S.S.O.S.O.S.O.S.O.S. and L.L.R.O.P.R.O. will be on the line of separation since spring 2014, when Ukraine launched a war against Donbass.
Mid-Mid has been alarmed by the blocking of UNSCR's attacks on the FP embassy
The Russian foreign police department is alarmed by the actions of some Western diplomatic representatives who block United Nations Subez's statements in the press condemning the terrorist attacks of the FF Embassy in Syria.
This is reported by the Russian MIDI.
The department recalled that the Russian Embassy's territory in Damascus on 2 August the third time a month was attacked by the terrorist groups "Hayat Tahrir Ash-Sham" (formerly "Jhabhat An-Nusra", banned by the FF) and "Filek Ar-Rahman".
Taking into account that the international community is united in the Nursi qualification as a terrorist organization, and UNSCRs call against that structure, the IMF noted that “it would be clear that Nursi acts should be met with total unconditional and firm condemnation, and that there should be no ambiguity in the evaluations of exits against diplomatic missions”.
However, as stressed in the doctrine, “for the third time a month, US, UK, France and Ukraine in the United Nations Security Council have blocked the proposal of the Russian Federation to adopt a standard draft statement of the Security Council for the press condemning terrorist attacks on the Russian diplomatic representation in the Syrian capital”.
The desire to show diplomatic solidarity with us should remain conscious of those delegations.
“The most disturbing thing is that the inability of the Security Council to condemn the acts of terrorists encourages them to face new provocations and acts, gives them a sense of impunity,” they said in the MIDI and added that “they do not want to have the conviction that someone in the Security Council is with them.”
Vladimir Putin spoke for limiting the number of off-the-line business checks
The President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, said during the project meeting in the Far East that the number of out-of-the-art business inspections should be reduced to 30 per cent of the planned number and said that it was necessary to limit the time for inspections by 10 percentage points.
“Integral checks are usually carried out without agreement with the prosecutor’s office; only 2-3 per cent agrees with the prosecutor’s office, all others are going on their own,” quoted President TASS.
Vladimir Putin also said that investigators should be forbidden to remove servers and hard drives from businesses.
In addition, in the view of the President, business associations should be entitled to protect the interests of their members in court.
"It is my hope that a certain position will be taken into consideration in matters relating to business or in matters relating to a breach of the law in the area of business," said the Head of State.
As “U” reported, the moratorium on planning checks has increased the number of other types of inspections by enterprises.
In May, an inquiry was conducted with the President of Russia, Boris Titova, who found that there was a real replacement of the planned checks for non-planned people (the proportion of them encountered increased from 21.9 per cent in 2015 to 30.8 per cent in 2016), prosecutors (from 16.9 per cent to 21.8 per cent), raids (from 7.9 per cent to 13.3 per cent), and civilian statements (from 15 per cent to 19.5 per cent) and administrative investigations (10.8 per cent to 15.5 per cent).
More on business checks in the "U" material "The small business has gone from one side to the other".
Brothers fight for the real estate of more than $500 million
Two brothers are fighting for one of the largest in the state of Victoria's empires in trade with the value of more than $500 million - 40 years after their Italian ancestors founded a dynasty.
The former director of the Karlton Football Club and co-founder Colin de Lutís live in the castle of Turk through three doors from his younger brother Paul, who filed a claim against him in the Supreme Court for a division of ownership and assets.
Paul wants to leave the family business since 2014, but in the Supreme Court there is a heated dispute about divorce conditions.
Together with her mother, Anna's brothers own 87 objects worth more than half a billion dollars since their family bought a store at Smith Street in Collingwood in 1973.
There the family founded Westco Jeans, which grew into a network of 160 trading points.
It was sold in 1999 for $85 million.
Money was invested in real estate, and the De Luttis family's list includes office buildings, construction sites in Brunswick and Sorrento, Zoloto Beach and Mount Bouller and shopping centers in the suburbs.
According to Colin's late father, whom Paul describes as the "main driving force and dominant personality" of the De Luttis family, he owns about two thirds of the company's assets, and Paul is about one third.
According to the court, this means that Colina's property is 316 million, and Paul is 176 million.
The division of property and money has become a stone of predestination for Paul.
"The division proposed by Colin gives him, in my opinion, the best parts of the property," he wrote in his first demonstrations in 2015.
Last Friday, after several unsuccessful attempts to reconciliation, the first hearings were held in the Supreme Court.
The brothers are now arguing about who will control the existing business, from which Paul thought Colin had excluded it.
Colin claims that it is not, but he accuses Paul of mismanagement of some objects.
In the evidence given by Colin at the beginning of the process, he said he hoped to settle the dispute.
"My Italian roots make me consider the family a top priority," he wrote.
The costs are increased as a snowcomb: hundreds of pages of evidence, e-mails and records of companies such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer have been added to the case; both parties have attracted the most famous lawyers, including Queen Alan Meyers' lawyer, and the best tapes.
Ms. De Luttis and her late wife, Luigi, were immigrants from Italy; since the late 1950s, they had managed milk bars and gastronomy, and in the early 1970s they bought a shop in Brunswick.
Under financial guarantees, they bought a shop in Collingwood, where Colin opened the first family store of gins.
Colin says he started Westco when he was "in the last classes of school, and Paul was then a boy (approximately 10 years old).
Anna De Lutis said that they and Luigi, who died in 2012, were hoping to hand over their possession to their sons without conflict.
"Louiji often told me he didn't want the brothers to get to court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Luttis group; Colina says that Mark received 10 million when he got out of business, and Luke was 26 million.
According to Paul and Luke, Mark and Mark were “unsatisfied with the financial conditions of their office”.
Colin was not a public figure, although he was a former member of the AFL Club Board of Directors and, according to the 2015 biography of Eddie McGira, the best other star.
"Ferfax Media" was in contact with Colin and Paul and their lawyers on Friday.
He answered only Colin, a textual statement stating that, since the case has not yet been dealt with in court, "I have the truth to say something particularly".
"I'm very sorry that my brother Paul decided to file a complaint against me and bring our family's name to court," he wrote.
In mid - 2016, Colin wrote in evidence that he was trying to meet his brother’s requirements.
"Our father doesn't want to see how we can argue with Paul in court," he said, adding that "there is still hope for a solution to the conflict."
On Friday, this hope seems to have spread.
"The decision on our case will soon be passed by the court," Colin wrote.
The new head of the Trampa apparatus plans to limit the information to the President.
Others tried to do so and suffered defeat.
Maybe John F. Kelly is really gonna make it.
In that case, he'll be the first.
"Politics" reports that the new head of the White House apparatus plans to limit the flow of information coming to President Trampo, including news from the media, hoping to keep the head in a calmer state.
That's what reporter Josh Douzy reports.
"At a meeting held by the new head of the White House, John F. Kelly, with the lead of the apparatus on his first working day, he pointed out the main problem in the White House with President Donald Trampe, whom he hoped to resolve: bad channels of information to the President."
Kelly told the staff that information should be transmitted through him, in paper form or through briefings, because the president would be better able to make decisions if he received the correct information.
Kelly's diagnosis is quite reliable, but others have already failed, trying to calm the Tramp, tracking the information.
President Trampa's relationship with television was a few decades ago, and now that he is in the White House, his habit of watching television is still strong.
"When Tramp, as a candidate, was upset by the unfair lighting of the campaign, it was useful to demonstrate to him that he had received a fair lighting in the publications that could have been convinced," said Sam Nanberg, former Electoral Officer in February.
Tara Palmeri then wrote in "Politico", that "according to the six former members of the electoral headquarters to keep the Trampa habit of writing on Twitter, it was necessary to observe that there was a constant flow of praise in the coming personal information".
Okay.
But the idea that Trampa's habit of writing on Twitter was once "under control", just funny.
Perhaps these members of the polling station know something we don't know, for example, that if they didn't, Trampa's tweets would be even more provocative.
We may never know about the tweets that Tramp has not published.
If his staff had kept him from the trouble at least several times, their efforts were not in vain.
But no one has ever been able to keep the Trump from pouring oil into the fire.
Part of the problem is that in the White House, divided into rival factions, people are constantly trying to move forward on their agenda, providing the Tramp with material that is reliable or not, which confirms their views.
"Politics" - once in this story - wrote in May about the willingness of advisers to constantly convey questionable information to the President.
Here is an example described by the reporter Shein Goldmacher:
"The current and former Trampa officials say that Tramp can react very sharply to negative reports in the press, especially containing dangerous leaks of information, and will not be relieved until they find who was behind them.
So it happened at the end of February, when someone put the president on a copy of the GotNews.com article, the Web site by Charles K. Johnson, in which the deputy head of the Katie Welsh machine was accused of being "extending for a number of leaks" in the White House.
It is not important that Johnson is forever indicted on Twitter for his aggressive behavior, that he has not presented specific facts or that he has started false accusations in the past and then refused them.
Tramp read the article and agreed to ask staff about Wells."
Goldmacher adds that the then head of the Rains Pribus machine and the secretary of the Rob Porter machine "were trying to build a system to manage the flow of papers that Tramp receives and document them".
How did it work?
Three months later, Kelly was trying to do the same.
He may be a more effective manager than Pribus, but Trampa still has an impulse nature, and his assistants continue to fight each other for influence.
These constant factors make Kelly's task very difficult.
The Tumene Procurator ' s Office fights HIV dissident
The Public Prosecutor's Office challenged the Kalininin Parasus judgment of Tumeni, which ended the criminal case against a local resident who had died from HIV.
According to the investigation, the child died because the mother was a dissident and refused treatment.
However, the court released her from responsibility for reconciliation with the injured father.
The Public Prosecutor ' s Office believes that the crime cannot be left unpunished in order not to create a precedent for other HIV dissidents.
The case for Tumeni's resident was initiated at 1 p.m. 109 CSF (cause of insecurity death) in April after her three-year-old daughter died of HIV infection.
According to the Office, the mother herself is HIV-infected.
"The woman did not treat herself and refused to treat the daughter, believing that there was no HIV infection," they explained in the Tumena District Prosecutor's Office.
The criminal case was brought to the Kaliningrad Court of Tumeni, which, on 25 July, decided to terminate it.
An application for this was made by the father of a dead girl, explaining that "he forgave his wife, he had no claim to her, she was starving and apologized".
The Prosecutor ' s Office, with the decision of the court, refused and appealed, demanding that the termination order be revoked and sent to a new hearing.
The girl died, and it's impossible to starve the crime of harm.
The HIV-infected mother, despite the advice of the doctor, refused to investigate and treat the child from a dangerous infection," reported the prosecutor's office.
According to the supervisory authority, it must punish, otherwise other HIV dissidents will follow her example.
According to the Tumna Center for AIDS, about 12 children with HIV are now in the Tumna area without medical care due to parental failure.
"And this situation has already improved - during the year of the special group of half-parents who have categorically refused to treat children from HIV, have changed their opinion - have allowed the diagnosis, become a doctor," said the Press Secretary of the AIDS Centre Elena Loseva.
According to her, it was impossible for parents to act legally and not all HIV-infected children could be found - mothers did not allow them to investigate, hide, and escape from hospitals.
What are the dangers of HIV dissidents?
At the end of last year, the Petersburg sociologists presented the results of the first study in Russia of the so-called HIV dissident movement.
HIV dissidents call people who deny the existence of HIV and refuse to take drugs.
AIDS-servicing NCO physicians and activists call such views antidepressants and see a serious threat in their distribution.
The yellow photo session, which ended in a tragedy, took place on Thursday, August 3rd, at the Greek Railway Station in Hmelnik.
The fun company of the underprivileged young people walked the bridge over the railways, where the freight train was standing.
One of the friends had an idea to make an effective car cover self, FACTAM reported in the police communications sector in the Hmelnik area.
The guy started to get off the bridge on the train, but because of his lack of supervision, he got stuck along the electric line and got hit in the current.
Luckily, it became known to the station's dissipator, who immediately called for "an emergency".
Before the doctor arrived, the patient was transferred to a safe place and then hospitalized in the fire department at the Hmelnica District Hospital.
Men were diagnosed with fevers of 1 to 2 degrees.
His condition is now considered stable.
Lawmakers have been reminded that in recent times, extreme self-esteem on the roofs of multi-stations, bridges moving in transport has become increasingly popular.
The police call on people to be vigilant and not to allow such photos, especially among children and adolescents.
Scientists allowed the existence of oceans in ancient Venus
The oceans could have existed in ancient Venus.
This is what French scientists have suggested.
Specialists have created a computer model that has demonstrated the water education process on the surface of the planet, says Science News.
It was found that at the beginning of her history, there were oceans where there were 10 per cent more water than now on Earth.
Previously, the Week Arguments wrote that, according to scientists, the ocean could have existed in Mars 4 billion years ago.
Foreign experts in their studies concluded that the water facility was available on the northern half of the Red Planet.
Three people were injured as a result of shooting at the park in San Francisco
In San Francisco, three people were injured as a result of the shooting, reported the Associated Press.
The incident occurred in Dolores Park, where a large number of visitors were present.
According to the witnesses, several men on the bridge began shouting threats.
One of them pulled out a gun and started shooting at people.
The outward appearance of the wicked could not be considered, for they had all but the eyes.
Another medical care was provided, after which he was released.
The third wound is minor, no details of his condition.
The Dolores Park hill is a popular place among locals and tourists.
On 1 July, at least 17 persons were injured during a night club shooting in Little Rock, Arkansas.
Several more visitors were injured trying to leave the room.
Louna rock group will present a new album in Barnaule
The Louna Rock Group concert will take place in Barnaule on 17 October.
The musicians will present their new album "The Wild New World", which has become one of the most anticipated religions of the year.
The collection is preparing a conceptual show that will be the brightest in the group's concert history.
The "Wonderful New World" is the fourth album by the Russian rock band Louna.
His name is related to the well-known novel anti-topy of O. Haxley "O strange new world".
The new songs do not translate a book, but they tell about a society that lives by the law of antitopics, “the blind belief in propaganda and the value of imposed values”.
The group helped to collect money on the album: more than 1200 people supported the project on Planeta.ru site.
Louna released her first album "Do Gromche!" in 2010.
Two years later, the musicians introduced the Platinum X, and in 2013 they wrote the album "We are Louna" (2013).
In the autumn of 2015, the Louna group performed a symphonic orchestra at Crocus City Hall with the program "Penny of the World".
As a group of Lucine Gewarkian (vocal), Vitalie Demidenko (bas-guitar), Ruben Kazaryan (guitar), Sergei Ponkratiev (guitar), Leonid Kinzburski (barabana).
The concert will take place at the Barnaul Club, Pharaoh, on 17 October, at 7 p.m.
Ticket price: from 1200 to 2600 rubles.
Louna is one of the huddled groups on the Russian rock stage.
The collection was established in 2008.
Their debut was held in 2009.
The team has won several prizes in various hit parades called "Dear Virgins".
The gypsies have overcome the breach and have returned to the "moon street"
Some of the most powerful homeowners in the West Midlands once again conflict with the strong gypsies who have overcome the harsh municipal authorities of the raves to re-occupied the area near their homes.
The gypsum parked 20 houses on wheels in a field bordering the rich street of Solihal, which was called the 'Millionaire Street'.
With the soldiers, the infantry, and many homes on their bicycles, they returned after they had been driven away, not far from May, nor did they interfere with the raids of the municipal authorities to prevent their invasion.
This tactical company found a breach in the defence facilities and pushed its vehicles across areas that were left untended to leave a place for the troops.
The undisputed inhabitants attacked the Municipality of Solihal, saying he was “inability to solve this problem”.
An anonymous local resident said, "They came here on Monday evening, after they had been driven out from Bentley, where they used to throw stones."
The municipality should be ashamed and forced to act because they are totally unable to solve this problem.
The gypsies were here in May, they were chased, and here they are again.
Last night there were even more gypsies, and today perhaps even more.
“The Birmingham Municipality knows how to solve this problem, they receive long-term judicial decisions to protect their parks,” she added.
I live on Streetbrook Road, and I don't like to keep paying the municipal tax, and the municipality can't even put an end to it."
One of the locals, who wanted to remain anonymous, said, "This is ridiculous. We have just seen the gypsies go away before, and, please, this is a continuous attack."
This time they were more numerous, and we saw the iron having been sent down."
The representative of the Municipality of Solihalla said: “We know about the illegal camp on the ground next to the Streetblock Road and cooperate with the Solihalla police; we are taking the necessary legal action so that they can be persecuted as soon as possible.”
In order to help us collect the evidence, it is very important that as many locals as possible report any anti-social or criminal conduct to the telephone 101 police.
This enables us to make a presentation of the situation that will be considered by the court when we present our case to them.
The cream is activated by the production of champagne wines "New World"
The Government of the Republic of Crimea "The New World" is determined to take action by transforming the New World "The New World" Ministry of Property and Land Relations "Crima Anna Anuhina" into the OAO.
100% of the company's shares will remain in the property of the Krem.
The statutory capital of the shareholding company shall be 595.5 million rubles and shall consist of 5,955 million ordinary shares of a nominal value of 100 rubles each.
The Ministry of Agriculture of Crimea has stated that if there is no funds to modernize the plant within the next three years, there will be a threat of a stop to the plant.
The amount of basic funds per enterprise is about 60-70 per cent.
The enterprise needs 1.2 billion rubles to be modernized, and as a result of the organizational and legal features, it is required to pay 50% of the revenue of the budget.
What remains is not sufficient to implement the modernization plan.
"Getting money from the owner is a problem, talking about attracting loans from large credit organizations," said Minselhoss Krim Sergei Petin in April this year.
The Crimean Parliament included the enterprise in the 2017 privatisation forecast plan.
It was proposed to take action and be put on the market.
The source of the Interfax in the Crimean authorities estimated the potential value of selling the enterprise in $40 million, and the investment of the investor in modernization was still in $30 million.
The "New World" in 2016 increased the production of juicy wines by 2.8 per cent compared to the 2015 level to 1.52 million bottles.
In 2017, the New World was about to issue 1.6 million bottles.
The company was founded in 1878 by the Prince of Lviv Golicini as a wine-making plant in the name of the New World.
The plant is located on 11 hectares of land.
Lower-city third-class gangsters smashed more than 40 graves
In the Low-City area, the MVG staff have identified individuals who have destroyed 46 burial sites in the city of Lyskovo.
A third - grade student was a criminal.
The first statement that the burial sites were damaged by the unknown was made by Russia ' s OMVD on 27 June.
In this regard, 24 people have been approached by the police.
As a result, a criminal case was initiated under article 244 of the RF “Destruction, damage or desecration of burial sites”.
As a result of the investigation, the police found the suspects, two schoolchildren 8 and 9 years of age.
The juvenile offenders told the police that they had been interested in seeing the memory fall, and that had led them to hooligan actions.
Preventive activities were carried out with children and their parents.
Italy is intensifying its tone with regard to NGOs that rescue migrants.
Italy warned NGOs belonging to rescue courts in the Mediterranean that they would not be able to continue their work unless they were subject to new rules governing their activities.
"If NGOs do not comply with the new code of conduct, it is difficult to say whether they can continue their activities," said Mario Minniti, Minister of Interior, in an interview with the Stampa daily newspaper.
The warning of Miniti came on the next day after the Italian authorities confiscated a ship belonging to the German humanitarian organization Jugend Rettet, suspecting that his crew was actually cooperating with human traffickers and facilitating illegal immigration.
The humanitarian organization, which has been working for the whole year, has rejected comments on the substance of the detailed charges brought against it by Italian prosecutor Ambrojo Cartosio.
"There is and will remain a high priority for us in human life, so we are very sorry that we cannot now continue our activities in the search and rescue zone," says an organization in the neighbourhood.
"We will be able to assess all the charges made now only after we have collected all the information and are able to assess the situation."
The Italian authorities have been following the Jugend Rettet vessel since October.
Its crew is suspected that all life-saving helmets have been taken on board by migrants sent directly to them by traders and allowed smugglers to go along with ships that they could use again.
At least one such meeting was expected to take place only 1.3 miles from the Libyan coast, as stated in the indictments published in Italian media.
The crew is suspected of violating the requirements of the Italian coastal authorities that control rescue operations in the area rather than for any other reason.
The Code of Conduct mainly implies that the Juventa courts will have on board an Italian police officer who will monitor their activities.
While only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations agreed to comply with the Code: "Spasti Children", Maltese MOAS and "Pro-Activa Disseminational Entities" from Spain.
The latter stated on Thursday that the new rules were unnecessary, but acceptable, provided they would not lead to any "significant change or confusion" of its rescue operations.
Among those who refused to sign are those who received the Nobel Prize for Doctors without Borders (MSF).
In the meantime, Minitty said that a sharp decline in the number of migrants arriving in Italy over the last few weeks as a result of rescue operations indicated that efforts to support Libyan coastal security and cooperation with local mayors bore fruit.
"In the last days we have begun to see the light at the end of the tunnel," said the Minister.
He reported on plans for further negotiations with the Libyan mayors on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving those countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
"In Libya, we do not want to associate with any of the parties to the conflict"
The authorities of the RF have recently significantly intensified their policies in the Libyan direction, and delegations of the opposing Libyan parties have often visited Moscow with visits.
The head of the Russian contact group on the internal settlement of the IDF and Gosduma, the assistant head of the Chechen Republic of Lev Dengo, told "U", what goals Moscow pursues in this region and to whom it pays.
The contact group on Libya, which you lead, is hardly aware of.
Let's say the contact group on Ukraine knows everything about it.
And here's the cover of the secret.
What exactly are your goals?
The Contact Group was set up on the initiative of the MED RF and the State Council.
Its activities are run by the Minister of Foreign Affairs Michael Bogdanov and Adam Delimhanov (Deputy of Duma from Chechnya. - "U").
The latter is authorized to work on the Libyan speaker, Mr. Veicèslav Volodin.
In September 2015, there were 11 people on board. - "U").
We've been thinking about how to help the crew.
At that time, a contact group of military experts, representatives of the Gosduma, had supported our work, headed by Chechnya Ramzan Kadirov.
How'd you get it, that's what you've been headed for?
Since I have been working on Libya since 2008, I have been invited to take the lead in the group.
Our activities have not been limited to the release of sailors from the Mechanika Chebotareva.
We have been able to establish contacts with representatives of all major groups opposed to each other in the Libyan conflict - and by Tripoli (which is based on the recognized UN Government in the head of Faiz Saradzem. - "U"), and with Tobruk (the resident of Parliament who opposes the Government and supports the marshal Khalif Haftar, controlling the eastern areas of Libya. - "U").
Thanks to the active participation of Ahmed Metiga (Vice Prime Minister of Libya, "U"), we were able to quickly agree on the release of Russian sailors.
It was then decided to make better use of these contacts, to establish a contact group.
Its objective is to analyse the situation, identify key factors and players, dialogue with all parties to the conflict.
I would like to emphasize that in Libya we do not want to associate with any of the parties to the conflict, we have a dialogue with everyone.
How many people are in the contact group and how many are in Libya all the time?
There are now five people in the contact group.
Among them are people with experience in the strengths, including the Ministry of Defence.
We also want to include a group of experts on the region, representatives of the Institute of the Middle East RAN.
There are no staff in Libya permanently, there is no need at this time.
There are now Russian military advisers in Libya, instructors.
And if so, on whose side?
There are no Russian military specialists in Libya.
All discussions and publications on this matter are not valid.
But in your contact group, the former soldiers are...
Yes, and their presence is necessary.
For example, when we visit hot spots.
Or closed to a certain point in time for us in the city, such as Misurata (based on teams of troops playing a role in the engagement of Libyan leader Muammar Kaddafi in 2011 and markedly intensified in the years to come. "
We arrived in Misurat in January of this year.
We were scared, they said there were Islamists, terrorists.
But it was important for us to assess the situation there, to analyse the real military potential that was responsible for why there were such rumors as the role of Islamists in fact there.
In Misurat, we met with all the teams involved in the destruction of the IG in Sirte (in December 2016 this city on the Mediterranean coast was turned away from the combatants banned in Russia by the Islamic State - "U").
We wanted to see them, to meet these people, to check that they had played a crucial role in the destruction of the IG in Libya, not Khalif Haftar, who had assigned these rights.
And what conclusion did you draw?
"Islamic State" in Libya won not Haftar?
It wasn't him.
Haftar had operations on another front in Benghazi.
And with the IG in Sirte, there were structures that were subject to the Government in Tripoli.
And, in fact, we have invited people in Russia to this anti-terrorism operation.
And they came - the visit extended from 19 to 23 April of this year, and the Libyan delegation was adopted by the Council of the Federation, the Duma, the Middle Ages and the Russian Guard.
You, as we understand, live in all the Libyan regions and probably represent the local elites and field commanders.
Do you think you will be able to make arrangements for the ceasefire, for the elections reached at the end of July in Paris by Khalif Haftar and Faiz Saradz?
Or, once again, as has been the case in the past, the agreements will be disrupted, the fighting will resume, the parties will try to seize power unanimously?
For us, the fact that Saradz and Haftar have agreed to a regular meeting has become a good signal has not yet been possible.
In the recent past, both leaders have responded negatively to each other.
And with regard to Russia's position...
They often write and say that Moscow actively supports Haftar, many believe in it.
We faced this situation when they were in Missouri, and Haftar was on board the Russian aircraft, Admiral Kuznezov.
It was a coincidence.
But they did not believe in Egypt at the same time.
They said, "You are perhaps very brave people who have come to us today."
But our task is to show that we do not only support Hafhar, but we engage with all key parties to the conflict in Libya.
You and Haftar have been together.
Does understanding with the Russian partners at the human, emotional level facilitate the fact that he has learned twice in the USSR?
So does Haftar know Russian?
He's Russian if he knows, it's very relative.
But what we learned, of course, facilitates dialogue with him.
And by the way, it's not just him.
When we communicate with the military in Tripoli and Missouri, we meet the generals who have been taught either in Russia or in the Soviet Union.
And here's what they're saying in Russian.
And they're going to Russia, they're kind of experiencing nostalgia on it.
Do you consider the early abolition of the arms embargo imposed on Libya?
Are your Libyan allies interested in supplying Russian weapons?
They are interested, of course, but, as I have already said, we do not take sides in this conflict and would not want to arm each other in the interests of each other.
We would like everyone to be in a balanced position.
With regard to the arms embargo, the Libyans continue to call for Russia to make it more effective.
Libya is now actively advancing the process of constitutional development.
We hope that the parties will make compromise decisions, build an internal consensus.
Then the elections must be held, as was the case at the meeting of Saradha and Hafhar.
If elections take place and a legitimate authority is finally elected (and none of the parties now have such a status), the issue of the withdrawal of the arms embargo can be raised in the United Nations.
To raise this issue now inadvertently and dangerously will only lead to an escalation of conflict.
The media reported that Italy, faced with the problem of African refugees from Libya, felt abandoned to the fate of EU allies.
Can Moscow help Italian partners in this situation by using their contacts with the Libyans?
How, for example, is it realistic that the Hafhar units will establish border control and put an end to the business of smugglers who transfer immigrants to Europe?
A very timely question.
We're actively working on it.
The Italians are in need of support from Russia, because Moscow is engaging in dialogue with Hafart, and with Saradze, and with Misurat and with the south of the country.
In this regard, the tribes of southern Libya play a major role, and they are ready to cooperate with Russia.
Is it about the south to cross the flows of migrants on further raids?
So, what, I mean, they were relaunching the buses where Nigerian migrants go?
That's what we're trying to do.
But it's not just.
Some clans and groups are interested in keeping these flows going.
We hope to help unite the South in the negotiation process between Sarajevo, Haftar and the tribes in the south.
But for the first time, we would like to see the unity of views on this issue between Hafter and Saradzem.
The head of the Government in Tripoli, Faiz Saradz, is considered an Islamist who advocates the introduction of Sharia.
How radical are his views?
Would this not be an obstacle to relations with Russia or the West?
I'll tell you my personal opinion of him.
In my opinion, he, on the contrary, is an opponent of radical Islam.
But there are Islamics in his coalition.
Yes, but he himself holds the position that Libya must be a perfectly normal country, a moderately Islamic, open world.
And he is also actively fighting terrorists.
How does he have such a reputation?
It was created by those countries that were not interested in Russia being contacted by Tripoli.
Tripoli is a capital, there is legislative, executive and judicial authority.
There is a national oil corporation, a national bank and other public structures.
Of course, some countries were interested in us not going there.
And we got all the cards mixed up and started talking to Tripoli and Tobruk.
And we are already reaping the fruits of this work: Rosneftet has concluded an agreement on cooperation with the public oil company Libya - NOC.
Director of NOC Mustafa Sanalla, with whom Rosnefti Igorj Sechin concluded a deal, directly from Tripoli.
Two weeks ago, the first shipment of Libyan oil was made by Rosneft.
What will Russia do to her?
I think I'm going to resold.
What other economic interests do Russia have in Libya?
In the plans to sign contracts with Muammar Kaddafi.
This is particularly the case with previous transport arrangements (railway construction), energy (electrication) and a number of others.
And the Libyans have anything to pay?
Well, they have oil.
So, like in the case of Iran, it's an oil exchange scheme?
I don't know what a scheme will be, I don't deal with these issues directly.
In fact, the economy for Russia in Libya is not the main one.
We're actually doing a peacekeeping job there.
For us, the main thing is to stop the bloodshed, to help the Libyans deal with each other so that they can establish their own order, and Libya has ceased to be an environment conducive to the development of terrorism.
For Russia, that is the key task of helping the Libyan people and of expelling terrorists from there.
Do you have any data on the presence in Libya (now or before) of radical fighters from Russia or other former USSR countries?
One of the objectives of our contact group was to clarify this.
I met with a representative of the Libyan Security Committee, who said that there is no exit from Russia and other countries of the former USSR to date.
He said that he had about 50,000 telephone conversations with representatives of Islamic and radical groups (in Libya. - "U") and the Russian word did not sound there.
And from which States, then, are these fighters?
I don't want to go into that detail.
Then we'll form a question differently.
How many of the Islamist fighters in Libya's own Libyans?
There are practically no Libyans, no more than 5% of them.
The others are coming.
Could Moscow conduct internal negotiations on the example of Paris?
There are such plans.
We are actively negotiating with the Libyans, several delegations from Libya have already visited Moscow, and we have expressed our readiness to come to Moscow or to the Groves.
When can such negotiations take place?
It's hard to say.
Several more visits should be made, and I hope that there will be clarity about the time and the venue for negotiations.
In the Czech Museum, the charity collects money for a precious gift to a sick boy
A nine-year-old boy, Sasha Macola, in the Under-Mosomal Museum, where DCP, brain hydrocephaly and complete blindness will be given a special escape route on 5 August.
A useful presentation will be given by the Minister of Culture of the Moscow area of Oksana Kosareva and the director of the Museum of Constantin Bobkov.
The money for the coach was collected during the charity marathon "Don't Stop Doing Good", which took place in Melichov on July 15th, on the day of the Chekhov Memorial.
Recently, Marafone in the museum received a letter from Sashi, who lives in the village of Manuškino in the Czech Republic, saying, "I don't have eyes, so I asked my mother to write this letter."
"I'd really like to get a runway in a gift so my legs get stronger, and I'd feel like I'd learn to walk."
And here's Sasha's dream!
After being handed over to the museum, "Concert-postscriptum" will become a well-known pianist, who deserves to be performed by Russian artist Alexander Gindin in popular classical productions.
During a charity marathon in Melichov, the Choir of Voznezneška Davudov Desert, the callers of Master Ili Drozdihina, students of the Moscow Conservatory of the name P.I. The Chaikov and Russian Academy of Gnesins, artists of the Melichov Theatre "Chehov Studio".
For visitors, auctions were held, book fairs were organized, and the sale of souvenir products with a maraphon logo was beneficial.
The Mélihovo Museum, with the initiative to make the day of remembrance of the Czech Republic on 15 July, one day of charity in all the Museums of Sub-Moscow.
A 30-year-old resident of the Oliveska Zitomir area near the local football stadium fired several times towards the adolescents who were there.
According to the suspect, he was upset by the noise, reported FACTAM in the communications department of the GI.
After that, the man went to a coffee shop nearby.
In the building, there was a conflict in which a man used a machine to shoot with resin bullets, wounding one of the visitors.
The 34-year-old is provided with the necessary medical care, and there is no threat to his life.
Police and emergency medical services arrived at the scene, but the shots were hidden by now.
The lawyers established his identity and held him on the same day, August 2nd.
He couldn't explain his actions.
He's got a device to shoot the resin pools that's been sent to the experiment.
According to this fact, the criminal proceedings under article 296 (holiganism) of the Criminal Code of Ukraine were initiated.
The detainee is threatened with imprisonment for 3 to 7 years.
On 28 July, a shooting attack occurred in Kiev in the area of Tatarsky Street.
Michel Carter's sentence for reports that led to the suicide of Conrad Roy
The householder, Massachusetts, was sentenced to two and a half years in prison for encouraging her boyfriend, Conrad Roy, by means of text messages and telephone calls.
Michel Carter, who is now 20 years old, will have to spend 15 months in his term of office and another five years in the test period.
Carter was found guilty of the unimaginable murder of Konrad Roy, which ended on 13 July 2014.
Father Roya said at the hearings on Thursday: "My family killed a mountain.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was allowed to remain free before the appeal.
She was threatened for a maximum period of 20 years, but her lawyers said that she and Roy had suffered mental disorders.
Carter, dressed in red shirts and cream blouse, listened to the sentence standing, rubbing his hands and taking his eyes off.
"She killed Conrad Roy by her actions," the prosecutor declared.
"She stopped his life to improve hers.
She didn't accept responsibility," she said.
"She didn't show a quarrel."
But lawyer Carter said it was "a tragic case that she deeply regrets."
However, Judge Lawrence Monis said that in his view, her “age, age, or even mental illness did not significantly affect her actions”.
The prosecutor read Roy Lynn Roy's mother's statement, which says: "It's not a day that I would not mourn the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and the way I do - I try to support his sister, despite all the pain that will stay with us forever," he says.
Sister Roy Camdin Roy said that she was constantly following the idea that she would never be able to attend his wedding or become his children's aunts.
"The man who has always been with me since I was born is the pain that will stay with me for the rest of his life," she said.
This case would appear to be a legal precedent, since Massachusetts did not have a law that provided for the responsibility for the counsel of a person to commit suicide.
In 2014, when Roya was found in a car with symptoms of gas poisoning, Carter was 17 years old.
The case drew the attention of the whole country when it became known that it had been influenced by Carter's suicide.
"You can hang, hang out with the roof, hang yourself with a knife, I don't know many ways," she wrote in several messages sent two weeks before his death when he was breathing with his family.
In a few minutes before she killed herself, she wrote, "You have to do this, Conrad" and "You just have to put on the fire, and you're gonna be free and happy."
Judge Monis said that Carter wanted to get attention through Roy's death, and he banned her from communicating with the press to prevent her from getting what she wanted.
The views of the lawyers on this matter have been divided.
One of the few who protected Carter was Amanda Nox, who was convicted in 2007 of murdering her British neighbour in Italy two years later.
The 30-year-old Knox published his special opinion in Los Angeles Times, which stated: "Michel Carter deserves sympathy and help, not prison."
Evgenie Boochev: "I let Langford go like a high-air bird."
One of the best basketball players in the one UTB League of the 33-year-old Kit Langford left the UNIX.
U.S. Attorney of Investigations commented on the President of UNIXEvgenie Bogchev.
China has taken this decision on family circumstances, says Eugenia Boochev.
He's got a little kid, a woman who didn't want to move to Kazan.
Kit wants to be closer to home.
I decided to go see him.
Of course, I could say no and extend his contract, but he deserved a different relationship.
He played three seasons in UNICS, and in each match he showed a high level, which was 100%.
That's why I let him go like a high-flight bird.
We thanked him.
We want him to succeed in his family life and in his career.
Kit Langford has been playing at the Chinese club for three years, winning the Silver One League 2015/16.
In the 2016/17 season, he received the prize for the most successful Eurolygia season.
He's got 21.75 points in the middle of a match.
This result has been the second since 2004 when this prize was established.
Langford, who also won the prize in 2014, became the second player in the history of Eurolygia, who received this prize more than once.
Langford will soon sign a contract with China's "Schenjen", reports Eurohops.
The American is expected to enter into a two-year contract of $5 million.
Langford is going to be the second in July of the Eurolithic Star that goes to the Chinese championship.
Previously, the Chinese CBA moved to the former Panatineicos, Jannis Burusis.
The sun-burned tourist from Podmoskovya evacuated by helicopter in Adigee
Today, fire rescuers evacuated from the mountain area of the sub-muscular tourist republic, which received the strongest solar lights.
The man was breathing at the "Fist" reception, located at a height of 1.6 thousand metres.
The 27-year-old tourist has had increased pressure and breathing difficulties.
Preliminary diagnosis is a serious allergic reaction.
The head of the tour group approached the rescuers and told them that the fires of the man had been fired.
“Audi” is to be modified up to 850,000 diesel cars
The day before the announcement by Audi, BMW, stated that they would offer to upgrade the software to more than 350,000 cars.
The President of BMW said that the company believed that “there are more intelligent ways than driving restrictions”, with regard to European cities, including Munich, where BMW is available, which considered the possibility of banning or limiting the use of diesel vehicles.
Daimler said on Thursday that he modified three million Mercedes cars in Europe to reduce their diesel emissions.
None of the companies called their step-by-step response.
European automakers have actively promoted the use of diesel cars in Europe and the United States to facilitate compliance with carbon dioxide rules.
But nitrogen oxides that emit diesel engines are considered as carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The value of the vehicle manufacturers of the equipment, which also neutralises the exhaust gas of diesel vehicles, and the competitive price of cars is becoming difficult.
While the German auto producers were under close attention, the Chancellor's Government, Angela Merkel, also accused them of being influential auto producers and ignoring the signs of the problem.
The companies are trying not to repeat the errors of Folkswagen, which have hidden the use of so-called "damaging devices" that could reduce the number of hazardous gases emitted during the test to comply with the rules and have been turned off under normal driving conditions.
In the United States, several leaders of Folkswagen were convicted, the others were prosecuted on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, in Germany, the former head of the thermodynamics division was arrested as a team of Audi engine development.
Former manager, Zackeo Jovanni Pamio, an Italian, therefore has not been protected from extradition and may be brought before a court in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was under German criminal investigation with Folkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of setting up a system to deal with European emission rules and increased the investigation previously focused on the United States.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation may create serious problems for Folkswagen: the manufacturer of elite cars is a source of disproportionately large share of Folkswagen's income.
In Astrakhan, a coffee visitor was disbursed with false money
The police received a report from the bank's staff on the recalculation of the money received from the bank's headquarters by a suspicious customer named 5,000 rubles.
The study conducted at the Expert-Criminist Centre showed that it was false.
As told by the UNMVD to Russia in the Astrakhan area, the banknote was distributed to one of the coffee visitors who bought the scarf.
It is worth noting that the case was not equipped with a customer's real estate.
Police are currently setting up individuals involved in the manufacture and sale of a commercially-informed CB RF ticket.
Such crimes are punishable by imprisonment for up to 8 years with a fine of up to 1 million rubles.
The Regional Office of the IMF calls on the people of the Astrakhan area to be careful in financial operations; trade facility workers are encouraged to establish tools to verify the authenticity of the money received.
Astronomers have found a planet where even iron can swim.
For the first time, astrophysicists were amazed at the properties of the giant exoplanet called WASP-121b, which was able to evaporate iron and other metals.
Specialists pointed out that water molecules are so light-enhancing that they emit infrared radiation.
The Hubble Telescope sealed the light of the water molecule on this gas giant: it is a high temperature that causes the planet's atmosphere to shine in an infrared range.
WASP-121b refers to the so-called "burning Jupiter" gas giants, size and mass comparable to the largest planet of the solar system, but located in dozens closer to the parental star.
This year, only 1.3 "earth" days" on the exoplanet last year, and its gas envelope has dropped to almost 2,500 degrees Celsius.
Climate change threatens lavender in Provence.
It has become a symbol of Provence and South France, but there are now fears that it is threatened by climate change.
Lavanda has grown worse because of dry weather and infectious diseases; this has caused the constant headache of scientists and farmers who are trying to find a solution.
Eric Shes, an expert from the Provence Agricultural Research Institute CRIEPPAM, said: “Lavanda in Provence is indeed at risk because in recent years this plant has experienced the effects of climate change: the spring and especially the autumn of the rains has become much less.
This affects the life of the lavender.
And there are some small cicadas on the leaves of insects that carry microbacterials; in very dry weather they become very much."
There's a lot on the map.
Lavanda not only attracts the vacationers; lavender oil is highly absorbed in perfumery and cosmetology.
Eric Shes says, "In place of very long belts with a large number of large colors, we have small, undeveloped, weakened or not at all.
So we have fewer parts of ephrine oil."
The decisions currently under consideration include improving water distribution and slowing land evaporation, as well as spraying plants with a protective mixture of soil and water, and the extraction of more dry varieties.
Ambassador of the Winter University-2019 met with the Red Sea Schoolers
A two-time hockey world champion, Ambassador of Winter University-2019 Alexander Semin met early with starters and distributed autographs to patients.
The meeting took place in the summer of 2019 under the theme week of the Shibe hockey.
Any visitor to the tent could walk on the horses in the field with artificial ice.
In addition, stadiums, victors and games with the play of the souvenir production of student games were organized, dissipating from the federation of the aerobics.
50 schoolchildren attended the event.
Alexander Semin advised the people as much as possible to engage in sports and stressed that the most important in the early stages of education was the sincere work and the public's desire to engage in hockey.
"Hello, there is a place in Krasnoyarsk like the Winter University's 2019 hat where starting athletes can ask questions directly to team coaches," said the champion.
It should be noted that promoting student sport and a healthy lifestyle among the redsmiths helps the Ambassadors of the Winter University of 1919.
The University Shatter will be working throughout the summer season until 25 September, reports the Winter University's 2019 press service.
The words of Medvedev have been commented on in Mr.
The official representative of the U.S. Mr. Hizer Nawert, commenting on the briefing by Prime Minister Dmitria Medvedev, stated the need to find " areas for interaction" with Russia.
According to her, such areas should be found to “improve bilateral interaction”.
For example, Nawert called for a peace agreement on Syria.
We're two nuclear superpowers.
"And people around the world agree that the US and Russia must be able to work together," said the diplomat.
However, Nawart refused to comment on Medvedev ' s claim of a full-fledged trade war between Russia and the United States.
"If Russia has said that, she has, of course, the right to speak, but more on this subject I can't say anything," said the representative of the House.
Former U.S. President Donald Tramp signed a bill to strengthen sanctions against the Russian Federation.
Commenting on the new package of sanctions, the Head of Government of the RF Medvedev stated that Washington had declared Moscow a full-fledged trade war, hoping to improve bilateral relations.
Bears also stated that the United States sanctions would be effective for decades.
In addition, the Prime Minister believes that the U.S. establishment "pure play" of the Trampa.
The missing in the Sub-Mosaic Bodibuilder found on a foreign dazzling memory
Bodibuilder Shamil Hanmetov was on his way to Noginsk on 25 July under very picantal conditions: he left the car salon to go to the toilet.
Seven days without success, he had been searching for familiar and local residents.
And Shamil was found on a foreign lander in Ramensk.
He found it completely naked in his own bathroom.
The Dutch sportsman couldn't explain what happened here and what happened to him.
He couldn't even remember what his name was, but the passport was gone.
To establish a person has helped the announcements of his failure.
Those who came outside the medical system have recorded a partial memory loss and a skull-brain trauma in Hanmetov, reports the press release Mash.
Perhaps sportsmen are waiting for other surprises.
The criminals who kidnapped Shamil may have already been in his apartment, the keys he had also stolen from him.
Oil revenues exceeded the forecast of 7.4 billion rubles in July
The actual oil revenues received as a result of July 2017 were overestimated by 7.4 billion rubs, the Ministry of Finance reported.
The excess, as explained by the Authority, was mainly due to a higher exchange rate of the United States dollar to rubbing compared to the average monthly value of June used for the assessment, as well as due to the fact that the volume of gas and the volume of exports of oil products at the projected levels were exceeded.
"The removal of the federal budget from the monthly assessment under the Federal Law on the Federal Budget for 2017-2019 is projected in August 2017 to be +40.2 billion rubs.", says Minfin.
Thus, the total amount of money sent to purchase foreign currency on the domestic currency market between 7 August and 6 September 2017 is 47.6 billion rubles.
Accordingly, the daily purchase of foreign currency is equivalent to 2.07 billion rubles.
The Bank of Russia will be involved in foreign exchange purchases by Minfin Russia.
Each working day during that period, the CB will conclude foreign exchange purchases at organized stores of the Moscow Stock Exchange on an equal basis during the trading day.
The acquired foreign currency will be credited to the Federal Treasury account at the Central Bank.
The murder of a journalist emphasizes that Mexico is becoming more and more dangerous.
Officials of the Ríodos weekly are usually meeting in the media to discuss plans to highlight recent violent crimes in the state of Sinaloa related to organized crime, corruption of officials or the continuing war of drug addicts.
But today, overwhelmed by their own tragedy, they have met to talk about security.
They were told that they should change their habits.
Two senior journalists discussed what seemed safer: taking children with them to the office, where they had already dropped the grenade in 2009, or leaving their home.
Security experts have written three words on the board that hangs in the room: enemies, neutrals, allies.
They asked journalists to name names for each column - evidence is not necessary, suspicions and internal feelings will be sufficient.
These are drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who suspect that they are contained in government or cartels, a whole list of predators, which makes the work of lighting chaos in Mexico dangerous.
Violence does not give rise, and among the troops that are growing in the country, more and more journalists: according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists, at least 25 since President Enrico Pena Nieto took office in December 2012; 589 people are under federal protection after attacks and threats; and at least seven people have died in seven states this year.
Among the last is their publisher and inspiration, the founder of Riodos, Javier Valdes Cardenas.
"The only big mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist," Waldes wrote in one of his many books on drug-related violent crimes.
His absence is very severe, although his presence everywhere is a large photo of Valdez, showing the middle handle, with the inscription "Justice" hanging on the facade of the house "Riodoses"; two reporters for 30 years, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, bear the footprints on which his smile, face in the eyes or his corporate panorama is depicted.
The seminar takes place less than two months after his death; journalists discuss their common trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, and paranoia.
Although the Office of the Special Prosecutor for the Investigation of Journalist Cases was organized in 2010, only two cases were investigated, according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists.
As with most of the crimes committed every year, thousands of drug-related and organized crime-related murders are rarely reported by journalists.
The Ríodos journalists insist that they write about violence in Sinaloa, although they were killed in the heat, but now much more dangerous.
Without information about the killers, without justice from the security talks at the meetings, Ibarra said.
"It's very stupid to spend time at this seminar," he says.
"Until we know the reason, we suspect all."
On 15 May, Valdes left the Riodos office in the capital of the state of Kuliacan.
He was able to travel only a few quarters before his red Toyota King was stopped by two men; he was pulled out of the car and shot 12 times, probably because of the name of the newspaper, which means "Twelfth River".
The shooter went to his car and broke it near.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He had a wife and two adult children.
The hearings are usually moving fast across the Kuliacan.
But it's almost silent about Valdes.
Since Guzman was arrested and deported to the United States in January last year, Sinaloa has been one of the country's most bloody battlefields, as rival factions are fighting to fill the established vacuum.
We're not going to talk about killing one or more people every day on the streets of Sinaloa, or about being filled with two-storey drug dealers who are more than home to many living people.
Let's forget for a minute that the state of "peace" is just when one of the cartels takes control of the maritime state with important ports and ways of drug trafficking in the United States.
Despite this and the fact that Valdes was well aware of the dangers of his work, Ishmael Bohorques, a 60-year-old co-founder and director of Ríodos, was overwhelmed by the guilt that he could not protect each other.
He thinks the murder helped two mistakes.
First, in February, an interview was published with Damaso Lopes, a leader of the rival factions of the cartel, who is fighting with the sons of Guzman.
The publication could upset the sons; people who were supposed to be members of the gang gathered all copies of the publications as soon as they were delivered to the kiosk.
The second mistake was that he did not force Valdes to leave the country for his own safety after the other newspaper that wrote about the same story was seized.
Valdès was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder was seen as a regular milestone in the development of violence against journalists in Mexico.
For so long, his friends and colleagues thought he would always be.
He was an experienced reporter in Noroest, and in 2003, together with five colleagues, Riodos, sold his 50-dollar shares.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to deal with journalism without affecting the subject of drugs," Bohorkes said.
In time, the newspaper earned a reputation for bold and honest publishing, sales, and advertising revenue.
Journalists were pleased that they could publish bold reports, not fear of censorship, but attracted readers to what they could read in this publication about what no one else dared to write.
Eight years later, Ríodos received a prestigious Maria Murs Cabo award for reporting work in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdes won the International Press Freedom Prize for Courage in an investigation into Mexico's drug trafficking wherever it went.
He openly admitted that he was scared.
"I want to live on," he said at the CPJ prize.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa is "this form of life," he said last October in an interview with Rompevinto TV.
"You have to take the tasks that lie on you as a journalist, or you're just a fool."
I don't want to be asked, "What did you do when there were so many deaths... why didn't you tell me what was going on?"
The Ryodose staff are missing Valdez, a shoemaker who prayed as a trucker in the port, another, generous to hugs and tips, a teacher who knew how to sit in the living.
They relied on their established order.
He's always had to wear his hat.
He had to go to El Guayabo, bar opposite the office, and always sit there with the same chair.
Now they ask: Did he lose his love for the unity of the order?
His death made them doubt and doubt how best to do their job and stay alive.
"They don't like it when you understand in their wives, children, their legal business and in sub-continents for the transport of drugs.
"These things were damn," Bohorkes said.
As a result, even at the best of the time, self-censorship and self-resistance were high.
We need to trust our instincts.
Keep away from the bad smell.
The problem, says the editor, "Riodose" Andres Vilaireal, is that "the rebellion can be deceived... and then what happens to Javier."
The old rules, he and others said, no longer operate in Sinaloa - as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states, where there is a poisoned mix of profitable counter-trafficking, weak government institutions and corrupt officials.
Landshaft is constantly changing.
In a room where Riodos staff gathered for security training, hundreds of telephones were banned: a few days earlier, it was known that spy programs sold exclusively to Governments were used in Mexico for searches by journalists and public activists.
Two policemen are hidden outside in the shadow of a 104-degree wood fire (40 degrees Celsius).
They were assigned by the Government to protect the Riodos office, which is located in a four-storey building in the Kuliakana neighbourhood.
Some reporters asked whether these policemen were part of the 50 per cent of the order that the governor himself said they could not be trusted.
A few months ago, journalists were sent to a mountainous area, which was de facto controlled by a gang of drug traffickers.
In the next issue of Rios, it was calculated on three main topics.
It's a murder in Sinaloa's brother's former boxing champion Julio Sezar Chaves.
They still had government expenditures concentrated in the governor ' s hometown.
And there was a group kidnapping in one of the most expensive Kuliacan restaurants in the district of the prosecutor's office.
It was not officially announced who had been kidnapped or how it happened, so it was necessary to be careful when the time came to write that everyone in the city knew that it was a favorite restaurant while drug dealers and authorities.
One of their journalists found out from the open database that the restaurant was registered on behalf of a policy of the ruling Institutional and Revolutionary Party (PRI), which dominated all levels of power during the almost last century.
Recently, strong allegations of corruption have been made against several PRI governors.
William asked journalists to write about the previous incidents in this restaurant, including when the son of El Chapo, Guzman, was evicted from the military.
A few more months ago, readers would be looking for the Valdez column with the most reliable information on kidnapping.
"We'd already known what happened," says 46-year-old Villareal, for his divine body called El Flaco.
"Today all channels of communication with our sources are broken."
The Valdez Cabinet is now being used as a repository for posters and stickers with protests against the killings of journalists, because staff have become those whom they never thought to be: activists on behalf of the press.
The journalist, Miriam Ramirez, took several posters and went to the local prosecutor's office next morning to show the other journalist.
El Salvador Adame disappeared in the state of Michoacan on the west of the country three days after Valdes was killed.
They found a burnt body, and the authorities said it was based on DNA tests.
Journalists all over the country have become loud, protesting and writing "SOS Press" on the sidewalks and walls of houses.
The director of Bohorkes was in Washington on that day, trying to seek international support for the demand for justice in the Valdes case.
At a meeting with Governor Sinaloa the next day after the murder of Valdes Ramirez, authorities accused them of spying on journalists and ordering them to be killed for speaking the truth.
She then asked her not to give her any further tasks to clarify the Government, fearing that anger would damage her objectivity.
Waldes has said many times that journalists in Mexico are "rounded" by organized crime, its partners in the government and a different society.
In his last book, Narco-Journalist, he wrote that reporters were killing not just gangs of drug traffickers; they did so by order of the security policies and services in connection with organized crime.
The Articulum 19 press committee believes that half of the attacks on journalists last year were carried out at the order of the police and government officials.
"In Mexico you die because they want to shut you up," says Ramirez.
Of course, killings scare people.
Everyone remembers the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Massias six years ago in the northern border state of Tamaulipas.
On her body, we found a note, supposedly written by the character of the Zetas cartel, "I'm here because of my articles."
The computer keyboard and earpieces were lying next to her cut head.
Some editions preferred to be closed as El Norte's newspaper in the northern border state of Chihuahua after its correspondent Miroslav Brich was killed in March.
Others continue to be "El Manyana" from Nuevo Laredo after her leader was killed in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Huarez publicly addressed drug cartels with the editorial article on the first page entitled "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have left their native states or even their country.
It's a painful decision.
It is difficult to find work in exile, and they continue to see the danger on the streets.
And sometimes they are killed, as it is evident, with a photographer by Ruben Espinoz, who was killed in 2015 along with four women in a Mexican apartment three months after he fled from Veracruz.
Those who remain and continue to work are balanced daily between risky decisions.
Ibarra, who used to dream of being a poet, admits that he was afraid to write about drug trafficking.
"Mexican's going to hell, and that's why I became a journalist," he says.
Last Friday, at midnight, when the last issue was ready for the press, the Ríodose publishers sat on the sidewalk next to the office and drank beer when their phones rang at the same time.
A series of shootings between opposing gangs and security forces near the resort city of Masatlan left 19 troops behind, as confirmed.
The war continued to burn as promised in a series of messages from the cartels found in the area.
Sitting on the sidewalk, they posted news via the phone on the Riodos website.
The next day, the first page had to be translated.
The sirens were blown near, another shot in the circles.
Bohorques has seen if their security officers are ready to defend them.
If they were scared, they wouldn't show it.
Sitting under the huge portrait of the deceased founder of their newspaper, whose middle finger was exposed to the whole of Sinaloa, the Riodos staff continued his work.
"How can you think of closing up," said Bohorkes, "if on the very day that Javier was killed, the practitioner asked me to send her on the street to do a report?"
Dinozar used a camouflage to avoid enemies
At first glance, he seems like a statue, even a horrific horror.
The researchers said that the first remains of the incredible substance from the noserotype discovered by the Canadian camp were preserved so well that experts called it “Mona Lisa among dinosaurs”.
It was so well preserved that they could even determine that the color of his bloated skin was red-coloured – and to say that it had, in some way, a “dark past”.
In a report published in the journal Modern Biology, it was described as “the only well preserved in Tyrefor for all the history of inventions and one of the best specimens of dinosaurs in the world”.
It is a recently found specimen of nodozavra, living in the middle of the mill, between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
His incredibly good condition has left the researchers who call him “very remarkable”.
This traumatic tireophor is the most well preserved species in the history of the inventions, according to articles in the National Geographic magazine.
He was found by Sean Fancom when he was working at the Milenium mine of Sancor near Fort McMurray in Northern Albert, Canada, on 21 March 2011.
He was drawn to something that seemed to differ from the environment and decided to take a closer look.
The excavated remains were sent to the Royal Tyrellian Paleontological Museum.
For the next six years, animal detection was carried out at a depth of 2,500 feet (1,100 kg).
Now that all this hard work is done, the final outcome can be demonstrated.
“It’s only easy to get up, and you can almost believe he’s smart,” said the lead author Caleb Brown, a scholar at the Royal Tyrell Paleontological Museum, where the creation is demonstrated.
"It enters the history of science as one of the most beautiful and well preserved specimens of dinosaurs – Mona Liza among dinosaurs."
While studying his skin, the researchers found that it was traumatic, despite its being covered with a brush and recalled a walking tank, it was apparently at great risk by plant dinosaurs.
This powerful dinosaur brush used a red-white camouflage to hide from predators and used a protective technique known as a protective mirror, which is also used by many animals today.
This would enable him to interact more quickly with the environment and avoid encounters with the enemy, experts say, assuming that he has been caught by larger dinosaurs.
This is a substantial age of 110 million years for the Nodozav family and has been widely highlighted in the press in May, and is now at the exhibition at the Royal Tyrellian Paleontological Museum.
Scholars have already studied the animal and given him the name Borealopelta markmitcheli as a museum lab named Mark Mitchell, a member of the group who spent more than 7,000 hours on his perspiration.
The amazing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and the international team of scholars to document the drawing and the shape of tiles and pansy plates on his body.
They found a protective ornament, a widespread method of protection in the kingdom of animals, which means that the upper substance was darker than its lower part.
Although the protection mirror is well spread, the opening has become unexpected, because the size of the Borealopelta dinosaur is significantly higher than the size of the living animals with the protection of the eagle.
It can be assumed that the dinosaur was so actively caught by the flood dinosaurs that evolution preferred the masking of confrontation as a means of survival.
But most of the modern animals with protective kraine, such as wool, linen or bronchoske, are much smaller and are more available, which shows that nodozaru had to be seriously combated for survival.
“A serious threat by predators to a massive, powerful dinosaur brush shows how dangerous the Melovian dinosaurs were,” said Brown.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in the dynasavara also shows that its skin should be red and brown.
Students continue to study the animal, looking for information about his life, including the contents of his food tract, to find out that he was eating during his last meal.
They believe that when the dinosaur died, he fell into the river and was taken into the sea, where he tossed and went down the bottom of the ocean.
At that time, in Alberta, there was as much heat as in South Florida, and rivers and oceans were probably spread far deeper into the drought than now.
“This nodozav is truly remarkable because it is fully covered with the skin that has been preserved, and at the same time has been completely preserved in three dimensions, keeping the original form of the animal,” Brown said.
“As a result, the animal now looks almost the same as it seemed at the time in the Middle Ages.
There is no particular need to get into the imagination to re-establish it, it is only to be easily shaken, and it is practically possible to believe that it is a snake.”
The Melo period is an era when giant thermopods, dynasiums, standing on two feet, sailed on the Earth.
Although the most remarkable of them, the tyrant Rex, lived for millions of years later than Borealopelta, one of his terrible ancestors could be caught on the tireofor.
These include acrocantosaver, a 38 - foot - long monster (11.5 m) weight in six tons.
Scholars whose latest findings are published in the journal Modern Biology believe that Borealopelta was introduced into the sea after death and immitated into the island.
The substance was found by Sean Fank, when he was working at the Milenium port near Fort McMurray in Northern Albert, Canada, on 21 March 2011.
According to museum staff, it is the most well-maintained tyerophorus in the world, along with skin and pancim, and it is the goal of the morgue to the bone.
On average, these substances reached about 18 feet (five meters) in length and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
Their characteristic sign was the two twenty - eight - foot - long [slips] of the shoulders.
Researchers believe that this traumatic tyerophorus has been a major factor in the fact that it is now Canada until the floodwaters have taken it to the open sea.
But the underwater burial of the dinosaur has kept his pancakes accurate to the smallest detail.
The stone remains of this particular specimen were so well preserved that the remains of the skin are still covered by bourgeois pansy plates along the dinosavar skull.
As Michael Greško wrote in an article for the National Geographic magazine, such a degree of conservation is “unless you win the lottery”.
The longer I look at him, the more defeat he seems.
Residues of the skin are still covered by the papyrus pansy plates that chew the skull of the animal.
His right front leg stretched out along the side, five fingers on it pushed up.
I can count the chutes on his desk."
Michael Saakashvili managed to get to Poland without documents
Michael Saakashvili, former head of Georgia, and then the Odesk region in Ukraine, flew to Poland.
In doing so, he did so without documents confirming his identity and nationality.
About the arrival of Saakashvili, the Polish edition of Telewizja Republica, which posted a video on its channel on YouTube with its presentation.
Saakashvili took part in an event in honour of the anniversary of the Warsaw Awakening against Hitler's troops in 1944.
Because the politician did not know Polish, even though he tried to start speaking in that language, he had to speak English through the Polish translator.
In his speech, the politicians focused on Georgia's cooperation with Poland, as well as on Ukraine.
The fact that Ukraine's immigration service had withdrawn its citizenship, the opulent politician learned from the U.S.
As he was able to make a transatlantic transfer without documents until he knew.
Former Odes governor Michael Saakashvili stated that his signature on the poll to obtain Ukraine ' s citizenship had been submitted.
The politician stressed that he had not filled out any polls.
The investigation period in the case of Weinziher and Olhovik extended until January
The date of the preliminary investigation into the case of the owner of the Renova Group of Evgenia Olhovik and the head of the energy holding "T Plus" Boris Winziher was extended until 2 January 2018.
On Thursday, 3 August, the Basman Court considered the extension of the house arrest indicted.
The representative of the CSC informed the meeting of the decision to extend the period of preliminary investigation for the last time.
“The particular complexity and length of the investigation is due to the need for the removal and testing of a large number of documents, as well as the conduct of investigations on the territory of several RF entities”, the investigator said.
He added that the suspects had regularly given the leadership to the Commission.
Their overall size is estimated at least a billion rubles.
According to the investigation, Wynziher, Olkhovic, as well as former CEO of the ZAO, Michael Slobodin, who headed the company Wimpelko by 5 September, transferred the acquisition to the highest officials of the Republic of the Commission for the maximum benefits of heating and electricity tariffs, as well as for the establishment of favourable conditions for business.
Weinziher and Olkhovic were arrested, staged in Siktivkar and arrested for two months, freed from the investigation and was declared a federal investigation.
How did one activist learn the answer to the question “Who are the streets?”
On 9 August 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken to the depths of the soul.
Just the day after arriving in New York during a tourist trip, St. Louis was sitting on a bed in an apartment rented by Airbnb, watching a Facebook tape on the phone.
She's stuck to someone in high school.
It was said, “The police have just killed an eighteen-year-old child, and he is still lying in the middle of the street.”
Considering that no one else in her tape had hired this information, she closed the Facebook and opened the Twitter.
She had a lot of user transfers with no @TheePharoh.
The rapper from the Greater St. Louis, in real time, broadcast the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed, eighteen-year-old, killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He published a photo of Brown's lifeless body, scattered across the street, where it will be for four hours.
"It's a savage," she thought.
But death was nothing new to her and her circle.
She postponed the phone, and later in the evening, she went back to the tweets that people are gathering at the Canfield Drive.
There were photos of a signal tape and shouting people and people who claimed that he was Brown's father who had a poster saying, "The Farguson police officer just killed my unarmed son!"
She looked directly at the broadcast as a police officer stood before a group of protestors with a loathsome dog.
In another video, another cop, she told me, she took a bullet and said, "I'm going to kill you all... animals."
“This is an unstandard situation,” Ferrell said, in his own memory.
"This is not a murder like the ones we used to and which we can call typical.
At the time, I felt a turning point.
I was angry and cried.
She took the ticket back and flew home the next day.
When she landed at 11 p.m., she took her six-year-old daughter out of her father's house and decided that they would both go to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened with Ferrell and Ferguson in the next almost three years became the theme of the new documentary “Who Are the Streets?”, which will be screened on 11 August.
This is a story of survival and protests, of love and loss, of strength and perseverance from the people living in the community and filled with streets, requiring answers.
While Ferrell was riding in Ferguson with a daughter dressed in a dress in flowers and flowers, they remembered the conversation that led to this morning a countless number of times, “about the experience of blacks and their situation”.
She said, “Do you remember what I told you about the black people who fought for what they believed in?
We're going to Ferguson because the cop killed an eighteen-year-old boy, and that was wrong."
"I couldn't take it," said Ferrell later.
“What is happening today is the culmination of... what happened earlier.
She needs to know about it, see it, and wake up at it.
It should not only be well understood in activism and organization, but also understand the different levels of experience of blacks and their provisions, and what we must do to be free to be released.
Even if I can provide her with an environment in which she does not personally face obvious racism, she's nothing but any other black girl.
I feel like I'd give her a bad favor if I gave her some of that."
When they arrived in Ferguson, they first stopped at South Florissant Road, on the site along the way from the police station, which was kind of a palace camp, while the activists were waiting for reports of the prosecution of Officer Durren Wilson.
There Ferrell and his daughter joined the local company who prepared the chains.
They collected packages and helped to distribute them to the Protestants.
Little by little, Ferrell took the form of a new type of activism.
“My activism has changed completely since 9 August,” she said, noting that as a student at the University of Missuri St. Louis, she was president of the Association of Sanitary Students, representatives of national minorities, and engaged in food justice and health inequalities among black communities.
“I had no experience with the organizer.
That's what happened."
A few weeks later, at the evening demonstration, Ferrell met Saba Folian, one of his directors.
Folian said that she and her chief operator Lucas Alvarado-Ferrerer “just wanted to document” events.
Ferrell asked, "Do you want to document, or are you trying to find a story that you can play?"
This skepticism has been attributed to many people, often to white people who have come to the community to benefit from its pain and endurance.
As Folian explained in a recent interview, “We heard that the voices of people who were born and raised in Ferguson did not fall into focus, and they wanted to do so otherwise”.
Folian was already united with his director Damon Davis, a local artist, who was known for his activism on death sentences.
His participation sparked sympathy for the project in Ferrell and six other locals, with whom the project “Who are the Streets” team, supported the connection over the years following the murder of Brown.
"In this documentary, no one's talking about us or us, that's what we're talking about," Davis said.
"This was the most important thing for me as these people will be represented, because that is how I will be represented."
Although the purpose of the project was not to focus on the experiences of Ferrell, it was to show that the movement “not about the leader, but about how the community is united”, as Folian said, it was the most open part of the film.
As a result, Ferrell’s personal aspects of life, such as how she fell in love and married his wife, have been shown unexpectedly.
"I felt naked," said Ferrell, laughing at how she first saw the ready product.
“But I understood that when you do this and humanize blacks, there must be some level of vulnerability.”
In addition, Ferrell's story again discusses and highlights the role of a black homosexual woman in the wider context of the Black Life movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement – those who created the #BlackLivesMatter tag in social networks after the murder of the Black Teen of Travon Martin in 2012 – attribute themselves to homosexuals.
“Black homosexual women in the leadership are supporting all this movement,” said Ferrell. “And all because we are constantly fighting on several fronts.
Black homosexual women have to bear all this burden."
Folian agreed with this claim, noting that “the movement is indeed supported by black women and by the majority of homosexual black women”.
However, she insisted that “this is not a case of positive discrimination”, and that Ferrell was not selected by the central character of the film because of its distinctive features.
She said, "She was the man who raised this energy."
"On the other hand, it's not a coincidence that it happened on the first level, because when"
You can feel her energy through the screen."
In the meantime, Ferguson has not been a camera for long, but there are complex racial links between the community and the police.
Ferrell will be at a time of two and a half years for the end of the road during the demonstration.
She describes the social and political atmosphere of the place, which she calls home, simply "Bardak".
She's still holding on to the word she learned when she went on Ferguson's street three years ago.
We must fight for our freedom.
We have to win.
We must love and support each other.
"There is nothing for us but our bones to perish."
Two Salvadoran footballers were disqualified for the taste of US players
The footballers of El Salvador Henry Romero and Darwin Seren have received long disqualifications for non-sportive behavior.
During the fourth final match of the Golden Cup of North and Central American Football confederations and the Caribbean (CONCAFF) the Salvadorans tasted the American players.
The first was the protector Henry Romero.
The Salvadoran bit the attacker, Josie Altidora, and then he bit him in the chest.
Then, a semi-defense Seren, when he was charged with coal in his field, was bitten by U.S. defender Omar Gonzalez.
As a result, Romero was disqualified for three matches and Seren for six.
The meeting itself ended with a victory of Americans with a 2:0 account, transmitted by Goal.com.
Similarity: The artist creates portraits with DNA Chelsea Manning
At the center of the hall in Gallery Friedman, New York, people are squeezing, white, black, and brown, all inseparable like each other.
These 30 portraits were created by the artist Hisser Dewey-Harborg from the tuxedo and cut hair sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent out cuts from Fort Levenworth prison, where an ex-exploratory analyst took 35 years for a well-known transmission of confidential diplomatic telegrams to WikiLeaks.
A new exhibition, opened on 2 August, is called "Research of the Similarity".
This is the result of a two-year census between Dui-Harborg, whose art unites technology, information and art, and Manning, a woman-transexual and a famous dissident, who Barack Obama eased the sentence for only three days before the end of his presidency.
By analysing and using a computer DNA programme from Manning to create three-dimensional portraits of people who could be with such a gene, Dui-Harborg created a deep, though difficult to perceive, not only the plasticity of DNA, but also the concept of identity.
Manning, who was born Bradley Edward, but when she was a teenager, openly said that she was considered a woman, was sentenced to 20 episodes in 2013, including six violations of the Act on Spouse, Computer Falsity and Harassment.
Her photographs were not available in prison, so only one of her photographs was known: a black-and-white selfie, on which Manning in a platinum tank, apparently feeling uncomfortable, sat behind the wheel; with that photograph, she became associated.
In 2015, Dui-Harborg successfully completed its 2012 project "Seeing strangers".
In it, the artist created portraits of unknown people by means of a court-martial of the type of circus and grass cutting, drawing out of this trash DNA and creating images of what these people might look like.
And then she got an e-mail from Paper Magazine.
"They interviewed Chelsea Manning in prison and wanted a portrait to illustrate the article," explained Dui-Hagborg in a preliminary presentation for the press.
At the time, Chelsea was unable to visit and photograph, so they contacted her and asked if she wanted a portrait of her DNA.
In this way, the artist and her prisoners in the museum became friends on the census and exchanged several letters for two years.
They even wrote the comic book "Sudden Faces", illustrated by Sholey Kanungo, who illustrated how the future president would ease Chelsea's punishment and be able to visit the exhibition personally.
The fact that Obama really decided to release Manning just a few days after the book went out in the light was a pleasant surprise after seven years of hard military prison in Kansas.
There is something deep and strong and that the exhibition is being opened right now, when Donald Tramp announces the war of people who reveal secret information in the Government, and finds new ways to burn down the enemy he is meant to soften on Twitter.
When Dui-Harborg was asked about the coincidence of this all over time, she said that "there's nothing going on."
In an artist's statement written on the wall of the gallery, the huge signature of Manning down (with a heart rather than "i" in her name) calls for the end of "automatic separation based on sex, race, sexual orientation and culture".
On the other hand, its mitochondrial DNA, a long-lasting resin from C, G, and A.
With 200 letters (or nucleotides, as a scientificly researched artist) Dui-Harborg hoped to show how amazing we all look, in any case, according to his biological structure.
"I hope to explain to people that our gene does not determine what we are, how open the genetic data is for interpretation and how subjective it is," said Dui-Harborg; her 2007 video "False Memories" is also shown here.
"DNAs can tell us a lot of different stories, and 30 of these stories here."
The last part of the exhibition in one room is the above-mentioned novel in comics.
It is the King-Kong Manning, which features the United States correctional building with a loudspeaker in its hand.
"If they kill your word, they will win," it says.
"So never shut up."
"This is a direct quote from the letter she wrote to me," says an artist welcoming us from Philadelphia.
"I'm still a skin muffin when I'm talking about it."
Manning has not seen the exhibition in person - as it was previewed in comics - but when she comes, she will welcome masks in the center of the room, her own genomic simulations, gathered like a crowd of protestors.
This is also done on purpose as well as on the show up to the height (5"2, increase Manning), on which the quarantine was drawn by the genetic group.
"I'd have hung them on the walls before, but now I'd like them to look like a bunch of people," said Dewey-Harborg about portraits.
"I wanted them to be like the mass movement that formed around Chelsea, like the movement that stood behind her release."
Professor of North-West University and Officer of Oxford University investigates the murder charge police
According to the police, there is a national coverage of Professor North-West University and Officer of Oxford University, who are being investigated as suspected of having been found dead in a luxury room in Chicago.
According to the reports of the Cook District Court, orders were issued on Monday for the alleged murder without the right to be released under the charge of forty-nine-year-old Windem Latham and fifty-six-year-old Andrew Warren in connection with their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton Mr. James Cornell-Duranlo.
According to the documents, Cornell-Duranlo died after he had been subjected to multiple knee wounds.
The warning issued by the Chicago Police Department said that the body had been found on 27 July.
The police received a call, they arrived in the Grand Plaza apartment complex and found a victim with several wounds on the body.
According to officials, Cornell Duranlo was declared dead at the scene of the crime, and now the detectives are investigating death from knife wounds, considering her murder, while the police are actively investigating two suspects.
Latham has been an assistant professor of microbiology and immunology at the North-West University since 2007.
Alan K. Kabbad, vice president of the University of Communications, reported in an e-mail statement that Latham was on the administrative leave and that he was banned from campuses of the North-West University.
“Now it is a criminal case that is investigated by the authorities, and the North-West University is cooperating with the result”, Kabbad said.
Warren is a senior financial officer at Oxford University.
The representative of the University and Somerville College reported in an e-mail statement: “We have contacted the UK police and are ready to provide any necessary assistance to US investigative bodies.”
The statement also stated that Warren's colleagues were shocked and wanted him to give up.
The chief of police liaison with Chicago Anthony Gulelli said that he strongly advises the suspect to surrender to the authorities.
“The police have assumptions about their location, but our attempts to find them are increasing,” Gulelmi said.
According to Gulelli, local, regional and federal authorities are helping to find suspects.
According to Gulelmi, the police had called the administrator of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a secret message that something happened in number 1008.
The police called the crime scene horrendous.
The Games reported that it was unclear whether the incident had occurred on July 27th.
According to him, video camera data confirm that Latham and Warren were in the building.
"We believe that Professor Latema and the victim were connected," Gulelli said.
The Grand Plaza Guide has issued a reference to the detainees, which reported: “Police is currently working on the chronology of the incident, collecting information on the victim and considering a number of reasons, including possible domestic events”.
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko: "We will meet the WADA road map soon"
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said that the conditions of the World Anti-Fraud Agency (WADA) set out to resume the work of the Russian Anti-Fraud Agency (RUSADA) would be fulfilled in the near future.
"The specified phase in compliance with the requirements has been completed, and RUSADA has been granted the right to plan and carry out tests together with the U.K.A. (United Kingdom Anti-Doping Agency).
The WADA road map was updated accordingly," Mutko said on Thursday.
The Prime Minister commented on the second part of the WADA road map to restore the status of compliance with the Code, which lists the conditions for resumption of the work of RUSADA and has recently been published on the website of the organization.
According to Mutko, it contains nothing that could present difficulties for Russia.
"Everything has been announced, everything will be done.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA as soon as possible," he added.
However, one of the requirements included in the list implies that the Russian andiping structures must publicly acknowledge the results of the Canadian lawyer Richard McClarren's investigation conducted by ADA, which claimed that the doping in the Russian sport is controlled by the State.
With regard to this issue, Mutko said: "We conduct an investigation because our anti-doping system has failed.
All measures have been taken.
But there was no host program, and we won't admit what was missing."
Mutko repeated the words of Vitalia Smirnova, head of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Fraud Commission.
On the same day, in an interview with the Russian edition of the "Rsport" Smyrnov, he acknowledged the earlier problems in the Russian anti-oping structures, but added: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains certain controversial positions and provisions.
No one is necessarily to accept this report," Smyrnov added.
WADA removed RUSADA from doping control in November 2015 after the doping scandal.
However, in June this year, he was allowed to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and the British Anti-Fraud Agency (UKAD).
Following a visit to the Moscow office in July, the Director-General of WADA, Olivie Niggli, stated that RUSADA was " moving in the right direction" to restore its work.
Blowing fire in the 79-storey forest in Dubai
The great fire, which occurred in one of the highest residential buildings in the world, is the tower of the Torch, the tower of Reuters.
It is noted that the fire has been able to cope with all the fires by 4.00 per local time (3.00 ms).
Local authorities reported that no one was affected as a result of the incident.
During the fire, the streets were closed.
The reasons for this are unknown.
It was previously reported that in Dubai there was a 79-storey residential skyscraper, The Torch, which is one of the highest buildings in the world.
All the houses were evacuated in time.
Indiscriminate Order of the Bush Shrews of the Worshipers: Broken Non-Troubleds
The scandalous leading show reality, Dom-2, was defeated by viewers at the Europe Plus Live Festival in the rabbits.
In the eyes of thousands of worshipers, the newly-founded poet with Nastya Kudri performed the song "We'll be hot."
Both girls went to the stage in the provocative "brücks" so that there seemed to be a lower white singer.
The letters Buzova and Kudry were made on the bridges.
Earlier it was reported that the change in the appearance of Busovov was commented by a specialist at a Moscow plastic surgery clinic.
Stoltenberg acknowledged the deterioration of NATO-Russia relations
On Friday, 4 August, Radio 4 reported on this with a reference to foreign media.
He said that the Russian authorities were responsible for the deterioration of relations between the West and Russia.
In an interview with the CNN, the genus NATO also criticised Russia for the situation with Crimea and for “destabilization in the east of Ukraine”.
However, Stoltenberg assured us that dialogue with Russia would be possible and that the further escalation of the situation would not benefit any of its participants.
Earlier on Thursday, US President Donald Tramp said that the relationship between the United States and Russia was at a dangerous low level, and he accused the American Congress of that.
Metro Ekaterinburg enshrines a new way of paying
In October, a bank card could be paid to the Ekaterinburg metropolis, said OAO Director of the I-Network Pavel Wedernikov in an interview with the District Journal.
Our goal is to introduce the same system of travel to the 2018 World Football Championship as in other major cities: Moscow, St. Petersburg, the Netherlands and Novosibirsk.
"We want people from other countries to be able to take advantage of the metropolis by using their bank cards, not buying chips and not standing in line," he said.
Steps that will help your company not to become a regular Uber
Amy Errett wanted to assess the level of satisfaction among the staff of her e-commerce start-up, but the interviews did not work.
The answers were often inflexible, useless, or worse, indiscriminate.
Even though she had promised anonymity, some staff members did not trust that process.
“He was never consistent and objective,” said Errett, a manager of 75 Madison Reed in San Francisco for e-commerce in hair care.
She therefore appealed to third parties for assistance.
There is now a new type of startups in the field of staffing, which help companies to find out how their staff feel.
By developing and licensing software that is designed to measure the turnover of staff, they allow companies to make expressions, to address certain teams and demographic groups, to offer staff anonymity and a hotline for complaints, and in some cases to enable informants to pass the top management and to address the directive directly.
“We now have tools such as Strava and Fitbit to monitor your health, and where is Fitbit to your company?” says Jim Burnett, co-founder and President of the Glint Start-up from Redwood City, whose analytical programs are used by companies to measure employee involvement.
Errett explained that she had gained greater understanding of what her staff thought and felt in three years of using "Glint".
In addition to the expressions and questionnaires of certain teams, the product offers a company's thermal map and shows in a clear way which units have more complaints and which managers have a low approval rating, which allows it to understand why.
The companies are aware that they need to monitor the situation at work, otherwise they will become the regular Uber, which became involved in the scandal when the former staff member posted a blog describing the aggressive situation in which those who expressed discontent were punished.
For startups such as "Glint", it is a desire to control the situation - an opportunity for a profitable business.
According to the Internet portal “Let’s talk about pay”, dedicated financial technologies, global governance, regulation and compliance industry can cost more than $118.7 billion by 2020.
The start of "Convert" from Denver, Colorado, helping companies to prevent and detect bad behavior, noted a slight increase in interest and activity earlier this year in the light of the decline in the reputation of "Ubera".
Almost 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla, are listed in the “Convert” section.
Recently, Uber appeared among clients.
Like “Glint”, “Convert” enables companies to send individual interviews of staff opinions, collect confidential responses in real time, and explore hot maps of problem areas.
It also provides a hotline for anonymous text messages that enables staff to report misconduct.
And if the top manager gets hit, the complaints go straight to the direction.
“The public opinion court has taken over the power of inspectors,” said Patrick Quinlan, founder and president of Convercent.
If it is found that the company is ill-treated or is acting in a non-ethical manner, even if the inspector is not involved, the company may face the costly effects of customer boycotts, the flow of staff and judicial appeals, Quinlan reported.
Ruby Tuesday, a network of restaurants, where more than 25,000 staff have been working in 500 institutions, has been using Convert for more than a year to make sure that staff are in the course of rules and procedures and to offer a simple way to go to the company's headquarters.
Earlier, if the staff member wanted to report the problem, he or she had to look for a phone number or a head office e-mail, file a formal complaint and hope that it would be taken seriously.
This was often a frightening and unpleasant experience, told James Vitrano, the head of the legal management of Ruby Tuesday, that there was no normal way to track staff complaints.
Now that the company is using the "Convert" service, the problems that were previously hidden from managers sitting in offices in other cities or states - such as discrimination, harassment and unfair pay - can be found and dealt with more quickly.
“I can approach a comprehensive, comprehensive understanding of the situation of staff”, said Vitrano, who was led by the Ruby Tuesday risk management team.
“And we protect our shareholders from judicial proceedings with staff.”
According to Quinland, the company began to be more serious about the ethics, values and involvement of staff in 2002, after the accounting company Artur Andersen suffered a breach due to ethical violations resulting from Del Enron.
But only when “social networks received mass distribution”, companies realized that they would not be able to keep their dirty bags from viral distribution in the network.
“Before using technology to control ethics, people used hope as a strategy,” he said.
Both "Glint" and "Convert" offer their software as a service, taking regular payments with companies for the use of their products.
This is a business model and an opportunity to gain the approval of venture investors who supported both startups.
In February, “Convert” received $10 million funding from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, resulting in a total capital of $47 million.
“Glint” received $10 million in November from “Bessemer Venture Partners”, resulting in the company's total capital of $60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising if they take into account the interlinked nature of companies, cultures and venture capital.
The growing volume of research shows that today’s staff expect more jobs than it used to be.
In markets with fierce competition, such as the Silicon Valley, high wages and interesting projects, it is only a minimum necessary.
Staff members want to feel that they are accepted and appreciated and that they devote their time to the company with a positive mission.
“When people are happy to work in the company, they feel that they are hearing them, and the work they are doing, they are more trying to make such a company successful,” says Nina McQuien, the vice president of the global benefits and satisfaction of the LinkedIn company, where they are also using “Convert”, and “Glint”.
Investors receive income when their portfolios go well; business goes well when employees are committed and involved.
If the third party's analytical tools promise to increase the dedication and involvement of staff, it is not surprising that they are supported.
As cultural experts in the workplace have said, it is important to have data on the involvement of staff.
But the data is useless until the company's supervisors take action.
In fact, if the company requests back-to-back staff, it can create an impression that the cycle of change is changing.
And if the changes do not occur fast enough, or if they do not happen at all, disappointment can develop, and staff lose interest.
“If you are going to ask for 4,000 proposals, you must be prepared to conduct 4,000 interviews,” says Russell Rat, president of the Kotter International management consulting company, who has come to see companies making a mistake, relying too much on data collection.
If you do not go to the end, the officials will say, "Did you hear me?
You don't care?
And if you are equal, why should I not be equal?"
According to Errett, Madison Reed, who now conducts monthly surveys of staff, is able to take action on the same day when someone reports the problem with Glint.
And, after the feedback from staff with insufficient speed of decision-making and quality of communication, it was able to reorganize several teams within the company and introduce communication training to address problems.
Ruby Tuesday is gaining new knowledge about its staff and hopes that in the long term, this knowledge will help her to keep staff in high-level sectors more efficient.
"If you do not try to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people," said Vitrano.
If you lose people, you lose clients.
And if you lose your clients, you lose your companies.
In Barnaule, a new asphalt on the Krasnoarmai perspective
In Barnau, cardinal measures have been taken to eliminate the causes of asphalt failures in the Krasnoarmian perspective.
The place where the pits have been created twice on a recently asphalt passage (a passage through the streets of Youth) is decided to “discover”.
It is recalled that a small section of the road near the tramway occurred because the land was planted in an unexploited network area.
According to the Vice-Chairman of the Urban Committee on Road Economics, Goods, Transport and Communications, Ivan Garmat will conduct a detailed survey for the detailed investigation and eradication of the conditions for violation.
Depending on its results, the necessary measures will be taken.
It is expected that the recovery and concreteization of uninhabited communications will be required.
This is reported on the official site of the capital.
The Briins team has to take longer because the National Student Sports Association has cancelled training twice a day
The time is approaching 11 evenings; a football crowd from the University of California in Los Angeles is being held back to hit on one side of the new training fields of the campus team.
Some of them were standing on their feet, finding their back shining after the stressful first day of the sports camp.
For many players, these minutes are a mid-day break.
Games recorded in summer sessions will be returned to the community after three hours of training to prepare for final exams, and the next morning will be returned to the Vasserman football centre at 6:30.
Shortly before Monday turned Tuesday, the coach of the Briins Jim Mora said, “The next three days these boys are waiting for a meat-sweet.”
The fact that the National Student Sports Association cancelled training twice a day, which was designed to reduce the burden on players, actually extended their working day – at least until the end of the Friday exams.
Therefore, the first three training sessions of the California University team in Los Angeles were scheduled at 7:15 p.m. to be held in and without a flat schedule of players.
A side effect from the lack of two trainings per day has become more than a day with one training, and Brunsz is starting the camp almost weekly compared to last year and is training during the summer school for the first six seasons of the Sea in Vesuvius.
According to the schedule, they are required to conduct 18 trainings by 20 August, including before the formal training for the first game in the season against the team of the University of Texas A&M in September.
He must have said that he supported the amendment of the rules by the National Student Sports Association, despite the fact that there was another point in the game schedule as a result of it.
"In three or four days, we will give them this tremendous burden, which is a serious test," said Mary.
"And they just overcame him, they work, they're amazing guys.
I think that when we live until Saturday and we have more time, it's really going to be great."
When the camp is completed, the California University of Los Angeles will conduct closed training; this is a difficult task, since its fields are directly visible from the adjacent park and from the nearby Laskin Centre, a expensive hotel that has already been bombed by football matches over the protective network behind the doors.
The Briuins games should start with these exits, but Mora admits that when the rooms are released during the season, there may be a problem.
"We will have protection," said Mora.
"This is a serious problem, and I don't exaggerate the risk, assuming that someone can take the room off, sit there and record the video training.
If you have a video training record, it's very serious.
But we'll have security there and security in park number eight.
We'll do everything we can with what we have.
I won't be too worried about it.
We have a plan."
All the victims of the terror in Petersburg were released from the hospital
All those affected during the attack at St. Petersburg Metro in April were released from the hospital.
This was reported in the press by Deputy Governor Anna Mityanin.
According to the end of July, there were three people left in the station, broadcasting the TV Centre.
It is recalled that the explosion in St. Petersburg's metropolis took place on 3 April of the current year.
The bomb exploded the terrorist-mortal Akbarjon Jalilov.
As a result of the attack, 15 people were killed as well as the perpetrator himself.
In the criminal case, 11 persons, including the alleged organizer, Abor Azimov, were arrested.
It was recalled that Rosuszüzer had recently recommended that the Petersburg metropolis review a road safety action plan, in particular by increasing the number of metal detectors.
Facebook strengthens the fact-finding in the fight against fake news
Facebook will be more likely to send text that is suspicious of mystifications, independent experts, and to show their conclusions under original posts, stated in the fourth largest social network of peace, which is trying to combat so-called fairy-tale news.
In a statement on its website, the company stated that it was beginning to use improved machine learning algorithms to identify possible mystifications, send them for verification and perhaps show the results of the check-in under the original post.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main ways in which the so-called Facebook news was disseminated, which many believe have influenced the 2016 presidential elections in the United States.
This issue is also being debated actively in Europe after the French voters had been misled by false reports before the presidential elections in May, and in Germany before the September elections, they expressed support for the plan to penalize social networks if they would not quickly remove hate-fired posts.
On Thursday, in a separate statement in German, Facebook reported testing a new fact-finding algorithm that was launched in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In order to see what reports are being challenged by independent verifiers, people want to have a wider context to make reasoned judgements about what they read and what they are sharing," she wrote in her blog Sarah Sue, Facebook News Manager.
She added that Facebook would continue to test the function of "related articles" and work on other changes in the news chain to solve the problem of fake news.
Create a Romanian comic book: One castle in English history
In the recent past, Skotni's crook castle was filmed in the Squeeze music video, and in the 1970s and 1980s he served as a port for Margaret Tetcher.
But 700 years from his comfortable place in the town of Beul, Kent, he watched the rough history around him, and now he inspired Jamie Rods, a Yorkshireman with a long hair and a tendency to historical documents, to novel comics.
"I think it's so beautiful to look at a man who died 300 years ago," he says with enthusiasm.
"You feel it so personal when you hold this letter in your hand."
"The Castle in England" covers the period from the Middle Ages to the Evardian era and tells about the families that lived in Scotland; each story illustrated one of the young British artists, Isaac Lenkevic, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
This is not the first book of Rhodes, which is based on archived data: in 2014 he wrote "Tooths of the Dead and Other Stories" - a collection of materials from the British Library; this project suddenly crowned him to the depths of the soul.
"I could only see the prints on the edge of a letter written in the 1700s by a double agent working on the Jacobites," he says.
"It's his finger print."
And the Scriptures will always be inspired by the smoke, for at that time the fire would be kindled.
And in 300 years, in the future, you'll think you're there too.
Oh, how I love archives!"
For a man who has such a passion for old papers, getting support from the National Fund and the English Council of Fine Arts and living in the castle for four months ('I'm honest, I'm a little stuck there') seems too good to be true.
Rods has been studying the "new" Victorian castle all day long, walking through the archives, and looking at many of the treasures of the name and ancient things - such as the heads of gin on the walls or bottles, the centuries that have passed away.
He went to the park and to the ruins of the old castle, talked to foresters, gardeners, and sometimes with artists working on illustrations to his book.
Then at night he "drinked whiskey and built to write."
The story of Scotty's lock was not very studied because the National Fund had full access to it only in 2006 when Elizabeth Hassi, the last heir, died.
When Rhods arrived ten years later, the staff only started to discuss the archive he described as "the aristocrats who had fallen on their hearts for centuries".
Newspapers, letters from the British Empire, maps showing who owned it, "You think the land disputes are boring," says Rhodes, "but there were two families on this beach.
There you go, guys!"
In some stories, the castles become a starting point for wider search in English history: for example, in "Worknike", the hero just left the castle built to join the 1381 Christian Revolution.
“There are reports of the rebellion that occurred in the 1380s in a book called “Kent and Sassex Riszar families”, says Rods.
"The Christian rebellion began in these places, and I thought the rebellion was the right beginning.
Maybe they were connected?"
Other topics are closely related to the history of the castle, for example, the Priest, in which the Jesuit priest, whose family had been hiding in Darrell for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or "Contrabandist", about the 18th-century smuggler Arthur Darrell, who was supposed to stage his own funerals by hitting the grave with stones (it was discovered several years after the tomb was dug).
Darrella is the beloved Rods' family of all who inhabited Scotty: "The gentlemen seem to have been a perfect juiler, they've gone into debt forever, and spent money on what they couldn't afford.
In different generations, the Darrells have solved their debt problems, marrying rich older women, and I represent them as a company of sympathetic men who are able to support the heirs of the great fortunes."
Following the completion of the Rhods Castle, there will be other opportunities for a unique writing experience.
He lived two weeks in a Finnish silence, where he wrote a graphic novel about Eliamyaki - a place where he was a sanatorium in the early 20th century and then it grew again in the forest.
But Scotty remains a special place for him.
"I had a hard time leaving," he says.
"I felt about it: damn it, I have to go back to real life again."
Fifteen major banks choose Russia
The Russian Banks Association (ARB) has developed as follows: Sberbank, VTB, VTB-24, Alpha Bank, Gazprombank, Rosselhosbank, Binbank and FK Open, seven other credit organizations are going to leave this public organization.
As a result, at least 80 per cent of the market will be affected by the percentage of ARB organizations.
But it is not just a way out - all banks that have declared a break with the ARB - are negotiating with another public organization that is a pooling credit institution - the Russian Association of Regional Banks, led by a well-known politician Anatolio Axakov, Chairman of the Committee of the Gosswords on the Financial Market, recognized as a result of the last session and by the most effective leader of the Committee of Thoughts and by a Member on the number of drafts prepared.
The beginning of the conflict within the ARB was during a discussion in the Council of the Federation when new draft laws were being considered at the Interregional Banking Council, in particular, suggesting the reclassification of banks according to the amount of the statutory capital.
Garegin Tosunyan, President of the ARB, then stated that, in the opinion of the association, the bill was adopted for the benefit of larger banks, which thus sought to limit the possibility of small and medium-sized banks in the regions by taking over their clients.
Among other claims was the criticism of the Central Bank, which, according to Tosunyan, did not always justify the withdrawal of licences from some banks, which, in truth, was followed by the opposition from the representative of the CB: many of the managers of the bankrupt banks, in particular non-prombanks, had entered the ARB's governing bodies.
It is apparent that this inter-exclusive exchange of views is very sensitive to relations with the main bank environment regulator and has become a visible reason for the fifteen largest banks to disagree with the ARB policy, to begin preparing for accession to the Russian Association, noting that “the effectiveness of the ARB’s work is at a low level, and the constructive dialogue within the banking community is not actually being conducted”.
It'll be better for investors.
What's going to happen?
Let us respond immediately to the main issue that arises in the case of a smaller conflict or conflict in the banking sphere or in close proximity to it: the investors will not be threatened, rather, to increase the reliability of the banking system.
The chapter entitled "Russian" Anatolio Axakov, known for its generosity in all the interests of banks and their clients, is a high-level professional who is highly valued in the Central Bank: almost all the management of the CB is present in the annual activities of the Association, and all relevant legislative initiatives of the regulator are carried out through the expert evaluations of the “regionals”.
The staff-organization plan clearly does not provide for special shocks.
There is no doubt that the ARB is in an uneasy financial and management situation following the disappearance of such powerful and influential participants with their contributions and lobbying capabilities.
However, this older, established organization of the banking community in 1991 has little capacity to continue to improve banking legislation and the scope of monetary treatment in general.
It cannot be said that Russia is ready to accept any new members under any circumstances, judging by the reaction of its leader, Anatolia Axakova (“may be too much desired”), who said on 21 July at the briefing in the press centre of Parliament's newspaper, that “on the next day representatives from the ARB have asked me to consider increasing the potential of our Russia association”.
Their proposals are to strengthen the voice of the Bankers in the Association Council, as well as to give greater attention to new banking technologies.
The negotiation process is now under way, both parties are studying the proposals, preparing an extraordinary association agenda that will take place in Sochi in mid-September in the framework of the international banking forum.
That's where we're going to be.
Also, by stressing that "the painting is not held," Anatolio Axakov called a possible new leader of the updated Russian Association Georgia Luntowski, who left in September the post of Vice-Chairman of the Central Bank, with a high profile of its business and human qualities.
On 18 August, Anatolio Axakov, who is now resting in Crimea, plans to cease his vacation and arrive in Moscow for one day at an extraordinary meeting of the Council of the Russian Association, which is scheduled to consider the agenda of the Russian Federation.
The entry of petrol engines into the major cities of Russia will not be limited
The vice-president of Mintrans Nikolai Asaul said that despite media reports, the entry of petrol engines into the major cities of Russia would not be limited.
It's a more radical form of our concept.
Our concept is that we need to step up the environmental class.
And there's the concept of going straight to zero emissions.
I don't think we're technically prepared for this.
The question is, what year has it been?
It's the same thing at the phrasing level -- let's forbid it.
Where and when?
Tomorrow?
We're closing the whole city?
"In 20 years, I don't know, maybe it will happen," says Prime Minister.
Earlier, the Information Report reported that by 17 August, Deputy Prime Minister Arkadia Dvorkovic had been commissioned to examine proposals for possible options for electric transport masterships submitted to the Government by the Director-General of PAO Kamaz Sergeem Kogogin.
Among the proposals, according to the newspaper, is the use of VVC cars in major cities and resorts.
Washington is changing the rules for the receipt of the Green Card.
According to the media, President Donald Tramp said that a new U.S. immigration plan would be adopted that would change the rules for the receipt of the Green Card.
The plan provides for a reduction in the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, a more stringent rule of temporary work visas and restrictions on family visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republican Party and supported by the President.
The bill will be discussed in the two Houses of Congress.
“This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save millions of dollars’ taxpayers, and it will make a significant change in how the United States issues Green Papers to citizens of other countries.
The law will reduce the migration rate and replace the existing scheme.
The new application process will benefit English-speaking candidates, have money resources that allow them to hold, and have skills that will benefit our economy," Tramp said, according to American media.
The phenomenon of sex robots is real, and that's what we need to be concerned about.
We were unable to think that 2017 could no longer be worse, and a new report on technological success in the production of sex robots was received.
Yeah.
Sex jobs are now at the center of attention.
The responsible labour force (FRR) has recently issued a report on the development of sex work in the next 5 to 10 years.
In the opinion of Noel Sharki, a professional worker and artificial intelligence at the University of Cheffield and the founder of the FRR, we must take seriously their appearance.
Users will be able to choose the color of the eye of the robots, the shape of the socks and the type of nails.
"People are ghastly about it, but companies are already sending them to consumers in large numbers, and soon we will see them much more," Sharki said in a presentation of the new report.
Modern sex cubes evolved from their inspiring collections of silicone leather, hot on the shoulder, and from almost human replicas controlled by artificial intelligence.
Users can also "crush" their robots for their own taste, choosing all from the color of the eye and the shape of the eyebrows to the shape and color of the nails.
But the fact that many jobs have a "person" compared to which the Stepford woman would be very progressive is even more concerned.
Modern sex dolls have become silicone-skinned robots.
For example, RealBotix robot allows users to work on the qualities they find attractive, for example, fatigue.
There are still sex robots Roxxxy Gold, developed by "True Companion", which are provided with already programmed individuality - for example, "The Cold Farra" makes the impression that the Wild Wendy has a bold character.
"The Roxxxy Gold has a character that fits yours perfectly," the True Companion reports with caution.
Therefore, she loves what you love, does not love what you do not love, and so on.
She's changing her mood for a day like this man!
She may want to sleep or bluff, or she may be in a mood!"
In the presence of sex robots, there is a lot of concern - not least because they replace real human relationships - but most of all concern the subjugated image of women, association with rape, which causes the cold (read-and-resistant) power of the Pharaoh.
"True Companion" on Roxxxy is compared to a fan only for men.
"If there's a woman (sic!) there can be a pickup, why can't men have Roxxxy?" - said on the site.
But these sex jobs are not just fetishes or just new sex toys.
Their emergence and increasing complexity indicate something darker and deeper in our culture, a deviation from the ideal of gender equality towards the desire for sex, subjecting as an optional addition.
Of course, most men will not buy sex robots, and although FRR notes their growing popularity, they are still on the periphery of consumer culture.
But what comes to us from the periphery can be very instructive about the meanings of the era in which we live.
And many people are not stupid and aggressive until the free market gives them the opportunity to do so.
It is not a coincidence that these complex sex jobs have occurred when women's rights around the world have been threatened when there is a president in the White House, who boasts that he is approaching women.
The most terrible thing in Rasska's television series is not graphic images, curved bodies, and evicted eyes, that is, how much this vision seems realistic.
The Republic of Gilead is an exaggeration, but now it doesn't seem that big.
The aim of the sex industry is to achieve a physical similarity to real women (only with the proportions of porn stars), which allows technology.
Their Creators want them to appear to humans to copy the movements of the human body.
But it's just that your "characters" work doesn't look like these women.
They can't break up with their partners or leave them.
They don't have their own life, nor their biography -- nothing that could indicate independence or something else that could destroy the illusion of full dependence.
In other words, they are beautiful slaves.
Or, as they say in 2017, servants.
The native of Los Angeles Eugene (Puh) Jeter, who has been speaking for the gathering of Ukraine since 2013, will not help our national team at the European basketball championship, the final part of which starts on 31 August.
In an interview with the BeBasket portal, the General Manager of Blue-Yellow Andrei Lebedev reported.
We tried to make a deal with Jeter, but unfortunately he won't come under family circumstances.
We're going to the Eurobasket without a naturalized game, because we don't want to take someone we don't know.
"This situation will allow for the development of our young players," he said.
I recall that with Jeter's direct participation, the Ukrainian assembly took the sixth place in the Eurobasket-2013 and first came to the basketball World Championship, where the "yellow" was unable to overcome the group phase, and the U.S. national had picked 15.4 points on average, 3 selected and 5 handed over.
Jeter has stopped running for the Ukraine assembly since his departure from the post of our top coach of the American team, Mike Fratello, who left that post in 2015.
The European Year 2017 will be held simultaneously in four countries: Turkey, Romania, Israel and Finland.
The Ukrainian team will carry out its team tournament matches on the Promised Land.
There will be five units in Group B: with Germany (31 August), Italy (2 September), Georgia (3rd), Lithuania (5th) and Israel (6th).
In preparation for the tournament, our husband's assembly held two checkpoints, in which she joined the Dutch and the Belarusians.
- Big Tremp? - Yeah.
Imagining Mita Romney seems very reasonable
In the Trampa era, the common place became the fact that political disputes that polarized the American electorate broke down some families on a micro level.
Between Thanksgiving and Christmas, the U.S. newspapers were crammed with columns of how to deal with terrible relatives who were voting for the Trump.
Looks like we're all under a lot of stress, so we're gonna be running fast.
Fewer talk about Tramp's ability to unite families.
I'm writing about it because my cousin, the left-wing poet of Chicago, who had been on a knife with the Republicans in her family, came to me in New York this week.
She reminded me that joining in the fight against the common enemy could have a powerful effect.
At Trampe in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican brother, with whom she has been arguing about the policy for decades, was suddenly and strangely on one side.
This is certainly good for dinner; but I can't imagine that in a broader context this could be dangerous enough.
The tramp blew the force in the left flank, but the deforming effect of his rule can move us all to the right.
When we're talking about Trump and normalization, we have a unlikely chance that we'll stop hitting his exits.
There is, however, an even more questionable scenario in which the Trump "normalizes" the most right Republicans, which will suddenly appear as a model of sound sense in the light of its standards.
I realized that I was very bored today with my old-fashioned nonsense of Mitt Romney - with a dog on the roof of a car and a 14-percent income tax (but at least we knew what his tax declaration looked like) - compared to Tramp and then, and others seem very little evil.
When Trump leaves, the next Republican candidate will simply be in his mind to see a huge step forward.
When my cousin went to the center, we went with the kids to the carousel in the Central Park, the biggest carousel in the New York Park Department and the best way in town to spend three dollars if you don't need caffeine.
The horses are terrible and huge, pictures of the glass fiber on the central drum, the thundering clowns and the animals who, as they turn away, look back in horror, are extremely evil, and the ringing music, as it were, is a wonder.
So many well-known things in this city are disappointed: the skyscrapers are getting old, the silhouettes of the buildings have come too far to cause shock, and the reality of the city is not succeeding in a dream.
Thirty-five years have passed, and I'm still worried about the day I learned that the Swiss-Cattage area is actually not a Swiss joke (thematic pub "Ye Old Swiss Cottage" not an account) but a large circuit in North London.
And Carousel in the Central Park is still an unusual, magical place where a two-year-old child, a eleven-year-old child and two-year-old women can spend a great time.
If I could put the carousel in an evaluation, I'd put a five, but fortunately, no one asked me to.
And at the university this week, I was asked before I could pass a terminal card, to evaluate my "expert" purchases on a scale from one to five stars.
At the corner of my street, the same plus option to conduct a 15 per cent tea assessment is for a stand-by order.
As a result, not only does the idea of interaction slow down, but there is still a need for a personal relationship in a situation that does not involve it.
The poor salesperson at the university smiled with condolences as I continued to assess my experience of handing her a credit card to five stars.
Oscar Pistorius was transferred from prison to hospital because of his chest pain
Pistorius is leaving prison for a second visit to a doctor.
Last year, he was transferred to a hospital for the treatment of contaminants, which, according to the prison administration, resulted in a fall in the chamber.
Pistorius was convicted of intentional murder after the prosecution's appeal for an initial sentence for unintended murder.
He killed Steincamp early in the morning of Valentine's Day in 2013, shooting at it several times through the door of the toilet room in his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius said he had taken his friend for a nightfall hiding in his toilet.
The Prosecutor ' s Office stated its intention to protest another protest, this time against the six-year period of Pretoria, which, she said, was too soft.
The Public Prosecutor ' s Office stated that the appeal would be brought before the Supreme Court of South Africa and that the appeal would be considered this year.
Pretoria's time may increase by 15 years if the prosecutor's office succeeds.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
NTV journalist suspected of killing was selected as a non-department signature
The city law enforcement has chosen a measure of suppression in the form of a non-passengage sign for a man who has attacked a TV journalist named NTV Nikita Dzuzzajeva during a direct airfield in Goriko Park on 2 August.
This is reported by the TASS with reference to the official representative of the IMF RF Irina Wolk.
“In the context of an investigation of the criminal case initiated under article 116 of the Code concerning a 32-year-old man who struck a television channel in the Central Park of Culture and took the name of Goriko, who was suspected of having chosen a measure of repression in the form of a non-refoulement and proper conduct,” explained Volk.
The representative of the IMF added that an administrative protocol for police non-refoulement had been drawn up in respect of the suspect.
On Wednesday, 2 August, during the direct air to the VAT Day, a non-interrupt man struck on the face.
As it turned out later, huligan had no relationship with VVP.
In fact, the dissidents were trying to stop the mosquito.
Two Bulgarians were detained in Greece for illegal Palatine Station
According to the Bulgarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, two citizens were detained in Greece for illegal Palatine.
On 1 August, a group of people who had set up tents in an unfavourable location, including two Bulgarians, were detained in Sitonia.
They were released on the same day, while the result is still under way.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported to the Bi-Ti-Vi television channel that Bulgarians then released.
The Greek authorities have strengthened control of the free camp and have already imposed serious fines on all those who have been arrested during the stay in a place not intended for that place.
Tests will be carried out throughout the season.
According to the Ministry, the court may appoint a fine.
Mid-Russia accused US Vice-President of the rhetorical period of the cold war
Statements made during the U.S. Vice-President Michael Penz's European tour were criticised by the Russian MIDI.
“Unfortunately, Washington is deeply affected by primitive ideologies during the cold war, which are completely depleted from reality,” said the Russian Foreign Office.
In this way, in the Middle Ages, Pensa responded to the words of the “Russian threat” and attempted to cross the borders of Podgorica.
The Russian MID indicated the destructiveness of the choice "with the West or with Russia" and the invisibility of the assumption that the whole of South-East Europe in NATO is an alternative.
Russian diplomats also recalled that it was the United States that violated international law by applying force to withdraw Kosovo from Serbia and thus creating another wave of tension.
"We call on American colleagues to stop the abuse of Russia and its foreign policy line, which is constantly based on respect for partners and willingness to work together constructively, on mutual interest," said the Russian MIDI statement.
Feldsher suffers from a "short" in Sub-Moscow
The DTP occurred in the sub-muscular stupino, as a result of the clash of the anomalous with the "Quick Help" karate, the fieldworker suffered.
Today around 8:10 a.m., Mitsubishi was hit by a car with a car crash in the town of Stupino Moscow area.
“As a result of the crash, the machine was soon turned back,” TAS said in the press service of the ICTY in Moscow.
The DTPs are employed by law enforcement officials who are aware of the circumstances.
In the Odes area, the woman threw her newborn son into the cellophane package.
On 3 August, the Division of Police reported to a local resident that he had found a package with a child in an unconstructed private home.
“The law enforcement officers and doctors who quickly delivered the child to a medical institution went to the scene,” reported the National Police Chief of Odés.
The doctors determined that the boy was born a few hours before his discovery, as evidenced by the presence of the papyrus.
During the priority operational and follow-up activities, the identity of the Rosary was established - the 36-year-old local resident.
It was also found that the woman had three other children.
As noted in the chapter, the family law enforcement had not previously fallen or had been taken into special consideration.
Police are currently setting out the circumstances and reasons that have offered a woman the opportunity to do so, after which a procedural decision will be taken.
The baby is now under the supervision of a doctor.
As previously reported, a 21-year-old woman threw her poor child into a garbage dump in Nicosia.
Gregory Leps: "I'm fighting, although 55 is not 30"
One of the most successful artists of the Russian Estrada Grigorio Leps will cancel his 55th anniversary on the next Sunday.
Before the funeral, the singer had a conversation with the Enlightenment Observer.
I remember your "cold."
A special tent in the Lies, Gloria Gainor sings for the nominee, a powerful salad over the Moscow River.
You must've been screaming like you wanted to spend your next five years.
Have you lost your mind?
When it comes to professionalism, it was a good time.
I've worked a lot, I've spent three times the whole country's gastronomy, I've been giving 120-130 concerts a year.
He released two bad albums.
Of course, now I'm not what I said 20 years ago.
Biological times are not to be fooled.
Five like I sang in my 30s, it's getting harder.
Still, I'm fighting, I don't want to stop.
And I'm with new people, and I think I'm going to a different level.
You're writing a new album with them, first in three years.
Yeah, it's working on him now.
Actually, we've already written it all down in my studio and now we're going to send it to Los Angeles.
It's called "What are you so serious about?" on a single song written together with Timothy.
She's not ready yet, so we haven't taught her yet.
We'll do it later when we take the clip on her.
And we will present the album in November to a series of my Christmas concerts in the Moscow Crocus City Hall.
A classic American drummer Chris Coleman put his hand in your new platinum.
Do you think you wanted to get him into his gastro-comb?
In my opinion, Coleman is one of the most outstanding drummers in the world today.
He came to me at the studio, he recorded his party.
I invited him to join my group, and Jeremy Colson (a well-known drummer who participated in various projects.
But for long-term work in Russia, they have made too much progress.
It was about a fee from €35,000 to €45,000 a month.
Then I thought it was in the post-Soviet space to find worthy musicians.
And he found a great drummer, Max Malashev.
It is better to feed your own souls.
In time, I want to talk to some of them, not what.
For example, guitarist Fedor Dosumov is a high-ranking player at the international level.
It's written by Western music magazines, it's invited to various guitar festivals.
Steve Wy, after listening to his game, said that "a new generation of guitarists came with another executive technique."
Your album's in Los Angeles, American musicians are working with you, but you still can't come to the United States?
Are you trying to remove this ban?
Now, honestly, I'm not doing anything.
There are a number of lawyers dealing with this issue.
As a musician, I'm really sorry that I can't get to America.
I never said I was learning there.
The more you communicate with these professionals, the more useful it is.
We don't drown them, but we don't have that kind of experience, schools.
Our performers of popular music for 70 years did not fully address the challenges that American musicians have always faced.
They have sought the highest quality sound.
And I'm trying to follow the same principles.
Now why did Britain refuse to come in for ten years?
But every year, I'm going to submit visa documents to the British Embassy to allow me to travel there again, and the main thing is to work there.
The rest of Europe is kind to me.
And in August, you're planning a concert in Monaco, not a prom, but an affidavit, right?
Yeah, there's a good sports hall in Monte Carlo, I've spoken there once.
They have now been invited again, and, as far as I know, all the tickets to the concert have already been sold.
You're going to "Randevo Lyme Wikulle," which will start on July 20th in Yurmala, will you?
She invited me, and I, of course, responded.
Lima is a remarkable singer and a beautiful woman who can give herself and her beautiful vocals, and even a whisper.
After the feasts and the Christmas concerts, as far as I know, you want to go to the creation of Vladimir High.
You already have two albums with his songs in the discography.
When's the third time?
Probably next year.
But he's going to be completely different.
I want to write about 80-90 songs to the High about in the same feed as he did himself.
Just a voice and a guitar.
No other arrangement.
My company will be our famous musician, Timur Wedernikov.
I'm trying to get involved in the album and Alexander Jakovlevic Rosenbaum.
I talked to him about it, we have a good relationship, but he's a busy man, so let's see what happens.
You and Boris Grebenškov's songs gradually entered your repertoire.
Maybe then you'll write his album?
Boris Borisovich is a beautiful man and a great musician.
I went through with him a couple of times and asked, "Can I sing that song?
He said, "Greece, I'm writing songs so they can be fulfilled."
Please try it, eat it.
It's probably interesting to write that album.
As long as I don't have a problem like that, but in the future, in two years' time, if Boris Borisovich won't object, I might make a project like that.
If you don't focus entirely on the business of your manufacturing center.
I don't think you've yet realized his potential, signed contracts with all the artists you're interested in?
There are a number of performers I'd like to have under my wing, but they are self-contained people.
You mean Sergei Lazarev?
Series is a brilliant singer, I invited him.
I can't agree with his repertoire, but he's a professional and he has his development strategy.
And now in my center, there's Alexander Paniotov, whom I was taking to the Voice.
We've made a deal with him and we're working.
In our pop music, such songs are rare.
It would be a real pity if he did not reach the heights he deserved.
I'm trying to improve his repertoire, I'm taking the clips.
I hope for a good outcome.
And I'm also trying to move other artists from my center: I buy them songs, I pay for poetry, sometimes their tracks fall into the rotation of television and radio channels.
If they do not achieve great heights, I will nevertheless lead our cooperation to a logical conclusion.
They're going to get a written album on their way out, a couple of videos.
And further, if they want to, they can go their way, and I won't insist that they get the money back.
Although I would be pleased if any of them were to gain commercial success and pay me the percentages we agreed on in the contract.
But if that doesn't happen, I'm not going to cover the oxygen for anyone.
Let everyone work, break, prove what I once proved.
If tomorrow you're invited to make a gastro-tour tour in Ukraine and they guarantee entry to the country, will you go?
I'm still being invited.
The focus is on closed activities.
And as for the big tour...
I was the person of my country, a Russian, in my own conviction, flying to Syria on the same plane that was then destroyed.
If they say tomorrow that they have to fly to some other point for the sake of the State, I will.
And let me guess what bloggers and other critics think about me.
I am truly sorry that we have had such a situation with Ukraine.
Because I think we're one people and we're supposed to be together.
I'm sorry that this is not going to happen, at least in the near future.
And I used to give 40-50 concerts a year in Ukraine.
They met like nowhere.
Thank you very much.
And he collaborated with several Ukrainian artists: Ani Lorak, St. Lobodi, Artem Loik...
In Ukraine, the masses of donated people, and I am truly sorry that they cannot now fully extend their talent to a large Russian audience.
Music must unite and entertain people.
I would be pleased to invite some of the classic Ukrainian executives to Russia, such as Slav Vakarcuk, and to have a concert with him.
But at this point, I think it's unlikely...
Andrea Ochlopkova was transferred with a cosmodroma
As it became known, the Technical Director of the Cosmodrom East Andrei Ohlopkov began work at the State Space Science and Production Centre (HCNPC) called Hruniceva.
He had previously been de facto in the construction of the East Cosmodrom, but because of differences with the management of the Centre for Land and Space Infrastructure (CENCI), he was transferred to a company in Moscow files, where the coordination of production would take place.
Mr. Ohlopkova's replacement will not be possible: the post of the technical director is likely to be cancelled and the function is disbanded by the CENCI units.
That the Technical Director of the East and Deputy Director-General of the CENCI for Technology Development, Andrey Ohlopkov, went to work in HCNPC on behalf of Hrunicev, "U" told the top managers of several space industry enterprises, as well as government staff.
"He's been working on a new job for a few weeks," the interviewers in the industry explained.
The CENCI's operational comment was not received on Thursday, and Mr. Ohlopkov himself was not available for comments.
However, the information "U" has been formally confirmed in the CCNPC.
He decided to move to the position of the Director for Coordination of Production, said to the companies. - Andrei Ohlopkov has fully fulfilled the task of ensuring a minimum driving licence for the first launch on the east coast.
Mr. Ohlopkov went to work at CENCI in 2013, having his shoulders served in space troops, in particular in Bayconure, and in Plesecke, at the "North" cosmodrome as the first Deputy Commander in the name of Colonel.
In 2009, Andrew Ochlopkov became a criminal figure.
The investigation accused him of being a hostage: it was alleged that the regional traders had received a bribe but had failed to fulfil the commitments made to clean separate parts of the missiles in the Arkangel area and the Republic of the Commission.
In 2012, the jury recognized him as innocent.
Its responsibilities for technological development were extended to various projects, but the main of them was the construction of a cosmodrom in the Far East.
The Federal Space Agency Oleg Ostapenko, then in an interview with "U", specifically said that the situation in the East was "critical already in October 2013".
The issue was that there was a strategic error in planning: the completion of the construction and the first launch of the Union-2.1 rocket was planned at the same time as the end of 2015.
In order to complete the launch by the end of the year, the construction was decided in the early half and the deadlines were set from December to July 2015.
In order to speed up the process, there was a need for skill: TENCI specialists began to conduct parallel installation of technology equipment on unassured sites.
The main proponent of this idea was Andrew Ochlopkov.
Despite the risks and still the transfer that took place (as opposed to December 2015, the Union only flew on 28 April 2016), this idea justified itself, says the source "U" on the cosmodrom: " Otherwise we would not have carried out a single launch with the East, but would have been built so far."
Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin, curing the creation of a cosmodrom, called Andre Ohlopkov in a joke his "space Suzanim", but he almost always asked for information about the state of the building.
He recalled Mr. Ochlopkov and straight: for example, in an interview with "U" he suggested that the Federal Special Building Agency (Specster) be removed from the status of the only East Executive and directly work with subcontractors: "Why should we all eggs be stored in one box of Specster?"
This idea was supported by the Government.
Since 2017, CENCI has assumed the responsibility of the contractor-general to allow the construction work to be completed at the start and technical complex to be completed by the fourth quarter.
According to "U", Mr. Ohlopkova's shift to a new place of work became a matter of disagreement with the management of the CENCI on how to complete the construction and construction of the cosmodroma, as well as working methods with subcontractors.
"It was decided that it would be better for all," said one of the top managers involved in the East.
The official of the Government machine, in turn, calls it a strange decision: "He was one of the best professionals, finding an equivalent replacement would be an easy one."
According to the U, this will not be required: the post of the technical director of the cosmodroma will be abolished and its functions will be disbanded by the CENCI units.
A two-speciality training programme will be held in music schools
In the future, children’s music school students will be able to receive two specialties at the same time.
According to the Deputy Director of the Department of Science and Education, St.
"The Ministry of Culture has taken over this issue, and we are working together with the expert community to develop a mechanism that will enable two specialities to be adopted, but at the same time will not contradict existing legislation in the field of education," Goubenko said.
Last Friday, during the "Nedital Talk", Vladimir Putin, a student of the Syrian Children's Centre, said that he was forced to pay for the second-specialty items in the MMS at the Moscow Conservatory.
The girl told me she was studying at the violin and piano class and had awards for both courses.
The Head of State recognized her question very relevant and promised to help.
In Mexico, 17-year-old Russians are detained on the wall.
In Mexico, 17-year-old Russian Kirilla N., who walked on the roof of the high building, reported the El Universal portal.
The incident occurred in Mexico City.
A young man, with the help of two unknown men, went through a three-metre trap on the territory of Nestle's office building complex and took himself to one of his pools.
However, he did not use any special equipment, insurance and rope.
The young man was already on the roof.
The employees of the Ministry of Public Security dropped it on the ground on the helicopter.
It was subsequently sent to the National Institute of Migration.
It explains whether a young person is legally present in the territory of the country.
In the meantime, the video with a young high - ranking man has become popular in the Network.
Users called the young man a spider.
As the media writes, such experiments are a hobby for him.
Red meat, milk products and chocolate can help to facilitate CPC.
Red meat and chocolate are considered a nightmare for your food tract.
But recent studies say that diet, rich in meat proteins and milk products, can help to relieve symptoms in those who suffer from infectious diseases.
It is an incurable disease of some 1.3 million people in the United States and 300,000 in Britain that leads to the loss of life, chronic or bleeding, weight loss, and extreme fatigue.
It is usually recommended to avoid meat and milk products to relieve symptoms, but researchers at Washington University found that the main amino acid triptophane contributes to the production of immune cells that increase the suction tolerability.
The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that the immune cells in the pocket monitor to prevent harmful microbes from entering the body.
Cells capable of starting the burning process are balanced by cells that increase tolerance, protecting the body, and thus do not harm sensitive tissues.
If the balance is too much inflamed, it can lead to a fever.
Experiments have shown that a mouse that has a certain bacteria in the pocket has an increase in cell tolerance.
And this bacteria need triptophane, one of the building elements of the protein, to start these cells.
Professor Colonna said: "We have established a link between one type of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri, which is part of the normal microbial fluid, and the development of the population of cells that increase tolerance.
The more triptophans were fed in the mice, the more these immune cells had."
He assumed that the same would work for people: the combination of L. reuteri and rich triptophan diets can contribute to a more tolerant and less prone to inflammation of the environment in the well.
Dr. Luis Servantes-Barraganavas, who studied the diversity of immune cell tolerability, found that one group of mice had these cells, and the other group that belonged to the same line, but contained them separately, had none.
She assumed that the difference could be caused by the microbial of the mouse, by the bacteria, viruses and fungi communities that usually live in the pelvic tract.
The cell DNA of the mouse was sequenced, and six types of bacteria present in the mouse with immune cells but not in the mouse that did not have them were detected.
Mouses grown in a sterile environment with no good microbes and no immune cells developed, received L. reuteri, and immune cells appeared.
In order to understand how bacteria affect the immune system, researchers have grown L. reuteri in the liquid environment and then transferred small portions of the fluid - without bacteria - to undeveloped immune cells from the mouse.
Immune cells have become cells that increase tolerance.
When the active component was separated from the liquid, it was a side-product of triptaphane processing, known as indole-3-molic acid.
When researchers doubled the number of triptophans in mouse food, the number of these cells increased by about 50 per cent, but when the level of triptophan was reduced twice, the number of cells also dropped twice.
Dr. Servantes-Barragan explains that people have the same tolerability as mice, and most of us have L. reuteries in their iron and oxygen tract.
It is not known whether the side products of L. Reuters develop cells in people as well as in mice, but in people suffering from respiratory diseases in the cough, there have been defects in the genes associated with triptophan.
She said, "We may have to strengthen these cells, because they depend on the internal surface of the cells.
The high levels of triptophan with L. reuteri may potentially lead to an increase in their population."
In the opinion of José Mourinou, Manchester United hired a genius in the face of the Matrice.
Manchester United has hired “genies” in the face of Nemani Matić, Joze Mourinou, after the semi-defender debuted in the match against "Samphoria" on Wednesday night.
The game, acquired for 40 million pounds in Chelsea, began with a 2-1 win in Dublin in the last pre-season Unaited match before the UEFA Supercoub against Real Madrid on Thursday, and impressed the role of a semi-defenser, while the games of the Pola Pogba and Andreas Periri broke in front of them when they were blessed.
However, since Mattic did not take part in the pre-season Chelsea tour in Asia, he did not take the preparations for the game seriously, and he lasted only 45 minutes, which, Mourinu said, requires processing before the start of the prime league season.
"He needs time, but his experience, mind, genius, as he thinks, he thinks football," Maurine said.
"We'll help him get ready sooner than late."
Just like Matic, his new friends, Victor Lindelöf and Romel Lukaku, started playing at the Aviva stadium when Maureen began to form his main composition by the beginning of the next season.
The Independent newspaper reported this week that Maurinu wanted to hire three more players, but that the club had already achieved fantastic results by hiring three of the four players he would like to hire first.
"I am grateful to the club for having won three out of four," he added.
“I am more pleased if they get me four of the four, but they have already made a great effort for me.”
Former Lithuanian Social Democrats' leaders pledge to remain in the ruling coalition
Former Presidents of the Democratic Party of Lithuania, former Prime Minister Algirdas Butkiychus and Gediminas Kirkilas, as well as former spokesperson of the Social Democrats Cheslovas Yürshenas, called on the parties to remain in the ruling coalition.
As the Parliament newspaper reported, because of training with partners - the Alliance of Croesians and Greens - a discussion was initiated in the Social Democratic Party, whether to remain in the ruling coalition.
And here are three senior experienced associates to open-ended partners, which say, in particular, "Resolved disappointment in the party results of the election, but the coalition with the "Christians" has created for us the easy and not very easy, but still the conditions for further implementation of the social justice goals that are set out in the Government's programme on our initiative and for maintaining the political domination of the left-wing centre on the right parties."
According to the party ' s former leaders, the discussion has so far been “a voice-based expression without specific arguments”.
The authors are afraid that the unimaginable actions of their party may lead to political, economic and social instability in Lithuania.
A fine was imposed on the disabled, Anton Mamaevou.
Mosgorsud smoothed the punishment of the disabled invalid Anton Mamayev from four and a half years of imprisonment to a fine of 200 thousand rubbing.
Earlier, the decision of the Timorese Court was released from SIZO.
However, Mosgorsud confirmed that the accused was a criminal, since he had organized a car robbery and kidnapping in an ex-combatant.
In his decision, Mossorud eased Anton Mamayev's punishment to 200 thousand rubles.
“Mamaev is an organizer of the riot, which also constitutes a crime, and should therefore be charged with criminal responsibility,” explained the “U” press secretary, Mosgorsud Uljan Solopov.
In this case, the court took into account the health status of Mamaeva, the actual circumstances of the case, the absence of aggravating circumstances.
In addition, the Court applied Art. 64 of the UC RF, which stipulates that a lower penalty may be imposed.
With regard to Mamayev Vasili Serostanov, the court did not establish circumstances that would give rise to a change in the category of severity of the defendant and a change in the sentence.
Sam Anton Mamaev stated that he was not satisfied with Mosgorsud's decision.
I'm disappointed with the court's decision.
The only legal solution would be a justification for continuing to fight for justice.
His lawyer, Andrey Orlov, did not rule out the appeal of a sentence in the Mosgorsud case and the Supreme Court.
"We will use all the cases before the European Court of Human Rights," he said.
Remember, the 28-year-old Anton Mamaev Moscow, who suffered from spinal atrophy, became a criminal figure in the fall of last year.
The invalid claims to have bought a motorbike in a well-known 160,000-year-old to sell.
However, the owners of a motorcycle, including former teammates, said that the disabled person and his assistant Vasili Serostan had chosen property, threatening to resort to violence.
On 30 June, the Timor-Leste District Court of Moscow sentenced Vasilia Serostanov to three years in the colony, and Anton Mamayev to four and a half years in prison with the sentence in the general regime colony (art. 162 C.E.).
After the displaced person was placed in SISO, the Public Chamber, the Office of the Public Prosecutor, authorized by President Tatian Moskalkova, was involved.
As a result, in mid-July, Anton Mamaev was released from SISO by the same decision of the Timorese court.
The defence, in turn, appealed to the decision of the first instance in Mosgord.
UNF will prepare a report on the environment to the President
The “Forum of Action” of the Pan-Russian People's Front (UNF) will address the environmental issue in 2017, reported to the “Reports” source in the UNF and confirmed the head of Alexie Anisimov's e-mail movement.
He said that, as a result of the Frontovika Forum, they planned to prepare a report to the President on domestic environmental issues and to propose a strategy for their solution.
The Conferences of the Reports in the UNF noted that the report of the Head of State would contain a “deep analysis” of the situation in all federal districts of the country.
According to the “Reports”, the final forum of the UNF will take place in autumn.
Its exact date has not yet been fixed - usually under the President ' s schedule, which is a leader of the movement and is traditionally present in key activities of the UNF.
The Front held several interregional environmental conferences, one in two federal districts, in Rostov-na-Donu, Kaliningrad and Kirov.
The conference will be held in the capital of the Republic of Ulan-Ude.
On the basis of the proposals that have been made and will be put forward in these activities, we are also making systematic proposals to address environmental problems, as the UNF interviewer told the "Reports".
The Co-Chairman of the Chief of Staff of the Movement, Olga Timofeeva, led by the Committee on Ecology and Environmental Protection, reported that the “frontows” were reporting to the head of the State on the work carried out during the Year of Ecology in Russia.
The outcome of the environmental forum and the UNF Forum of Action are likely to be compatible.
Over the year, we have grown up with a strong team of experts in the field of environmental issues, seen gaps in legislation, and stopped dozens of violations of the law.
All of this will be in the report that we are preparing for the President as the leader of our movement.
In addition to this document, “fronts” are also reported on the priority projects of the UNF,” said Olga Timofheev.
She said that a special representative of the head of State on environmental, environmental and transport issues, Sergei Ivanov, would be invited to the forum.
He had previously participated in the UNF Media Forum, which took place in St. Petersburg in April.
A few months later, the Year of Ecology will go back to history, and the most important thing to do today is to launch environmental mechanisms to work for years.
To prevent these issues from getting out of the agenda, she added Olga Timofheeva.
The head of the Regional Policy Laboratory of the Expert Institute of Social Research (EISI) noted that, by raising the environmental issue, the UNF is acting as part of the presidential agenda.
Many things they have offered as experts in various forums, and these initiatives have been supported by the President, said "Investments" by Andrey Kolyadin.
He stressed that the economic capacity of the environmental agenda could not be excluded to date, which could give regions additional impetus to development.
Further, the UNF will be able to address not only its environmental problems but also the development of ecotourism, the expert added.
The current environmental issue has demonstrated the "direct line" with Vladimir Putin in June.
In particular, the President was asked about the garbage dump in Balasche (closed) and coal dust in the port of Nagok (a draft law on the prohibition of open carbon leakage in human settlements, one of the authors, Olga Timofheeva).
Environmental experts believe that the legal basis for addressing environmental problems in Russia as a whole has been set up, the issue is in further legal practice, as well as in the position of civil society.
A clear implementation of the decisions taken by the State is considered to be the head of the Ecology Fund for All, Leonid Bocin.
A member of the SPD, Head of the Non-Governmental Organization Greens of Russia, Sergei Ciplenkov, in talks with the "Reports", stressed that a responsible approach to society and business was needed to deal successfully with environmental problems, and some legislative efforts were limited.
As soon as society and business are aware that environmental problems - a much more positive step in the strategic perspective - will change the situation, Sergei Ciplenkov noted.
The expert stressed that there was a need to break the trend that the violation of environmental legislation was an economically beneficial solution for business.
The British inventor used a microchip to get into the house and the car on his towing.
The British inventor became the first man in the country to have a microchip set up to open his home door, go into the office, and even drive a car with a simple towel.
Thirty-three-year-old Steven Nortem used a cross-sectional chip between large and indicative fingers, and now, through his BioTek company, he offers this service to companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives for technology.
He joined Dr. Jeff Watson, an anesthesiologist from the Queen of Winchester, in order to ensure that the procedure for use was carried out in accordance with medical standards.
Technology looks like a microchip that uses cats and dogs, and the procedure takes only 30 seconds.
Nortema also replaces locks in houses and machines on compatible with a price chip of 300 pounds per lock.
One child's wife's father has already established technology in his home and in his BMW Z4 car, which takes place when his hand is on the wheel.
The White House's Recquisite was charged to taxpayers in thousands of dollars
According to the military records provided by TIME magazine, the White House's decision last month to push a helicopter to the South Bank for an event dedicated to American industrial production amounted to $24,000.
The white-green Sikorsky VH-3D, known as “Marine One”, when the ship was president, became a central element of the event held in the White House on 17 July, which demonstrated American construction programmes.
President Donald Tramp, Vice-President Mike Pens, and senior white-house officials reviewed technology products from all 50 states.
The helicopter, produced in Connecticut, was exhibited near a boat from the state of Man, a fire car from Wisconsin and a truck driver from Mississippi.
According to the records of the first helicopter helicopter (HMX-1), the division responsible for helicopter management, the Military Office of the White House has ordered the presence of a helicopter in a private order, or “FRAGO”, only 36 hours before the helicopter landed in the Southern Lusk in the event of “ordinary” activities.
“I just wanted to assure you that you are in the course, because it is an unusually wide-ranging event in the press”, wrote commander HMX-1 in an e-mail to his chief, the first Deputy Chief of the Marine Corps Air Force, in advance of the event.
The letter indicated that the helicopter would arrive at the South Bank about 7 a.m. on 17 July to participate in an event scheduled for 3 p.m. and would remain there until the gas would be released between 6 and 9 p.m. on the same day.
The letter adds that if departure from the White House would be delayed, a second flight crew would be required in accordance with working hours limitations.
The first crew escorted the helicopter during the operation, and the security officers stayed close to the aircraft while it was on the ground.
It remained unclear whether the second team had been required to follow up on the reports received by the TIME magazine.
The Hatcha Act prohibits federal servants from using public property for political purposes.
According to the records, HMX-1 has clarified whether the action is contrary to that decision.
“We asked, among other things, whether it was a violation of Hatch’s law, and we were told that it was not,” the commander wrote.
"It seems that you are not going anywhere," answered the Deputy Chief.
The Delano event in America was announced by the White House as an official event, and the Hatcha law did not extend to it.
But even official activities have political notes.
During the course of the event, the President made efforts to promote the health reform that was then being developed in the Senate and commended efforts to regulate government decisions.
The use of aircraft known as Marine One and Air Force One for political purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
The Presidents are required to use them for travel.
But to invite them only for the sake of photography is unusual.
Tramp had already been discussed in February, when the Presidential aircraft had gone to the rear during his first election meeting in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account had been dropped by communications with complaints about the use of the President's aircraft by his predecessor.
“A white house in the dawn of the show “Sedlano in America”, where products from 50 states made by American workers from American materials were presented,” said the Deputy Press Secretary of the White House Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 crews often carry out training flights around Washington and the South Bank to train the transportation of the President of the United States to the White House, with accuracy to the inch.
When Tramp was in early July at the G-20 summit in Germany, HMX-1 conducted 58 training sessions at the White House.
According to one official, the flight carried out for the activities “Sdelano in America” was taken into account in the necessary training flights per month.
The unit's helicopters that day also flowd 11 additional hours under “unpresidential support tasks”.
According to the White House, the taxpayers were not charged for any of the other exhibits on the event.
The representative of Sikorsky reported that the company did not take part in the organization of the helicopter demonstration in the Southern Lujayka.
HMX-1 does not budget the presidential field, and it is difficult to determine the exact amount spent on the event.
However, according to the time rates of the Ministry of Defence for 2017, the rate of reimbursement of the Ministry of Defence for VH-3D is $24,380 per flight.
The unit records that the flight time in the air was 30 minutes on each side of its airport based on the Quantico Marine Air Force base in Virginia.
The White House argues that the actual value of using the helicopter is much lower than that rate.
“To calculate the value for taxpayers, based on the reference rate of reimbursement, is quite wrong,” Walters says.
“These exemplary rates include personal composition, maintenance and many other irreversible costs, which are included in annual appropriations”.
According to a study carried out in 2015 by the RED Corporation, reimbursement rates do not include the value of the personal composition, but indeed take into account the value of the fuel, service and costs specified in the contract.
At the time, the former White House Press Secretary, Sean Spyser, spoke for the protection of the use of the helicopter for the event.
"The idea is to show this week things done in America," Spaiser said.
“And I know that Sikorsky and Connecticut are very proud of their contribution to national security, and that there are hundreds, if not thousands of people whose jobs depend on it.
And I think like most Americans, we're all proud of this helicopter and other military technology, over which so many Americans have been constantly working.
It is therefore appropriate, of course, to draw attention to this.”
It was hard to see whether Tramp was working with a helicopter, watching the South Mouse during the event, but he was sitting right in the driving position in the fire car.
Within the White House, Tramp approached Sikorsky's representatives, with a press release on his own fleet of products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the President. "I have three of them."
Moscow will grant grants to city hospital rehabilitation offices
Every year, the Life Saving Grants will be awarded to the rehabilitation and offices of intensive hospital therapy.
The funds will be used to promote doctors and nurses.
Mary Moscow Sergei Sobianin visited the City Hospital, Judin.

The total area of the hospital is 23.7 ha.
In February of the current year, the medication was part of the pilot project to organize short-term accommodation stations (SCPs).
They are intended for relatively small operations.
In the surgery process, advanced medical equipment is used to significantly reduce patient rehabilitation.
After surgery at the station, they're only spending a few hours.
In the first half of the year alone, 36,000 patients were hospitalized in the hospital on behalf of Judin.
Medical staff carried out 15800 operations at different levels of complexity.
NBU reported the absence of buyers of the Ukrainian "daughter" Sberbanka
In Nazbank, Ukraine (NBU) reported that there were no applications for purchase of the Ukrainian "daughter" Sberbanka.
On Friday, 4 August, TAS reported on this subject with reference to the representative of the NGO press.
NBU confirms that on 3 August 2017, a package of documents from the citizen of Belarus and Cyprus, Victor Prokopani, to harmonize the acquisition of 100 per cent of the shares of Sberbanka, via Parjetbank.

On 28 July, it became known that Nazbank Ukraine had rejected Russian businessmen Sayid Guceriev and Gregory Guselinik in the acquisition of the Ukrainian "daughter" Sberbank.
The regulator justified its decision that businessmen had not provided the necessary documents to verify compliance with Ukraine ' s legislation.
Sberbank reported on the sale of its Ukrainian daughter to Norvik Banka consortium and a private Belarusian company in March of the current year.
The main shareholder of the consortium was Said Guceriev, son of Russian businessman Mikhail Guceriev.
The sanctions against five Russian banks in Ukraine, including Sberbank, were imposed in mid-March.
During the year, they were prohibited from withdrawing capital from the country for the benefit of parent organizations.

Democracy in Afghanistan depends on the role of women in politics, stated in the UN.
Elections may be representative only when all members of society, including women, have participated, said on Wednesday, the head of the United Nations mission in Afghanistan.
According to Nicolas Haysoma, the head of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, hundreds of women are embroiled in the provincial councils, three women are fighting for the Vice-President, and more than 30 per cent of newly registered voters are women.

In Venice, torture for tourists for abusive behaviour has been increased
The Venetian authorities have increased the charges for bathing in channels from 50 euros to 500 euros.
For walking around the city in the bathroom or with a heavy torso, the penalty will now be 200 euros.

Electricity is available both for the inhabitants and for the producers of Burratia
The efforts of the Soviet and post-Soviet authorities of the Republic of Burma (East Siberia) to establish fair tariffs for electricity consumers have started to bear fruit.
From 1 September to 25 per cent, the value of electricity is reduced in low voltage for industrial recipients.
The Federal Anti-Money Service of the country, in accordance with the Government of the Russian Federation ' s Decree on the Amendment to the General Market for Electricity and Power Regulation and the consolidated forecast balance of electricity production and supply (power) within the Russian Energy System for the Russian Federation' (from 17.07.2017 No. 842) has established indicative prices for electricity and power for industrial users in the Republic of Burma.
As a result, the value of electricity for bulk carriers is reduced by four, which will greatly facilitate the lives of small and medium-sized enterprises and individual entrepreneurs.
For decades, the leaders of the republics have challenged the thresholds of the Moscow Cabinets in a thorough attempt to compare the region in tariffs from the neighbouring Irkutsk area with the cascade of hydroelectric plants in Angara, from Baikal, the main water-supply territory for which Burratia is.
And only this year the movement began.
In March, electricity tariffs for the population decreased from 4.24 rubles/kWh to 3.93 rubles/kWh, or 7.3 per cent.
With the inclusion of the Burtiya by the Federal Government in the List of Valuable Areas of the Optical Market, for which the characteristics of the optical and differential markets are established are among industrial consumers.
In the opinion of analysts, this is only the beginning, as the population of the Irkutsk area pays for the kilowatt/hour of 1.01 rubula.
But no one dares to call it at least the approximate date of the new tariff movements towards the humiliation of Burratia.

National Trade Union of Unqualified, Municipal and Qualified Workers (GMB) is concerned about investment in the McVitie's plant in Glasgow
The trade union requires guarantees from the managers of the McVitie's bisque manufacturer in connection with his long-term production obligation at the Glasgo plant.
The Scottish GMB reports that the company has been silent about the future investment in the tolcross facility.
More than 500 people are working at the manufacturing plant, among other products, Hobnobs and Rich Tea.
Pladis, owner of McVitie's, reports that over the last few years, it has invested in more than 5 million pounds.
The company adds that in the case of any change in the work of the staff member and representatives of the trade union, “the first to know them”.
In a letter to the head of the company-owned facility, the Scottish GMB required McVitie's response to concern that funding would not be allowed to modernize production lines.
Senior organizer Drew Duffy said: “Our trade union members are deeply concerned that we cannot be clear from the head of the business and investment plan for the future of Tolcross”.
Families have worked here for generations, and the concentration of large workers in local society and in the territory of the Greater Glasgo; this is an essential pillar of decent work in the territory of high unemployment and social depreciation.
Thus, in terms of jobs, wages and prosperity, and in front of Brexit, the growth of the living minima and the chronic decline of production, East-End Glasgo desperately needs to flourish at McVitie's factory.
According to the representative of Pladis, “The Tulcrosian Manager only received a letter yesterday from the Scottish GMB office, and the company will respond immediately, as we appreciate our continued cooperation with staff and trade union representatives.”
Two months ago, we held a regular meeting in Tolcross with GMB staff and representatives, on which a number of issues were discussed openly.
We have talked to staff about how all companies working under the most competitive and unstable economic climate are constantly reviewing our actions – and this concerns all our facilities and activities – to remain competitive.
“In recent years we have invested over 5 million pounds in our tolcross facility, especially in production lines and improved functional indicators.”
We are fully aware of the value of Tolcross as a productive object, and in the event of any change in the object, staff members and trade union representatives will know about it first."
Putin stated that the authorities would not give instructions to Rosnefti and Gazprom
Vladimir Putin said that the issue of gas supplies to the Eastern Oil Chemical Company (WNHC) should be connected to Kremlin and the Cabinet of Ministers, but the Gazproma, as well as Rosnefti, would not be given to anyone.
Thus, Russia's President Vladimir Putin responded to Igori Sechin's request to contribute to the resolution of the conflicts.
The Head of State pointed out that the relationship between Rosneft and Gasprom should be determined solely on the basis of market principles.
Previous chapter of Rosnefti, Igori Sechin, at the meeting on major investment projects in the Far East Federal District, said that the lack of an agreement with Gasprom on gas for HNCC threatened the project.
The Council noted that dialogue with Gazprom on this issue was ongoing.
Gasprom proposes to find gas resources from the Rosnefti perimeter, but we don't have such resources," Sechin added.
Recall that Rosneft requested permission to use it for the "East Petroleum Company" gas from the Kirin village of Gazprom, located on the Shelf of Sahalin.
In June, Gazprom stated that negotiations on this issue continue and that there are no sharp angles there.
Did the Barcelona GSP warn of the transition of Niger three years ago?
The “La Ligi” participant may regret his interest in Marco Verratti
"Pari St. Germen" would not stop chasing Naaman after the club offered 189 million pounds for his ransom, but did they warn Barcelona about the world record of the three years ago?
The sensory proposal had survived a more summer transfer window, when Club League 1 was ready to defeat the world record of the transition, more than twice as much as the previous note related to the return of Pogba to Manchester United in the last 89 million pounds season.
When the transition is over, he will be the most expensive player in the world, as well as the most highly paid professional athlete in the world, since the GSP offers him more than 500,000 pounds a week.
It is well known that Barcelona and the anger of the proposal and how he broke the contract, despite the fact that, as a source near the Catalan club's leadership, the club has always done everything possible for the game since its transition from Santos in 2013.
But wasn't the football world a warning of this three years ago by the President of the GSP?
When Manchester City expressed interest in the rental of Blaza Matouidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Helaifi gave a keen warning to any club who wanted to change one of the best GSP players.
“I’m not worried because they know that if they touch one of our games, then we’ll fight them, we’ll offer their games to them,” Al-Helaifi said.
“We respect all clubs.
But if they try to deceive one of our players, they are waiting for the consequences.
In all, Barcelona crossed this line when the Spanish club expressed interest in the semi-defense of the PZJ Marco Verratti earlier this summer.
The GSPs understood that they would not release an Italian gathering game under any circumstances, and now perhaps Barcelona is experiencing the consequences of its proposal as a loss of one of its most valuable players, Nimara.

They've been talking about cleaning the lake.
Then the boys were shown in an open container next to the container that they had prepared for the divorce.
Putin let a couple of boys out of the bag first.
Then he went down for a special rickshaw on the cover of the container and released the others.
Also, during the trip, the leader ordered that the environment in Baikal be treated and that he build a road on the island of Olhon.
According to the Ministry, one volume is needed and the other volume is probably required.
