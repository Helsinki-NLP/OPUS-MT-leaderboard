I can't explain it to you.
He's afraid of a dog.
There was a lot of girls at the party.
I didn't even know you had a girlfriend.
How did you impress Tom?
What does he hate me for?
Enough to piss him off.
He knows her from high school.
Tom made it look like nothing happened.
I promised myself I'd quit smoking.
Stay here with them.
Avarya didn't deserve his life.
He cut off the bottle.
We're home.
You haven't returned those books yet?
I met him at the club.
I didn't agree.
Even if I knew, I wouldn't tell you.
I hope you won't take me back.
What are you so secretive about?
You're just running away from life's problems.
Out of the snow.
When did you see her?
I've been waiting three hours for you.
I missed the exam.
Eat while it's hot.
So three hours had to be spent.
What are you offering me?
Tom thinks Maria's an idiot.
I said wait for me.
I couldn't answer all the questions.
I didn't know you'd come, either.
Last week, I hit Tom in Boston.
Tom's beautiful.
Tom didn't know Mary liked to prepare.
I said 'cause you're busy.
Tom was surprised to see Mary in Boston.
You want the anecdote?
I wanted to do more.
Tom is our best pilot.
Are you sure you know what that means?
I can't just ignore him.
She travels to a bicycle school.
I'll pay now!
Would you like to sit down for the roll?
I've been busy all day yesterday.
They're the equals.
There was a coin under the table.
She's empty.
Help the window.
Don't think I didn't try.
You stay here.
Tom risked his life to save Mary.
The caravan of fifty camels was unraveling in the desert.
You must be ashamed of your ignorance.
I've changed Tom's place.
Tom went to the park alone.
You're a teacher, aren't you?
I'm not trying to convince you.
I knew Tom wouldn't lose.
Tom told Mary he wanted to drink.
Why are you smiling?
Tom didn't say how he was going to get there.
Didn't I tell you that I'm allergic to arachitis?
I know how old you are.
I'm not going to show it to anyone anymore.
Tom won't sell his house.
I didn't mean to upset Tom.
I'll teach you.
I have food.
He came to her.
I wouldn't do that.
Tom tried to drown Mary.
I decided to try again.
Tom won't let you win any more.
The cosmonauts are wearing claws.
Algeria is buying artillery weapons in Russia.
So, what happened?
I don't give you anything.
Why should Tom apologize?
The results were shocking.
In this room is empty.
Tom sent Mary a telegram.
Can you believe that?
We spent the night in the open sky.
Don't shut the door.
When are you free?
Didn't you have to do that on October 20th?
I have to go to work now.
Who is this woman?
I want to talk to you about this report.
When does it start?
Circumcision is one of five feelings.
What's wrong with you?
They're afraid of him.
Tom at work.
Tom's hiding something from us.
He didn't even touch him.
Have you made a name for a newborn yet?
I want you to help me with my homework.
I'm not a specialist.
I got cold from him.
I like Brazil, but I'm still going to Ukraine.
I've prepared for you tomorrow.
I didn't think you'd let me do that.
I see Tom almost every day after school.
The poor grave will correct.
Soup is so hot that it's impossible.
Why is she so popular?
They declared their innocence.
Where are you so badly hurt?
I don't think they're friends.
I made a deal with Tom.
I thought Tom and Mary were friends.
I was expecting good news from them.
Distilled water is tasteless.
Dad's in the garden now.
Harry's working a full day at the local supermarket.
It's unlikely I'll be late.
I told them to be in the traps.
Tom said he was totally tired.
I used to dream of being a millionaire.
I just wanted to say I'm sorry.
Tom's planning to break up with his girlfriend.
Where are you going tonight?
Tom closed the door in his bedroom.
I knew Tom only for a few months.
You're hopeless!
Tom plays very well on the script.
No one's accusing you.
The following year, Crolik.
Tom almost always takes a bath before dinner.
I can take you home.
What did you learn?
Please write down what I say.
Now I'm adding the last lines.
I can't forget Tom.
I don't have any books.
Tennis is the only kind of sport Tom has in his possession.
Come to the bone.
Let me help you.
I was very tired, so I fell asleep at the time.
Tom is my favorite singer.
Remember, I love you.
As they say, he's a killer.
Mary didn't want to give Halloween an open suit, so she decided to dress like a friendly woman.
Tom put the hat on.
Tom was waiting three hours.
Mary said she didn't want to drink.
You knew Tom better than I did.
Maybe people like us shouldn't have kids.
I won't be like that anymore.
Every morning I go shopping.
The baby's pushing.
Tom refused to sign the document.
Tom didn't even stop.
I don't want Tom driving anywhere without me.
I've been watching how you do it.
He has the potential for mathematics.
Watch out for the road strike.
He's a newlywed father.
Men were men then.
Swiss banks are very secretive.
Once you finish your mission, you can drink as much as you can.
I'm the only one who can help you.
I hate winter.
What do you think Tom will say when he finds out?
Christmas is coming.
You want us to do this together?
All our attempts have been made.
He poured himself another glass.
Please be careful, I'm going to go to the patient's hearing and make sure that you have the correctness of the procedure - you have to use it tomorrow.
Please, salt.
She spent all her money.
Tom slept in the barn.
You're looking at yourself.
Tom was tall for his age.
Did you notice what Mary had in her purse?
You're gonna be late for school again.
What's your favorite movie star?
That's why I didn't have to ask twice.
You have to come to Boston.
I was moved with joy.
She's rich, young and beautiful.
Do you love your country?
I rarely see you and Tom.
I'm pretty tall.
From a practical point of view, there are many shortcomings.
This is the house I live in.
I'm going to school with him.
You see, you don't agree.
Tom didn't kill Mary.
I don't know what I mean.
I went to Harvard.
You're like a runaway plastic.
I can't let him go alone.
It's Tom's window.
Jesus, by allowing his anger to enter the flock of pigs, demonstrated the difference between God’s Law on unclean animals.
I'm the captain.
I think we're gonna be okay.
We had to come.
I was wrong about that.
Today is my birthday.
We need to tell people what they need to do.
If she's not expensive, I'll buy her.
I said 'cause you got to do it.
She didn't miss it.
It was a good movie.
Are you crazy?
I'll never let you forget it.
Tom told me not to talk to you.
Who are you going to sell it to?
I don't want a divorce.
I grew up in Australia.
Tom gave him the will of anger.
The missing boy was known for his clothes.
I have good reflexes.
Tell me what it looked like.
She'll probably refuse to follow his advice because she doesn't like him.
Did you write it?
I know you're working on them.
I hope I can help you.
Does your parents know about this?
The officer put a white skater on the table.
That day I stayed home because there was rain.
Is there a pharmacy around here?
I read it.
Tell me where I can find her.
Why is Tom looking at me like that?
I called the police and told them my car was stolen.
We can discuss this later.
That helps a little bit.
The bones in ancient Egypt were sacred animals.
Can I speak in public?
I work for an oil company.
Why don't you find someone else who needs your help?
Tom applied to Mary's forehead a wet coat.
He hurt his left hand.
She's Italian?
We want to go.
The population of this city decreases annually.
Dan didn't want to show off.
Can't you tell me anything about yourself?
Did you find the difference between these two photos?
He never saw so many books collected in one place.
You look a little depressed.
Don't forget to call me.
It's a sheer language.
I would never do that.
Fix it, please.
You need to apply the ice pack to reduce the flow.
I could show you the city.
I know Tom's sick.
You didn't do anything wrong.
Take another stove.
I want to sleep!
You must be an idiot.
Tom in the park.
I didn't think you'd be here today.
"Who are you by nationality?" "Argentinians."
Why are you sad?
I can do a lot better than you.
Don't forget!
I really think so.
The sun is breaking.
Tom brought his room in order.
Did you file a complaint?
I don't like Tom very much.
That's why we're going to have to change our plans.
Someone tasted it.
You want to know something else?
Tom said he wanted to see us before we left.
But I don't have the money.
How's your new salary, Mary?
There was fear on his face.
If you don't tell her, I will.
Can you trust the secret?
My mother died in an accident.
London is the capital of England.
Her mother was a singer.
Can we call her?
I asked Tom to explain.
It's your fault.
Tom told everyone he was adopted.
Tom promised he wouldn't say anything.
Something's changed.
It's not the only key.
Ask Alex.
It's just money.
Take her somewhere.
I was just there when it happened.
Her origin is unknown.
Take it easy.
Tom's awake from deep sleep.
You're big.
Where did you see him?
I don't know why you want me to do it.
I hope I'll see him on Monday.
Are you sure you want to sell your father's guitar?
There's no girl on the Internet.
They'll find you.
I'm trying to figure out why that happened.
We'll send them an opening.
If you don't want to answer, you don't have to.
Look to the left and to the right, before crossing the road.
Tom was my friend, too.
I didn't know her then.
We've heard those promises before.
What did you and Tom do after dinner?
I'm not enough.
As is often the case today, Mike is late for the meeting.
Tom told me that Mary had a new boyfriend.
We won't let that happen.
These fools violated the law prohibiting the violation of the law.
It's not done yet.
John spoke so loud that I heard him on the second floor.
Tom checked his vision.
I didn't give it to him.
Strange sounds are coming.
I know you're rich.
Bill postponed a hundred dollars on his trip.
He served in the fleet.
Who taught you to dance?
Tom left his nose.
I wouldn't be surprised.
Seriously, I'm not.
You knew them better than I did.
None of us want this to happen.
How much more wine to buy?
I'm not going to cholera.
He sat in the car and left.
So tell me all about what happened here.
I'm looking for my phone.
He shared his soup with me.
All models are wrong, but some are useful.
I don't have time to do homework.
It's a big step forward.
Pray for me, Tom.
We still don't know the side effects of this medicine.
Tom's got a toothache for three days.
You seem to know everyone here.
Hope dies last.
That's the girl who came yesterday.
I'll give you a new one.
You said it was yours.
Where did he buy these boots?
Don't make me do it.
Why are you kidding me?
Tom usually goes to work on the bus.
Fadel went to school.
I've been working with Tom before.
Tom and I are partners on the team.
Leave him alone!
My heart beats more and more every time I see her.
I think so?
Everyone except Tom, the hats.
She gives him everything he asks.
Is that what you're selling?
I'm getting worse.
Do you have such a bigger one?
It's legal.
Do you like your name?
We can't afford to buy a new car.
This only adds to the problem.
Tom told me he saw Mary tonight.
Tom heard the sound of a snoop in the bathroom.
I called the door.
Tell him I'm sick.
They're already gone.
Can you take your car for a while?
You can't stay here all day.
I saw Jessie standing there.
They're very close.
You're wet.
There's a little sugar in the package.
That's what I did when I was a kid.
Something really good happened today.
What are you talking about?
Don't get involved in other things.
Who's in the blue football?
Tom's got an American accent.
I don't have the money to buy a word.
Why are you so surprised?
It's good to see you.
I want you to tell me everything.
She looks good for her age.
If I knew her address, I'd write her a letter.
She kept herself married.
We need to talk to them.
I'd like to talk to you.
Tom took care of it.
It's the third.
A lion's strength.
I had to make sure he was coming here.
She said she didn't know the rules.
Education is one of the most important aspects of life.
The boy fixed the lid.
Maybe we're going for a walk?
He's capable of math.
I'm glad you told me about her.
He's afraid of the basket.
I heard you're playing a good gang.
Did you read them?
I said 'cause I'm not gonna help him.
Tom's sorry he left Boston.
I don't like this store.
Tom's speaking more French.
I don't remember how much I paid for it.
You won't eat with us?
Tom lives in Australia with his wife and three children.
I could barely sit on the train.
I don't like to argue.
Do you like science fiction movies?
I'll make her happy.
Just tell him I called.
I don't want to get up.
His home after the Holm.
It was a resurrection, and I did not get up early.
How much lunch!
Mary, are you in a good shape now?
I made a mistake.
You want me to call them?
Tom's done 20 shots.
I'm sure you can handle the job.
After Mary gave birth, she poured a bottle of wine through him and took a hard step out of the restaurant, a dead silence grew.
You're young Tom for two years.
We've met them.
Tom's gonna be fine tomorrow.
Tom wanted to talk to Mary on his own.
You don't mind, do you?
I think you'll need a loan.
Tom's father, in prison, never writes that.
It's expensive.
I haven't heard from him in a hundred years.
I didn't know Tom couldn't swim.
I thought we all had a long time to meet.
Everyone's interested in Japan.
Tom's getting out of here very easily.
Please, just do everything like me.
Stay there.
I disagree with him.
That's what it's called success.
It was so dark in the room that I had to go through a hole.
How many aircraft in the U.S. Army?
She's your teacher?
Get back together, Tom.
What are you hiding from me?
Tom understands he doesn't need it anymore.
Tom was in the garden.
Young plants are placed in a green forest.
I have French.
If that sounds too good to be true, it's probably not true.
Leave it where he found it.
Tom had to tell Mary.
Why is everyone looking at me?
Tom kissed Mary yesterday.
I'm not afraid of him.
I'm very proud of my father.
I told you it would work.
It all seems so strange.
Tom decided to go.
You taught me a lot.
How long are you sleeping?
Bring in the moustache.
Tom apologized to the audience.
Tell Mary I have her keys.
Did you have any candles?
Canada is a hockey family on ice.
The brain is a very complex organ.
They'd agree.
Your Japanese good.
We're going through a window.
The spiders are disgusting little creatures.
I want to know where it is.
Kiss with no ears like a soup with no salt.
Did you try to talk to him?
Where are the others locked up?
So much has happened today.
I saw the car hit a man.
We accepted their invitation.
Tom worked with Mary.
I'm tired of dying.
You know what your kids are doing now?
You want her to stay?
He misses her.
Tell me, please, I'm right.
We saw the castle in front of us.
Tom kept stabbing her.
Six goes before the family.
I was going to my grandfather's grave today.
Tom couldn't believe someone was trying to kill him.
Tom didn't dance with Mary.
I saw a man who ate from a shitty grandmother yesterday.
I think Tom cheated on me.
She took me under her wing.
Tom and Maria stopped laughing when they noticed John crying.
I have to meet Tom.
Tom lost his thumb.
Did you sign the contract?
I said 'cause he needs to talk to a lawyer.
They're not on that bus again?
Let Tom go home.
I'm not hungry either.
He's got a lot of partners.
This area has changed completely.
Tom is anti-Semitic.
What is your most powerful side?
Tom doesn't like it when it's pushed.
Interestingly, when Angelica Agurbash sang a song on the words of Necliev, could she imagine that he was going to join the president?
There's a yogurt in the fridge.
Can you tell us what's going on?
Tom's always being honest.
Foma must be there by two thirty.
Show me Boston on the map.
Tom said he'd be extremely exhausted.
Tom wasn't in his room?
Why aren't you looking for him?
They survived, even though the building was destroyed.
I don't want anything better.
Tom wants a popcorn.
My favorite restaurant burned.
John's not careful, he's making a lot of mistakes.
Tom took Mary's interview.
Tom is my personal assistant.
Who's this guy?
Keep the kids away from the mud.
Let's talk about it tonight.
I have to do it.
They don't know French.
Let's get out of here!
I knew what the Jacksons were doing.
You don't have to apologize to me.
Tom and Mary have one granddaughter and three grandkids.
He wants the peanut butter.
That's how it works.
Tom starts drinking less.
I barely saw him.
He ran away from the shelters.
You can live in a big house, and you don't even feel like an egg.
I expect Tom to tell me what to do.
I'll see him tonight.
One plus one is two.
Red better.
The universe is endless.
I'm not ready to do this yet.
Thank you for your visit.
What did you mean?
I wanted to spend more time with you.
Can you tell me about Tom?
Can I have Tom for a few words?
Don't make a noise like that.
When was Tom arrested?
We're going to six.
The olive was a victim of the lion.
Tom didn't want to go.
Tom's a little younger than your daughter.
I did everything I could to save Tom.
Try to get her to help us.
Are you with us?
I'm sorry to bother you.
Tom's alive.
It may well be ten years of water, but it will not be a crocodile.
Tom saw that he didn't understand that Mary was trying to tell him.
I saw how it happened.
I don't think there can be any other reason than that.
I'm very happy now.
My apartment was robbed last week.
How do you always get to be so energetic?
Put your signature here.
What an ego!
So you bought it?
The man's as old as he feels, and the woman's as old as she looks.
Wisdom comes with age.
Remember what you told me?
There's been a lot of snow in the last year.
He was trying to cross the river.
Everything seems to be nice.
Tom told Mary to tell the truth.
You don't want a daughter yet?
I like to dance along the river.
You can come with me.
This speech is a great gift for us.
"How much before dinner?" "Five minutes."
Tell her.
Mary spent all her time at work.
Tom sat on his motorcycle and took him away.
Have you ever been to Scandinavia?
Can I open my eyes?
I don't want to play cards.
I want to keep working here.
I live in Latvia.
I've been waiting for him until ten.
Tom usually says the first thing in his head.
Why do you want to leave?
How's it going to be more French until we meet?
It wasn't worth it.
What do you have with the computer?
We were both busy.
I'm fine.
We're not going to let you go.
Do you really think Tom can swim?
How are you going to spend so much money?
Mary likes to hang out with bad guys.
It is often said that the world will disappear in one language each week.
She has a little advantage.
I thought we talked about it.
I wish my parents were upset if I had failed.
I feed the basket every morning and every evening.
Hold your tongue, you won't get it.
You must take into account all the consequences before making any changes to the existing code.
I can't taste, I don't have teeth.
I think you did great.
Last night, we had a lot of rain.
What did Tom bring?
That's exactly what I was looking for.
Tom noticed that the door was open.
That's when I hurt my granddaughter.
Tell me more about him.
What choice did I have?
You should stay upstairs.
Come back home early, Bill.
She sat on the table and read the magazine.
Since then, crying has been prohibited.
If I knew that, I'd tell you.
Here's the house where he lived.
I'm not talking to you, I'm talking to the bees.
Is there my chocolate? Don't even think!!!
Beautiful in white, the house seems more.
I've had trouble looking for an original quote.
I had no idea you knew her.
What's the point of doing this?
Which dog is yours?
You have to give it more time.
You didn't tell me what Tom said in French.
Tom is returning to Boston next week.
Why don't you help me?
I watched a movie in French with English subtitles.
I'll eat.
In my opinion, Tom played well.
He only blames others, and he never does.
Can you play the gang?
Tom came to Mary and hugged her.
"When will you come back?" "It's up to the weather."
How many turtles do they live?
How safe is that?
Your message has been received.
It took me three years to complete my house.
I was upset.
Don't talk to your mother like that.
We'll see if we can do that.
Tom didn't want us to attend his party.
I just realized what was going on.
She said she'd be late.
Your parents still live in Germany?
I need her today.
Tom's probably winning.
What do you want Dad Moroz to bring you?
Why doesn't Tom want to see me?
Where's your spirit of adventurer?
What are you mad at me for?
You can leave if you want.
I see you've already met.
Something tells me you're right.
It's not my cat.
The captain ordered his men to shoot.
Sit down there.
He hasn't done this yet.
Tom became a father.
Tom's been asked about my daughter.
I'm not going to school tomorrow.
It's hard to be a woman, to think like a man, to act like a lady, to look like a girl and to work like a horse.
Let me talk to her first.
I tried to convince her, but I failed.
I thought you were a Canadian.
Why are you sitting on my chair?
Sounds simple.
I can't afford to buy it.
I've never seen you in the closet.
Put it on the pole.
I thought you found someone else.
There is always a large number of vehicles on this road.
You lied to us all.
I don't think Tom has a brother or a sister.
He must love you.
To pretend foolishly that you make me believe that I believe what you do not believe!
I think it would be a big mistake.
Tom and Mary have a son.
I was mistaken.
I appreciate your support.
You think that's possible?
In the end, he's sick of everything.
You think Tom's locked up?
If that's true, she's better than me.
I'll take good care of Tom.
Tom, it looks like he didn't recognize you.
I refuse to help that.
Can I sit with her?
Leave him alone.
Are you reading anything other than the Bible?
Read me the accountant's testimony in the cat.
What does this gentleman do for a living?
Why do you think that's why you like it?
Does your parents know about this?
Is that what they're talking about?
Tom's waiting for you at the conference room.
The main thing in Tatoebe is not to say thoughts above the stomach and below the knees.
He paid him four dollars.
I had to cancel my trip because of the strike.
I don't know your name.
How many trains are coming to Boston?
What words of this song?
Mary likes to hate her brother.
The law on my side.
So we had to find where he lived.
Tom was with Mary all morning.
The publication of the article was adjourned to the day of the professor's birth.
Your phone called a couple of times while you were in the soul.
She went out for him because of the money.
No bird can sing.
I bought him a magazine.
I don't think Tom hates you.
Tom doesn't respect them.
It's just superstition.
Tom has to make his own decisions.
Count, please.
Your shoes should always be clean.
You'll have your birthday soon.
Count it.
I don't like those boots.
Tom had been married to Mary for a long time.
It's just a picture I jumped on the Internet.
I think that's why less than thirty.
Have you had a drink?
Of course, he is best suited for this work.
You're making it easier for me to work.
Tom said he saw Mary do it.
Tom can't just leave.
I'm in love.
You don't seem to be very busy.
Delleen's gone.
You look a lot like me.
Do you know those men?
Tom left the room, didn't tell anyone a word.
This probably didn't happen.
Have you finished the chain yet?
Tom and Mary talked for no less than an hour.
I want you to stay with us.
He tried to save her.
If you press this button, the door will open.
How much do you need?
I'm back to help you.
Tell me more about them.
Have you heard the last of your hearing?
I'd show you how it's done.
I asked Tom to come.
You've got a steak.
My mother taught me not to waste money.
We could go through the front.
She ended up yesterday in the middle of the afternoon.
I can't raise our daughter alone.
He took my place.
I wanted to talk about it.
I screamed for help.
Can you explain your answer?
I know what matters to you.
They all knew her.
We better stop.
I'm not gonna be late anymore.
I'm so hungry.
I live pretty close to you.
Tom's stalking the horses.
Why wouldn't Tom agree with you?
I have to go back to Australia.
Usually people die if they kill them.
They've disconnected Tom from the life insurance system.
I didn't know what I was talking about.
I'm sorry about my French.
What did I do now?
Tom and Mary are very common.
Tom wants to go to the beach.
They won't let me go.
They wouldn't tell me the truth.
We always tell each other.
I've never been satisfied.
Tom's twice as young as you.
Tom's closing the roof.
I'll marry a lawyer.
Another interesting source of energy is heat that can be obtained from radioactive waste.
He's smarter than me.
Why did you first say that?
Your grandmother is a charming lady.
He wouldn't dare do that.
A 12-hour trip has made me nervous.
The baby woke up in the middle of the night.
I said I was tired.
Who's the boss of this company?
No one saw us do that.
He came back two days later.
Tom was in the morning.
We should be home soon.
When did you move to Boston?
I know that Tom and Mary have been asked.
Eda!
So you helped wash the window?
It's out of my jurisdiction.
It was yesterday.
I'm starting to love myself.
Who wants to be your son when he grows up?
I'm still here.
Don't tell me what really happened.
I'm not just gonna give you that.
What are you gonna say?
Did you talk about your hobby?
Get down here.
Why can't I see her?
I showed my friends these openings.
Tom didn't realize he made a mistake.
I threw the ball.
I'm a singer.
Tom apologized to us.
He read this book yesterday.
Where did Tom find this picture?
Tom gave me both money and advice.
What do you want to hear from me?
Please open the door.
Tom said he doesn't want to sleep yet.
She married him at the age of 20.
I can't give this word to anyone.
Give me that box.
They say his father died in a foreign country.
Take mine.

Your children know French?
Tom yelled and ran out of the room.
This soup is a fish.
There's a lot of girls in the room.
He's talking too much about her.
She put a lot of sugar in the coffee.
You didn't know I was teaching French in Boston before?
Tom was very surprised.
They were trying to make time.
I've already discussed this with Tom.
Jesus Christ, who lived among people, spoke in a horrible way, from the Jewish perspective, the Galileo dialect of Aramaic rather than Irritated, thus showing the incompatibility of allegations of the existence of any sacred language that is particularly close to God in prayer.
Tom's changed his mind.
My opinion is slightly different from yours.
Tell her I don't want to go.
So they paid three hundred dollars for it.
You don't know all the facts.
I know what Tom's doing.
Don't miss the weather forecast.
Tom obviously doesn't know anyone.
I'll ask Tom to get you something to eat.
I'll go find Tom.
I don't have any more books.
I want you to read this book.
Tom didn't wear a tie.
That's my answer!
I heard him sing in the soul.
You remind me of my young man.
Tonight, Tom's on his trip.
I'm always busy.
I'm playing for the piano a little bit.
I thought you were a ghost.
Tom got up fast.
Please tell everyone I'm sorry.
Tom told me to stay in my room.
It's important.

The good idea came to her head at the last minute.
In this room, there's a lot of air.
Why aren't you in the sweater today?
Pound is a weight unit.
I wouldn't talk to him in your place anymore.
Japan needs a lot of papers.
It's very difficult.

And I'm so glad to meet you.
Thank you for sharing your thoughts.
I can't help it.
Is that my book?
The strike is routine work.
Who else do you have on the list?
So don't give me my phone.

I'd like to know what to tell them.
Tom's kids must miss him.
I thought Tom was wrong.
I think you should talk to them.
He's reading physics in Oxford.
He's been hiding this fact from me.
Did you save me?
He's got a big fever in his sleep.

Someone said something, but I didn't get it.
Someone needs to talk to him.
I've never been worried about them.
Tom was able to get to the hospital on his own.
I was sitting next to Tom.

It's not God who knows what science is.
Tom suspected that Mary was using drugs.
Promise me you won't tell her.
Maybe you shouldn't talk to her.

Where do you want to go next exit?
How wonderful is that?
I'm tired.
Tom wasn't acting with Mary.
Get out of my office.
This car's a good sale.
I need to work on these exits.
You can't do that to us.
His words made me sad.
I know what happened.
When can we start?
I know that's why I had to.
Give her a hi.
Was that a lie?

Tom looks good.
Did you kiss Tom in answer?
It's time for me to go.

The church's located on the hill, it's a beautiful sight.
The goats don't like to drown and find shelter faster than sheep and other domestic cats.
He told me he needed more time.
Tom died two years ago in a plane crash.
My older brother, Tom, was born here in Boston.
I thought you hated him.
"Now leave X-Wing, Your Majesty." "Don't go out, I'm going to space." "As it is written, you are a goat!"
I felt the smell of food long before I got home.
My father put the mailbox in the red.
A lot of people ignore laughter.
In addition to Tom, everyone in the family speaks more French.
I'm not that young to know.
Don't pay attention to them.
I know you don't like me.
The police found Tom dead on the wing.
I'm not as happy as you are.
I did everything you asked me to do.
Are you planning on buying a house?
On the table of the cat.
Tom says he doesn't want to go with me to Australia.
He came, he saw, he won.
Life is not always just.
I saw Tom take your keys.
The whole night was exported because of Tom and Mary's dragons.
Can you read it?
We need more farmers.
Tell us more about your trip.
Six degrees below zero.
I don't expect you to believe that.
We've seen a lot of unusual plants in the botanical garden.
Sometimes a small gift can be a manifestation of great love.
Are you a blonde or a brunette?
I didn't get on the bus.
That's why I didn't like the movie.
You want us to help you?
Be realistic.
Tom planned to set up a party.
I'll call someone for help.
Why didn't you tell us about it before?
Is it Chinese or Japanese?
Fire.
I'm making a success.
You're pale as a ghost.
I'll be home by six.
The French isn't that complicated.
Let's get out of the cab.
He was sitting.
Tom never missed school.
I suggest you do it today.
I'm not going to marry her.
Tom's drinking apple juice.
Are you going on a trip?
That's what we think.
How could something like that happen?
You're actresses.
Tom was mentally ill.
I forgot to ask.
I've always had my hands and feet cold.
How can I translate words that are not in any language other than mine?
Could you tie that tape?
I'll go home.
She always keeps her room clean.
I hate people like Tom.
I asked Tom to wait for us.
We're stuck in a hole.
Tom is very angry with me.
I used to shave my head once a week.
Eleven is a simple number.
I'm not going to give you back.
Coffee for me.
We're husband and wife.
Jacksons invited us to dinner tonight.
Tom was impartial.
In October, the leaves begin to fall.
Melanie said she liked to swim.
What's bothering you?
Now I'm too busy to talk to you.
The captain is running his ship and command.
Tom says he wants to be buried here.
Where do you share the distortion?
Three of the prisoners escaped.
Thank God!
You think Tom knows?
This time, I'm crying.
Tom was acting like a kid.
Stop singing.
There were only six people at the party.
What did you decide?
I didn't know you were romantic.
I saw you spying on Tom.
I need you to do this right away.
The kidnapper walked into the house through that door.
I know how to survive.
Mary worked most of her life.
Mary's boyfriend's name is Tom.
I'm afraid I have something to admit to.
It was expected that Tom would be there yesterday.
Tom was an important man.
I want you to stay with me.
He's in the hospital.
Don't forget to sign up.
You'll be safe there.
I'm in Tehran.
"Do you speak Greek?" "Not yet, this is my first lesson!"
Why did you give him the money?
Tom bought something for Mary?
You went to Boston last week?
I didn't play tennis yesterday.
Let me do it again.
We must respect their wishes.
How did you get her?
I was already in Sapporo.
I told you to get out of here.
We'll try for all the power.
Would you have bought that?
Tom's gonna be late for the plane.
She's always getting up early.
You want her to help you?
You eat rice every day?
We were sitting in the deepest auditorium.
You'll survive.
What did she buy in that store?
When will the president have a woman?
He's here to see you.
I'm glad Tom did it.
I'd buy it.
Have you ever seen this movie?
I know what you did last night.
The bus stop is not far from our school.
It's the oven I made for you.
England looks like Japan in many ways.
Tom would never do that.
I suggest you try harder.
This dog doesn't scare the baby.
Don't resist.
Tom has the keys.
When I have a bad mood, I like to think about the mountains to get rid of them.
How would you feel if someone did that to you?
We both really want to sleep.
Tom just can't do everything he wants.
Tom often tells us anecdotes.
Luke can be used in many rituals.
There's almost no snow here.
I asked Tom to help us.
She hit a mole in the tree.
You speak English?
My brother's gonna kill me.
I opened my purse.
Tom can stay with me.
Is it difficult to learn Greek?
Tom's coming with you?
Where's the remote control?
I can't find her either.
You're talking more Swedish.
Have you seen anyone else?
Tell me why you're here.
Don't put the tube on.
Tell him not to look in the eye.
We looked in the window, but we didn't see anything.
You want to work with them?
The movie was interesting.
I'm working from tomorrow to dinner.
How long are we leaving?
It's a bribe.
Tom's very emotional.
Why are you avoiding me?
What about Tom?
I hope you don't mind.
He's been shot in the bird.
Tom will leave on Monday.
Oh, you!
I need to move on.
She burned her nose to the glass.
The English language does not differ in terms of ser and ser.
I know exactly what to do.
He's very secretive.
You have excellent English.
Do I have any messages?
Tom didn't want to cry.
How much time do you have?
Writing a text message, driving a car, is very dangerous.
Tom said Mary agreed.
Tom said Mary won't win.
Why'd you take off your beard?
I want to go back to this house.
How much lunch do you have?
The black villa was broken.
Why don't you go and kill yourself?
Tom spoke first.
Did you ask Fume to stop?
You swore you loved me.
I don't want Tom to think he should explain it to me.
I was very calm.
Everybody's got something to hide.
We'll have a few guests tonight.
Her voice will still ring in my ears.
Tom wanted to ask you some questions.
It's time to heal.
Why do you always take his side?
We weren't cold.
I saw it on the roof of the basket.
All men are the same.
Are you hot?
His son is a genius.
Don't let that happen.
Why don't we have dinner tonight at the restaurant?
Some birds didn't fly.
What else do you want from me?
What did Tom ask you about?
I said 'cause you came to Australia.
Did you want that?
Didn't you tell me you had a brother?
Where am I waiting for you?
I was really worried about you.
What did you find?
Can you explain that to me?
We were hit by a snowstorm.
The book is on the table.
I don't want any of them.
What are we gonna lose?
You'd better ask him first.
He was fired against his wishes.
Take them to the hospital.
Tom told you where he bought his pipe?
She didn't answer his letter.
I hired someone today.
Stop kicking the ass!
Tom would like us to stay.
I'm on the ladder.
It's the biggest car in the world.
Tom's almost never asking why.
I have to get back to work.
Tom told me Mary didn't do that.
Tom gave Mary all the money he had.
Where do you usually buy clothes?
I already did.
What's the weather?
I sent her a message.
You owe me three hundred dollars.
I wanted to stop him.
I loved him so much.
You're not gonna introduce me?
We can't tell her.
I want you to know that I'll always love you.
She said she was ready to do it.
She cried.
I said because Mary had to do it.
You're both idiots.
You like to live in the city?
How long have you been up to this time?
We finally have everything we need.
I wasn't busy last week.
I'm the leader of Tom.
Who are you planning to go to Australia with?
Someone shouted.
What's better?
We thank you for your help.
Go to your room!
I didn't say that 'cause he was leaving.
What do your parents want for Christmas?
The train is sent to three-thirds.
I know you're hiding something.
Release the beast from the cell.
He's afraid of the basket.
You look like a father.
George's five years older than me.
Give me a cigarette.
Do as you've been told.
Please take a look at this movie.
Someone's calling.
I ran away.
Why aren't you ready?
I can't fall in love with your new car.
You shouldn't have done that.
You're way above Tom.
You can use his library.
I congratulated him on his son's birth.
Mary says she needs more time.
Fooma's gone from the door.
My father is an English teacher.
Tom and Mary gave their grandson a bicycle.
Hold on to the pearl.
Did you do that?
I'd like you to translate it into French.
How many bottles on the table?
The lawyer has convincing evidence that she is innocent.
Maybe.
I don't like Tom anymore.
Who's Tom with?
Tara has a strong sense of responsibility.
We both saw him.
We have to help.
Tom just got out of prison.
Did you tell me that?
Me!
Tell me you saw it.
I think I found what you're looking for.
Let your uncle think about it.
I fired her.
We need to know what Tom looks like.
I've come up with a good plan.
I didn't know you had a cat.
I know you'd do the same for me.
I can't believe Tom did all this.
I don't want to hear your theories.
Tom already told me what I wanted to know.
Only in philosophy can be used as evidence and appreciated.
I can't afford to have children.
When I spoke to them in French in Paris, they only laughed at me, and I couldn't make them understand their own language.
Am I leaving?
I was so stupid that I believed in it.
She really did.
I think it's very expensive.
I'll open it.
My mother must be angry.
White bread, please.
It's sweet.
Tom's ill.
I think Tom's still out of work.
We're going to be ideally approached by each other.
French is complicated, isn't it?
He doesn't like fish.
The danger has gone away.
We need more wood.
Tom said Mary was upset.
Let me know if you need any help.
We have to get there before he does.
He must miss her.
He says he's not sick.
Paris away?
How much time is Tokyo now?
He said he was hoping to see you.
Tom and I did what we were told.
Frieda Calo was a Mexican artist.
No one knew why.
Jim won't be here today.
You'll be a father, you'll get it.
Last Monday, I saw you and Tom.
Where did you take off your shoes?
We went to the beach.
What do you think, this year, it's snowing for Christmas?
How was Tom's party?
I need to go to the bathroom.
I owe it to one of my friends in the palace.
I'll work for you as long as you pay me as well.
I'd like to have a cup of coffee.
No one asked him.
I haven't seen Elizabeth in a while.
You're the only one who likes Tom here.
I know what Tom would do.
You won't have a second chance.
Tom immediately agreed to pay the ransom.
All accounts have to pay for me.
She got caught.
Tom said he was looking for you.
We're not as rich as Tom.
Tom taps Mary's hair.
Tom didn't show me happiness.
When I grow up, I want to be burned.
Tom's been dry with his mother regularly.
We forgot to write it down!
Tom said he likes it here.
No, I'm not tired.
She's the most lazy of those I know.
Mary's already gone to her room?
This time I forgive him.
I like Chinese food very much.
It's just what you think.
Tom wasn't a good coach.
He's a vigilante.
Alvaro from Venezuela, he's a Venezuelan.
That's it.
He insulted me in public.
Tom won't win again.
Why don't I stay with you?
Induction plates are used for direct heating of castrel and coarse wires.
I cried.
Tom wants to learn to play the trombone.
Get out right away.
May I take a look at your rights?
I'll take you 1,000 peas for the replacement of the mill on these gins.
How well do you know them?
Why did you ask Tom to leave?
You're too young to get married.
He forgot the sweater.
Tom lives in Australia.
I didn't know exactly what to start with.
It's a memory!
Only love can break your heart.
I have two tickets to the concert.
I had to go to Australia with you.
Tom's out of his ass.
He dictated a few letters from his secretary.
Why do you want to come with me?
Why are you in the pajamas?
How much is that worth?
I've never seen him so busy.
He likes to hang around the garden.
It weighs about a hundred and eighty grams.
I had to leave a note.
You Canadian?
You're stronger, Tom.
I'm waiting for Tom from half a third.
He likes it that way.
Tom knew Mary was unhappy.
Tom and Mary are doing this together.
Did anyone else notice that?
This proposal is not in English.
I think Tom's good.
She played the sonata.
You can write in any language you want. All languages are equal in Tatoeba.
The infection went into the blood.
Tom didn't want to buy Mary a present.
Does he know me?
I hate this place.
You'll ever thank me.
Tom's watching TV sometimes.
Am I ready?
I was waiting for you.
I still have a bad image.
Run, you bastard!
I saw a terrible dream last night.
The network is huge.
You got me!
In my view, we should pay more attention to the current situation.
I know what you told her.
I fell asleep only after two hours of night.
Mary had no desire.
So it was not as hard to sleep as he thought.
I don't like it.
I was trying to wake Tom up.
They say it's very interesting.
Do something about it, please.
As you know, we're late for heavy rain.
She's healthy, by the way.
Tom was in a broken hat.
Watch out for a brother.
Tom said he wasn't gonna wait for permission.
It's time to finish.
Have you eaten yet?
I love the bitter peach.
How much time do you normally get up on Saturday?
I added milk to my coffee.
How can I change that?
Spain took the 1992 Olympics.
I never betrayed you.
We used to do this together.
My house is not far from here.
I don't care about money.
There are no invincibles.
Tom's winning.
I don't understand what you're saying.
I know Tom can draw.
They're stuck.
I didn't know it would be impossible.
Are you having fun?
A man was sentenced to death.
Was it snow yesterday?
You scared her.
You don't get Tom.
Did you kill her?
Does Tom know French?
He studied Russian when he was young.
Put it back.
Tom and Mary almost one year old.
I was impressed.
You're not going to the council.
We didn't discuss it.
Tom poured Mary a cup of tea.
Tom couldn't understand why no one else wanted to go to the zoo.
That was convincing.
Tom shot Mary for self-defense.
What is the difference between faith and trust?
Tom put the paper on the table.
What did you know?
If the weather allows, tomorrow we'll get to the top of the mountain.
We're both familiar with him.
How's your wife?
I'm trying to solve the problem.
I could go to Boston with Tom, but I didn't want to.
Tom read an ancient manuscript.
The ancient Egyptians believed that the sun was the eye of the god Ra.
Did Tom see that?
The more I thought about the problem, the more difficult it was.
His gray eyes shined and were hidden, and his pale face was usually brought back to life and covered with a Roman.
What kind of pizza do you like most?
Tom was standing in front of Mary.
Take another one.
I'm looking for my passport.
His hands are cold.
You want to be famous?
Do it carefully.
I find it difficult to solve this problem.
Tyfun destroyed a lot of houses.
This man was doomed to death.
Call me as soon as you meet him.
Is there anyone here who can speak French?
I think Tom's still living in Boston.
Let me take your luggage.
Besides, I can't dance.
I can't wait to see you.
Why are you in my shoes?
The power in Tom's hands.
I've learned to do and play like my Japanese friends.
What are you looking at me for?
Nobody's gonna blame you.
I'm not busy right now.
Children like playing more than learning.
He was accepted by his younger brother.
What doesn't kill us makes us stronger.
Everyone tells me I look like my father.
Think of what language I speak.
Tom thinks Mary's in Australia.
My guy's a journalist.
Why are you calling?
I don't like people who insist on political talks.
Is it red or white?
We're not afraid.
A few days later, Tom found another job.
Tom moved to Australia.
I'm going!
Do it until it's dark.
I didn't expect to see you again.
Tom's not used to this kind of work.
Bring your wife.
What, are you suddenly in a fashion?
Tom said he wouldn't want to spend so much time on it.
You're upset.
Our granddaughter was born last night.
Tom's suit is a pirate.
It's pure truth!
We're going for a granddaughter.
What are these people doing?
I did everything I could.
Tom couldn't remember exactly what Mary said.
It's my passion.
Why didn't they ask me?
Tom must be here in 15 minutes.
Tom hopes that Mary knows she shouldn't do what John told her to do.
I don't drink wine anymore.
I'll take care of you.
We are proud of our achievements.
That's why Mary had to be invited.
Tom had to be punished.
You're adorable?
Tom ate all the bread I bought yesterday.
She's his sister, not a girl.
I'm not sure I understand you.
Schools and universities are closed.
I'll follow every day.
She became a postman.
Don't leave me here alone.
I need to know everything.
We need a cab.
Stop beating the cat!
What are you going to say?
I didn't attack them.
What kind of crime have you committed?
How do we know this man is the one he spends on?
King Harald Hormsson, known as Harald Sinezubius, embraced Christianity in Denmark.
We can't do anything for you.
You were an honest politician.
Why don't you like him?
I'm in Russia.
He was careful.
That's what Tom could stay further.
Almost all of them were dead.
You have to get up early.
Nothing bad happened.
The last few days have been very bitter.
He's wearing a black coat.
I forgot to eat flowers.
I asked Tom to tell me what he wanted.
Then Tom never saw Mary.
You can't be in this room.
Did you have any other plans?
Who can blame you?
Can we call him now?
Tom is very gifted and talented.
I'd like to talk to her again.
Mary said she liked the idea.
Tom bribed Mary?
Tom likes to read German Gess.
In fact, I've never spoken more Portuguese.
When criminal cases are brought before a court, it is generally assumed that there are twelve persons in the court of the jury.
What exactly did Tom do at the Australia Embassy?
Tom and I are getting together.
The boys marched four in a row.
Tom was very disappointed.
I didn't know Tom was waiting for me.
This fruit is very acidic.
Tom left Mary.
Tom realized something was wrong.
We had no idea what Tom was going to do.
That's another day.
You have to do this right now.
I have to go to X-ray tomorrow.
His bag was badly damaged.
He got hurt when he fell.
We're impartial.
I've got mosquito bites all over my hand.
Tom, come on, we're gonna be late.
I'm sure Tom doesn't think so.
I don't want to know who kissed you.
Are you following your weight?
Tom's playing trombones.
Are you from Tokyo?
I want her not to be in my house.
You probably can't do that.
I'm sorry I doubted you.
McDonalds is known worldwide for his hamburgers.
Tom made Mary a precious gift.
Do you have any idea?
Do you like these spirits?
The castle is broken.
Almaz is a precious stone.
Get some heat, Tom.
I don't want to talk to him anymore.
I have three French-English words.
Drop it, Sergeant.
No one can do that.
Tom promised to join us in Boston.
To my surprise, he married a very beautiful actress.
How'd it go?
I've got a few minutes left.
Tom wanted to surprise Maria.
They want the best.
Tom works as an officer.
It's gonna be cold tonight.
She says she'll wait for us.
Why do so many suffer from self - esteem?
Was that too simple?
It was a loud noise, so sharp, to break down her drums, and so loud, to reach heaven.
I lost him in the crowd.
We talked about Jim when he went into the room.
We can't just sit here and do nothing.
I know you don't know who I am.
Tom decided to leave his job.
That's why you can't go there.
Tom helped Mary get things in the car.
You're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.
I know what I did was wrong.
Many books are published each year.
Tom was reluctant to give Mary the money she asked for.
What do you hate her for?
My steering machine's broken.
You're from Boston, right?
We need to hire him.
I've been trying hard to solve the problem.
You should have done homework.
I spoke on the phone.
I don't think Tom and Mary are married.
They're right behind you.
This rock was so heavy that I couldn't lift it.
Why doesn't Tom ask?
It'll open and respond.
We took the canoe.
Have you ever tasted a banana pie?
The girl who gave me beautiful flowers is your sister.
Isn't Tom remarkable?
He's your teacher?
The rich sometimes look at the poor.
I know what Tom's afraid of.
I don't know where Tom bought his zone.
How can we explain this to our children?
I didn't even know your names.
The bee went to the tree.
The language I'm learning is very difficult.
Your child can walk.
Is that all Tom's doing?
I'd rather not marry her.
You know we owe him a lot.
You know I'm getting married.
Are you a living person?
I told you I'd be back.
Tom's my youngest.
Welcome to the real world!
We would like to ask you a few questions.
I firmly believe in his innocence.
The President has been in charge for four years.
I'm glad you're happy.
I don't know if I'm ready for this.
What a long flight!
How much money do you have?
Couldn't you solve that question?
And Tom and Mary here.
What would you do with that?
Twenty floors in the building.
If you don't go, I won't go either.
Are you by chance not in the course of Tom's coming back?
I don't have a picture of Tom.
Can you wait a minute?
Will you give something for Christmas?
She won't let him go.
I know you're working with Tom.
They don't know I'm Canadian.
I'll be very busy next month.
Tom was trying to help Mary.
She likes this singer.
If he followed my advice, then he would now be a rich man.
I made that decision on my own.
Can you say that again?
I asked Tom to wait for us.
A strong wind came up.
Tom didn't have the courage to try to climb the parachute.
How do you know all this?
He's running as fast as you are.
We're not as young as Tom.
How long do you plan to be home at night?
The sum is empty.
Are you feeling okay?
He's straight like an ass.
I think you'll be able to.
She knew she wasn't right.
It's so cool!
Tom had the feeling that Mary would bring her new boyfriend to the party.
When I came home, he watched TV.
Tom talked to me last night in a dream.
Tom's ready to protect himself.
You're never right.
Don't repeat it!
I called him, but I picked up some girl.
Where did you meet them?
Mary told me she'd win.
We have to stick to the plan.
I'll tell you 'cause you called.
Tom is very strict with the kids.
How are the negotiations going?
He's ready for the worst.
The beginning of history was interesting.
I thought Tom was interested.
I'm mixing Mayones with ketchup.
They're always complaining.
Tom's got a little rest.
Did you understand what she said?
You're kind of distracted.
Don't hurt her.
I'd better stay.
That's why a brilliant idea came to mind.
She's breathing now.
I refuse to leave Boston.
Tom said he wouldn't help me.
How do you know so much about Boston?
Is this an important place?
I didn't know why Tom's late.
He lost his job last month.
Who were you talking to?
I want to believe everything's okay.
She always keeps her room clean and tidy.
I suspect that's why I have to go to Boston next week.
Don't go anywhere else.
Tom was terrified.
Tom's face is gorgeous.
Tom didn't know what I knew.
Where did you and Tom stop?
You don't know Tom?
I believe in friendship.
We're done.
How's your new class?
Fear your own shade.
Tom was very pleased.
Hunger was an abstract concept for him; he always had enough food.
The room needs a new tower.
Can you stay with them?
Tom came early.
I didn't know it existed.
He's left.
Someone poisoned me.
Unfortunately, there was rain yesterday.
Looks like he's asleep.
Are you sure you know what you're doing?
Are you afraid of the cross?
How long do you want to leave?
She had legs.
It's a risk we can't afford.
I want to discuss something important for both of us.
We need to take you to the hospital.
What's the square root of two?
Tom leaned forward and kissed Mary.
Tom was swimming?
I'd say you're jealous.
I never called him an idiot.
Tom often did that.
I hope we don't do that anymore.
How many times have you helped you do that?
If you were my friend, I'd be happy.
I almost believe you.
These precious things, dear.
I don't know how you do it.
I saw Tom dancing with Mary.
By the time I'm done, it'll be time to open.
I'm not sure what size she has.
He was also kind to animals.
Tom and I went out together.
You really don't want anything?
Tom put a bell and walked into the cave.
Who's your lawyer?
We'll leave as soon as the rain stops.
Fooma's gone from the door.
We have to do it.
She couldn't think of Tom.
Tom told everyone that Mary was widowed.
Who doesn't admire them?
We were crying with him.
You don't want to try again?
Wait a second.
What'd you break up like that?
Milk can be made of oil, cheese, and much more.
You don't have the authority to do this.
I have a project for you.
Tom saved me.
Are you her relative?
When you drink water, do not forget those who drank a well.
Did you know Tom had a son?
I didn't know her name.
Tom asked Mary when she was going to buy a new pair of shoes for the younger daughter.
Take a good lead.
You like jazz, don't you?
You're drunk.
I used to smoke.
You didn't know Tom and Mary were John's parents?
I wanted you to win.
I felt like an anonymous guest.
Are you popular?
The Russians won as much as they expected.
He blew up in response.
Tom said Mary's enough.
I know you want to see them.
We're on the right floor.
You'll get it if you try.
You didn't mean to ask Tom for help?
It's worth a try.
Tom says I eat like a pig.
Couldn't you say that in human language?
No one was hungry but me.
Tom's very excited.
No snowflake in the snowflake is found to be guilty.
Who did you want to talk to?
They can understand everything she says.
I don't want Tom to be here.
Do you have a German-Russian dictionary?
I just want you to know that I forgive you.
Can you speak French like him?
I'm going to solve this problem.
I told you Tom wouldn't want to go.
When will the shop open?
Don't worry, I'll be careful.
He opened his mouth wide.
It's a time to swim.
I really liked this book.
You're important.

The fish is still raw.
Try to stay positive.
I've had it all wrong.
She swallowed him with a pillow.
Look at him.
Is it gonna hurt?
The girl had a big red hat.
I don't think I can be happy here.
Tom's been cheated.
I called you here to ask you a question.
Who do you play with?
I need a light coat.
I'm done with my job.
It's a cat.
Please tell me it's not true.
You're not coming in?
I repaired his radio.
That's a very bad idea.
Tom above you.
Tom found a job without work.
This book in public access?
Please, can't you talk louder?
I'll tell him to get in touch with Mary.
I helped them.
He looks like a girl.
Please address me, not like James Matthewevich.
She's not alone anymore.
Tom never admits he's not right because he thinks it's a sign of weakness.
I've been to America.
It's been more time than I expected.
Mary stayed with her father.
I thought I could trust her.
Do you have a new Steve Wander album?
I got kicked out of my house because I didn't pay the rent.
Tell me where you were going.

That's what happened at Park Street.
Eduardo's younger than Roberto.
The moon is the satellite of the earth.
I don't know.
There's nothing in nature that's useless.
No, she never fell in love.
You did it on purpose!
You won't need it.
Tom rarely goes to parties.
You're not my mother.
Tell them we're going.
I look like a guy who wants to marry?
I closed the door, but don't close it.
So you should be careful not to kiss Mary publicly.
Can we help them?
Thank you for calling me back.
They're happy.
Please don't be so hard on me.
Now I'm in charge of the council!
People, good for us all year.
I'm not sorry.
I know Tom won't give up.
I don't really like her.
He's not.
You're very smart.
Tom and I are planning to get married on 20 October.
She thought I'd take her.
I'm living in Boston now.
Tom entered his secret with him in the grave.
You really want to put your money in that bank?
I don't think anyone else wants to do that.
We're teachers.
I'm sure you like me very much.
Why are you so worried about her?
I'll never do it again.
Are there visitors?
Emily wants to be an electrician.
Those books are better than those.
Don't try to remember every sentence in the text, it's almost impossible.
He's been teaching French for eight years.
I thought it was you.
I personally think you're right.
I can't believe I did it anyway.
The candle's burning.
Why don't I get you something to drink?
We're picking up clothes for homeless people.
Tom paid Mary a very good salary.
What do you think?
Let's hurry up and come tomorrow.
Tom doesn't know why I didn't win.
Never in life!
Did Tom ever ask you to help him?
The chair has to start.
I thought you were right.
Why are we all looking at each other?
Where's Tom's keys?
Am I right to say your name?
No one saw her leave the room.
Wa-bank.
Tom will never find him.
All women are the same.
He let them dance around the garden.
I don't have a crusade.
Your love is fake.
She's about my age.
Did you really do this for free?
You want me to open the box?
Boys will always be boys, girls are girls.
It's time for you to lie down, turn off the radio.
There's nothing new about his desire for alcohol.
He doesn't know the risks.
So we don't have to do this anymore.
Do you have any idea who could do that?
The teacher warned us that exams would probably be difficult.
I'm a married man.
He bought his son a camera.
Shut up and eat.
I gave it all to you.
I dedicate that song to you.
I like her more.
You're too small to know what a logarithmic line is.
I used to do it almost every day.
I'm deeply shocked.
About a billion people suffer from hunger and poverty.
I am pleased to inform you that your work has been accepted for publication in “SM”.
I'm convinced of my right.
I didn't know you wanted to learn French.
Let's go home.
You've got time.
I'm not coming.
Tom doesn't spend much time thinking about money.
That's why we should go with Mary.
It's interesting what Tom's doing here.
You can't.
I don't think I can go faster.
Tom was left with questions.
Are you looking for someone?
Tom's hand tasted the mureno.
That's why I didn't have to hide.
He'll be out of his parents' house soon.
I don't think he'll hear us.
I want to go to England.
Did you see anyone in the park?
Did I not warn you that you would not go there?
Tom moved here from Australia three years ago.
She left Boston.
We should consider all options.
Tom could have killed me.
Grandpa Ali was a drummer.
Why didn't anyone tell us?
He's walking in the pajamas.
On the contrary, I went looking for Tom in the lobby.
How old were you when you moved to Boston?
He's better aware of his problems.
Tom claimed he saw the UFO.
I know who you were with.
Does Tom have a bike?
What did you ask them?
It's not bad.
I'll have breakfast every morning.
It's not a bug, it's a bug.
Do you have a car problem?
At the tourist information centre, the city map was issued to all those who wished.
I'm so sorry, but I can't.
Tom's closed all the windows.
Come as fast as you can.
We're not very hungry yet.
Learning Chinese is not to impress your future boss, but to understand what she's saying.
You can add suggestions that you can't move on your own, maybe you can do it to someone else!
Mary's always home, isn't she?
Just don't pay attention to Tom.
I don't think I'm going to.
I'm sorry, I didn't notice.
I teach.
I knew Tom was bluffing.
I've tried all my strength.
That's a good sign.
Some people are convinced that the guardian angel will protect them.
Tom broke his bank account.
She's in the hotel now.
What's going to happen to me?
He was so interested that he paid attention to it.
I told him I didn't care.
Tom wants to change society.
I thought you didn't see anything.
We're both here for the same reason.
Love is strong, and money is stronger.
I saw him naked.
In our library a lot of children's books.
I didn't let her home before.
Did you talk to her?
How long will it take to get there?
I didn't want to stop you.
We all wanted each other luck.
Tom was born three days before Christmas in 2013.
The young girl was silent.
When Tom heard his favorite song on the radio, he could not stop singing.
When does this end?
Tom kissed Mary and apologized.
The scored Friday still left a trail on the jube.
Is Tom seeing someone?
Tom didn't show me anything.
I hate driving.
They're fake.
When you're back, I'm gone.
Did you talk to him today?
I thought you stopped seeing him.
Tom's calling Mary.
She smells flowers.
A woman often calls me when she travels abroad.
You're in bed.
First of all, I would like to make a clear point of my position.
Tom can play the gang.
Tom didn't decide what to do.
He doesn't like coffee.
Please turn on the radio.
Don't bring Tom to tears.
The police can't arrest Tom.
How did you get into my room?
What do you want to give to that?
We want to go to Australia.
I have a very small salary.
Toma hit the bear.
Tom knows where Mary's going.
You scared them.
Tell her, let her go.
I don't know anything about it.
We've been meeting for three months.
I'm glad you were there.
They made me a big party.
The mountain is covered with snow for a year.
Tom stopped at Mary's store to buy sugar.
I like being a rice.
Stay away from here.
What's the worst movie you've ever seen in your life?
I thought you hated us.
Think carefully before you answer.
Tom says Mary needs more time.
I took it for a joke and I didn't answer it.
Actually, he wasn't called Tom Jackson.
Is that sarcasm?
Do not do what you will later regret.
You envy her?
I hope I can stay here for a long time.
Payments will be made according to experience and education.
I think Tom's right.
You don't have to do sports.
Tom told me you were married.
I decided I wouldn't stay.
I can't wait for you and your family.
Did you change her?
I told you I changed my mind.
Why did you say that?
You have to work hard if you want to succeed.
There's no exception in the espresso.
If you need help, say it.
Can I go home early today?
You wouldn't survive for anything.
Tom didn't think Mary'd upset it.
There's a trade area not far from here.
Mary thinks she's the smartest.
Use your doll.
Tom doesn't know exactly where Mary lives.
I remember you.
It's interesting news.
Tom is a bitter drink.
We don't even know her.
Tom made a few suggestions and checked them out on Mary before hitting Tatoebu.
I know where you're keeping your money.
After all, the school is over.
It's a long drive.
Does your mother know about this?
Do you really like that kind of food?
Tom looked into the mirror.
I told them not to tell anyone.
That's how Tom died.
The coffee shop is empty.
Write in the cranadas, please.
We can't leave.
He's committed his crime.
It's the most beautiful painting I've ever seen.
What are you doing here?
He's worried about something.
The times Claudia thought about psychoanalysis.
Tom would never agree to that.
You need to find work.
He'll be back later today, too.
She's very proud of herself.
I left about half a third.
Don't leave the tape in the sun.
I already knew that.
I watched them leave.
I'm surprised you remember them.
Hey, I know you.
"Help, help, help." "Pieretta yells." "They're killing!"
Can I open a locker?
You didn't have any right to do that.
I'm yours.
He was just as drunk as he was.
Let the earth be your dwelling, Father!
Why are you still one?
I want us to be friends with your sister.
Who were you waiting for yesterday?
You like to sing?
The road's rolling.
Tom's getting ready for tomorrow.
Come on in.
I'll keep them for my grandchildren.
I heard Carol and Will got divorced.
How's Tom doing?
Tom says he never did.
Tom seems to be a nice man.
Help me find her.
Tom didn't give it to me.
I had to go through a fight.
The firemen couldn't hold fire.
Help finally came.
It's a horse.
That's what happened here on Monday.
America's done with slavery.
Don't you know him?
Luckily, he didn't die in an accident.
He's often sitting around reading books.
I had no idea what you could do.
Tom unloaded the car.
Tom knew about Mary something John didn't know.
The answer is no.
We need to call him.
Are you busy?
I've had a negative head rise.
Tom, they're calling you.
You promised you wouldn't drink today.
Are you ready for tomorrow?
We checked.
Go check out what Tom's doing in the garage.
I don't think that's how it works.
I didn't do that.
Tom told me he'd come back.
How long are you going to be here tomorrow?
A box with openings.
Did you talk to Tom about it?
Is that a flying mouse?
She'll take you to the airport.
Tell me what else I need to know.
You can't make me marry you.
That's pretty weird.
The leaves are yellow.
I woke up, and she's not.
We have a lot of food today.
He spoke with a word that supported my point of view.
Mount Kilimanjaro is a sleeping volcano located in Tanzania.
Why don't you go with her?
Why didn't you just tell them?
I can't rule it out.
Tom asked me why I never tried to get driving rights.
I need to get back to Boston.
Have a seat, please.
Wake up, Tom.
Here's the map.
You should have stayed with us.
Let's imagine that we're an alien.
Tom said he wasn't hungry.
I have nothing to say to you.
I'd rather you don't talk about it.
I didn't want to go anyway.
I'm not going to complain.
They kept their love secret.
She was only on the train just to be late for the train.
Don't say that to my bride.
Tom was tired of the need to pay the bill when they and Mary were dating.
I urge you to reconsider your decision.
I'm not worried about your past.
The police searched Tom's car.
Although I felt something strange, I didn't know it was.
Are you a pig?
I went to the army.
Why can't you take me the way I am?
Bear black.
Tom doesn't know what Mary did.
I don't know who will be in the congregation.
It's hard to get to the president.
If you're hungry, eat.
I was terrified.
He's no longer a member of our club.
I'll do it right away.
I don't trust her.
Six is equal to eighteen.
‘Scala’ is an anagram ‘laski’.
I've never seen Tom help anyone.
Dan took part in a meeting against racism.
You did it fast.
I need to spend two minutes ahead.
He's on her side.
I didn't forget your betrayal.
I think you did great.
She danced so gracefully that she surprised all of us.
This is where she worked as a secretary.
They're not so bad.
I thought I had everything.
Don't worry, it's gonna be okay.
It's hard for me to work with Tom.
I'm competitive.
He says that his son is now able to consider up to a hundred.
Something's wrong here.
Tom hates these things.
There's a little garden in front of my house.
Why didn't they go?
I heard you paid someone to do it.
It's for my friend.
Tom said Mary was innocent.
Tulpan is the official colour symbol of our prefecture.
I knew we'd be friends.
I didn't want to lose him.

I'm going to give you some karate lessons.
Don't worry about my dog.
Tom, they're cremating tomorrow.
That's not true.
You are no longer allowed to do this.
The summer canals in Karuedzawa were swallowed by tourists.
I saw Tom sitting in the train.
He didn't do anything wrong.
She was hoping for eyes.
I love that commercial.
It was just water.
I bought it for my sister.
I'll never forget how we went to Hawaii with her.
Nobody heard the phone.
How did it get here?
Tom and Mary said they didn't want to fight.
I'd love to go with you, but I can't.
Shocked by the events of 11 September, the policies of the world condemned terrorists for their reprehensible denial.

I don't know all the students.
Thank you so much, you just ruined my life!

Peace to you.
I got a white one.

I can't go on Saturday.
We're getting married in October.
Tom and Mary disagree with you.
We'll let you know soon enough.
Let's get a divorce.
He won't find any keys.
Her manners make me nervous.
He likes eating.
And then what happened?
Do you think he likes me?
Tom agreed to help Mary do that.
He prefers not to talk about it.
I let them sleep until noon.
I just wanted to go back to my old life.
I'm sorry she yelled at you.
I've already told you everything you think you know.
Health gives a person the freedom that most people do not realize until he leaves.
Does that matter?
I know Tom's secret.
Tom is a man.
It's not nice.
No one could believe it.
Tell her I'm repairing the refrigerator.
It's amazing.
The rabbit's got blood coming from the ear.
Postmodernism differs from modernism.
I've already read this book.
Damn it!
He's showing great enthusiasm.
Maybe you should call the police.
Did you report this to the police?
You really think Tom's sick?
I'm not afraid of that at all.
I don't have much money as you think I do.
I'm selling clothes on the Internet.
I could do anything faster when I was younger.
I wasn't worried.
John, the tallest boy in our class, wears the name "Mr. High."
Tom's leaving tomorrow morning.
I didn't kill them.
You'll know him?
I was, in general, all the same.
Tom has a horse.
I shouldn't have come here.
Don't make such an acid face!
That white one?
Tom came first.
They had strange rumors about them.
That's amazing.
The sky's covered with the beats.
This bird is in danger of extinction.
You made her very happy.
How do you live?
I mean, Tom felt like he was having fun.
I'm all ears on my throat.
You said it was important.
He said he'll be back right now.
They have a lot of information.
Everyone in the village called her Green Shapeck.
I don't want to.
It's time to put the kids to sleep.
This work can be done.
I'm easy to breathe.
Tom won't object.
There's nothing.
I'm afraid you don't have a choice.
Did you take the medicine?
Many people believe in corruption of our country's officials.
He's been slowing down his pants?
I can't distinguish him from my brother.
We can count on him.
I'll go with her.
Did the phone wake you up?
I really need someone to bite.
I don't think Tom has any experience.
Come now.
Last winter, I went to Canada to see a lie.
That's acceptable.
Tom says he can prove that Mary didn't.
I was born on January 2, 1968.
I want you to stay away from Tom.
Tom just got out of prison.
Pets allowed.
Tom is full of hope.
He speaks French, as well as, of course, English.
Get this stone out of here, please.
"It's getting married." "And who's the lucky choice?"
I've been thinking about you all day.
It's good news.
I can't pay you.
That's what I found in the cave.
I think I made an impression on him.
The train will be at this station for about two minutes.
Grow up, Tom.
I want to sleep with your wife.
What do you think would be the safest place?
I'm familiar with your father.
I heard you scream.
He's the guy who drew that picture.
"Call up" means calling on the phone.
Who would have noticed?
Medicinal product subject to medical prescription.
Do you have a question?
They went into the woods.
I'm talking too much.
You show me the way.
The sun shines brightly.
The coral reefs are alive.
Tom said he knew what Mary was planning to do.
You never wanted to talk about it.
We hope for the best.
I didn't expect Tom and Mary to be here.
Last night, the temperature dropped below zero.
"You cannot carry it." "Why not?"
Tom did a bad job.
I knew Tom wasn't in Australia.
My eyes are the ocean in which my dreams are reflected.
In a big city like Tokyo, I prefer walking, not riding a car.
As it turned out here, it's not possible to find out now.
Now Tom has his own room.
I didn't know her first.
A number of votes were taken.
You lied to us, didn't you?
I don't think Tom can help you right now.
He'll probably be here soon.
He did not fully realize that this was a differential equation.
I know that's probably it.
Be an adult, Tom.
Can you distinguish Tom from his twin brother?
I'm not paid for it.
Tom's had sex with a piece of glue.
Don't give up.
How did you know where Tom was?
She says she'll do it on Monday.
Tom's too fast.
The popularity of the phone has led to fewer people writing letters in our days.
I think we're almost ready.
The woman came to our town three years ago.
So you're not going to help us?
My son-in-law died, and I'm terribly upset.
She's above the sister.
I have a pink car.
It's so quiet.
In the most beautiful colors, the sharpest tails.
You better hide.
Tom follows instructions.
It's just not gonna happen.
They can't afford it.
What color do you like?
She says she feels very tired.
It doesn't matter.
Tom had a happy childhood.
I just got back from Boston.
Why did Tom run away?
Tom doesn't know what Iraq is different from Iran.
So they told themselves not to.
Two days ago, I caught a cold.
I was waiting for him.
You don't have to do this.
Let's have a coffee or something.
You have something in your pockets, don't you?
Ask Tom--he'll tell you the same thing.
I saw that helicopter myself, and I took it by the hand.
I'm with you.
You want to end up like him?
I thought about him.
I'm waiting for someone.
Are you going to the theater tonight?
You have to protect yourself.
There's no conditioner in my house.
Tom and Mary are studying French together.
My boss is very happy today.
They blocked his proposal.
I admire your courage.
Tom was hoping that Mary would stay in Boston for a while.
Don't make me do it again.
Soon your turn, Bashar!
You're worthless.
It's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.
I visited Boston.
I'm sorry, couldn't you repeat the question?
What do you think they're doing to Tom?
Ask Tom when Mary's gonna do it.
I don't want anyone to do that.
Tom's gonna be working on these exits.
Give her the phone, please.
No one could see us.
I knew I'd find you with Tom.
The President's efforts to strengthen arms control were accompanied by powerful weapons lobbys.
I think we know each other.
You're underestimating Tom.
Don't worry, Tom.
I'll try to express it in English.
Give it to me, please.
We need to talk to her.
Time enough for you.
We had to plan more carefully.
You need to sleep.
I'm proud of my father's good fortune.
Is there anything else you want to tell me?
Foma tried to explain the situation to Masha.
I told her it was a mistake.
He's her manager.
Tom didn't have it.
No one paid attention to me.
So there were thirteen at the time.
I'm going to Boston on a bus.
Tom wants to try a new shampoo.
Tom grew up in these places.
You have to pay in advance.
You made coffee?
You could tell the truth.
She's just thinking about herself.
You usually talk too fast.
We both speak French.
Look at yourself in a pretty suit.
Who told you where to find me?
Who likes Tom?
That's definitely not what I wanted.
How did you break your shoulder?
Tom hid the fact that he was in prison.
We're more than Spartacus!
That's how he was celebrating his birthday.
Why did he need it?
It's a capital investment.
It's really bad.
Time didn't catch it.
Did I say something funny?
Where's the ring?
Meg didn't even look at me.
Promise?
I know you did it on purpose.
It's time to find out.
I have to call him.
There's a lot to think about.
You've always been a winner.
Network!
I used to live on Park Street.
Try to be there on Monday.
I've already read this.
That's thanks to you.
Until certain conditions are met.
She's not like everything.
Social networks allow you to find a lot of information about a person before you meet him.
What really happened in the last exits in Boston?
What Is the Meaning of Learning?
These Persians aren't very cute.
I don't think these black fives can be pulled out.
I told you everything I had to tell you.
No, I didn't.
Let me pay for it.
I can't forgive his thighs.
Tell me you're kidding!
I'm a realist.
I heard Tom was expelled from school.
Tom said he was very lonely.
I didn't tell my friends I was eating in Australia.
Kim's four years older than me.
Why aren't you in shape?
Tom just wanted to make sure that's what you meant.
Tom let his daughter go to bed without dinner.
I'm coming with you.
They've cleared the snowy street.
Tom and Mary have to do this together.
They offered us their help.
Tom was determined to kiss Mashu.
Are you very hungry?
What's going to happen to him?
Tom and I are friends with each other.
Where do you think you're going?
I had blood in my urine.
You can't always win.
Tom, some kind of celebrity.
Jimmy knows everything about cars.
I saw them all.
As everyone knows, he's a genius.
The painting hangs on the walls.
Mary said she'd win.
I want this dog.
Tom with you?
The boy's afraid of the dark.
That's why I've prepared dinner.
Russia has become a second superstate.
I'm worried about them, too.
He went to the post office to send a letter.
Remove this powder in a glass of water.
Will you come with her?
Let's take one of those ready-to-sale dishes.
Tom tried to kill them.
She says she's happy.
You want to go outside the border?
Don't blame the government.
Put him in place.
How come you know each other?
Who sent this letter?
Drop your guns.
What happened to the money?
The average rent per apartment in Manhattan is about $40,000 a month.
You won't find them.
Tom is the only one who survived.
Are you going to buy this car?
You speak like my grandmother.
I don't have any relatives.
Let's see something else.
You think that's the exact translation?
I know Tom kissed Mary.
We both really wanted to.
So there's nothing here to do.
Try not to worry about us.
Stop here!
You're very helpful.
Don't stop at the door.
You should take his age into account.
I forgot to tell her something.
We forgot you didn't like pizza.
Tom's got to suspect something's wrong.
What if he comes back now?
If you stand up, sleep!
I'm afraid I won't have time.
You didn't know Mary was Tom's wife?
I need to move on.

I told her not to.
I don't think Tom knows anyone who can do it.
We've come to wish you luck.
Do you remember his name?
Tom put the toys in the toy box.
I don't want you to drive.
He said he'd come.
"Doctor, I'm being ignored." "Next!"
He's got one purpose in life to make money.
He gave the dogs a piece of meat.
Let's write to you.
Uncle Tom couldn't read.
I'm not a doctor, I'm a teacher.
She said she liked him.
Should I go with you?
Give him the microphone.
Tom spent the night at the hotel.
I explained that to her.
Tom's indecisive.
The nuclear baton!
I'll delay my departure if there's rain.
It has to be absolutely.
There's something else I want to discuss with you.
It's the tallest building I've ever seen.
That'll cut my ears.
What are you doing tomorrow night?
Are you a musician?
It's been ten years since my mother died.
The three basic colors are mixed with black.
Have a seat.
When do you want to meet?
She doesn't like the new job.
I didn't want my neighbors to see me naked.
The operation was successful.
Long Tom's still in the hospital?
I want you to be with her.
I'll make him pay the money.
You must respect them.
I'm waiting for you in Turin!
You didn't look tired.
I will pray earnestly.
What will you do if the war begins again?
Tom said he'd do the same.
I'm not going to Australia this year.
The most well-known gold disaster is the California gold disaster, which began in 1848.
You know why Tom doesn't trust Mary?
Show your picture.
I'll meet new people every day.
I want to go see him.
You cheated on Tom.
What are you doing in my room?
We miss it so much.
He answered his parents.
Tom, have you eaten yet?
Who did you give it to?
I kept him behind the doorbell.
No one's offering you to do this.
I forgot that this is the first April.
Please stop singing that song!
Tom tasted the dog.
I know you're out early.
Tom took care of all this morning.
I'm aware of the consequences.
On the east and west side of the city, the river divides.
Why are you coming?
Do you know anyone who speaks French?
That's why it was terrible?
Tom invited me to stay overnight.
I don't think Tom's guilty.
I'd love you to stay.
I'm impressed with your French.
We both want to do it.
If the ice warms, it grows.
We could do that.
The doctor said that's why we need surgery.
I just changed my toothpaste.
Here's something for you.
It's your bedroom.
Tom is realistic.
Who's knocking at my door?
When and where did you meet Tom?
I've come to visit you.
I feel like an ampheus.
Our team came home with a triumph.
I went alone.
Tom was married to an older girl.
I heard him.
Why don't you sleep?
He came to you with a guarantee?
Can you take a picture of us?
I heard you cry.
Show me how to do it!
They're all quiet.
Let the dust fall.
Why are you so stubborn?
He became a Chinese teacher, but with all these hormonal matters, he became a member of almost every meeting.
I'm glad to inform you that I'm completely cured.
I've written a lot of suggestions on the espresso.
I like the watermelon more than the bed.
I can't make an exception.
He's quick to imagine.
I can find them.
I'm here now.
You have the right to a lawyer.
Don't sit too close to the TV.
I'm my head almost every day.
To my surprise, he didn't give up.
Did you steal it?
She must be mad at me.
You don't understand, Tom.
My father likes a fish, just like me.
Hey, it's me.
Dan showed himself to be a rival of the white race.
I'll try to take them away.
I like the color of your dress.
It's not me, I swear!
I don't think Tom speaks French.
My parents wouldn't understand.
I don't know what to do.
She asked me if she could use the phone.
Tom's better ready than I am.
He's floating like a torch.
Tom didn't tell Mary what he needed to buy.
She brought the ball.
"Tom, turn around." "I'm going!"
I have a big problem.
We're not partners.
We have already faced this problem.
I'm trying to say it in French.
I'm not like everything else.
I managed to get two tickets to the concert.
He likes to boast about his father's successful car business.
She's in the sunscreen.
Come on, Emily, your father's waiting for you.
How many hours can you sit in front of the computer?
Tom can barely walk.
Minus per minus gives plus.
In the basement.
Please make a donation.
I really need to talk to you.
Tell me something.
I prefer to travel alone.
Ankara is the capital of Turkey.
I went to the trunk.
I prefer a simpler approach.
They're classic.
I had a good time with my friends.
Jane's kind words really hurt us.
I'm trying not to read the news.
What am I supposed to tell him?
You look dormant.
I'm grateful for your help.
He couldn't hold a smile.
Wait, did you say "girl" or "boy"?
I didn't try to kill them.
Education is learning that you didn't even know you didn't.
Tom agreed to help Mary.
You should have thought well before making her pregnant.
Tom says he doesn't marry Mary.
I got two fish.
I think Tom's sick.
Tom's fainted.
I'm not poor.
Professor Hudson is my father’s friend.
Can I come too?
Is Tom working enough to live in the city?
Question over.
Please turn off the radio.
He said he wasn't sure about his answers.
I heard about Tom and Mary.
Take off your jacket if you're warm.
They're so many.
He couldn't follow the principles.
Mary says she's alone.
You probably have three hours to go.
It was an easy decision.
Mary said she'd come sooner.
I want to open my own restaurant.
Are you still buying lottery tickets?
That could be anyone.
One language is never enough.
Mary told me she was a Canadian.
You seem to be suffering.
Tom forgot to tell Mary about the party.
That's what people don't understand.
Tom has a rich imagination.
Finally, she solved the problem.
The main thing is to tell the truth.
I don't want Tom singing at our wedding.
It's all about work.
I had nothing wrong with it.
Tom keeps his room clean.
That is why these three books belong to him.
He jumped from one topic to the other.
It's a truce.
Did you tell him I was here?
Tom's inside.
It's not cold today.
I mistook Tom's shirt.
It seems that the bank's robbery was planned in the middle of the mill.
So he didn't like it, but he bought it anyway.
Hold on a second.
I want to talk to you about something.
The bank is empty.
Why didn't you show her why?
Isn't the weather wonderful?
We'll be there in half an hour.
I bathed in the river.
Tell them to take off the tube.
Can you tell us what it is?
Say "no" racism.
You're a butcher, aren't you?
Don't make me kill you!
What do you like more?
They don't respect him.
There's no choice.
I want you to be my girlfriend.
Don't hurt us.
You can't answer that.
Tom's got a lot of books.
Can you distinguish the alligator from the crocodile?
Wait, what's that?
My grandfather built this house.
Do you want to take advantage of this opportunity?
You can't stay here.
I did it for the first time today.
I came to Australia when I was a child.
You really want me to say 'cause you killed his father?
Your teacher called me.
I'm your father.
Can I do it myself?
All the people were touched by his word.
You know how dangerous it is?
He's running.
He's sitting next to his brother.
I'd like to meet him.
How old is Tony?
Can I have a shower in the morning?
Yes, everyone, listen, please.
It's made of wood or metal?
Excuse me!
I think Tom is my friend.
In view of being ignorant and free, the nation is counting on what has never been and will never be.
Tom's barely breathing.
Dogs don't change colors.
Tom poured water out of the bottle before filling it with fresh water.
Dogs are true animals.
Tom's house was almost completely destroyed.
You're so stupid.
Tom knows you can't speak French?
Two boats on the lake.
I'm not gonna call you her name.
I knew it was a lie.
It's better to be alone than in a bad company.
It's a fake data.
There's a difference between them.
I know some of you think Tom is lazy.
You have to tell him not to do that anymore.
Are you disappointed?
I'll stop you.
I think he looks.
Come closer.
We stopped at Hilton.
That's why it's worth telling Mary the truth.
I'll be alone after you leave.
Tom wanted to open the box right away, but I offered to wait for Mary.
She kept complaining that there was no money left.
Don't you think you should call that?
There's something to do.
She gave him a present.
Mary's in her room.
Attention!
At the same time, I fell in love with that language.
It's safe, isn't it?
Is that what you ordered for this pizza?
I need you to help me with this.
Tom's my close friend.
Don't do two things at the same time.
You didn't have to go to the woods alone.
Nobody sees my tears.
Tom slept again.
She likes you so much.
I'm glad you're still here.
These bottles are multi-faceted.
Tom has never kissed anyone before.
I'll tell them you're in.
I'll listen.
I haven't been home since October.
I'm so glad to meet you.
I didn't forget about the congregation.
They had a wedding last autumn.
He's helping me.
Put your hands up!
Everyone knows we didn't.
I thought Tom was never in Boston.
She learned to swim when she was five years old.
We appealed to the manager of the neighbor's noise.
I'm not gonna let you do this.
I don't think they heard us.
I thought you might need it.
Honesty is one of the righteous.
You're gonna meet him for a new year, and you're gonna do it for him.
There's no book in the library in French.
Any dangerous compound, especially that.
You could have stayed in Boston.
There's no one there.
Can you write it to the surgeon, please?
We don't think it matters.
No one understands you as much as I do.
Take your age accordingly.
Can you get married?
Did you kill your wife?
We exchanged greetings.
Tom still wants to come.
I didn't think they'd come.
I don't bear the kind of animal suffering.
I think Tatoeba's stopping today.
Sally had her brother clean the toilet.
Mary's apartment is full of trouble.
The conference room is now busy.
The potato chips are harmful to your health.
I'm not as good as yours.
I look forward to Christmas.
I've never seen you so happy.
He made a deep breath.
I think Tom's right.
It's gone.
You see the star?
Ask Tom.
Grab the belt!
That's how you used to talk.
Tom says he's not hungry.
It's always been.
Can't we fire her?
The artificial satellite was taken to orbit.
I'm totally serious.
Are you sure it's sick?
It's too simple.
What happens to our children if a nuclear war begins?
I told them the bank isn't working.
Tom and I soon became friends.
He has a question.
I thought Tom was your best friend.
That's why I'm so sorry.
Nothing to tell me what to do.
Documents on the table.
I'm sure Tom didn't know that.
Tom didn't tell us how upset he was.
I knew it was him.
Tom's working.
I'm not working today.
That's what you said last time.
I know it's better than anyone.
I don't know what Tom thinks.
I knew it was something like that.
There's nothing to hide from you, is there?
You're lying to me.
Tom looked very young.
The account shall be paid to the first number of next month.
My French freak.
We need help.
You're scaring her.
For me, Boston is a cold town, not Chicago.
Tom was a victim of an attempted rape.
I can't talk about a colleague.
Tom lives far away from you?
Why didn't I die?
The stop's over with a dragon.
I didn't take it.
Tom came here yesterday.
I'd like to leave a reply.
You chose not that man.
They were very risky.
We have a white cat.
Maybe you'll never be able to walk again.
He used to be better.
Tom wants to see us.
You weren't home yesterday?
If anyone can do that, Tom.
The meeting was cancelled because of typhoon.
Tom was diagnosed with tuberculosis in 2013.
On the way, she was riding with the mules.
Tom speaks French to grandparents and grandparents, and to parents in English.
I don't think Tom's got enough money to buy a ticket.
Tom was hard to find.
They're all dancing!
I'm living with Tom.
I met them here.
You're not wasting your time.
Your problem is that you don't have enough patience.
Several events marked the arrival of the twenty - first century.
Stop doing this, Tom.
Tom said he wasn't planning on doing that.
This university was founded by Mr. Smith.
I told him to go to Australia.
I think you could do that.
Tom said there can't be a word about it.
He got out of bed.
The train shall be in accordance with the schedule.
I paid for Tom.
There are many people who think it is impossible not to speak.
Why is Tom avoiding me?
Is the exam going to be today?
What motivates you?
I gave Lee a computer to myself.
Put your hand down.
I was hoping you'd come back.
Do you think Tom will agree to meet us?
They say anyone in America can be president, but it's probably not true.
Tom never forgot Mary.
The first on the list is Tom's name.
What else have you missed?
Mary tried to calm down.
How long is the train coming?
How long is this train coming to Boston?
Didn't you see that?
I need you to call me.
Tom never suspected that Mary and John met each other.
When I get rich, I'll buy a farm.
I burned his ass.
It's the neighbouring country.
I called my son.
Why didn't she come yesterday?
Where can I sit?
You can't believe Tom told me!
I'll give you some more time to think.
Make it French, please.
Take the ice cream!
She needs a cab.
The crowd has grown rapidly.
Mary told me she loved me.
That's what Tom told me about what happened.
Bones and kill.
I'll find her.
Did you think about what I said?
I'm very sensitive to the cold.
We're looking for you!
She loves everyone.
Compare your answers to Tom's answers.
In Tom's weak heart.
That's why she's gonna have to pay for it.
I didn't know how to buy.
Can you lend me a carnival knife?
Tom took off his board.
Did you see my dog?
Don't even try to do it on your own.
Nobody saw you take it.
I'm going to half a Japanese.
Tom says he'll fix it.
You have to come back.
We've already spoken.
I can't believe I finally made it.
Tom didn't know why Mary was pregnant.
Don't worry!
Why don't you just tell me?
What month is the thirteenth?
I don't know what book to choose.
Tom didn't understand anything at all.
Tom can't stay.
I panicked.
He's wearing a white boy's cotton shirt.
It's a garden.
I'll have to wait.
Yesterday was Sunday, not Saturday.
Anyone here with them?
They're watching you.
How much time do you need?
I think Tom remembered me.
We can do that.
He knows his shortcomings.
Tom told me he was interested.
You said you loved him.
Mary is dressed in black.
We had dinner at the restaurant.
I'll tell him about you.
Tom never asks for help.
Tom didn't say that to Mary.
It's okay.
There's a lot of prospect in this city.
What are you wearing?
When was the last time you were in Boston?
They decided to get married next month.
They slept in the car because they couldn't find a hotel.
She's not stronger than me.
You haven't said that yet, have you?
She's got a double chin.
We can't force people to do that.
Let me carry it.
I think it's Tom's fault.
I can't stand this color.
They sleep together?
We're very grateful for that.
I can't believe he's still not married.
I didn't even know you knew.
I won't let her in.
We were welcomed by neighbors.
I think Tom is lying.
Looking back, I think you were right.
I shot the bear.
I never talked to Tom.
I'm just saying that we can't trust that.
She has shortcomings.
I wonder why that's why it's necessary.
That seems suspicious to me.
I'll make it look like you didn't say that.
What are you doing on Friday night?
Tom's not the only one in Boston.
Will you hold me?
Why don't you like this plan?
I thought you were at work.
That's what you have to decide.
Are you ready to have fun?
Is it you or the enemy?
This picture reminds me of my childhood.
What happened last night?
We used to be neighbors.
Tom wasn't married to Mary.
Winter's about to end.
The titles and rewards are nothing to me.
Where did you find him?
The meeting's over.
I'll find out.
Have you had a good time?
Tom's drinking beer.
You don't want to do it, don't do it!
Tom had a good job.
Is that good or not?
You don't remember anything?
I need cash.
Bring it to me to drink.
What do you want to eat on these exits?
Get up!
Tom wants to be rich and famous.
She laughed at me.
He's afraid we're going astray.
I can't call him home.
You should have apologized to Tom for his rude behavior.
Tom didn't tell me they were married.
The boy ran to his home.
I don't know anything about Japan.
Tom was a taxi driver when he lived in Boston.
Tom looks optimistic.
He's not buying a camera.
I did everything I could to help.
I'm joining you with her.
She has received the highest scores.
Tom can explode.
I think you'll be very busy tonight.
What color do you have with your childhood?
I'm in a hurry.
I work for the welfare of society.
There are people here who need your help.
You can do it.
I was a little scared.
Tom took advantage of a full - time homemaker.
I'd like to come.
Give me some notes or something.
I want to relax in front of the TV tonight, and I don't want to leave the house.
He'll be here today.
Cat's dead.
Now only half the ninth?
Tom went to the store to buy milk.
I'm not allowed to talk to Tom.
I don't mind if you smoke.
It's safe to swim in that lake.
I cut my finger yesterday.
Tom wanted to have dinner with me today.
Tom doesn't look very good.
She put herself on her hands to warm them up.
Tom said he was glad you came back.
My car's covered with blue shit.
Tom doesn't know about my existence.
Tom found Mary's door open.
Lori home?
I decided to marry Tom.
I'm not gonna make that mistake anymore.
I don't care whether we stay or not.
I agreed to marry her.
I've been waiting all my life for this day.
What did they do to you?
Did he pass the exam?
The plane went in a minute.
It wasn't him.
Do you have any friends on a census in Indonesia?
You may need to help her.
Mary lost consciousness.
Tom wanted to play chess with you.
Will you come with me to the concert?
Is that why you're leaving?
If I had time, I'd be happy to introduce you.
I don't know her phone number.
Where's your zone?
I can't let you risk your life.
You're photogenic.
Read this book!
It won't happen again.
Let's talk about basketball.
Tom came to see Mary, not me.
I don't think I can do this for you.
"Hello," said the wolf to Tom.
Where are you?
I can't hear you die yesterday.
I'm sick of it.
She had no food.
I don't think Tom knows how long.
They're running.
The road does not correspond to the number of cars passing through it.
You seem to be afraid of my dog.
Attack!
Look at the price.
You don't have to come to the congregation.
I was somewhere else.
Do you have any more questions?
A new proposal as a message in a bottle: it will ever be moved.
You won't find work here.
Can you listen to me for a minute?
They loved you all.
He and I are family souls.
I have a granddaughter of your age.
I'm sorry I took your party.
I don't need a doctor.
Is that a bear?
How did you meet him?
I've never worked with her.
She's beginning to sink into her new office.
Let us take care of it.
I think you're sitting in my place.
I planned to do it yesterday.
Now it's a little early to drink alcohol, isn't it?
My parents don't like my manner of dress.
Anyone who wants to stay can stay.
That'll be interesting.
I hit him with a knife and I hit him hard.
Because, worse?
It's not expensive.
Can I take your hand?
He's green.
Tom heard the noise.
Tom gave Mary his phone number.
Who wants to cut the cake?
Tom wasn't lying all night.
Open the door!
You called the police.
You're too young to worry about the cellulite.
The series needs to start watching when all the seasons are gone!
Road accidents occur every day.
Where'd you guys go to get hit by a lie?
You've been to the barricade?
It's a fascinating prospect.
I thought you'd never ask.
Give me a handkerchief.
The only way to find out what happened is to ask Tom.
I haven't slept for two days.
She was afraid to travel alone.
You should find another way out of this situation.
Get out of here.
Are you sure you want to do this?
Let's take a picture together.
I broke into the exam.
They've already known about it.
You'd better go help her.
The footballer made a huge mistake.
They're coming, too?
She sleeps like a baby.
Tom forgot to let go of the brakes.
That song reminds me of one girl.
Tom says it's urgent.
You don't know who I am.
Blow up the whole building.
Tom kissed Mary, and they got married.
It's my cat.
Do you have any children?
Tom didn't want to have breakfast.
That's why they like it.
Tom doesn't even know why he was expelled from school.
Tom is a hopeless idiot.
It won't let me sleep at night.
He was transferred to another department.
I think you need some help.
Don't look at me!
I was in Boston last month.
Let go of the cat.
I know you're all rabbits.
Tom thinks that removing products is a sin.
Don't look at me like that.
The road in this place disappears to the right.
Tom's not busy right now.
When did you see Tom?
Why haven't you talked to Tom yet?
I'll never listen to you again.
I don't doubt it.
I'm glad you helped me.
I think your English has improved a lot.
Let's go to church.
Tom's potion whiskey.
Was it hard?
He's responding.
I've never met him before.
How much was he worth?
I need to see you right away.
I'm not hungry at all.
Show me your passport, please.
The sharks eat fish.
I'm the same as I was before.
Do you know the boy who's crying?
No one knew about it.
It's just amazing.
He said he'd never do that.
The thief's gonna steal the cow.
Tom's not swimming very well, is he?
I didn't give it to them.
Tom and I went fishing.
He was just a little old-fashioned.
How do we do that?
I can't believe Tom really doesn't want to go with us to Boston next week.
Don't let them in.
It's all happening.
What day is it today?
So let's give it another chance.
I just want you to take me the way I am.
I'm a regular guy.
Wake me up before you wake up.
Paul kissed Lily in the mouth?
Why don't you go there?
Tom didn't say he'd come with us.
Tom died the day after.
Tom and I should stick together.
I just heard good about him.
I don't work here anymore.
Which one do you prefer?
Here's my ticket.
Don't compare yourself with us.
I saw the car exploded.
Window here.
Tom's mad at me.
Tell me more about Tom.
He's right behind you.
I'll never throw out my Plaston.
I don't want Tom to see me like that.
Stay calm!
What's your favorite TV show?
You want to go to the movies tomorrow?
Thank you for your concern.
Chemodan Tom is empty.
Oh, my God, it's burning!
I'm afraid you're going to lose.
I like to go to school.
I offered to help.
I'll be back in Canada tomorrow.
Thank your son for me.
Looks like her father's a lawyer.
I want to see the volcano.
I know the owner.
Your dog.
What do you mean?
You can't do anything about it.
Tell me because I'm going to go home today.
They need you.
It's orange.
What else can I do to help you?
I'm trying to impress her.
Don't you see what happened?
I didn't want to worry about him.
The officer took courage in his men.
Tom will never find her.
In any case, I'm thinking about trying things like that.
I don't really understand the desire.
For the first time, I'm making a home of meat on my throat.
You're avoiding me.
Why did they do that?
Tom would have apologized to Mary if he thought it was important.
How many zonites do you have?
You're a gentleman.
Tom quickly became very famous.
It was all known.
If you want to be free, destroy your TV.
You mustn't lie.
I know Tom's gonna pay for it.
Mom, look what I found.
It's interesting what Tom meant.
I already knew that.
I've never met Tom.
Maybe she said so.
Who told you the story?
I don't want to argue with you.
I saw him look at you.
Tom was skeptical.
Tom must be home.
She was the one I was thinking about.
Tom showed the police his driving rights.
I'm shaking every month.
I told you I don't know Tom.
I didn't tell you to release them.
It's an acid apple.
The number of tickets was limited.
Send me a new directory.
That must have been expensive.
Let's not talk about school.
I don't know where she is.
If you go fishing tomorrow, I'll go too.
Are you going to work at home?
According to mythology, Prometheus had taken a sacred fire from God.
Welcome to the world of physics.
I wish we could spend more time together.
I know how dangerous Tom is.
All passengers were able to get out of the bus before it was burned.
I want to help you understand that.
You speak French better than me.
There's a lot of talented people in our city, but Tom doesn't belong to them.
You have six unread messages.
Bring your best game.
We're taking checks.
My bike's gone.
The stars died in the night sky.

Listen to what the teacher says.
She looks pretty much like Marilyn Monroe.

I'm stronger than you.
She was deeply sorry for her life.
I don't think Tom knows what he's doing.
I swear I didn't see her.
I really loved him.

It's your dog.

Maybe you don't have to tell me.
Coffee, nagher, so expensive.
She's an honest man.
We'll miss you.
This is for me.
I'm learning to drive.
I know it's impossible.
This morning is awfully hot.
Tom denied everything.
We'd better get ready early, because the train won't wait.
He likes you, too?
I see you from time to time.
The noise was working on my nerves.
Tell me because I'd like to help.
Do you want proof?
We've got problems, and we'll be fine.
I did everything Tom wanted me to do.
You need to put your feet on your feet.
I heard strange sounds coming from his room.
My mother's playing for the piano.
That's why I really wanted to sleep.

Can I eat it?
Drink enough water.
I'd like to make more money.

Tom never went to Australia.
Tell me when you're ready.
We've achieved a lot in the last three years.
Give me your word, please.
It could have been either of us.
We asked what to do.
You asked them why?
The enemy is the mind of a grammaphone, regardless of whether it agrees or disagrees with what record is currently being played.
I'm in the pajamas.
It's a very simple proposal to move.
Don't screw up.

Tom can't hide his emotions.
I just got it, you know?
Tom often travels to Boston.
I love instrument music.
Listen, someone's calling you.
I've been waiting for this all my life.
Get up there tomorrow.
I'm here for work.
I'm worried Tom's going to go wrong.
What's your favorite number?
I want half the third ready report to be on my desk.
That's why he's gonna need it.
Your friends won't have enough of you.
Tom leaned on the wings of the wing, held in his hand a drink.
Have a good time.
Let's not go there today.
I was honest with him.
He won't tell me what happened.
Can I see your driver's license?
You were invited, too.
Tom and Mary together for three years.
You and I look very alike.
One of those men was Tom.
Tom died in Mary's hands.
I always do.
Tom and Mary were not married.
He said it's so good to see you.
I think you need more.
You may not remember me, but I remember you.
You know who killed her?
I couldn't decide what to do.
I just wanted to teach you a lesson.
I don't care whether you go or not.
Tom certainly did a great job.
I'll tell you what I know about Tom.
You want to take a look at that?
Ask yourself that question.
Tom's a criminal's past.
Tom showed up for John and Mary's wedding.
How many planes do you have?
He committed suicide to commit his sin.
It's very suspicious that he's still alive.

I'm popular.
When will we use them?
How much did it cost?
I thought we were friends.
Tom touched Mary's shoulder.
When was the last time you went to the zoo?
Friends congratulated me on my success.
Nobody hates you.
Tom let Mary use his phone.
Call me tomorrow morning, please.
I've just been raised.
Tell her I'm kneeling on her.
I knew it would happen.
How long have you been writing this report?
You want me to be a company of why and Mary?
He had a radio.
Then I started to understand.
Let's try!
He and I are friends.
What you said upset her.
Tom didn't do anything like that.
I think you'll like it here.
I'm doing my imagination.
We've had a great time.
I've never seen you laugh.
Clearly, you love Russian very much.
Will you help me?
I bought something.
You're not going like that, are you?
I spent the last Sunday reading the novels.
All my friends say that.
Tom's watching too much TV.
I can walk there.
You're drinking milk, aren't you?
Please tell me what you'll do.
How much longer are you planning on going to Boston?
You should've kept it a secret.
I like the idea.
You need to use the tools.
Tom can barely move.
Let me guess.
I knew you'd be mad at me.
It's over for poor Tom.
He took a cab to the station.
Everyone's welcome.
Forty people were present.
It's very hot today.
I'm afraid I can't finish the report on time.
She said she really wants to sleep.
I'll tell him you were here.
He's been hired.
It's a long trip.
The students keep asking him questions.
We tried to protect her.
Tom's a fortune-winner for the sale of supported cars.
Where's the registration?
I didn't translate that.
The whole story would take a lot of time.
All the apples were cut.
Are you asking me for help?
I'm so tired today.
I'll be busy all day tomorrow.
I hate sand.
I didn't forget to give it to him.
My sister became a good pianist.
We have a package here for Tom.
I'll do everything I can.
Mary's been drinking with her lips.
He'll break up.
It's a problem that's hard to solve.
Tom brought two boxes to the warehouse.
She's a lot more successful than I am.
Well, that's a difficult question.
He did it himself.
Switzerland is one of the best countries in the world.
You could at least take a shower.
I'm sure Tom will help you.
You love your sweet little dog?
I hope you like it here.
I've had a great time.
You and I are one year old.
Do you have any plans yet?
I'm out of here.
Just sign here.
Tom said Mary was stupid.
How fast!
We have five lessons in English every week.
Tom said he felt happy.
The door is locked.
One more time!
Tom's gonna hear me get older.
I'm a reporter.
Don't you want to know who took her?
What made Tom so angry?
Selecting a car is a bad idea.
Tom took his clothes off and turned around.
Why can't I go with you?
Tom wasn't waiting for Mary.
It's not as hard as you think.
I've got a couple of presents.
He was welcomed wherever he went.
The big dog's always around him.
You don't have to sleep.
It's a lion.
I don't care about sports.
I've never really liked you.
What's Tom doing here?
The teacher warned us that the test would be difficult.
I'm not running away like a rabbit.
I'm filming a movie.
He won her love.
I wanted to see you again.
Wetness is pretty high.
I don't remember how I did it.
I'm getting married next Saturday.
You're not going to the concert with me?
Tom's staying for dinner?
I don't think Tom understood what he had to do.
Try not to cry.
Tell him to be here by half a third.
I never got up on Fuji.
What are you doing here so late?
She's not home, she's at work.
I've served in intelligence.
Kate is smarter than any other student in our class.
We have to wait for him.
I only know him by name.
I like to live with her.
Wait for her.
Forever is a long time.
How's the new job?
Why do you believe that?
I don't know much about it.
Maybe I should stay in Boston for a week or so.
I have your key.
How big a box do you need?
I see yours, where are mine?
It doesn't fit in any category.
Have you ever saved someone's life?
What's the deal?
Are you ready?
Don't be me by half the third.
It's not the end of the world.
Their progress has been halted by a large river.
That's why we need protection.
We all liked him.
Why do you think Tom isn't here today?
I promise to be punctual.
You got the offer wrong.
I had a really good evening, but not today.
What kind of movie is it?
What is the advantage of this technology?
I'm counting on Tom to be polite.
They wouldn't let me go.
How did you do that?
I gave you what you asked.
Boston needs to see.
My father owns a restaurant.
Tom worked as a French teacher in Australia.
He sent weapons against me.
I was born in Boston.
I love fries.
So there was someone to tell their story.
You're getting old.
You have a stunning house.
I'm retired.
We won't have enough of you.
We didn't do anything!
How many people died yesterday?
I'll get you brandy.
Forgive her for this time.
Why do you have such big eyes?
I'd like to ask you a few questions now.
I only heard Tom play the piano once.
Can you hear me now?
I didn't order that.
Tom's sorry?
They trusted him.
Do you like digital torture?
How much is the ticket for the concert?
Tom didn't understand anything.
Tom always says that.
Nobody has the right to tell you how to live your life.
It was a good day.
She put my head on my chest to listen to my heartbeat.
We won.
They announced they were looking for a cook.
He's coming to Paris tomorrow.
Don't ever forget that.
You want to be a lawyer.
They laughed at each other.
Take one of these pills.
Who can be sure?
We're not coming back.
I'm still looking for Tom.
Did you answer Tom's question?
You've made it all up.
I'll be there on October 20th.
Don't forget to take a camera with you.
I was totally shocked.
Please finish this work by Monday.
I broke the bend.
I think it's time for me to change my job.
Let's just say I'm better off, Tom.

It was too easy.
In the midst of a foolish love bond, her heart became ever more hardened.

The kids are playing in the league.
Tom is the tallest boy we have in the group.
We live on planet Earth.
It's a tall tree.
I need to see you.
You don't really think Tom would kill himself, do you?
Her death was a powerful blow to him.
She's busy now, so she can't talk to you.
No way.
He likes it.
I'm just lucky.
I see when men love women, they give them only a small portion of their lives, but women love, they give everything.

Don't make him any trouble.
Mary had a black sweater when I met her.
I did it without permission.

Tom told Mary not to do what she asked him to do.
I won't have you.
Tom and Mary like to talk about celebrities.
What didn't you like?

Many people don't do that at all.

I want to be happy.
You're going to lose.
We've seen it before.
How many legs did you buy?
We never give up hope.
What happened to the book I put here yesterday?
I don't even talk about the price, I don't care.
I want to know who started it.
I didn't think they'd punish me.
Write it as a quarantine.
We didn't build it.
You'd better go help him.
Is that okay?
Tomorrow morning they're selling tickets to the Shakiri concert.
It was better today.
I know Tom's a brave man.
I got married early.
It's not a rat.
I don't want to scare you.
Tom told me Mary wouldn't want to go.
Have you talked to doctors yet?
No one's seen it.
Mary is an outstanding artist.
I think he's right.
Everybody loves money.
They went astray in the woods.
When was the last time you ate?
I have a heart pain.
My father won't let me in a movie.
I saw the boat tonnet.
Instead of going to work, I spent the whole day at home.
I'll back you up.
I didn't talk to Tom.
They decided to work harder.
It's not sold.
Who's your neighbor?
My dad usually watches the TV after dinner.
He's drinking wine.
Please cut yourself a apple pie, I've prepared it for you.
I don't think Tom understood the question.
You have to stop her.
You'll make it in time if you leave now.
There was no special problem with Tom.
The darkness didn't hide it.
I invited him to dinner.
I'm sure it'll be easy to find a place.
I took two aspirin tablets from the main pain.
You're in my heart.
He took me to the last dig.
Don't laugh!
Love doesn't owe anyone.
If you come to that right now, you'll probably stop watching it.
I saw you in the park with Tom.
I didn't mean to offend them.
I'd better go find them.
My motorcycle broke down on the road.
Tom made himself without a shirt.
In what kingdom was this church built?
Soon we'll be able to put you in jail.
I'm starting to think you're serious.
I'm not coming back.
I'm sure Tom would like to help.
It's Joanna.
I made so many mistakes.
How can humans do such things?
That's why I'm really sorry.
I like your eyes.
The rainwater's coming through this tube.
I always thought Tom was a close friend.
I'm one of those girls who hang out with guys.
Don't worry, I have insurance.
Tom will be here with me.
My dad's having a hard time letting go of drinking.
Nobody's offering you to do this.
He works in this company from Monday to Sunday.
Mary forgot to shut the car down.
I'm old.
Tom left with Mary.
Tom started laughing.
I'll call you tomorrow.
Tom has telepathic abilities.
Who is he by nationality?
Tom was sitting with John in one of the cameras.
I didn't want to swim.
He was drinking beer.
In our time, men are more difficult to be... themselves.
I'll never talk to him again.
Shh, Tom, wake up!
I'll cut my noses off.
I did what I promised to do for them.
I'm a new teacher.
They're all children.
She went out and yelled at me.
Have you taken your medicine?
The rabbits are very nice.
She doesn't trust him.
Time on our side.
You don't know him?
I'm still in shock.
Do you like bowling?
I don't want to hurt my son's feelings.
You wanted to tell me something?
I doubt Tom's still mad.
You'll be better in the morning.
What do you want to tell them?
We'll take her home.
Do you feel the smell of chicken resin?
It didn't happen here.
When will your father come home?
I understand.
Tom gave Mary a book.
I'm trying to help them.
I just got out of my mind.
In Tom's patient.
She didn't buy the bread.
Tom and Mary are not married.
Tom's trying to escape.
You're obviously tired.
We're champions.
Tom's glaucoma.
Tom said it wasn't enough.
Tom asked Mary to bring the salad to the party.
Her hair's wet since then.
I'm just buying a soft toilet paper.
I saw Tom again last night.
Tom sat on the floor between the door and Mary.
How do you know how heavy it is?
The board manager is a master of compliments.
Tom's married to Mary, right?
All the rocks in the park were busy.
Someone needs to tell her that.
I've got it all done.
Vermont is on the border with Canada.
He had to live in one room with his brother.
I didn't imbecile.
You're gonna start it all, aren't you?
I can't afford it.
He has a brother in Tokyo.
The dynamite invented Alfred Nobel in 1857.
We need to get involved.
Tom told Mary not to worry.
You can come down if you want.
I know you don't have to do this.
I suggest you let them go.
Take my eyes.
I've already spoken to this student.
What is the chemical sign of bromoacid acid?
We have a lot of money.
It's like looking for a needle in the haystack.
I asked Tom.
So we need to talk to a lawyer.
I think you should do it.
Key!
You don't want to help them?
Tom was dressed like a court man.
I respect his views, even though he disagrees with many of them.
The sky is in the center of the city.
Who sent you?
She tied his sweater.
I don't think Tom's gonna want to go to Boston with you.
Tom wanted Mary to know.
After nine calls for cash?
You don't have to go.
Put it on the floor.
If only I could go with her.
Tell her not.
He didn't say anything.
They don't like you, do they?
How much money do you owe us?
Don't be late for school.
We didn't have a chance to win.
You've been planning on staying?
We're in a hurry and we're out of here.
There's a big garden behind the house.
You're straight.
Be careful, don't push anything at your feet.
Start each meal with soup.
I'm afraid to be alone.
What did she whisper to you?
We couldn't find anything.
Did you even call him?
He didn't stop the car.
He sat right opposite me.
The kite was open.
It's my fault.
I'm unpopular.
It's his first day at school.
I want to meet you before I die.
She's beautiful, too.
He told me he wasn't sure.
Can I suggest another strategy?
They're dead.
Apples big.
You didn't know Tom was living in Boston?
I don't want Tom to worry about it.
She's driving?
I need to go to the bathroom.
I'm a doctor.
Tom was interested in listening.
I think they're happy.
Do you understand Tom?
Let's go to the car.
You're bothering me.
She wondered how his lips would taste.
A good coach is training this team.
The tree hurts.
The train was stopped because of heavy snow.
Why don't you give it to them?
What did you take from me that I don't want to go?
You need to go and support the girl.
That was my plan.
When was the last time you saw her?
I told him I was wrong.
I'm a citizen of the United States.
He hates himself.
You're looking for this book, aren't you?
It must have been you.
Mary left me in the closet.
Is that drinking water?
She doesn't think so.
You live there?
What would you eat?
You don't know her?
I didn't ask if Tom was planning to do it or not.
I'm falling.
I wasn't able to come to his birthday.
I thought Tom would be disappointed in me.
Tom's wearing a new shoe.
Last year she learned to ride a bicycle.
Help us.
I don't have to thank you.
Since it was winter, he didn't go out the street.
I'm going down the street, I've seen my friend.
How many houses on your street?
The elephants are made of ivory.
I'm not a kid anymore.
"What's life, Mike?" "My name's Tom."
Her native French.
It's a pretty awkward coat.
She stopped smoking.
Tom was married then.
I bought this book.
Naiveness is its only positive quality.
My hobby is collecting insects.
The boy Tom lived in Boston.
I haven't eaten for six days.
Can I tell them about this?
She's been quiet all day.
It doesn't matter what he can say, don't believe him.
I went further.
Tom and Mary hope their next child will be a boy.
Mary is always very welcoming, and she has a nice smile.
I won't let her die.
In all cultures, babies fall asleep under their knees.
It's the best restaurant I know.
You could know a lot of them if you only listened.
What was I supposed to do in that situation?
I'm sorry he upset you.
The one who never left the borders of his country is a lot of prejudice.
It's amazing how quiet it gets when snow falls.
Tom's helping a woman.
He's in her room.
I didn't think you'd come back.
For many people in India, cows are sacred animals.
I turned on the imagination.
I thought we could do that.
My mom was against me riding alone.
I'm sorry, I didn't get it.
You know what you're doing, right?
You can't trust the car transfer.
She hit me, not him.
You won't understand.
I was with her.
I can't believe you're getting married.
In this river full of fish.
His success was nothing but a miracle.
We're partners with her.
Tom said I should talk to you.
Have you ever had these symptoms?
Locked released.
What, they said, did it happen?
Couldn't you leave the door open?
That'll have to wait.
I wasn't alone.
I needed them.
He's twice my age.
Tom knows they made a mistake.
In Japan, it's a soft climate.
Check again.
Don't judge Tom.
My mom finally came home.
I have four brothers.
I didn't let him do what he wanted.
He replaced the traumatized game.
Tom said he doesn't believe in it.
Our trip was very smooth.
It's inevitable that I'm going to France one day, I just don't know when.
When I woke up, it was almost noon.
Tom's only getting sick.
I'm going to Boston in October.
I know Tom's wife.
I agree with your opinion on taxes.
Tom's watching.
The rain has stopped, it's possible to open the window again.
I've never been like this before.
I don't think Tom's lost.
I was going out when I called.
I don't have to endure it.
Always take the road between the right and the left.
We're asked to be presented in turn.
I'd like to ask you a few more questions.
I don't like rain.
Maybe she's nice, but I don't like her.
I can let you go if you want.
Tom told Mary that she was wasting her time.
Do you still have a problem with that?
I never asked her.
Nothing relaxes like a hot tub.
I really don't have that much time.
How can I cancel my wedding?
There's an open book on the table.
I'm sorry, I totally forgot about it.
You don't have to regret it.
She's my mistress!
Your voice sounds like a melodic song cheese to me.
What kind of marriage?
I thought Tom could help.
Who called me?
What's your favorite American beer?
Tom knew why Mary didn't like it.
My fingers were left on fingerprints.
Chemia is a remarkable science.
I feel like my French isn't getting much better.
How can I best get a passport?
Maybe you're in a position to help out.
Tom is the best drummer I know.
I didn't know Tom was your boss.
He needs you.
They're ready.
Tom didn't pay attention to Mary all day.
Tom's got fat hair.
Tom doesn't want to sell the house, but he doesn't have a choice.
There's more light outside.
I gave my sister a speech.
It's my father's car, but she'll be mine soon.
Did you forget what his name was?
If I had time to do this, I would.
Do you see Tom's boat?
Big Foma?
This medicine will help you.
Stop the noise.
I'm in pain.
Do you know how I was busy?
Tom pretended to be busy.
I can trust someone.
She's a big-town sex fan.
You're so impatient.
You said you wanted it.
Talk to him well.
Tom wants to take my car tomorrow.
Do you often have to do that?
Mary told me about her plans.
I thought you'd agree with me.
Christ works, stop it!
Nothing compares to a glass of beer after a long working day.
What is it?
Tom left his bag.
Here are a few interesting facts.
How much time do you need?
Let's move over here.
Are you in new shoes?
You can leave if you want.
Did you find the book you wanted?
That's what my mom said.
She cut the makeup when she saw the dog.
He's no bigger than me.
Smoking's strictly threatened.
That Persian is beautiful.
Do you see it?
Tom's not in the mood for it.
You shouldn't have gone to such a dangerous place.
Good job!
You used to say that to yourself.
Here's a few letters for you.
It is almost unimaginable that a scientist would make such a fundamental mistake.
He has no evidence.
You look bad.
He was a very good swimmer when he was young.
I'm writing to my friend.
He's very good at tennis.
She led the students astray.
She said she was a Canadian.
Don't talk to anyone.
And when were you going to tell me?
I didn't want to tell you that.
I filled the kitchen up.
Go straight.
I'm too tired to think about it right now.
What house do you live in?
I told them it wasn't nice.
What are we living for?
Will there be rain today?
We know about her.
You could have helped us.
I drive a car a lot.
That's why I don't like the end of the movie.
Just get inside.
Just ask for his forgiveness.
I'm trying to protect them.
Tom did a great job.
I'm two of you.
I didn't know it was legal.
I love adventures.
Tom's in the library.
You were in school then?
You haven't changed.
I don't know who it was.
Why didn't you wait for us?
I didn't know.
Why didn't you sing with us?
Are you enough?
I decided to forgive Tom.
I'm starting to enjoy myself.
Tomorrow's gonna be a big snowfall.
We decided to hold the meeting on the next Sunday.
She thinks she can prove it.
When was the last time you played golf?
Are we poor?
I don't know Tom's name.
We have the same dentist.
Not all Brazilians like carnival.
I don't think Tom knows what's going on.
To whom did Tom sell his car?
Tom's moaning.
I have to make money to buy a computer.
Don't laugh at strangers.
I don't know them.
If you could choose genes for your children, would they?
So Mary and I need to rest.
It's easy to sleep.
It could have been worse.
Tom did his part.
Tom doesn't know where Mary's keys are.
What book are you looking for?
I'm sleeping a little.
You'll get there sometime.
Tom's having a good time with Mary.
"You need my money." "No, you don't."
He walked in and stood on his knees.
You don't have to go there if you don't want to.
This song always reminds me of my childhood.
Tom did this for you?
I don't think Tom knows I love Mary.
He says he's rich.
Tom works three times more than Mary.
I drank milk.
It'll snow tomorrow.
Isn't life remarkable?
When it comes to getting ready, no one compares to Mary.
You haven't been on your own lately.
Tom lost his leg when he attacked the shark.
I made it for you.
We'll do it as soon as we can.
Next year, I'll be three times your age.
Can you tell me what happened?
Show me your stamp collection.
It'll take forever.
Tom's quite unknown to Mary.
It looks like no one knows.
Tell Mary I want to talk to her.
How did you know who to give it to?
This tissue fits your skin.
I fell in love with you.
It's almost winter.
I think Tom lied to me.
We're all very proud of her.
Tom's parents told him not to.
Tom and I were wondering.
I'm fine.
Tom decided to give up his professional guitar game.
I'm married now.
It was just a couple of times.
This time you've gone too far.
It's working.
Are you going to see Tom before you leave?
No wonder, Tom answered.
We want to take the apartment to the city.
They spoke more French.
It's extremely expensive.
He's not driving anymore.
I didn't know what else to do.
They haven't woken up yet.
Tom for a couple of inches above Mary.
I'm glad you offered it.
It's hard to answer your question.
You don't believe her?
English is the world language.
Sounds simple.
Can I get a copy of these?
I just said 'cause he's gonna leave Mary in the room.
You didn't know Tom lived in Boston when he was a kid?
Tell them what I told you.
Tom's looking for a job.
Why do you need milk?
Stay with me, Dad, I'm afraid of the dark.
The situation is getting worse.
I choose where to taste.
Tom decided to buy a supported car instead of a new one.
I just wanted to wish you luck.
She's breaking up.
I won't let you take my kids.
Don't give them to him.
Run, and they'll arrest you.
Mary said she was very tired.
Tom made himself a rule to meditate every morning.
Have you checked your bills?
He tried to make a short story.
A room without books, like a body without soul.
Why did God hurt us so much?
What's your brother doing?
We need a volunteer.
Why is Tom so sure it won't happen again?
I haven't seen you in a hundred years.
I called Tony yesterday.
It's easy to make an impression on her.
You're old enough to do this on your own.
Aristotle believed that the Earth was the center of the universe.
It's interesting that Tom actually meant it.
No one understands me.
So many stars in heaven, I can't read them.
They all came back and looked at us.
Let me see.
White bears live in the Arctic.
I told you I was the best of all.
I told you Tom wanted to go to Boston.
Tom doesn't have to ask me to do something a couple of times.
So let the dish be washed by the one who loses his wallet.
What a failure!
I would never do that.
Have you ever been to Boston?
He said Russian — at least, he told me that.
Tom is a third grader.
Will you stay long?
I'm not a woman.
She's got a tall father.
The train was overloaded.
The house is red.
I think I'll start with a bottle of beer.
You don't know Boston well, do you?
The orchestra started playing.
Mary was in a pirate suit.
It's not my wife.
Why didn't you mention it earlier?
Tom didn't want to be a hit man.
He was born at seven a.m. on 5 June 1970.
I'm afraid your plan won't work.
Jane and Kate are twins.
Tom's just white meat.
Thank you for helping.
We only have three rules.
She bought one of herself.
Security didn't see Tom.
In recent years, Tom has seen a lot of things.
I helped carry those bags.
They have plenty of time.
Fifteen to five is equal to seventy-five.
I live in this hotel.
I don't want to know anything anymore.
You still don't know what he's gonna say.
My hands are up.
I've been driving a woman all the time.
Finally, she did it.
It's a ghastly nonsense that they weren't insured from the fire.
We've got a lot of money.
The examination was broken down into two parts.
When are you going to tell them?
Tom didn't want to talk about his illness.
Hey, you're so boring here!
The book reading compares with the journey.
Tom saw Mary come into the store.
Why aren't you there?
Tom said Mary would probably win.
The Japanese would never do that.
I don't really care about Boston.
She keeps writing letters.
I don't know who to consult.
Turn left on the corner.
Tom taught me to do it.
You can do a lot more.
Give me one, please.
I'm not bringing up disobedient children.
That's what Tom bought me.
What you said made everyone angry.
You're too small for that.
My parents have been married for 30 years.
She showed her talents.
I'd like that to be possible.
I guess you can't do that.
I'm lucky I'm alive.
At Bob's next school festival, for the first time, he's going to play a major role.
You must stay in shape.
I've been plowing seeds all day.
I realized he was an American.
Maybe it's a problem.
Was that a joke?
Forgive me!
Tom has submitted.
All the people of my generation think about it the same way.
I live for it.
Can you jump on the lie?
Duke reigns in many lands.
Well, they're having fun.
He told me he was very happy.
My dad's getting better.
You'll feel at home.
It's not gonna end well!
He looked like he didn't eat for a few days.
I didn't ask you to go there.
"Who's Norman Finkelstein?" "American politician."
Get out of here!
If it's not selling goods at home, maybe it's a new way to meet girls?
Tom improved the coin.
Why didn't you go to your room?
If there is no God, everything is allowed.
We were both called Mary.
I knew I had to marry him.
Are you still at work?
New?
Don't take anything for granted.
You're in time.
They know too much.
Don't laugh at them.
Please step on the brakes during take-off and landing.
That was why and Mary.
We both love seafood.
I've been waiting a long time.
I rejected the proposal.
You want to come with us?
Tom didn't.
I'm going to have too much time to explain why it doesn't work.
Nothing's changed.
Did you build all of this yourself?
I look forward to the summer vacation.
Can it be formulated differently?
That's where he looks.
Homes are easily lit.
So let's have a party.
Dog's still alive.
I'm going to college.
I know you lied.
It's very convenient.
I'll report this tomorrow.
He was safe.
She's squeaking.
I want to hear your side.
I'll wait for him to come here.
We said what we could do.
Tom doesn't know the size of Mary's shoe.
I need to think about it.
The meeting was scheduled on Tuesday.
My name is Jose.
You forgot to mention that.
We don't need that anymore.
Can I have something to eat?
Tom can do this without our help.
Everybody's ready to go.
She said she could fix it.
Who arranged the meeting?
I'm such a bad guy.
Tom wants to fix it.
I'm not going to have fun tonight.
Mary was the only girl in the grave.
What bird can't fly?
That's what we need to put an end to.
Tom didn't answer right away.
Tom died at the age of seventy.
Life is a gift.
Tom also speaks more French.
The invention of the transistor was a new era.
I'm not in love with Mary.
Did you hear what she said about Alexie?
You look like a girl.
Here's a few photos.
What's going on on the tenth channel?
I hate spinach.
Mother's getting ready for lunch.
Tom's a fireman.
What can I do?
Her son is a genius.
I know you've seen terrible things.
I know a few Canadians.
He's willing to give his emotions.
We were shocked by the news of his death.
Why didn't they go?
I didn't see you.
You're just noticing obvious.
He had cancer.
You're the one responsible for what happened.
It's like hours.
I know where you're going.
You're taking it all for the summer.
Let's get him out of here.
Let's leave it till tomorrow.
Maybe Tom knows more than he tells us.
Let me tell you what you're doing wrong.
I wonder if I can do that.
I don't like doing this.
The janitor stopped talking.
It's on the desk.
I don't want to be late for work.
You don't chew anymore.
Tom was a busy chicken.
Tom gave me a ring.
It's hard to talk to Tom.
I was born in Finland.
Tom didn't want to help me.
Tom said he was worried.
Tom's not used to that kind of weather.
I wonder who's gonna help him put on a snowflake?
I still don't know why Tom did it.
Do you believe in family souls?
What's that noise?
My son has inherited a disease.
That's disgusting.
Is it snow?
I'll call you back.
He dropped the glass.
I don't know if there's a country where you can marry your dog.
Better protection is an attack.
This autumn she's getting married.
I'm sorry, I don't understand.
I thought it'd be easy.
Can we help you?
Is that clear?
I ate five avocados.
The Japanese live on rice and fish.
When are you ready to go?
The investigation began last year with the confiscation of human computer archives from the German city of Magdeburg.
How's life?
I can't tell you what happened.
What did you see?
What did you decide you couldn't do?
We drove back through Boston.
Who's gonna believe that?
Thank you for the correction.
With your mind?
The stars appear at night.
Where did Tom take this scarf?
They wanted proof.
Tom's on his forehead.
Tom can't ride a bike.
I'm not talking on the couch at all.
Why did Tom leave?
Why would you want to be a teacher?
I'm afraid of wild beasts.
How much more money do you need?
Mary laughed at the tears.
I spent $500 a day.
Tell them to go home.
That's where it fits.
They didn't make it in time.
Now seven thirty.
I see you're awake.
I want to know who said that.
Tom got up early to see the light.
The dinosaurs died a long time ago.
I usually get up in steps through one.
Tom's had another year.
I'm around the station.
Tom's a very good boy.
Do you drink?
Are you from Boston?
Put it on my desk.
Tom, get out of the water.
I was very proud of it.
You were ready.
Do you know Brother Tom?
All the eggs can be laid off.
You'll pay for what you did.
I've got it all coming out of my hand today.
I asked them to stay away from this.
Tom only learned to drive in thirty.
I'm glad he didn't get hurt.
Neither Tom nor Mary studied French.
I haven't laughed like that in a long time.
The kitchen knife was not strong enough to cut the meat, so I took advantage of my periphery knife.
Honey, I can explain everything.
You'll soon be able to adapt to the forest life.
Keep the air close to the water.
You're not a child anymore.
I don't want to go to the lake.
They're unpredictable.
I can't laugh in front of the cameras.
We're all set.
The river is deep.
Thank you very much.
I told you that a hundred times.
I'm very cold.
You must say that.
They're dead.
Tom and Mary kissed.
Writing separate words in cases where they are to be written in the same language is a major problem in Norwegian.
What are you doing with the leftovers of the prepared character?
It's been ten years since her death.
Tom met Mary a year ago.
Do you need anything else?
We left soon after that.
This book has to be read.
Tom and Mary took lessons for dinner.
I don't want your tea.
You're always so romantic.
A woman is not a frog — you don't take off her leg.
I'll go after you at 6:00.
So I teach French.
I love learning other languages.
Mary's eyes.
I would like to know how long Tom is planning to be in Australia.
You didn't know I couldn't do that, did you?
How did you feel?
Let's give that a chance.
I like fruit.
Tom snooped.
He's trading cars.
Are you still in touch with her?
"Do you think he'll come?" "I hope he doesn't."
Tom didn't expect Mary to win.
I hate hospital food.
I ate a kuru.
They shot me.
She knows her husband's psychology.
We have to check.
Tom gave Mary a rose.
He couldn't believe his eyes.
They first got on the bus.
Let's wait till Monday.
Does anyone know them here?
There must be a mistake.
He can't afford to take a vacation.
I'm used to smell.
Tom didn't want anyone to know.
How was the day?
It's your fault.
I told you when to come.
Of course, I kept my promise.
Our friendship remained strong.
Have you ever talked to him?
It's a Japanese doll.
Let's get closer to the case.
Tom was sitting on the stairs.
What else does Tom want?
Sometimes the mill is twice in one place.
I'm not kidding.
Leave it behind.
Tom advised Mary not to leave the door open.
Tom blames Mary for John's death.
Decide on your own.
Were you surprised?
We counted the annual rings on the tree that we broke, and we determined that he was thirty years old.
I think I know you all my life.
I want Tom never to write my daughter again.
The rabbits are multiplying fast.
I don't want to discuss this right now.
How much does a clean coat look like?
We'll do it.
Open the gates.
I'm not afraid to go to the cave.
When happiness comes to your door.
You need to listen to her.
I'd like you to know how much you mean to me.
Mary answered the teacher's question.
Tell me openly.
I'll come to anything else.
You don't mind making another cup of coffee when you want it?
I'd like to go back to Tokyo through Gonollulu.
You're not telling me anything I don't know.
I couldn't help them.
Tom left the last one.
Tom signed the request.
Did you try to talk to Tom about it?
You scared them.
She insisted on her innocence.
We don't know much about Tom.
How was the day?
Don't worry about my dog.
Now I understand.
Give me time.
You want them to help?
Tom's nowhere to see.
That's why I told you to come here.
Find out what they said.
Apples are the best fruit.
Can't you close the window?
Tom didn't have a ticket.
We can meet again in the near future.
The trees calmed me down.
He's talking.
I've been sleeping for a while.
Keep me in line.
You have the right to your opinion.
Mary told me she bought him.
I made breakfast.
I'd like to buy two brands of forty-five cents, please.
I'll give you a birthday bike.
Tom began to suspect that something was wrong.
Beer's got beer.
I don't think that's why it's gonna like it.
I thought he was innocent.
I'll wait for you here.
I'd like you to talk to him.
You said she was yours.
Tom's doing his research.
Look at that cat.
I'm divorced.
That's very interesting.
Don't be late.
That's what we're working on.
Everybody's having fun?
Tom's watching a digital TV crash.
We're gonna have to sleep on the street today.
That's what Tom showed Mary, how's it going?
Amazing, isn't it?
I cut the rose.
The school's only five minutes away.
Tom put a bed in the carnival.
Is that the only thing you care about?
Do you see the rose?
Mary tried to hide her tears.
Self-confidence is the key to success.
I just want to be a good father.
I'll send you a link.
I lived in Japan three years ago.
How many more people know about it?
I'm scared.
We didn't meet in Paris.
Are there volunteers?
I told her I wasn't interested.
I'd like to talk to Tom.
People often complain about the weather.
I just need you to sign it.
I felt like something was wrong.
Tom's a brewer.
I'll tell you what to do.
A man born in France, France.
I'm not used to it.
This gift from her.
Do you have a house?
Don't feed the wolf.
Hey, it's me.
Now tell me something about you.
Tom was the only one in the pool.
I'm studying French on my own.
Tom couldn't answer all Mary's questions.
Tom will teach my children French.
Tom says he hasn't eaten for three days.
It doesn't look like Tom's having fun.
There's a few unscrupulous things here.
I had to tell him to get up there.
We're done.
I know you're in love with Tom.
Dick gave me a picture.
You said you'd help her.
Did you really expect Tom to tell you the truth?
I couldn't look at her face.
That could be true.
Someone sent us a gift.
Tom and I have been married for three years.
It's hard to live with Tom, right?
Have you ever seen Tom dance?
Tom asked for my advice.
Tom started crying.
She's got a nail on her.
He would never betray me.
She wasn't sick.
I tried to be nice.
He deliberately tried not to kill me.
You think I'd change my mind?
Tom is an Australian citizen.
Did you buy them?
Tom just looked at Mary and laughed.
I gave them my old coat.
Tom asked to help Mary.
Are you a liberator or a conservator?
We don't know exactly why this is happening.
The presence must be.
I got rid of Leila's computer.
There was a rain in Boston on Monday.
I just don't agree with you.
A new president can be put on, can't he?
I'd like some coffee if you make it.
I'll tell you something.
How much do you want?
They say Venice is a beautiful city.
You should talk to Tom.
It's a Chinese name.
After all, she didn't call back.
The doctor had to wait a long time: he was in surgery.

I went to the museum the other day.
I haven't found a more comfortable and detailed grammar manual yet.
How do you know him?
I'd like to talk to the lab.
At first, I didn't like him, but now I like him.
I forgot the money.
I'm on a eleven-hour train.
I can't dedicate you to my plans.
I broke it.
That's why you said that?
Tom and Mary know each other very well.
You bought a precious coat.
Scientists explain that differently.
What are you doing here?
Do Germans have other concerns in their lives except for consumption?
Does she have a brother or a sister?
Hey, what are you doing?
They sell both.
It's a very cheap card.
Why?
It's my favorite project.
We don't have any water.
Don't you want to introduce yourself?
Don't worry, even if I drink, it doesn't affect how I drive a car.
Tom told me he'd stay home.
I lived in a three-room apartment when I was in Boston.
Don't look at it.
On the contrary, our school has a bus stop.
So it's just more than thirty.
Tom's bringing the neighborhood.
"Oh, I'm dying," said Pierreette, falling on his knees.
After I got on the train, I noticed I forgot the paper at home.
How long after Tom died?
Are you playing guitar?
We hope we don't have to do that.
The situation is under control.
Who's there?
Today's payday?
Obviously, that's inevitable.
It's your fault, not me.
I wanted everything.
We'll do it tomorrow.
Shut up!
Don't trust him.
What search system do you use?
I swore I would never do that to anyone.

How rude of you!
You said you wanted me to do it.
Dan realized he was in love with Linda.
I saw Mary leave the house.
Couldn't you get out of the room?
Tom needed an explanation.
He's my wife's friend, not mine.
Tom told me he didn't want to move to Australia.
Tom promised he wouldn't cry.
So I told you all about what we did yesterday.
I'm so glad.
I need to feed my baby's chest.
Drinking is a food that is suitable for modern life.
Do you know where the dog is?
Tom said he wasn't mad at Mary.
Why am I always here?
I'd be surprised if Tom won.
We don't know English at all.
I couldn't do anything for Tom.
I don't think I would.
The door doesn't want to close.
I thought Tom hated Mary.
I'm a Japanese student.
You don't have to.
Well, I think it's time to tell this story.
I haven't singed for years.
Tom's not dating Mary anymore.
Tom gave me this tie.
Why would that make you feel better about your age?
Come on in the third, please.
I feel like you don't really want me to win.

I went to the shoe shop yesterday.
We found out he was innocent.
Tom was the only one who didn't know that Mary was moving to Boston.
They live with you?
Don't write red ink.
Tom shouldn't have yelled at me.
I don't want to see you.
Keep your hands on the wheel.
He'll play tennis tomorrow.
I saw your rights.
I didn't leave hope.
I'm quiet.
And that continued until early morning.
I have a very flat schedule.
That's his answer to my letter.
People with no sense of humor are like a bear with no flowers.

You're not familiar with Brother Tom, are you?
I don't have time to do politics.
It was a strange story.

How did you come to that conclusion?
Who do you know in Boston?
I'm happy because from today on we're not going to have school until September.
I think you'll have to help me.
Hi, it's Sepide.
I heard, Tom more.
I'm sorry you didn't come with us.

Tom didn't want to admit it in his own ignorance.
I tried to protect you.
She wanted to meet you.
You're the only Canadian I've ever met.
I'm too tired to concentrate on this problem right now.
I wanted to tell him something, but I didn't.
This problem must be remembered.

She's too weak.
You can't be here.

You need to do this now.
Tom would never do what you accused him of.
Tom's not the only one late.
Let me get you something to drink.
Is it true you like salty coffee?
I never thought Tom would want to do that.
Once you made a promise, you had to keep it.
I hope you don't try.
Children are forbidden to smoke.
You're starting now.
