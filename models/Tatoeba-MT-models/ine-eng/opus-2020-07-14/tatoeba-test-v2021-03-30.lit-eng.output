I don't have a clue.
Don't rush it like that.
Why are you so angry?
There are many words I don't understand.
Could I get a cup of tea?
I have to tell her the truth tomorrow.
My dream is to learn the Totor language in Kazan.
Those students.
I'd like to buy a map.
You're gonna have to drive.
Take your brother with you.
Betty always managed to get what she wanted.
You didn't tell him anything?
Stay with me, ladies and gentlemen.
She knows exactly what she wants.
Hello.
Did Thomas forgive you for what you did last week?
Good morning, time to go.
The baby spent the whole night.
She didn't like it in town.
This size is too big for me.
It won't change anything.
Do what you want.
That man you saw yesterday is my uncle.
I don't like winter.
I gave Tom a chance.
We played golf without rain.
What kind of test is this?
He told me his life story.
I decided to be happy because it was good for my health.
I'll wait here until he gets back.
Teacher's training.
What do you see?
What do you see?
That's not what you think!
In that shop, you can buy a dog yourself.
He likes sweet tea.
You have to do the same.
It's simple and intuitive.
How many hours a week do you work?
Yes, you do.
They're not helping.
Please contact me as soon as you get to Boston.
She asked me who came first.
We'll all die sooner or later.
How long will it take?
It's a shadow.
Where is the German Embassy?
Be friendly.
This rose is amazing.
But he knew it couldn't continue.
Probably not.
I want it too!
She's looking but she can't see anything.
He can't eat any sweets today.
She's eating.
I'd like to travel around the world.
Do you like Italian?
I've been in prison for five years.
I didn't.
Any universe that is simple enough to understand it is too simple to create a mind that could understand it.
We didn't have to rush.
Excuse me?
It doesn't matter which team wins the game.
He's running.
This dress is too big for me.
Get in and get in your car.
Bring her some salads.
We're in war.
She didn't answer.
I've heard that Mary wants a divorce.
Is this an eagle or a doll?
My father's coming home tomorrow.
This mountain is covered with snow all year round.
Never lose hope.
Can I give you a drink?
This book belongs to the libraries.
I want to die with Getter Jaani.
From milk we produce cheese and butter.
When I was in high school, I was up at 6: 00 a.m. every day.
You guys are the best shot.
How can you say something like that?
Be careful!
Clearly you've done this before.
Did you get a letter?
Two years ago, I couldn't really play basketball.
What's the difference?
You're guilty.
She rejected my request.
What do you give priority to?
I like Korean food.
He invited me to lunch.
You're still green.
There's nothing here.
You never know what's going to happen in the future.
We're producing a vortex of dry form.
Everybody likes greens.
What did you do to deserve this?
Look at the example given above.
Their flight seemed very funny.
I wanted to be a philosopher.
You're not fast enough.
We left the door open.
Could there be a nine?
Why did you call?
They discussed the problem.
If I hadn't received his help, I'd be dead.
He was almost asleep.
I have one brother.
Where did you come from?
Do you like this color?
Isn't it strange that Tom is still not here?
Millions lost their lives during the war.
Compare your sentence with that on the table.
She's happy to meet him.
They need our help.
Did you get Tom's message?
I don't like the way he talks.
I don't know what's going on with me anymore.
I've learned a lot from him.
He killed that man.
Don't trust (not waiting) too much.
That red hat is old.
He plays golf every Sunday.
Be creative.
I couldn't understand what he said.
Close the door.
I'm always tired.
He's a weird guy.
Go back to your place.
Be friendly.
Isn't that a wonderful morning?
It's at least a story.
I have more and more yellow hair.
He turned off the light.
I'm not asleep.
The sky is blue.
The old woman fell apart and could not rise.
They're asleep after the movie.
You can use my dictionary.
I want to talk to your uncle.
You like Tom.
He's rarely staying at home on Sundays.
When would you like to see him?
Thomas began to cry for help.
His son's eight.
If I had wings, I'd fly to you.
Where the hell are you going?
He promised me he'd be more cautious in the future.
What time did you hear the noise?
I forgot to buy one mind.
I've heard a lot about you.
Don't worry about it now, we're getting ready to eat lunch.
Italy is a very nice country.
It's an old insanity.
Eat the bread!
Although he lives in the United States, Tom is not allowed to speak English.
The school is five kilometers away from my home.
I gave up my weapons.
Who ate all our food?
I know her bread will be delicious.
Please come.
Women change the world.
In Singapore, tension on the floor is considered to be a crime.
I wanted Mary to love me instead of Tom.
You can sit on the chair.
We need more sugar.
The roses filled the room.
Bad luck sometimes.
Thomas has already had three cups of coffee.
I don't understand German.
Yes, please.
I'll help you.
You're guilty.
Who are you looking for?
What does that mean?
The apples on the other side of the wall are sweeter.
What's that?
I'm studying Japanese.
It's pointless.
She had a woman's head, a lion's body, a bird's bird, and a living calf.
Tell me how you solved this problem.
Would you like to dance with me?
Even if I wanted to, I couldn't explain what happened there.
I'm afraid of heights.
I don't know where to go.
If I don't, then let's go.
What's going on with me?
I agree.
Compare facts.
I'm not hungry right now.
I'll go to France for a vacation.
You can sit anywhere you want.
You're an engineer.
The door's been opened slowly.
It's at least history.
Did you engage in any sport?
It's time for you to start a new business.
Let's wait here.
That girl I told you about lives here.
Please just leave.
I can't believe she's older than my mother.
Look back and see the black cat.
His family traveled a lot.
Do you know him?
I don't know whether to turn left or right.
I'll clean the kitchen later.
He came from a small town in the mountains.
I was talking to my friends.
All your cats are gray.
I remember the times when we had a meeting with you.
When we go to sleep, we say good night.
Scandal ruined his career.
Cats are difficult for individuals.
He was so poor that he couldn't buy the bread.
I suggest you ask Tom.
This bag is not small.
There's nothing wrong with that.
If you invite him, he'll probably come.
I know you know I know.
Go home before six.
Duona's fresh.
I'll be back in half an hour.
I don't want to be bad anymore.
Are you a lawyer?
Where's your school?
The candle lit the room.
I'm sorry.
Put the paper on the side.
What does he write in a letter?
A woman eats a meal.
I'm eating apple.
A single person receives pleasure by observing the scrolls.
What is that man sitting at the other end of the table?
Are you pregnant?
Now I'm really tired.
His steps have accelerated.
I'm being punished forever in these endless spaces.
What do you need a new shot?
He wrote a straight line on the wall.
You need a car?
Take your hat off when you get into class.
They don't do anything more than complain.
She was in a hurry.
Please contact me as soon as you get to Boston.
Thomas got up at 7: 00 a.m.
This is for us.
I'm listening to the radio.
The boy wants to know the truth.
Thomas ate all the pizza alone.
You have to take care of yourself.
You need patience, Tommy.
How are you?
Your trip starts here.
Can you believe what he said?
Thomas asked where you were.
I'd like to help, but I'm very busy.
Thomas could not bear to think of Mary.
I think we should call Tom.
Don't be late for the bus.
All the apples are there.
You're gonna have to pay.
What time should we go to the station?
The more I think about it, the less I like it.
I'll take you to the new store.
Everyone knows her.
She's incredibly naive.
Where do you live in Turkey?
Tom's starting.
I can't.
Get out of class.
On my mother's bed, three dogs.
Thomas has already completed the work he needed to do.
If you are unable to have children, you can always inject.
That's what I thought.
Although she was running as fast as she could, she still couldn't wait to get on the bus.
They need friends.
Please, welcome.
Can You Explain as a Gift?
Do you like living like that?
It's hot today, isn't it?
Don't you really have a home?
Are you kidding me?
Her boyfriend is Turk.
Answer me.
My mother can't come.
There's a lot of aludars in Bavaria.
Do you know if he has a girlfriend?
I don't have family.
Fathers believed too much of their sons.
What would you like to order, sir?
He did it.
He went into my room without permission.
You can't just leave.
Come on, move!
You can sit on the seat.
Where do you live if you don't have a home?
Our union can be perfect.
He told me I could use his car.
Almost all students love English.
That test was so hard that we didn't have enough time to finish it.
That's all.
You have to work fast.
If it is believed that society has created nothing valuable, it can be said that it believes in massive destruction.
The English language is spoken around the world.
All their efforts were meaningless.
Where's the mirror?
This girl doesn't sound so bad.
Life is unfair.
Each person paid a thousand dollars.
Jill is the only girl in our club.
Students don't have to go to school today.
The sun went down in the sky.
His parents were pleased with his success.
Now it's our house.
I'll call them tomorrow when I get home.
He helped fix my watch.
No one was worth helping me with you.

I'm a good German student.

I'd encourage her to jump.
Have you done your homework already?
John is professor of French literature at Oxford University.
Do you understand what he said?
What are the colors of her hair?
The sooner you get back, the happier your father will be.
Are you ready to start your trip?
Your watch is ten minutes late.
They betrayed you.
I thought you said she was yours.
How much money do you have hidden behind your bed?
We believe in God.
I'm air.
Here's the man I've been waiting for.
He didn't pay the debt and started.
Mr. Brown speaks very well in Japanese.
No, he's not my new boyfriend.
I like to watch baseball and football.
Everyone but her is gone.
The queen stood by the king.
This bridge was built two years ago.
She's my first love.
You have to keep your promise.
Today, Thomas seems different.
What is the price of the room rental?
We have to get out of here.
Thomas never wants to do that again.
I asked her to wait a minute.
How have you long been able to learn the languages of those who hope to learn?
They're not threatening.
Her advice moved me to move abroad.
You're the only one who can help me.
What are the places that are going around?
That's why we played inside.
Your lift is completely white.
But I don't want to.
I'm sorry I can't meet you tonight.
Tom has a sister who's a lawyer.
I look like my mother.
Tonight, you look just wonderful.
Doctor, can you hear me?
You understand, don't you?
I hope to see him on Monday.
Thomas's ready.
Orcaite is hot, so be careful not to get caught.
Have You Found Your Mails?
For God's sake!
He doesn't remember whether that room was empty or not.
The store sells valuable accessories to women.
I don't like to be wrong.
It's not theirs.
I didn't get up early.
Just where you are.
The house is hers.
The doctor advised him to stop working so much.
Are you sure?
You've been busy.
I can't live like this anymore.
He'll do anything to make money.
I just want to talk.
What music does Tom like?
This tree grows near her house.
Don't talk at the reading room.
How are you doing, panel?
I'm just turning it into a dollar.
I hate winters.
I think Thomas is going to kill Mary.
There are only two correct answers.
If I were rich, I'd give you some money.
When and where did you meet her?
Where the hell did you fuck them?
Tom didn't show up.
Don't be so serious, it's just a game.
He told a funny story.
I don't have time now.
Tom is the captain of our team.
This slope is very long.
Listen to what the teacher says.
Why doesn't anyone eat my potatoes?
I asked Tom to play guitar.
What does that remind you of?
She put it in the word.
What a wonderful night!
I can't find Tim.
She named him Charles.
I'm not sure whether it's a boy or a girl.
Life is beautiful.
She's taking them to school.
Tatoeba was temporarily unattainable.
Nobody believed what you said.
I didn't know what to say.
Do you think I should go alone?
Just answer the question.
I never want to owe anyone.
Look at the train running through the bridge.
I'm not the only one who loves Tom.
I'm really sorry now.
No, I don't think I'm guilty.
Where are we?
I've got forty-five.
Their flight seemed ridiculous.
She's too young to understand.
I bought this suit just for this time.
It's like that.
Be careful, okay?
It's the only explanation.
I can't believe I'm really here.
Don't you know the way?
That's what I like.
Tom will need help.
I printed a hundred pages.
I can see and hear.
Don't forget the ticket.
Put your hand up before you answer.
Please change the flag.
Isn't it true you have a gun?
I slept in bed all day yesterday.
The war ended their investigation.
When spring comes, the days become longer the day after the day.
I'm listening to the radio.
Sweet dreams!
Leave my car alone.
It's Tony's book.
I needed to come first.
Tom only eats what he wants to eat.
Who stole this apple?
He threw his ticket into a movie.
What would you do if you were in his place?
I don't like summer.
Well, what's your address?
She was lying on the bed face down.
African drums are larger than Asian drums.
What I always said.
He heard it while working in the middle of the night.
Please bring me a glass of water.
He held her hand.
Eat the bread!
If God did not exist, we would have to create him.
You should do it yourself this time.
My family was very hospitable.
You don't understand.
It has green eyes and bright red hair.
Does Tom have experience?
She left her seat on the train.
I'm a vegetarian.
You have to go there.
What's the reason?
I don't see anything from here.
Because I didn't have the answer, I wrote it again.
She's standing outside the wall.
Don't trust me too much.
They missed a great opportunity.
Fight for your right.
He always talks to me when he meets me on the street.
Look at the book on the table.
I drank one of the beer and I got a lot of drunk.
Tom didn't think he needed a personal guardian.
Someone opened the door.
Do you have any questions about this lesson?
We saw her in the park.
I can't believe we're busy.
It didn't look like you wanted those books.
I have a red double.
He's low and fat.
I want to go to Tokyo.
The trip was frustrating.
He's a lot smarter than I am.
Tom still doesn't seem interested.
It's a storm today.
I didn't want this to happen.
He's trying to get out of here.
Like I said, I'm not gonna do anything.
After that table there's a little red dog.
Stop them.
Anna likes chocolate very much.
I know Mike likes a basket.
I'm gonna have to try all of that on the obelisk.
He died two years ago.
Take your seat to your room.
Taxi suddenly turned left.
Yeah, I get it.
I'll be there in ten minutes.
He was convicted of murder.
If you don't go to school, you won't miss anything.
If anything happens, call me quickly.
Would you like to eat some hot potatoes?
Is there any danger?
You're dangerous to swim in this river.
My friends are wonderful.
Gold won't buy everything.
We have enough water.
Who will inherit the throne?
She worked hard.
Don't be afraid of change.
Please open this box.
Is it healthy to eat fish?
My baby wants to talk.
I asked her what music she likes.
There are no adventurers.
Was she satisfied?
But he knew he had no choice.
Do you remember this game?
She started without a dome.
I'm here a lot.
She kept on speaking.
Mike's not good at playing baseball.
Coupons are often used when travelling in the woods.
Mary is a bookmaker.
Good weekend.
I saw his car through the window.
Are you ready?
I'm glad I'm not a woman.
Take your time to clean up and get back to work.
The more, the better.
Ten years is a long time.
Is this your car?
I can't believe you're still hungry.
To be happy is quite normal.
We must move very carefully.
Did you get Tom's message?
Yesterday, my hand was hurt.
If I were rich, I'd give you some money.
I don't have a computer home.
My father didn't eat much fruit.
Can you give me a discount?
She gave me a kiss and wanted a good night.
My friend's here.
Where do you live now?
The older you are, the harder it is to learn the language.
Tom doesn't drink coffee, but he smokes cigarettes.
Not all people like dogs.
I'll stay here a few days.
I feel bad.
Why did you say such a stupid thing?
You can't beat me.
I don't think I could do that.
Is that true?
She's crying.
We'll see the plague.
He's my father.
He doesn't want to wait for you.
He took the family to the zoo.
Thomas refused to go to the hospital.
Half the nine.
This car was manufactured in Japan.
Is this your first time in Japan?
Tony was happy.
My father asked me to open the door.
Make him a photo robot!
Your brother wasn't in school today.
Thomas will never abandon you.
I was in Canada at the time.
I made this food myself.
Write a note.
Someone wrote their name on the wall.
Anyone who can take a bad turn like that.
They don't have sugar anymore.
I love your daughter.
Thomas hopes he'll stay and not eat again tonight.
Someone opened the door.
I'm not your mother.
Why isn't Tom in the car?
My name is Ricardo.
When did you get a telegram?
You shouldn't be swimming in that cabin.
When's the snow going out?
He thought I was really tired.
I don't think she's good enough to eat anymore.
Either you're with us or against us.
Please help me!
Thomas knows she likes Mary.
I like this music.
She's getting the dog out.
He went to the store, but he stopped at her house.
Snow's moving fast.
We're in the south.
Of course I should read this book.
Thomas is not in prison right now.
Tom and Mary went to the museum.
The ship is going for the horizon.
Good morning, my dear dog.
God blesses those who repent.
I can't work when you're standing there.
Marilyn had lung problems.
We were one big happy family.
What kind of color car did she buy herself?
The child spent the whole night.
Do you see me?
She testified against him.
My father's growing rice.
We speak Japanese.
The result was disappointing.
I'm stuck in the window.
Meat is not ready yet.
Give me a piece of credit.
She needs more sleep.
Did you hear anything?
Is she your mother?
You want to turn on the light?
He doesn't trust a doctor anymore.
It was the first time I visited the museum.
We've spent a great deal of time.
I think Thomas wants to stay.
What a beautiful family.
Are you still in Florida?
You didn't have to eat those green fish.
Get ready! Tomorrow's the last day.
We looked through the window, but we didn't see anything.
When was the last time you saw Tom?
The capital of Sweden is Stockholm.
They were talking about love.
Thomas never wants to do that again.
I don't understand.
One left, the child felt very lonely.
I don't know anything here.
Our team lacked mobility.
Kate's been through the street.
There's a mirror.
Why don't you help the police?
I want to meet your father.
Please continue.
He was busy.
I'm a bitch.
I saw him.
I'm paying for Lozban.
"Good morning," said Thomas smiling.
I'm hurting my hand.
He needs a cupcake.
You shouldn't go.
You don't have to trust him.
There are seven days in one week.
You have to go your own way of life.
Without air and water, no one could live.
He fainted and just didn't eat.
They work eight hours a day.
I'm eating and drinking.
I do it every Sunday morning.
She quickly opened the letter.
Are you busy right now?
I'll take everything I said.
Where'd you get all those keys?
I went inside through the window.
Take Tom to the hospital.
I have a white cat.
He quickly recorded our names.
Our son died in the war.
It is not satisfied with the result.
Of course you're wrong.
I can't tell you what's going to happen first.
I don't want to talk to you because you broke my heart.
Don't trust him.
We better go.
What is that person sitting at the other end of the table?
This idea is very attractive.
They're going to buy.
Everything is genius is simple.
Their students learn too much.
Thomas raised his hand.
Let's go for a drink.
Birds go south.
This tea is very nice.
I disagree with him.
It's my fault.
Not bad, but I'm a little tired.
That's a great idea.
He's very proud of his toy.
That'll be enough for us.
I wasn't completely.
The woman wants to know the truth.
Is this word often used?
Lithuania joins the European Union.
I want to be a speaker.
Where's the cat?
I'm sorry for what I did.
She became an ambassador.
I learned to ride a bike when I was six.
He took out a piece of cream.
Let me do it.
I like jazz.
I'm sure he's innocent.
Open the window and enter the fresh air.
Have you ever offered a kiss?
It's very nice.
Did you see my mom?
I know his name.
Tom doesn't want to live like that.
Do you agree to what she's doing?
He came here before he finished school.
You know their address?
What the hell are you doing?
He looked down at his dirty shoes.
Their cat was lying on my forehead, and he didn't want to slip.
There are some good hotels in town.
What's this letter from?
He doesn't want to learn today.
We're all different.
You don't know how strong I love you.
I wrote her a long letter.
He couldn't do what he wanted.
I feel a little weak today.
Life is interesting.
She's here?
I don't like to be wrong.
Be careful, okay?
I bought the camera for $30.
This is great.
It's no method, it's a provocation.
Answer in English.
He wants to see us again.
There's a lot of water here.
Where do you live?
My friend doesn't use sugar.
I'm a cop. I'm a cop.
He's got to get people to sleep.
Bob's been washing his guts at the time.
My brother is two years older than me, but he's three centimeters lower than me.
I can only tell you what I know.
I'm thinking about you.
What's your address?
Tomorrow he'll be free.
Have you not seen my wife?
Your daughter heard us talking.
Thomas will die soon.
I'm used to going to sleep late.
I've met him before.
Look at that house with a red roof.
My shoe's on the fourth floor.
She was already pregnant.
We're basketball players.
These clothes are for you.
Don't call her.
Do you know you're stronger than you think?
I love her so much that I can't leave her.
Can you come with us?
I don't care.
Thomas could not find a reason why he had to return early.
Put your hand up.
He didn't sell the house.
No one has ever seen God.
She saw something waiting for her at school.
I can't believe we're busy.
Where's Maria?
The new contract allows us to demand just what we want.
Tom's still a bitch.
Go and open the door.
I told you I'd talk to you later.
God, help me!
She told him she was happy.
She needs it more than she needs it.
Big exits!
Tommy, I'm back.
You wanted to see me?
It's not a mistake.
The airport is quite far from the city centre.
You can turn off the radio now.
You can turn off the radio now.
You're a very nice man.
Ankara is in Turkey.
You're a very nice man.
I was in Boston a few times.
You're a very nice man.
