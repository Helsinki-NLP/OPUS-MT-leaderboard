Tom reads to his daughters.
My computer is expensive.
The blood came out.
Tom worked at the hospital.
I remember.
Continue reading:
Keep going.
Don't hesitate:
Sit tight.
Tom doesn't know anything about Mary.
Ask someone.
Look closer.
Hide.
We're the best.
Stop fighting.
It worked.
Don't yell.
Come on down.
Clearly, Tom is sad.
Tom was scared.
Tomorrow's gonna be hot.
Tom was inspired.
Publish.
Tom doesn't want to see how he talks to you.
They all came out.
It's yours.
I still think you lied to me.
I just want to be able to say that I'm sorry.
Be careful.
She's gone.
Drive the car harder.
I don't want to go to school.
Be good.
Take it.
You're so sharp.
I've been working on it.
Sit here.
How many years have you lived here?
Tom was dancing.
It doesn't matter.
They lied.
Tom flew.
My mother's at home.
Be careful.
Thank you.
Stay strong.
Take a step back.
Of course:
How beautiful.
Do you think I should do that?
I can't believe it.
No one knows.
Write down your manuals.
How's your number?
It was a good fire.
Tom didn't go into details.
Attention.
Please, stop.
Tom was bored.
They laughed.
Keep this.
Tom took his breath.
They didn't know.
I can't stand to think about it.
Come in time.
Are you ready to leave this year?
Come in.
A little bit to that side.
The airline only makes cargo transfers.
Tom broke up.
Where did you come from?
Tom told me he didn't learn French at the university.
Sit tight.
Look here.
Get out of here.
Is there someone in the house?
I'm sorry I'm so late.
I hit Tom's face with a gun.
I don't agree.
Keep dancing.
Don't look at Tom.
Tom did it with his hand.
It takes my sleep all day.
Find Tommy.
Tom Merry took her car home.
Women change the world.
A little high, please.
Tell him I'm asleep.
Tom married a girl from Boston.
They all laughed.
He's afraid of the darkness.
I'm not so sure yet.
Fill a bottle of water.
I don't know if Tom's hungry or not.
Shut it down.
Someone's rare.
Finish it.
It was uncertain.
Here's what I asked.
It won't change anything.
I don't understand that at all.
Keep practicing.
Think about it.
What a shock.
Tom had to ask Mary for help.
Keep looking.
Keep busy.
Can you tell me who's coming tonight?
Have fun.
Sit tight.
Be content.
I don't know why Tom didn't come, and I don't want to ask him.
I remember.
One read:
Be focused.
Here you go.
Be careful.
Feel this.
It helps.
Wait here.
Please read it.
I don't know if Tom's hungry or not.
I believe you will succeed.
Come to us.
One day you'll understand.
Look at it.
How interesting.
Hold on, please.
Tom read what books?
I have two brothers and three sisters.
There are three parts of the Kemping area.
Tom has no time to talk to you now.
Tomorrow Tom has to go to school tomorrow.
Keep digging.
It's amazing.
Change the weights.
Fresh, please.
He's really talking very well.
Nsti, please.
I looked around you.
Take care of it.
You tried.
Keep fighting.
Did you hear me at all?
Eat slowly.
I'm not a doctor.
This is a bird.
We're together.
Take everything.
Come to us.
You did the experiment.
Let me do it.
It's on the table.
Tom commends the head with his new car.
Contracts are already being negotiated.
Don't say anything.
Look in the eyes.
How could you not know?
Publish.
What a surprise!
They're sweating.
Keep working.
Tom was amazed.
I wanted to read that book all the time.
Me, too.
They all laughed.
"Burge-califf, now considered the world's highest skyscrapers."
What did you want to talk to Tom about?
Forgive us.
It was amazing.
He's walking.
Come back now.
The tree swims.
Get out of here.
Turn it off.
Try it again.
I'll give you five minutes to solve this problem.
What are you standing for?
Let's move a little bit.
I didn't think you liked Tom either.
When do you make purchases?
They won.
My mother's at home.
Tom died as a result of a stupid accident.
The circumstances have changed.
I gave up.
When do you make purchases?
Tom recovered.
How does this work?
Just calm down.
Stop trying.
Follow him.
Tom wrote this three weeks ago.
Be patient.
Let it go.
It doesn't matter.
I sat at home for a week.
I started living alone.
Take this.
Kiss me.
Are you kidding me?
Tom wondered if it was worth discussing this topic with Mary.
Tom doesn't put a sign.
Be prepared.
Tomorrow's gonna be hot.
Tom was laughing.
Time's flying.
We've forgotten.
Now I need to see Tom.
Say "well."
They started a few hours ago.
Eat something.
He was weakened because of blood loss.
Don't fight.
Be careful.
Try this.
Is there a man in the house?
Be kind.
Keep busy.
Don't wait for us.
Translate the game.
Follow him.
I'm trying.
Tom needs something.
Change it.
When do you make purchases?
Come on.
Come on.
Sit down.
It's amazing.
Look again.
Who should give it to?
Get up.
Stay there.
I talked to Tom tonight.
Try again.
Can you translate the slogan?
Don't read it.
They were swimming.
They called.
Tom doesn't care how he dress.
It's true.
We were honest.
Tom and Mary walked through a manslaughter.
It can't be late.
We stayed alive.
We work together.
Hang in there.
Say, "Visit."
Let me take it easy.
Forgive us.
Keep dancing.
Keep warm.
Think again.
We've forgotten.
We didn't get anything.
Ladies from the beginning.
I'm not a teacher.
Tom didn't say much, which is a bad sign.
One day you'll understand.
Back then, people lived there.
Finish it.
Tom was in a bad mood.
Not at all!
Non-printable move:
It's clear.
Say it.
Look around you.
Stop arguing.
Tom came here to help us.
My eye went out.
Take it.
Stop them.
Start again.
Keep walking.
Tom closed his eyes and looked like he was asleep.
Write this down.
Protect yourself.
I'm sorry enough.
Everything is important.
Be careful.
Wait a minute.
Don't wait for us.
It's true.
They all shouted.
Come on, let's not talk long enough. Let's do it.
Tom smiled.
He cleaned up the dust with a pig.
This morning, the temperature fell below zero.
Did you think I forgot?
Be yourself.
Be nervous.
They waited.
Tell everyone.
Who do you want to ask?
What are you offering me to do?
Below:
We're learning on the basis of experience.
Tom showed Mary the paper.
Attention.
They danced.
Start writing.
Hang on.
Put it down.
They walked.
Just tell me why you're here.
Look at that.
Tom flew.
Cut the rock.
This is my choice.
Tom read better French than I do.
Show me.
Tom's ear went away.
Take this.
Tom was fighting.
Tom agrees.
Watch it.
It'll be easy.
Aphres.
Tom's broke.
Did anyone get hurt?
Don't fire.
Tom doesn't have a sign.
Sing with me.
Please, Tom.
I'm saying.
No one answered.
Not bad.
Go to sleep.
Do you really want to know the truth?
Tom was never in my house.
Let's go.
That's enough.
You have the right to have your opinion.
It's very fun.
Be good.
Keep working.
Stop it.
Of course I can, even though I don't speak much Shanghai.
I made a contribution.
Let's find out how that's gonna help.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
Be fair.
When did you tell me?
Be reasonable.
Tom is a very self-contained person.
Tom agreed.
We didn't get it.
There's a tall man in the audience:
I'll watch TV.
Wait for me next to the car.
Tom tried to speak to the saleswoman in French.
Even if we get something that we're late, it won't bother us.
Ask Tom.
Ask Tom.
What a surprise.
You know I'm in love with Mary.
I don't agree.
I want to make sure it's perfect.
Now, look at us.
Stay away.
Listen.
Does it look stupid?
Tell me.
What's your name?
We remember.
Running as fast as I could, I was able to catch my friend.
We're going to have fun.
Tom doesn't put the sign on.
Hang on.
I waited.
Something's changed.
Tom's on the run.
We waited.
Wow!
Everyone knew.
Go to sleep.
This box contains 5 seeds.
I'm against it.
Tom asked us to be patient.
I thought he didn't have the right to do that.
Tom gave me a smile.
Don't pay attention to Tom.
It won't change anything.
No one has ever expressed a desire.
I have to do something about it.
Think about it.
Ignore them.
A lot of workers were missing their fingers.
Keep looking.
They were starving.
Keep weighing.
Can you speak French?
Look at us.
I can't stand it anymore.
Eat something.
Tom died three months before he graduated from high school.
Tom was born.
Tom and Mary ate in silence.
Welcome home.
Have a good time.
Join us.
Tom swims well than Mary.
Tequi to the right.
Be real to me.
Start again.
They all laughed.
I want to know how this happened.
Keep that.
Let's tell you why we're here.
Anyway, thank you.
Yes.
Tom is with his mother.
Stay away.
They didn't know.
He was fast going home.
Don't worry.
You can't do that without me.
Please, come on.
I deserve more.
Give it to me.
Keep going, please.
You were supposed to wait.
Don't go naked.
It helps.
Now I have to see Tom.
Forget him.
It's a good time today.
Do you know Tom's name?
Don't cry.
Please sing.
Don't do this.
I don't know if he's got there or not.
You're so sharp.
Tom was missing.
No one came.
What are you standing for?
Oh, no.
Tom answered.
Get up.
Tom called the neighbors.
Walk away.
I'll see you at school.
Take him.
Tom and Mary are alone in the room.
I'm in love with you.
Squeeze this.
Let's do the exercises.
Keep moving.
Hurry up.
Oh, yeah.
Even green thoughts are in anger.
Keep them.
I see.
Hurry up.
What are they waiting for?
Thank you.
What's the matter?
Go tomorrow.
Get up.
Say, "Please."
That's what's bad about it.
We're trying.
Tom can go to the club any minute to hear how Mary sings.
Tom liked Australia.
Take the tools.
The tree is green.
Don't be proud.
Read this.
Be satisfied.
It was uncertain.
Let's get out of here.
Stay silent.
I think I left something in the audience.
One day you'll understand.
Do what I've asked.
I'm worried.
It works.
Be careful.
Do you know Tommy's name?
Tom was crying.
Stay here.
The flowers are flowering.
That's enough.
Bring me the paper.
What happened?
The house is small.
Do you love your mother?
Get in there.
Tom wants a new car.
Other:
Someone got mixed up.
Mary's gone.
Start singing.
Answer me.
It worked.
We forgot.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Take a step back.
Sit down, please.
What's the difference?
A language is never hereditary.
They noticed.
Listen.
Tom came back to the room.
I still think you lied to me.
Keep working.
There's no problem.
End this.
Tom was squeezing.
They're playing kids.
Think again.
When do you buy?
Don't do that.
There are no props on this.
Why are we running?
Put bracelets on him.
They all laughed.
Let's talk about how this works.
Tom fought.
The dogs are crawling.
We made a promise.
It happened.
Sit here.
Hold on.
Tom invited me to go with the movie star Mary.
Get ready.
Tell me what you're looking for, and I'll help you find it.
What?
All right, Tom.
Be sure.
Years have passed.
Get dressed.
Tom forgot.
I like it here.
If the snake weakens my head, I'll take a few bugs instead of this terrible medicine.
Tom really respects you.
I said some things I didn't mean.
Look here.
Good world!
I've never eaten horse meat.
Let's not talk long and act.
Do you want to see what the new device is like?
We were saved.
A taco.
Shut up.
They kissed.
Tom and I will go together.
Marry me.
You better go home as soon as you can.
They say Tom Jackson is one of Boston's best lawyers.
I'm sorry.
End game:
They approve.
It's just your opinion.
Fill the box with water.
You're the leader.
Tom begged us to be patient.
Healthy food is important to a healthy body, a healthy consciousness, and the result is to have the best effect.
Hurry up.
He believed the truth.
Tom looked.
Shampoo, please.
Stay here.
I'm not hiding in detail.
Don't get up.
Everyone prayed.
They all started to laugh.
Tom was red.
No one asked.
Hurry up.
All right, Tom.
Come on, please.
Be honest.
I'll see you at work.
Tell me, Tommy.
Write it down.
Write this down.
There I looked.
Keep that.
I live in Hawaii.
I'll get in the car.
Take these.
You're running.
Don't fight.
You do nothing but eat.
Don't do it, Tom.
Take care of them.
Don't look at them.
They were busy.
She got married last year.
Tom made a link to my website from his blog.
Stand still.
Let go of everything.
This is my choice.
Tom's gone.
Let's tell you why we're here.
You're running.
Well, that's another case.
Please sing.
Have you spent all night here?
You'll do well to pull back.
It's time.
Toulouse:
I doubt that's what happened.
Tell me what I'm looking for, and I'll help you find it.
Stay away.
Keep them.
No one pays attention.
Stay away.
Come back.
Will you come for a minute?
Sing with me.
Tom often heard about Mary, but he hasn't met her yet.
Wait a minute.
Leave Tom alone.
Let Tom.
Stop firing.
Creatures don't have teeth.
He didn't know.
Don't move.
Tom heard it.
Tom wanted to sleep long, but he couldn't.
Past:
Start here.
That's enough to laugh.
Be loving.
Be prepared.
Tom was breathing.
Tom gave up.
How many years have you lived here?
Does it look animast?
Can you speak French?
Keep warm.
I thought Mary still loved me.
Stay here.
It's really impressive.
I don't know.
Mary ran.
Try it again.
I slept a lot.
I get it.
Forget Tom.
Thank you.
Take him.
Sit down.
Don't yell.
Start writing.
Every man's work, whether it's literature, music, painting, architecture or anything else, is always his portrait.
A noise.
Everything's changed.
Ask Alex.
There's always options.
You were supposed to be waiting.
Let's do this.
I'm out of work.
What are you trying to do?
Stay here.
It helped.
Where are you from?
Keep digging.
I missed you.
That's enough argument.
I got it wrong.
Just shut up.
Tom can go to Mary's band at any time.
It's cold.
Stop it.
We don't need Tom.
I finished my homework when you called me.
Do you have plans for tonight?
I'm not tired.
Keep going.
How amazing!
Prepare:
Tom went wrong.
What's your favorite bird?
Tom is a very beautiful man.
Call us.
What about going to a movie?
Remember that.
These things are not mine.
We're lost.
Take me.
Call me.
He was crying.
What's interesting?
Who died?
Stay here.
It's easy to say, but it's not easy to do it.
Don't look at Tom.
Sit down.
Persistent food:
I'll try it again.
Tom's gone.
We forgot.
Tom should thank me.
I'll be right back.
Take care of yourself.
Hurry up, please.
Be loving.
A brothel.
Be patient.
Everyone was alive.
Speak clearly.
He tried.
Gather yourself together.
Speak clearly.
It's a helm.
Who knows?
Sit here.
Most of all, I love corn.
I'm connected.
Do you have a more detailed map?
I got a message from Tom.
Tom looked into Mary's eyes.
Tom paid.
Tom doesn't know anything about Mary.
The bread is fresh.
I want Tom to be killed.
Tom died.
Please specify the conditions for your use of this information.
Be reasonable.
After you.
I just ignore them.
What does Tom read?
Look at it first.
Stand tight.
I can do the math.
Don't worry.
Protect yourselves.
You've had patience.
Everyone's dreaming.
Thank you.
Tommy's hospital year.
Keep talking.
I forgot.
Give me a break.
What did you want to talk to Tom about?
Squeeze this.
Go a little further there.
Finish this.
Open fire.
Is there details about Ellie?
Tom is much stronger today.
Fire.
Excuse me, can I leave a message?
Take me.
Please, come and bring me.
It'll be great.
I drink milk.
Screams.
It can't be late.
Keep reading.
Even if he doesn't come, we have to start.
Don't get up.
Tom was asleep.
Tom can't accept your gift.
First Tom hated Boston.
It's offensive.
Everything's changed.
Tom heard how they named him.
Stay away.
Tom is dead.
Let's go.
Tom looked at his watch.
Speak up.
Ask the different people.
The forest is burning.
Let him be open to him.
Tom has no time to talk to you now.
Be respectful.
Stop arguing.
I can't let you do this.
Please don't mention my name.
Gather yourselves together.
It's nice to see that girl.
You're doing something right now?
Seventy-eight years is the normal life span of a person.
Forgive me.
Call me.
Hurry up.
Sit tight.
Stay awake.
Don't move.
Is there a man in the house?
What did you want to talk to Tom about?
Use the warning tool.
Speak out.
Well, I'll see you.
Tell Tom.
I left something open?
Tom knows.
Snow came.
You can't do that without me.
You've got to fight enough.
Tell everyone.
Speak clearly.
Answer me.
When did you tell me?
Would it be normal if I sat here?
Keep writing.
Tommy seemed to be adorable.
I'm sorry.
Be careful.
Keep trying.
Come back soon.
I'm sorry.
The decision was made.
My knife is a sword.
I left Tom open.
I get it.
That's right, too.
I'm drinking tea too.
Tom stood there waiting to pass the road.
I just want to be able to apologize.
Be nervous.
I don't remember what I ate last night.
Squeeze it.
Ask Tom about it.
Do you think I should do that?
Tom ran away.
Stop the fire.
They were subjected.
Tom boasts of his new car.
Change your weight.
Time's up.
Tom would like to go to Mary's night, and unfortunately he had other things to do.
Take these.
Keep smiling.
I can always sleep wherever I am.
How deep?
Start now.
Tom laughed.
Tom gave me a smile.
I woke up.
Let him go.
Let's get a little closer.
Leave it open.
I'm sorry enough.
Do you have Dana?
Don't push it.
Tom came out.
Tom won.
Tom's gone.
Stay positive.
We hope to arrive at the time.
Tom advised Mary to go as soon as possible.
Stay focused.
Tom will die again.
Keep fighting.
Say it.
Remember that.
Listen carefully.
He helped.
You're a lot of talk.
Don't go in.
Take it.
Tom worked at the hospital.
Tom wrote a very detailed report.
These details will not be published.
They were all confused.
Welcome to Wikipedia
Does anyone know whether the dinner is open or not?
The woman's in the room.
Take him.
Tom's trying to smoke all the time.
Keep running.
He wants to drink a little hot milk.
Wait, please.
Help me.
You're doing something right now?
What?
I know most people are trying to avoid any kind of sad feeling, but I think it's wrong.
Circumstances:
I have to translate the sentences.
How disastrous!
Everyone was waiting.
What a strange thing.
A brothel.
Stay there.
An argumenter about the limbs.
It worked.
Be creative.
Be careful.
Keep an eye on it.
What a coincidence!
I confessed.
You have to sign this.
Be careful.
First row:
I don't care what you do with it.
Think about it a little bit.
Why didn't you write me?
Listen.
They all panicked.
Get out of here.
Tom has a very creative spirit.
Stop.
Do you have an object on this plan?
Ask different people.
Tom failed.
Hello, Tom.
I'm sorry.
Be a bear.
I didn't think you liked Tom either.
I love you.
Be yourself.
I'm going to have to do that thing.
I'm sorry.
Do well to pull back.
They cried.
Let's take a picture of my mother.
Hurry up, please.
I have two cats.
You didn't say anything.
Please, stop.
What a tragedy!
We'll spend a good time in Boston.
I'm lost.
He was running.
We understand.
Do you really want to know the truth?
Be careful.
Don't yell.
Smile at me.
No one died.
Tom helped.
Take this.
Take him.
Italy Calvin returned to Italy while he was still a child.
What are you offering me to do?
Get in touch with Tom.
Start.
Don't shout.
What's the end of it?
Do you speak French?
Let him go.
Sign here.
Have you ever been to America?
Wait a minute.
Tom flew up.
Be careful.
Don't go after the silence.
Tom volunteered.
Why did you stand me?
It's an old name.
I know.
Don't yell.
I don't know anything about this.
I'm late.
Thank you.
He's fast.
Follow me.
Good evening.
What's wrong with me?
Hold on.
Praise God.
Put this on.
Tom said he'd be a few minutes late.
None of my friends have any taste.
Stand by.
Don't fight.
I don't have any more time to talk to you.
I can't think about what happened.
Accessed:
Tom wept.
Stop talking.
Tom exclaimed.
Don't worry.
You don't know it.
Go on.
Chris is very attractive and rich, but not very modest.
Good dreams!
Select carefully.
What a coincidence.
Don't say anything.
Aah!
He worked.
Tom drinks.
My mother's adorable.
How old is your dog?
Tom was saved.
I love the Aquitaine language.
Tom's gone crazy.
Stop arguing.
Move a little bit.
Do you have a dictionary?
Wash.
They shouted.
Over.
Google Translate cannot translate expressions or define individual words.
Keep going.
Help me.
What's your favorite bird?
We wrote voluntarily.
Take Tommy.
Do it.
They're gone.
Take him.
Tom wrote this three weeks ago.
It really surprised him, and for some time he didn't want to talk about anything, and I think it would take long enough for him to get back into a moody state.
Stay strong.
I don't speak Japanese.
Tom doesn't know how to speak English what he wants.
Be respectful.
Tom says there's no problem.
Mr. Yoshida has a very good head out of France's history.
Good year.
Follow Tom.
Stop complaining.
Take it.
Good.
Can you translate the noise?
Do a lot of work.
We know all the details.
Keep writing.
One concern:
Come on.
I'm doing my lessons.
Stop laughing.
I don't imagine life like that.
Get out.
Thank you all for coming.
Tom was listening.
Write me.
Did you hear me?
He was working.
We're going to have fun.
Follow me.
I don't know the details.
Take Tom.
Tom smiled.
It happened.
Don't fire.
Keep moving.
Tom called.
They were burned.
Let us go.
Get up.
No one's listening.
Tom's driving a car.
They understood it.
Take this.
Thank you.
What?
Be nervous.
What's not interesting about how much it's worth, I'll buy it anyway.
Everything changes.
Attention.
Take this.
We know.
I couldn't understand her thoughts.
It's cold.
They're lying.
It's not easy.
Home call.
They rested.
Where'd you send the kids?
Hide.
Have fun.
Tom's got a cake for Mary.
We slept.
With us.
Here you go.
It's my greatest happiness to read.
This is a bad smell.
Would you?
Tom's not funny.
Let's talk about how this works.
Tom wasn't happy to see Tel Mary.
I also drink tea.
Try it again.
I agree.
Continue, please.
Please listen.
I gave you a musical.
Get up.
This works.
How many of you are there yet?
Look closer.
Tom needs to know what the obstacles are.
She's happy here.
The man sitting there is a famous singer.
Call us.
I can't really confirm the offer.
I find it very easy to talk to Tom.
Someone called.
Everything's broken.
It's a dog.
I know Jimmy from childhood.
You have to sign this.
I thought he was coming.
Tom lied.
She came.
He's coming.
Who are we going to give that to?
Attention.
Tom said he'd help me.
Stop complaining.
I swore.
Turn left.
Come on.
Turn around.
Really?
Why are they so bad about us?
Stop shooting.
Keep walking.
I don't like silence.
Be careful.
You don't get that well.
Be generous.
