According to the Chief Inspector of the New South Wales RSPCA, David O'Shannessy, at the ABC, monitoring and control of the mattresses in Australia should be regular operations.
"The closed circuit cameras would no doubt send a strong message to people who work in contact with animals, that is, their well-being has the highest priority."
The international map of the United States Geological Survey last week did not report earthquakes in Iceland.
No sysmic activity has been reported in the Hekla area in the last 48 hours by the Icelandic Weather Office.
The remarkable seismic activity at the origin of the phase change occurred on 10 March at the summit of the volcano, on the north-east slope.
The presence of dark clouds at the foot of the mountain was reported, not related to volcanic activity.
The clouds created confusion over the possibility that an eruption really happened.

Officially China continues to be a communist state; however, in the last 30 years China has developed a market economy.
The first economic reforms were launched under the Deng Xiaoping government.
Since then, the volume of the Chinese economy has increased by 90 times.
Last year, for the first time, China exported more cars from Germany and overrun the United States by becoming the largest market in the sector.
Within two decades China's GDP could be higher than that of the United States.
The tropical storm Danielle was the fourth of the 2010 Atlantic hurricane season to which a name was assigned and took shape in the Eastern Atlantic Ocean.
The storm, located about 3,000 miles from Miami, Florida, is characterized by winds supported by a maximum of 40 mph (pari at 64 km/h).
The forecasts of scientists at the National Hurricane Center say Danielle will gain more strength and by Wednesday it will become an hurricane.
The assessment of the potential impact on the United States or the Caribbean is difficult since the storm is far from the ground.

They were hitting the windows with the chairs, but the windows were inaccessible.
"Finally one of the panels broke, and they could get out of the window," said Franciszek Kowal, survived the incident.
The stars irradiate light and heat through the energy that evaporates when hydrogen atoms merge (or merge) between them, forming heavier elements.
Scientists are at work to create a reactor that produces energy the same way.
However, it is a very complex issue to be resolved and it will have to take many years to achieve effective fusion reactors.
The steel needle floats on the water due to surface tension.
The surface tension is due to the fact that the water molecules present on the surface of the water itself are strongly attracted by each other, more than the air molecules present above the water itself.
The surface molecules create an invisible film on the hair of the water that allows the objects, like the needle, to swallow you up.
The blade of the modern ice chips has two edges with a concave cavities between them. The double edge guarantees a better grip on the ice, even when they are tilted.
The bottom of the blade is slightly curved and so, when the blade folds from one side or the other, even the wire that is in contact with the ice describes a curve.
And this is what allows the patenter to bend. If you turn the patents to the right, the patenter to the right, if you turn the patents to the left, the patenter to the left.
To get back to the previous level of energy, they must get rid of the excess of light.
To do so, they emit a very small particle of light called photon.
This process is defined by scientists "stimulated emissions of radiation"; in fact, atoms are stimulated by an intense light beam that causes the emission of a photon of light and light is a kind of radiation.
The following image shows the atoms that emit photons. Of course, in reality, the sizes of photons are much less than illustrated in photos.
The photons are even smaller than the matter that makes atoms!
After working for hundreds of hours, eventually the bulb filament burns and the lamp stops working.
The lamp must be replaced. Attention must be paid when it is done.
First of all, you need to turn off the switch of the lamp, or pull the cable.
This is due to the risk of electrical shock, caused by the electricity passing into the hold where the metallic part of the bulb is inserted, where the inside of the hold or the base in the metallic part of the bulb is touched, if it is still partially inserted into the hold.
The main organ of the circulatory device is the heart, which deals with pumping blood.
The blood comes from the heart through the tubes called arteries and brings you back through the tubes called veins. The smaller tubes are called capillaries.
The teeth of the triceratopo were able to break not only the leaves, but also the more resistant branches and roots.
According to some scientists, Triceratopo is fed by scars, a species of common plant in the period Creteo.
These plants look like a small palm and have a kind of crown of pointed and accumulated leaves.
With his robust becco, a triceratopo could break the leaves and then eat the trunk.
According to other scientists, these plants are very poisonous, so it is unlikely that dinosaurs feed them, although today the frog and other animals such as parrots (which come down from dinosaurs) are able to eat poisonous leaves or fruits.
What effect would the force of gravity have on me? If we were on the surface of I, we would weigh less than on Earth.
A person who weighs 200 pounds (90 kg) on Earth would weigh about 36 pounds (16 kg). The force of gravity therefore exerts a lower pressure on us.
The Sun, unlike Earth, has no cross on which to climb. The whole Sun is formed by gas, fire and plasma.
The gas is becoming less denser than we are away from the center of the Sun.
The visible outer surface of the Sun is referred to as the photo sphere, that is, "the sphere of light".
About three thousand years later, in 1610, the Italian astronomer Galileo Galileo, observing Venus with a telescope, saw that the planet presented phases similar to those of the Moon.
The phases are verified because only the face of Venus (or the Moon) directed towards the Sun is illuminated. The Venezia phases took advantage of Copernicus' theory according to which the planets rotate around the Sun.
In 1639, a few years later, English astronomer Jeremiah Horrocks observed a passage of Venus.
A long period of peace for England was followed by the conquest of Danielaw.
However, in 991 Ethelred faced a greater Viking fleet than any other from the time of Guthrum a century ago.
The fleet's leader was Olaf Trygvasson, a Norwegian who was encouraged by the ambition to resume his country by bringing it back to the Danish rulers.
After a disastrous military start, Etelredo came to bed with Olaf, who returned to Norway to try to conquer his kingdom, with other success.
The Hangul is the only alphabet intentionally invented for the daily use of the people. It was designed during the reign of King Sejong (1418-1450) in 1444.
King Sejong was the fourth king of Joshua’s dynasty and one of the most esteemed sovereigns.
At first, he called the alphabet Hangul Hunmin Jeongeum, which means "The sounds correct/appropriate for the education of the peoples".
There are many theories about the origins of the Sanskrit. One makes them laugh at the Arias, who by moving from the West to India would have brought their own language with them.
The Sanskrit is a classical language and is comparable to the Latin spoken in Europe.
The first book to the world known was written in Sanskrit. After the composition of the Upanishad, the Sanskrit lost importance.
The Sanskrit is a very rich and complex language that has originated in many modern Indian languages, as well as Latin is the origin of some European languages, such as French and Spanish.
After defeating France, Germany began preparing for the invasion of Great Britain.
The attack was called in the code "Operation Sealion" by Germany. The British army was in a fragility condition because most of its heavy weapons and supplies were lost during the evacuation of Dunkerque.
However, the Royal Navy remained much more powerful than the German Navy ("Kriegsmarine") and could have destroyed any fleet sent to invade through Manica.
However, the Royal Navy ships assigned near the possible conquest routes were very few: the admirers, in fact, were afraid that they would be sunk by the German air attack.
Let's start by analyzing what were the plans of Italy. Italy was essentially the "minor voice" of Germany and Japan.
They had an army and a weaker navy, even though they had built four new ships shortly before the war began.
The main objectives of Italy were African countries. To conquer those countries, it would be necessary to have a starting base for troops to allow them to cross the Mediterranean Sea and invade Africa.
So I had to get rid of the bass and British ships in Egypt. Besides, it was not expected that the Italian warships would do anything else.
Now we come to Japan, which was an island state, just like Britain.
The submarines are vessels designed to move and remain underwater for long periods of time.
The submarines were used in the first and second world wars. At that time they were very slow and had a very limited range of shootings.
At the beginning of the war they traveled mainly on the surface, but after the development of the radar and its greater precision, the submarines had to go underwater to avoid being seen.
The German submarines were called U-Boot. The Germans were very capable of guiding them and handling them.
After the war, in view of their success with these naval means, the Germans were considered dangerous in the case they had a large number of them.
Yes! King Tutankhamon, sometimes called "King Tut" or "the Pharaoh boy", is one of the most famous Egyptian kings in modern times.
It is interesting to note that in ancient times it was not considered very important and was not added to the years of the oldest kings.
However, the invention of his tomb in 1922 made him a celebrity. Unlike many of the tombs of the past that were plundered, this remains almost intact.
Most of the buried objects together with Tutankhamon are well preserved, and there are thousands of artifacts made of precious metals and rare stones.
With the invention of the ray wheel, the Assyrian carriages became lighter, faster and better equipped to overcome soldiers and other carriages.
Their mortal whales were often able to penetrate the armor of enemy soldiers. Around 1000 BC the Assyrians introduced the first cavalry.
The cavalry is an army fighting horses. Since the seat had not yet been invented, the soldiers of the Assyrian cavalry were fighting riding on the naked back of the horses.
We know many political personalities, scientists and Greek artists. The most well-known character belonging to this culture is Omero, the legendary unsightly poet who composed two masterpieces of Greek literature: the poems Iliade and Odissea.
Sofocle and Aristophane are still appreciated dramas and their dramas are considered among the major works of world literature.
Another famous Greek personality is the mathematical Pitagora, known above all for its famous theorem, which established a relationship between the sides of the rectangular triangles.
There are several estimates of the number of people speaking Hindi. It is estimated that it is between the second and the fourth language with more speakers in the world.
The number of native speakers varies depending on whether the dialects closely linked to each other are or are less included in the account.
Estimates range from 340 million to 500 million people speaking the language, and up to 800 million people able to understand it.
Hindi and Urdu have a similar vocabulary, but they are different in the graph; in daily use, people who speak these two languages usually manage to understand each other with each other.
Around the 15th century, northern Estonia was exposed to a strong cultural influence by Germany.
To bring God closer to the indigenous people, some German monks invented the Estonian literary language.
It was based on the German alphabet, with the addition of the character "Õ/õ".
In time, many words were integrated into a loan from Germany. It was the beginning of a period of inspiration.
Traditionally, at the end of the school path the heir to the throne reached the army directly.
Charles attended the Trinity College in Cambridge, where he studied anthropology, archaeology and, in a second moment, history, resulting in a 2:2 (lower Second Class vote).

3% of the country is made up of European Turkey (or Eastern Thrace or Rumelia in the Balkan Peninsula).
The territory of Turkey extends for more than 1,600 km (1,000 miles) of length and 800 km (500 miles) of width, with a more or less rectangular shape.
Turkey, including lakes, has an area of 783,562 km2 (300,948 square miles): 755,688 km2 (291,773 square miles) located in South-West Asia, and 23,764 km2 (9,174 square miles) in Europe.
Turkey is by extension the 37th largest country in the world; its dimensions are approximately equal to the size of the metropolitan France and the United Kingdom together.
Turkey faces the sea on three sides: west of the Aegean Sea, north of the Black Sea and south of the Mediterranean Sea.
Despite the long history of Luxembourg, independence was achieved in 1839.
Part of the current Belgium belonged to Luxembourg in the past, but became Belgian after the Belgian Revolution of 1830.
Although Luxembourg has always tried to remain neutral, Germany has occupied it during both the first and the second world war.
In 1957 Luxembourg was one of the founding countries of the organization known today as the European Union.
Located in the upper part of the district of Paro (in the village of Phondey), the Drukgyal Dzong is a strong ruins, as well as a Buddhist monastery.
It is said that the fortress was built by Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel in 1649 to celebrate its victory over the Tibetan-Mongols.
In 1951 there was a fire, which survived only a few remnants of Drugkyal Dzong, including the image of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal.
After the fire, the fortress has been preserved and protected and continues to be one of Bhutan's most extraordinary attractions.
During the 18th century, Cambodia was close between two very powerful neighbors, Thailand and Vietnam.
In the 18th century, Cambodia was invaded several times by the Thais, who destroyed Phnom Phen capital in 1772.
In the last years of the 18th century, the country was also invaded by the Vietnamese.
18% of Venezuelans are unemployed and most of the workers work in the informal economy.
Two thirds of Venezuelan workers are employed in the services sector, about one quarter in industry and one fifth in agriculture.
An important industry is the oil industry, in which the country is a net exporter, although only 1% of Venezuelans are working in this sector.

The Serengeti region welcomes the Serengeti National Park, the Ngorongo Conservation Area and the Maswa Game Reserve in Tanzania and the Maasi Mara National Reserve in Kenya.
Learning to create interactive media requires conventional and traditional skills, as well as the ability to use tools in interactive lessons (storyboard creation, audio and video assembly, storytelling, etc.)
In the interactive design you need to reassess your own assumptions about media production and learn to think in a non-linear way.
The interactive design requires that the parts of a project interact with each other, but also act as a separate entity.
The disadvantage associated with the use of the zoom targets is the fact that the focal complexity, as well as the number of elements of the target needed to achieve a wide range of focal lengths, are far higher than the fixed targets.
Thanks to the ever higher standards achieved by producers in the production of lenses, the problem tends not to happen again.
This allowed the zoom objectives to give life to images whose quality is comparable to that achieved by the goals with fixed focal length.
The use of the zoom targets presents a further negative aspect related to the fact that their maximum opening (speed) is usually lower.
Therefore, in poor lighting conditions and without a flash, the zoom targets are difficult to use.
When you try to convert a movie to DVD format, one of the most common disadvantages is overscan.
In general, televisions are made to satisfy the public's tastes.
That is why all the images we see on the TV had the upper, lower and lateral edges cut.
This is performed to ensure that the image fully covers the screen and takes the name of the overscan.
Unfortunately, when a DVD is made, with all probability its edges will also be cut and, if there were subtitles placed too close to the bottom in the video, they will not be displayed completely.
For centuries, the typical medieval castle stimulates imagination, evoking scenes of castles, banquets and knights of King Arthur.
It is easy, even being among the thousands of ruins, which return to the mind the sounds and smells of distant battles, to perceive almost the noise of the bells on the hips and to suppress the fear that comes from the prisoners.
But our imagination is based on reality? First of all, why were the castles built? How were they designed and built?
Kirby Muxloe Castle, a characteristic example of this period, represents a more fortified house than a real castle.
His great windows and subtle walls could not withstand a resolute attack.
In the years since 1480, when Lord Hastings started building it, the country was relatively peaceful and the necessary defense was only against the small bands of nomad predominance.
The balance of powers was a system on which European nations committed themselves to maintaining the national sovereignty of each European State.
The concept meant that all European nations were committed to preventing a nation from reaching the hegemony; that is why national governments often modified their alliances in order to maintain balance.
The war of Spanish succession was the first focus on the issue of balance of power.
This has marked a crucial change: the European powers, in fact, would no longer have claimed the wars of religion; for this reason, the last war to be defined as "religious" was the Thirty Years' War.
On July 21 of 356 B.C. the temple of Artemis in Ephesus was destroyed because of a painful fire set by Erostrato.
It is said that his motivation was the awareness at all costs. The Ephesians, the offensive, decreed that the name Erostrato would never be remembered.
The same thing we know today was noted by the Greek historian Strabone later. The same night he came to the world of Alessandro Magno, the temple was destroyed.
Alessandro, of the king, offered to finance the reconstruction of the temple, but his proposal was rejected. Later, after his death, the temple was rebuilt in 323 B.C.
Make sure that the hand is as relaxed as possible while performing the notes correctly and also try not to make unnecessary movements with the fingers.
So you can only get the minimum needed. Do not forget that to increase the volume, you need to press the keys with a lot of force as it happens for the piano.
On the fisarmonics, to increase the volume, it is sufficient to exercise a greater pressure and speed on the butter.
Mysticism is a search for sharing and identifying, or conscious awareness of a last reality, of a divinity, of a spiritual truth or of God.
The believer is searching for a direct experience, an intuition or a vision of divine reality, divinity or divinity.
The followers maintain specific lifestyles or practices aimed at feeding on such experiences.
Mysticism is distinguished from other forms of religious belief and worship because of its emphasis on the direct personal experience of a particular state of consciousness, especially of a peaceful, deep, blessed character, if not even static.
Sikhism is a religion of the Indian subcontinent born in a region of Punjab in the 15th century following a sectarian division within the Indian tradition.
The Sikhs consider their faith to be a religion separate from Hinduism, although they recognize their roots and Indian traditions.
The Sikhs call their religion Gurmat, which in Punjabi means "by guru". The guru, central element in all religions of India, has taken on such importance in Sikhism as to form the heart of Sikh beliefs.
This religion was founded in the 15th century by the guru Nanak (1469-1539); after him there were nine other gurus.
However, in June 1956, Krushchev's promises were tested when Polish workers started a protest against the lack of food and wage cuts, which turned into a general insurrection against communism.
Although in the end, in order to restore the order, Krushchev sent the armed forces, he agreed to some economic demands and to appoint a new Prime Minister of the famous Vladyslaw Gomulka.
The civilization of the Indo Valley dates back to the Bronze Age and extended into the North-West Indian subcontinent, which included much of current Pakistan, as well as some areas of North-West India and North-East Afghanistan.
This civilization develops on the banks of the Indo River, from which it has taken its name.
Although some scholars rightly assume that this civilization should be called "the Indo-Sarasvati civilization", because it was also living in the banks of the now prosecuted Sarasvati river, some call it the "the harpana civilization", by "Harappa", that is, the first of its sites, brought to light in the 1920s.
The military nature of the Roman Empire has promoted the development of progress in the medical field.
The first doctors were recruited by Emperor Augusto and were even the first Roman health body to be used in battles.
The surgeons knew several sedatives, including the morphine obtained from papaver seed extracts and the shocloamine derived from herbaceous plant seeds.
They became experts in amputations to save patients from cancer, as well as in the use of emostatic lactating and arterial pins to stop blood flow.
Over the centuries, the Roman Empire has seen the achievement of important achievements in the field of medicine, which have laid the foundations for modern knowledge.
The origami "Pureland" is an origami characterized by some limitations: it is possible to perform one fold at a time and no more complicated folds are allowed, such as reverse folds. In addition, all folds follow basic positions.
It was designed by John Smith in the 1970s to facilitate the work of unexpected climbers or those with limited engine capacity.
As young children, children are aware of both race and racial stereotypes and these latter influence their behavior.
For example, children who identify themselves in a racial minority that for stereotypes is considered to have poor school outcomes tend to not go well to school as soon as they come to know the stereotype associated with their race.
In the ranking of the most used websites in the United States, MySpace is the third place, with a current number of profiles equal to 54 million.
These websites have received great attention, especially in the field of education.
These websites feature positive aspects, including the ability to easily create a class page that includes blogs, videos, photos and other features.
Access to this page is done through a simple easy web address to remember and type, even in the case of students with problems with keyboard use or spelling.
You can customize it to make reading easier and you can also increase or decrease the color according to your preferences.
The attention deficit disorder "is a neurological syndrome whose triad of most common symptoms includes impulse, distraction, hyperactivity or excess energy".
This is not a learning disability, but a learning disorder; it "is responsible for 3-5% of children, which is equivalent to about 2 million American children".
Children with ADD are tired of focusing on things like school tasks, but they can focus on what they love to do, how to play, look at their favorite animated card or write phrases without punctuation.
These children tend to end up in trouble, since they "take risks, fight and challenge authority" to stimulate their own brain, as this cannot be stimulated by traditional methods.
The ADD conditions relations with the coetans since other children are unable to understand that their level of maturity is different or why they behave or write in a certain way.
Given the change in the ability to acquire knowledge and to learn, as mentioned above, the basic speed at which knowledge was acquired has also changed.
The way to receive the information was changed. The point was no longer the individual memory; attention was focused on the ability to remember the text.
In practice, the Renaissance has significantly changed the approach to learning and dissemination of knowledge.
Ominides no longer use their hands for the locomotion, to carry weights, or to walk among the trees, contrary to what other primates do.
The hands and feet of the chimpanzee have similar sizes and length, as a result of the fact that their hands support the weight of the body when walking on the nights.
The man's hand is shorter than the foot, and the falangi are more straight.
The passage in the specialization of the hand from locomotion to manipulation is demonstrated by bone fossils of the hands dating to two/three million years ago.
Some people think that making a lot of fancy dreams with a certain frequency can be particularly extensive.
The main reason for this phenomenon is the product of lucid dreams, which extend the time period between the REM phases.
By reducing the nighttime frequency of REMs, the state in which the actual sleep is experienced and the body recovers becomes more rare, at the point of creating a problem.
It's all as boring as if you had to wake up every twenty or thirty minutes to watch TV.
The effect varies according to the frequency with which your brain tries to dream lightly every night.
Until almost the beginning, things did not go well for the Italians in North Africa. Less than a week after the declaration of war in Italy took place on June 10, 1940, the British of the 11th Ussari Regime conquered the Fort Capuzzo in Libya.
The English captured General Lastucci, commander of the military genius of the 10th Italian Army, holding him an Imboscata east of Brady.
On June 28 was the friend's fire to kill italo Balbo, Libya's general governor and probably Mussolini's heir during the landing in Tobruk.
Today the screen is practiced at various levels, by students who learn to practice this sport at the university until professional and Olympic competitions.
This sport consists mainly of fighting between two opponents, where one double screen with the other.
The game of golf consists in hitting the balls to the mouth using specific apples.
A regular turn provides eighteen loops, with players that usually start from the first loop of the track and end at the sixteenth.
The winning player is what uses less punches, said swings of the puzzle, to complete the route.
The game takes place on the grass and the one that surrounds the hole, called "green", is cut shorter.
The most common type of tourism is what most people associate with the idea of travel: recreational tourism.
This kind of tourism takes place when people go to places very different from those who have attended in normal everyday life, with the aim of relaxing and having fun.
Beaches, thematic parks and campsites are the most frequently visited places by recreational tourists.
When the purpose of the visit to a specific place is to learn history and culture, then this kind of tourism is called cultural tourism.
Tourists can choose to visit more points of interest in a particular country or simply choose to focus on one area.
The settlers also, having noticed this activity, had called for reinforcements.
Among the troops that strengthened the advanced positions there were the 1st and 3rd New Hampshire regiments composed of 200 men, under the command of the Colonels John Stark and James Reed (both of whom became general).
The men of Stark took a position along the defense on the north side of the position of the settlers.
When the low tide opened a gap along the Mystic north-east river of the peninsula, the defenses were quickly extended thanks to a small stone wall toward the north, which ended on the shore of a small beach.
Gridley or Stark planted a pole at about 100 feet (30 m) from the fence, giving the order not to shoot until the regulars had overcome it.
The American plan consisted of launching attacks coordinated by three different directions.
To prevent the arrival of any reinforcements, General John Cadwalder would have launched a diverse attack on British troops in Bordentown.
General James Ewing would have led 700 militias across the river near Trenton Ferry, to take control of the bridge on the Assunpink River and prevent the escape to enemy troops.
The main assault force, consisting of 2,400 men, would have crossed the river nine miles north of Trenton, and then split into two groups, one ordered by Greene and the other by Sullivan, and driven an offensive before dawn.
Going from quarter to half a mile, speed becomes much less important, while resistance becomes a real necessity.
Of course, a podist who wants to face a race of half a mile at a certain level, a man who is able to beat the two minutes, must have a great dose of speed, but above everything is the resistance that needs to be trained.
The most suitable preparation for the race season provides during the winter a little camp race associated with a specific gym training for the upper part of the body.
The right nutrition practices are not enough to generate high performances, however, they can have a significant impact on the general well-being of young athletes.
Maintaining a healthy energy budget, getting used to proper hydration and understanding the various aspects of integration practices can help athletes improve their performance, as well as increase the pleasure of practicing sports.
The medium distance race is a relatively low-cost sport. However, there are wrong beliefs about the little equipment needed to participate.
Products may be purchased on the occasion, but most of them will have a direct or no impact on the performance.
Athletics might prefer a product even if they do not offer any real benefit.
We can consider the atom as one of the essential bricks that make up the matter.
This is a very complex entity, according to the simple model of Bohr, from a central nucleus on which orbits electrons, a little like the planets orbiting around the sun, see Figure 1.1.
The nucleus is formed by two types of particles: neutrons and protons.
The protons have a positive electrical charge, but the neutrons are free of charge. The electrons are characterized by a negative electric charge.
In order to examine the victim, it is necessary to inspect the scene to ensure its safety.
As we approach the victim, pay attention to his position and to the possible presence of automatic danger signals.
If you try to be of help you hurt, you can only get worse.
The study revealed that depression, fear, and disaster mediated the relationship between pain and disability in people affected by lumbargia.
The effects of disaster are the only ones to be conditioned by structured weekly sessions of physical activity, not depression and fear.
Those involved in regular activities needed more support, in terms of negative perception of the pain, to distinguish the differences between chronic pain and the feeling of discomfort due to normal physical movement.
The vision or ability to see depends on the senses organs or the eyes of the visual device.
There are various eye structures, whose complexity varies according to the needs of the body.
The various structures have different capacities, are sensitive to different wavelengths and have varying degrees of accuracy, and require different processes to interpret the signal and various numbers to function optimally.
A population is made up of all the organisms of a given species within a specific geographical area.
When all individuals of a population are identical from the point of view of a specific phenotypic approach, it is said that they are monomorphic.
Individuals with different variants of a specific stretch are defined as polymorphic.
In addition, colonies of legionnaires march and nest in different stages.
At the stage, the legionnaires march during the night, and then meet by day.
The colony enters a nomadic phase following the decline in food. During this phase, the colony realizes the temporary nests that are changed every day.
Each of these marches or nomadi rage lasts about 17 days.
What is a cell? The term "cell" comes from the Latin "cell", which means "small body", was used for the first time by a microscope who was studying the structure of the tipper.
The cell is the fundamental unit of every living being; in fact, all organisms are made up of one or more cells.
Cells are fundamental and essential for life study; in no case are often defined "the bricks of life".
The nervous system is able to maintain myostasis through the transmission of nerve impulses throughout the body to maintain the flow of blood in motion, and without interference.
These nerve impulses can be sent very quickly to each part of the body, so as to protect it from any potential threat.
The tornados hit a limited area than other violent storms, but they can destroy anything at their passage.
The tornados are spreading trees, tearing down axes from the buildings and tearing down cars by air. Among the most violent tornados, 2% have a duration of more than three hours.
During these storm storms, the winds can reach 480 km/h (133 m/s; 300 mph).
For thousands and thousands of years, man builds and uses the magnifying lenses.
But the first real telescopes were created in Europe at the end of the 16th century.
These telescopes used a set of two lenses to make the closest and larger objects appear the longest.
Avidity and selfishness will always be a part of us.
Most people will hopefully understand that the best choice for them is to work with others in the long term.
Many fantastic people on the day that human beings will be able to travel to another star and explore new worlds, some wonder what is out there, others think that on other planets they can live alien or other forms of life.
But if this ever happens, it probably won't happen for a very long period of time. The stars are so spread that there are billions of kilometers between the stars that prove to be "near".
Whether one day your ancestors will find themselves on a foreign world and think of their ancestors!
The animals are made up of many cells. They eat the food and dig it inside. Most animals are able to move.
Only animals have a brain (even if not all: the meduses for example are not provided).
On Earth, the animals are everywhere. They dig in the ground, swim in the waters of the oceans and fly in the sky.
The cell is the smallest structural and functional unit of living organisms.
Cell derives from the Latin word "cell", which means a small room.
If living beings are observed in the microscope, it is possible to note that they are formed by small squares or small spheres.
The English biologist Robert Hooke, with the help of a microscope, observed small squares in the suger.
They looked like rooms. He was the first to watch dead cells.
Elements and compositions have the ability to move from one state to another without making any changes.
The nitrogen in gaseous form retains the same properties of the liquid nitrogen. The density of the liquid state is greater, but the molecules remain the same.
Another example is water. The water compound consists of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen.
It has the same molecular structure, both in the gaseous state and in the liquid or solid state.
Although its physical state can change, the chemical state remains unchanged.
Time is something that surrounds us and affects every action we take, but it is difficult to understand.
The time is studied by religious scholars, philosophers and scientists for thousands of years.
We perceive the time as a series of events that pass from the future to the past through the present.
The time is also the unit of measurement with which we compare the duration (length) of the events.
Each of us can scan the passage of time by observing the repetition of a cyclic event, which is something that repeats systematically.
Today computers are used to manipulate images and videos.
It is possible to build researched animations, which are increasingly present on TV and in movies.
Music is often recorded using sophisticated computers to develop and mix sounds.
In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries it was believed that the first inhabitants of New Zealand were the Maori, a people who hunted huge birds called moas.
The theory then established the idea that the Maori people were migrating from Polynesia with a large fleet and arrived in New Zealand was sub-entered into the Moriori, establishing an agricultural society.
New evidence, however, suggests that the Moriori were a group of Maori of the earthquake that from New Zealand migrated to the islands of Chatham, developing a particular peaceful culture.
On the islands of Chatham there was also another tribe; it was Maori from New Zealand.
They were called Moriori and, after some fighting, they were finally pushed away.
People who have taken care of it for decades have helped us to appreciate our strengths and our passions, while at the same time we honestly evaluated our difficulties and also our failures.
Since listening to people who shared their personal, family and organizational stories, we have received very useful information about the past and some of the people who have had a rise, positive or negative, on the culture of the organization.
Even if knowing the history of a person does not necessarily mean understanding the culture, it does help people to understand where they are within the organization.
In assessing the successes and taking into account the failures, both individuals and the participants as a whole have the ability to discover in greater depth the values, objectives and strengths of the organisation.
In this case, recalling previous examples of entrepreneurship and its success has encouraged the opening of people to new changes and directions for the local church.
These successful cases have softened the fears of change, while creating positive attitudes towards change in the future.
Convergent thinking schemes are problem-solving techniques: they combine different ideas or areas to reach a solution.
This kind of thought emphasizes the speed, logic and accuracy, focusing also on the recognition of facts, on the application of existing techniques and on the collection of information.
The most important factor in this way of thinking is: there is only one correct answer. You think only of two answers, that is to say one right and one wrong.
This type of opinion is associated with certain scientific or common procedures.
People with this kind of thinking have a logical thought, are able to store schemes, are able to solve problems and can work on scientific tests.
Human beings are the kind of big-longer equipped to read each other's minds.
This means that we can accurately predict what other humans perceive, understand, think, know or wish.
It is fundamental among these abilities that we understand the other intentions, which enables us to resolve possible ambiguity of physical behavior.
For example, if you have to see a person breaking the window of a car, it's easy to guess what he's trying to steal the car of an unknown person.
If he lost the keys to the car and himself trying to destroy his own car, he should be judged differently.
The physical phenomenon known as nuclear magnetic resonance (MMN), discovered in the 1930s by Felix Bloch (the University of Stanford) and Edward Purcell (the University of Harvard) is based on magnetic resonance.
In this resonance, because of the magnetic field and the radio waves, atoms emit weak radio signals.
In 1970, scientist and physician Raymond Damadian, laid the foundations for using magnetic resonance for images as a tool for performing medical diagnosis.
Four years later he obtained his first patent in the field of magnetic resonance.
In 1977, Dr. Damadian completed the construction of the first scanner for the magnetic resonance "integral", which he called "Indomitable" ("Indomable").
Asynchronous communication promotes time for reflection and reaction to others.
Allow students to adapt their activities to their own pace and manage the speed of teaching information.
There are also less time constraints and this makes working hours more flexible. (Bremer, 1998)
Thanks to the use of the Internet and the World Wide Web, students can access information at any time.
Students can also send questions to teachers at any time of the day and expect answers in a discreetly fast time rather than waiting until the next person meeting.
The post-modern approach to learning offers absolute freedom. There is not only a valid way to learn.
As there is no right thing to learn: it is the experience between students and knowledge presented to give place to learning.
This theory is appreciated by our current experience in the context of television broadcasts about you and providing information.
It is very common to see a television program that gives information about a procedure or tells an experience to which you will never take part or which knowledge will never be applied.
We will never repair a car, we will never build a fountain in the house garden, we will not go to Peru to visit the ancient ruins, nor we will rebuild our neighbor's house.
Submarines in fibre optics with Europe and broadband satellites allow Greenland to connect with 93% of the population that has an internet line.
It is likely that your hotel or guest (in case you stay in a guesthouse or in a private house) have the Wi-Fi or a computer connected to the Internet; in addition, you will find a coffee internet or a place with public Wi-Fi.
As already noted, despite the term "exemies" is acceptable in the United States, it is considered to be disparaging from the non-US artistic populations, especially in Canada.
Even if you can hear this word from the Greenlandese natives, foreigners should avoid using it.
The inhabitants of Greenland self-defined Inuit in Canada and Kalaalleq (a Greenlandese, multiple Kalaalit) in Greenland.
In Greenland, crime and hostility towards foreigners are practically nonexistent. Even in cities there are "dangerous areas".
The only real danger to an unprepared traveler may be the cold.
If you visit Greenland during the cold season (regarding that more you move to the north and will make more cold), it is essential to equip yourself with quite warm clothing.
The long summer days can lead to sleep problems and health problems.
During the summer period, pay attention also to the northern spells. They don't transmit diseases, but they can be annoying.
The economy of San Francisco is diverse, although it is linked to its world-wide tourist attraction condition.
The most important employment sectors are professional services, government, finance, trade and tourism.
Music, film and popular culture have often represented the city, contributing to the world fame of the city itself and its monuments.
San Francisco has developed a large tourist infrastructure, with numerous hotels, restaurants and excellent congress facilities.
San Francisco is also one of the best cities in the state where you like other Asian cuisine, such as Korean, Thai, Indian and Japanese.
For many American families, Walt Disney World is one of the most important trips.
The typical tour program provides a flight to Orlando International Airport, a bus for a Disney hotel on site, a stay of about a week exclusively within Disney property and the return home.
There are endless variations possible, but this is what most people have in mind when they say "go to Disney World".
Many tickets sold online via auction sites, such as eBay or Craigslist, are valid Park-hopper tickets for several days and partly used.
Although it is a very common practice, it is forbidden by Disney: tickets are not transferable.
To be able to camp under the Grand Canyon, you must get permission for backcountry.
For the protection of the canyon, permits are available in a limited number and must be requested on the first day of the month, four months before the beginning of the month.
As a result, from 1 January, a backcountry permit will be available for any starting date in May.
The spaces available in the most popular areas, including the Bright Angel Campground which is next to the Phantom Ranch, are usually filled with requests received on the first day of opening to booking.
A limited number of permits are available for non-booking requests, assigned in order of arrival.
Getting into South Africa by car is an extraordinary way to admire the beauty of the region and to reach destinations outside the usual tourist routes.
For this purpose, a normal car can be used with careful planning, but a 4x4 vehicle is strongly recommended. Many elsewhere are only accessible with a 4x4 high-interlacing.
When you plan this trip, keep in mind that South Africa is a stable country, but the neighbouring countries are not always.
The requirements of the visa, as well as its costs, change according to the nation and depend on the country of origin.
Each country also has specific laws which determine which emergency instruments must be present in the car.
Victoria Falls is a city located in the western part of Zimbabwe, on the border with Livingstone, Zambia, and near Botswana.
The city is located right next to the waterfalls: these represent the main attraction of this notable tourist destination, which however offers many opportunities for longer stays, both for adventure lovers and for panorama lovers.
The water volume increases during the rainy season (from November to March) so the waterfalls appear more scenographic.
It is impossible not to swim through the river or walk along the paths that cost the waterfalls.
On the other hand, it will be for the huge volume of water that the sight of waterfalls will be obscured; from all that water!
Tutankhamon's Tomb (KV62). The KV62 is probably the most known tomb of the King's Valley, the scene of Howard Carter's discovery in 1922 of the real burial almost intact by the young king.
But, compared to most of the other real graves, Tutankhamon's tomb almost deserves to be visited, as much smaller and poorly decorated.
Only the head and back are visible, so anyone who wants to see the evidence of the damage caused to the mummie after trying to remove it from the bar will remain disappointed.
The magnificent treasures of the tomb are no longer within it, being transferred to the Egyptian Museum of Cairo.
To tourists who have little time available, we recommend to visit other places.
Phnom Krom, 12 km south-west of Siem Reap. The temple was built on the top of a hill at the end of the 9th century, at the time of the reign of King Yasovarman.
It is worth climbing the hill to enjoy the dark atmosphere of this temple and the panorama on Lake Tonlé Sap.
On a visit to the site you can easily combine a boat trip on the lake.
To enter the temple you need the Angkor Pass pass, so to go to Tonlé Sap you need to remember to carry the passport.
In addition to being the largest city in Israel, Jerusalem is the capital, although most other countries, as well as the United Nations, do not recognize that status.
This ancient city that rises on the hills of Judea has a millennial and fascinating history.
It is the sacred city of the three monotheistic religions, that is, Hebrew, Christianity and Islam, and performs the function of spiritual, religious and cultural center.
For the religious meaning that it reaches and, above all, for the numerous sites in the Old City area, Jerusalem is one of Israel's main tourist destinations.
Jerusalem boasts numerous places of historical, archaeological and cultural interest, as well as lively and crowded shopping centres, bars and restaurants.
To enter Ecuador, Cuban citizens arriving through international airports or border crossings must have received a prior letter of invitation.
This letter must be legislated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and must also comply with certain requirements.
These requirements were introduced to regulate the migration flow between the two countries.
Cuban citizens of a US Green Card must address an Ecuadorian consulate to obtain an exemption from this requirement.
The passport must be valid for at least 6 months after the date of the trip. To demonstrate the duration of the stay, a departure and return ticket is required.
Tours are cheaper for the most numerous groups, so if you are alone or in the company of a single friend, you can try to meet others to form a group of four or six, so that you have a more affordable rate.
In any case, it is not something to be underestimated, as tourists are often pushed forward and back to fill the cars.
In fact, it seems more like a way to deceive people, convincing them that they have to pay more.
At the northern end of the Machu Picchu climbs this rocky mountain, often the background of many photographs of the ruins.
Looking down, it looks a little scary; it's a quick and complicated climb, but people with a discreet physical form should be able to complete the company in about 45 minutes.
The stone steps are present on a large part of the road, and in the fastest parts the steel cables are a support corridor.
This said, expect you to remain steadfast and pay attention to the most obscure points, especially when they are wet, since they can become dangerous quickly.
Near the summit, there is a rather low and narrow small cave that must be crossed.
To admire the places and wild fauna of the Galapagos it is recommended to use the boat, just as Charles Darwin did in 1835.
The Galapagos waters are landed by more than 60 cruise ships of various sizes, from 8 to 100 passengers.
Most people book their place very early (the boats are usually full in high season).
Make sure that the travel agent with whom the booking is made is an expert from the Galapagos with a good knowledge of the various types of ships.
This will enable you to quantify your interests and/or particular links with the most appropriate vessel.
Before the arrival of the Spanish in the 16th century, northern Chile was controlled by the Inca, while the central and southern part of the country were inhabited by the indigenous peoples of the Araucacania, the Mapuche.
The Mapuche were also among the last independent American indigenous groups: they were absorbed entirely by the Spanish domain only after Chile's independence.
Chile declared independence in 1810 (in the midst of the Napoleonic wars that left Spain for a couple of years without a functioning central government), but the decisive victory over the Spanish was achieved only in 1818.
The Dominican Republic (in Spanish Dominican Republic) is a Caribbean country located on the eastern half of the island of Hispaniola, the other half of which belongs to Haiti.
Besides having white sand beaches and mountain landscapes, the country hosts one of the oldest European cities in the Americas, now part of Santo Domingo.
The first inhabitants of the island were the Tainos and the Caribbeans. The Caribbean were a people of the Arab language who lived around 10,000 BC.
The population of Taino, within a few years of the arrival of European explorers, was drastically reduced by Spanish conquerors.
According to Fray Bartolomé de las Casas in the "Tratado de las Indias", the Spanish conquerors killed about 100,000 Taino between 1492 and 1498.
Jardín de la Union. This space constituted the atrium of a 17th century convent, whose only surviving building today is the Church of San Diego.
Now it performs the function of the central square, where many things often happen, both day and night.
The garden is surrounded by several restaurants. In the afternoon and in the evening it is often possible to listen to free concerts from the central pavilion.
Callejon del Beso (Vicolo del Bacio). Two balconies separated by just 69 centimeters, which were the theater of an ancient romantic legend.
For a few pennys, some kid will tell you the story.
Bowen Island is a well-known daily trip or excursion for the weekend, which offers the opportunity to make Kayak, excursions, visit shops, restaurants and more.
This typical community is located in Howe Sound, at the gates of Vancouver, and can be easily reached by the water taxis from Granville Island, in the city centre.
For those who love outdoor activities, a trip along the Sea to Sky route is essential.
Whistler () is a two-hour drive from Vancouver. It is a high-cost location, but well known for the 2010 Winter Olympics.
During the winter it is possible to enjoy skiing in one of North America's best composers, while in summer it is possible to try the real mountain biking.
The permits must be booked in advance. A permit is required to stay in Sirena.
Sirena is the only Ranger station offering, in addition to the campsite, a temporary accommodation in the bedroom and hot meals. In La Leona, San Pedrillo and Los Patos there are campsites, but not the restaurant.
Parking permits can be purchased directly at the rangers station of Puerto Jiménez, but credit cards are not accepted.
The parking service (MINAE - Ministry of the Environment and Energy) does not allow for suspension with more than one month in advance than expected arrival.
CafeNet El Sol offers a 30-dollar booking service, or 10-dollar daily pass; details are available on the operator's Corcovado page.
Cook Islands are located in Polynesia, in the centre of the South Pacific Ocean; they constitute an island state in free association with New Zealand.
It is an archipelago consisting of 15 islands distributed on an oceanic surface of about 2.2 million km2.
The islands, which have the same time zone of Hawaii, are sometimes considered in the same island of Hawaii.
The smaller, some older travelers, the island remembers the Hawaiians before they became a state, without the large hotels for tourists and other transformations.
Cook Islands consist of 15 different islands, the main are Rarotonga and Aitutaki, but are not present in the city.
Today in developed countries offering luxury bed & breakfast facilities has become almost an art form.
The B&Bs of the highest class naturally compete mainly at bed and breakfast level.
In fact, in the most refined structures of this category it is easy to find elegant sheets, hand-made hooks or time beds.
Breakfast may include typical seasonal pre-emptions of the area or a specialty of the landlord of the house.
The environment can be a historic building with ancient furnishings, curative gardens and a swimming pool.
Getting out in the car and leaving for a distant destination has the intrinsic fascination of simplicity.
Compared to the larger means, you will certainly already have some mesmerity with your car, and you will know the limits.
Mounting a tent on a private property or in a city, small or large, can easily be subject to unwanted attention.
In short, your car is a great choice for a journey on the road, but it is difficult for it, as such, to be a good way to "campare".
The car campsite is possible if you have a truck, a SUV, a berlin or a car station with the seatbelts.
Some hotels enjoy traditions that date back to the golden age, the era of steam railways and transatlantics prior to the second world war, between the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century.
These hotels were located in the places where the rich and famous people of the time stayed and often offered a refined cuisine and night entertainment.
The old-style furniture, the absence of the latest equipment and a certain grace without time contribute to their character.
Although they are usually owned by private individuals, they sometimes host heads of state and other visiting authorities.
A traveler with several money could consider the idea of a flight around the world, with pauses to stay in many of these hotels.
A network for the exchange of hospitality is an organization that allows travellers to contact the people who live in the cities that will visit.
Usually to enter a network of this type is enough to complete an online module, even if some networks offer or require further verification processes.
Therefore, a list is provided, in paper and/or online format, that reports the available hosts and that may at times be complete with references and reviews of other travellers.
Couchsurfing was founded in January 2004, after the episode in which the programmer Casey Fenton had found an economic flight to Iceland, but had not found an accommodation.
He emailed the students of the local university and received an overwhelming number of free accommodation offers.
The hostels address the young most (a typical guest is on the 20th), but it is often possible to find even more mature travelers.
It is rare to see families with children, but some hostels are in private rooms.
The city of Beijing, in China, will host the Winter Olympic Games of 2022, thus becoming the first city to host both the Summer Olympics and the Winter Olympics.
Beijing will host the opening ceremony and closing ceremony, as well as the ice events that take place on the roof.
In the Taizicheng ski area in Zhangjiakou, which is about 220 km (140 miles) from Beijing, further ski events will take place.
Most temples have an annual festival from the end of November to mid-May, which varies according to the annual calendar of the single temple.
Most of the temple celebrations are held in the framework of the festivals organized for the anniversary of the temple or for the observance of the divinity that presides over the temple or for any other important occasion associated with it.
The festivals of the temples of Kerala are very fascinating to see, with the numerous processions of elephants barded at feasts, the temple orchestra and other celebrations.
For World Fair (usually also defined World Exhibition or simply Expo) an international festival of great art and sciences is meant.
The participating countries offer artistic and educational exhibitions in national pavilions to expose the themes of the world or culture and the history of their country of origin.
International Orthoculture exhibitions are events dedicated to the exhibition of floral compositions, botanical gardens and all that it has to do with plants.
Although they can theoretically take place every year (even in different countries), in practice this does not happen.
These events usually last between three and six months and take place in areas not less than 50 hectares.
There are many different film formats that have been used over time. The most common is the standard 35 mm film (negative 36x24 mm).
Usually it can be refurbished quite easily if it expires, and ensures a more or less comparable resolution than that of an existing DSLR.
Some similar medium-format cameras use dimensions of 6x6 cm, more precisely a negative of 56x56 mm.
This offers a resolution almost four times higher than a negative of 35 mm (3.136 mm2 versus 864).
The wild fauna is one of the most difficult subjects for a photographer: it serves a combination of various factors including happiness, patience, experience and adequate equipment.
Naturalistic photography is often almost discounted, but as for photography in any area, an image has more value than thousands of words.
Naturalistic photography often requires a long teletarget lens, although they used other lens for subjects like a bird storm or a small creature.
Many exotic animals are hard to find and the photographs taken for commercial purposes are regulated by the rules of some parks.
Wild animals can be hideous or aggressive. The environment can be cold, hot or in any hostile case.
There are more than 5,000 different languages in the world, of which more than 20 have at least 50 million speakers.
In addition, the written words are often easier to understand than those spoken. This is especially true for the addresses, often difficult to express clearly.
In many nations a great English is spoken, but in many others the knowledge of this language is limited, especially among young people.
Try to imagine, if you want, a citizen of Manchester, one of Boston, a Jamaican and one of Sydney sitting around a dinner table in a Toronto restaurant.
They come together with stories of their native cities, told with their distinctive accents and in local jargon.
The most convenient way to nourish yourself is usually to buy the food at the supermarket. However, if you do not have the opportunity to cook, the choices are limited to ready food.
More and more supermarkets offer a deal with a greater choice of ready food. Some even offer microwave ovens or other means to warm up the food.
In some countries or in some types of shops there is at least an internal restaurant, often rather informal with affordable prices.
To produce copies of the policy and the policy-making of the insurer and take them with him.
They must display the e-mail address of the insurer and international telephone numbers for recommendations/authorisations and to require compensation.
Take care of another copy in a suitcase and online (on e-mail as attached or saved on cloud).
If you travel with a laptop or tablet, keep a copy in memory or on disk (accessible without internet).
Also distribute copies of the policy/contact to travel companions and relatives or friends at home, wishing to help.
The heights (or armored) are not aggressive by nature, but they defend themselves if they perceive a threat.
If people underestimate the potential danger of highs, they could get too close to them and run risks.
Drink alcohol responsible. Drinking alcohol has a different effect on everyone, and knowing your limit is very important.
Possible long-term long-term health episodes related to alcohol abuse may include liver damage and still blindness or death. Potential risk increases with illicit consumption of alcohol.
There may be various types of dangerous impurities in illegal alcohols, including methanol, which, even in small doses, may cause blindness or death.
Eyeglasses can be cheaper abroad, especially in low-income countries where the cost of working is lower.
Take into account the possibility of conducting an eye examination at home, especially if the insurance covers it, and bring the prescription with you to present it where required.
Luxury brands available in these areas may present two types of problems: some may be imitations and imported genuine ones may be more expensive than those purchased in their own country.
Coffee is one of the most traded goods in the world and it is likely that you can find several types in your region of origin.
However, there are many features in the world to drink coffee, which is worth trying.
The canyoning (or canyoneering) consists of the descent towards the bottom of a throat, which can be dried or filled with water.
Torrentism combines elements of the swim, climbing and jumping; however, to start it serves relatively little training and physical form (on the one hand to the training and physical form required, for example, for climbing on rock, for underwater dives or for mountain skis).
Excursionism is an activity that takes place in the open air and provides for walks in natural environments, often on specific routes for excursionism.
One day's excursions provide distances ranging from less than one mile to longer distances that can nevertheless be travelled in one day.
One day's excursions on an easy path require little preparation, and anyone moderately in shape can benefit them.
An open-air day is also possible for those who have preschool children and children, even if families with young children might require more preparation.
There are about 200 running tour organisations around the world. Most of these operate independently.
Go Running Tours, successor to Global Running Tours, creates networks of dozens of sighting providers scattered in four continents.
With roots in Running Tours Barcelona and in Running Copenhagen, Running Tours Prague and others have quickly added.
When deciding to take a trip, it is necessary to take into account various aspects, both before departure and in the journey.
When you travel, you need to be aware that things are not like home. Behaviors, laws, food, traffic, housing, rules, language and so on will be in part different than those of the place where you live.
This is an aspect always to keep in mind to avoid disappointments or even affluence for the habits of the place.
The appearance of tourist agencies dates back to the 19th century. A travel agent usually represents a valid alternative to a journey that transcends the previous experience of the traveler in nature, culture, language or low-income countries.
Although most agencies especially accept normal bookings, many of these are specialized in particular types of travel, price ranges or destinations.

The Antarctica surrounds the South Pole and is the coldest point of the Earth.
Tourist visits are expensive and presuppose a good physical form, they are only possible in the summer period, from November to February, and are therefore most circumscribed to the peninsula, the islands and the Sea of Ross.
In the summer, mainly in these areas, there are two thousand employees divided into about fifty bases, while during the winter months there are only a handful of people.

The most common causes of infertility in winter are road, trams and, above all, slippery stairs.
They are necessary for at least footwear with suitable soles. Summer shoes are usually very slippery on ice and snow, and sometimes it is also some winter boots.
The soil must be sufficiently deep, 5 mm (1/5 inches) or more, and the material must be kept sufficiently soft at low temperatures.
