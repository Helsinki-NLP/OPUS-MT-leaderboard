Semilaric against the prosecutor ' s office: the death of the former mayor of Tartu will be considered on 4 August
This means that it is likely to be decided in early September.
The Courts of First Instance refused to consider the claim of Semilarski, but in April, its cassation complaint was brought before the State Court.
On 12 December 2019, the Tartu Administrative Court returned a complaint to the complainant, as its authorization was not within the jurisdiction of the Administrative Court.
The Court's ruling indicated that the complaint contained a claim for compensation for the damage caused during criminal proceedings.
“Regulatory matters must be handled by the prosecutor and the court of departure”, explained former correspondent ERR Press Secretary of the Tartu Court, Annette Creatsmann.
She said that Valvo Semilarski had regretted this decision in the district court, which on 5 February had not changed the decision of the court of the first instance.
Now you're going to have to say your word.
According to the defender of Samilarski, a sworn lawyer, Oliver Neaes, his client was unsubstantiated for about two years.
He now demands the prosecutor ' s office to reject the false allegations in his address and to compensate him for the moral damage.
In October 2017, when Samilarski, together with the other sister-in-law of Tartu Artem Sowrow, was arrested for several crimes, the prosecutor of the Lebanese District Prosecutor Margus Gross, has been accused of bringing complaints to the court.
“Remember, when I was arrested, the Security Police and the Public Prosecutor immediately organized a press conference and informed the whole of the Republic of Estonia that the Tartu leaders, one of the most influential local authorities, were sold.
Those air - conditioned public suspicions accompanied me for about two years.
And now that these allegations and suspicions have been false, the prosecutor's office doesn't want to talk about it," Semilarski commented in early August 2019.
According to Oliver Neaes, the prosecutor went beyond the legal framework in which the prosecutor was to operate.
"The claim of acquisitions and sales has proved false, but it is not the only problem here.
The European Court of Human Rights, for example, has repeatedly stressed in its decisions on Russia and Lithuania that during the investigation, representatives of States should be cautious in choosing words so that suspects are not represented as criminals before the conviction.
The prosecutor's office also imposed a presumption of innocence, which, unfortunately, was not respected in this case against Valvo Semilarski," Niaez said.
“The public representation of Semilarski as a serious offender and recipient in circumstances where the facts underlying the suspicion of a recipient are still being ascertained are unacceptable, contrary to the presumption of innocence and unfairly vis-à-vis the complainant,” added the lawyer.
As Rus.err.ee wrote, the former mayor of Tartu Valvo Semilarski will not be charged with the charge of the indictment - the criminal case brought against him in July was partially closed.
At the same time, the former officer is accused of deliberately violating anti-corruption legislation in the conduct of transactions in particular large sizes.
According to the indictment, from 2015 to 2017, the former Deputy Mayor of Tartu participated more than thirty times in the city law meetings in the decision-making of the companies in Tartu, whose owners or managers, Semilarski, had been actively involved at the personal level at an extraordinary time.
According to Gross, in all these cases, Semilarski had personal interests and therefore had to be removed from participation in decision-making.
Earlier, as Rus.err.ee wrote, the prosecutor's office had submitted Semilaric suspicions of receiving bribery and violating anti-corruption legislation in dealing in particular large sizes.
This happened in October 2016 when he was arrested along with another deputy mayor, Artem Sowrow (Centrist Party).
The prosecutor ' s office and the Security Police then stated that there was strong evidence against both Vice-Presidents.
After that, both officials resigned.
The Suvorov case was later brought before the court, which fully justified the policy.
The judicial investigation in the Valvo Semilarski case is still ongoing.

The singer is probably breathing in the beautiful town of Twerska, along with the family.
The inhabitants of the region have already thanked the performers for their visit, as well as expressed the hope of meeting and personal communication.
The new "Kroška" in the post is probably due to the new version of the old song that Zukov has now written with the blogger and musician David Manukyan (DAVA M).
Most fans are left with an old version of ZA: "Sergey, the old version of the song is clearly 1,000,000 times better!
Support me with the hand-held fans on top, we don't need a new hook.
Most of them even write directly that they like the original, which has become a hit in their time.

How the decision of the CB to reduce the key rate affects the economy
We're expecting the bank of Russia to reduce the key rate again.
It has dropped by another 0.25 per cent, to 4.25 per cent of the year, a formal historical minimum.
In the light of a brief reduction in the rate, as well as the tone of the CB's statements and updated forecasts on the Russian economy, the regulator looks at economic prospects more optimistic than before.
This means that the current cycle of monetary policy mitigation can soon be stopped.
"We have continued to mitigate monetary policy, especially since there are still risks of inflation declines below 4 per cent in 2021," said President Elvira Nabiullin of Russia.
They are associated with a significant decline in economic activity, a fall in domestic and external demand.
The recovery of the economy, according to Nabiullin, will take more than half a year.
It noted, however, that, following the removal of the restrictions resulting from the pandemic, economic processes were revived: energy consumption, consumer demand and investment demand, increased construction and issue of consumer goods, slowed the annual rates of reduction of transport traffic, production.
According to the CBC, the economic downturn in 2020 would be 4.5-5.5% (before expected 4-6 per cent) and the recovery growth in 2021 would be 3.5 to 4.5 per cent, and in 2022 2.5 to 3.5 per cent.
In addition, the Bank of Russia revised the annual oil prices forecast to $38 and $40 per barrel of Urals in 2020 and 2021 respectively.
In the past, the CB expected $27 and $35 for the barrel.
Finally, the Russian inflation Bank forecast for 2020 was 3.7-4.2% against the previous expected 3.8-4.8%.
The Bank of Russia's view of the situation in the economy is becoming more optimistic, which brings us closer to the end of the mitigation cycle, according to economists on Russia and the CIS Renesance Capital Sofia Donez and Andrei Melastenko.
Yes, the Bank of Russia has consistently reduced the key rate for more years, and since the beginning of last summer it has fallen by 3.5 percentage points.
At the last meeting in June, the CB lowered it immediately at one percentage point because of low inflation rates due to the pressing demand and the need to stimulate the slowed pace of the pandemic and associated economic constraints.
The chances of monetary policy adjustment are maintained (at the next meeting on 18 September and by the end of the year), but the border is already close, with the agreement of the main analyst, Rosbank Evgenie Koschelev.
The pool of inflation risks also indicates the proximity of the break in the reduction of interest policy - broken supply chains, possible increase of costs due to prevention of the epidemic, and faster recovery of demand (as expected) than expected, he said.
In conclusion, the Bank of Russia will need more attention to the inflation processes during the harvest season, as well as the external volatility that has increased in the face of geopolitical conflicts, Koschelev indicated.
Thus, or otherwise, a reduction in the key rate would lead to a further reduction in the rates for the most reliable borrowers, as well as perhaps by mortgage, said the senior economist of the bank's "Open" analysis management, Maxim Petronovic.

In general, the pre-school and secondary education project is of particular importance for the region.
For your district, especially.
The demographic situation here is the best in the region.
And we are obliged to create all the conditions for the education and enjoyment of children of all ages, as noted by Igor Kobzev, Governor of Irkutsk.
At the meeting, the head of the region instructed all mayors to be actively involved in the development of human settlements.
This is one of the main conditions for the integrated development of the district.

This is necessary for the development of the territory, for the construction of socially important facilities, as well as for infrastructure and cultural heritage facilities, as stressed by the head of the region.

The Sub-Mose authorities have told about the fate of closed mines
In Sub-Moscow, solid household waste fields continue to be closed.
This year, the authorities promise to eliminate the latter.
Some of the 39 landfills are modernized in modern waste processing facilities.
But this option is not possible for every polygonna, many of which have grown up with a flat housing.
After the polygonal is closed, it rises to recuperation - the body of the polygon is resuspended by ground, the degasation systems and the removal of the infiltrate are mounted.
This allows the chemical processes to be stopped in the trash, so that it does not melt, or that there is no evil, nor does it poison soil and groundwater.
And then the ex-con keeps raising a useless dog in the middle of her living room.
Why don't you do something useful?
For example, in Russia, where the recuperation of the Annanian polyno was literally completed, the authorities considered the option of making a mountain slope from the dog.
This polygon, which was operated from 1976 to 2016, grew so that it reached beyond the boundaries of its land.
It was therefore necessary to purchase adjacent sites, de facto that had long been seized by a musor under siege.
"Sometimes will pass, the polygon will "suffer," will take up the strength, and we'll think what we can do to get him to benefit.
It's a mountain resort, right in the eye," the head of the Russian district Nikolai Parfenov told reporters.
Two fields will become renewable energy sources

"Timohohovo" will produce 72.5 million kilowatts and continue to operate as a musoroprocessing complex.
A museum may be set up at the Balashin police station, Cusino, which was closed after the citizens' complaints on the Straight Line with the President of the country.
"It was such an idea to create a museum for the reculture of Podmozkovya polygons," said the Government's Minister of Ecology and Environment of Dmitri Curakin.

Beautiful high minerals only decorated Ayah-Sofia
Once again about Ayah-Sofia, the text of Vladimir Zelinski, which, please, must be protested.
First of all, there's been a free entrance.
I wasn't in Istanbul, but in God's House I'd be better free of charge.
Second, Muslims have made a fair profit of this land, just as the Orthodox have won the Volgo-Oxco interface, the Muslim Caucasian (and set up churches in Grosno) and planted apples on Mars.
God help!
The Jews conquered the Holy Land.
The Americans won the U.S.
We'll all be back?
You don't think there's any linguists who will need to return to their capital, where the 10th Church?
Third, Muslims have improved this building, invested in it.
In other words, it is the same as the factories and premises that the linens have chosen for their own possession as the linens - Putin and other nomenclatures.
They have improved everything from Kremlin to Angara, so it's all about the rights of the progressives.
The beautiful high mines were very beautiful to Ayah-Sofia, very.
It was a stupid blacksmith, it became a stupid blacksmith with beautiful minerals.
Fourthly, there are no "Islamic" and "legal" civilizations.
There are those who believe, and there are some hypocrites, and there are some hypocrites, and some who are allegorical.
The person who believes in the categories of civilization will not think.
It's the thought of a British MIDI officer Toynby who is ashamed to think so.
And a place of prayer for everyone who believes.
And always.
The prayer of the believer is not but from a place from which he may be asked to be heard.
Indeed, he is a believer, but he is not of those who are defiantly disobedient.
We're snakes, not cave-stones.

The President of the Russian Football Union (RFS) Alexander Dukov believes that it is wrong to expand the Russian Prime Minister (RPL) to 18 teams at the moment.

Koby, he's got a good shot, great pass!
