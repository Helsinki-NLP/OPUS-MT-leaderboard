At the end of the exchange, the Prague Bascula stock exchange in the negative
After the fall of Tuesday morning, the Prague Stock Exchange rectified its losses.
Transactions with CEZ actions reached almost half of the usual daily exchange.
On Tuesday, at the beginning of the exchange, the Prague Stock Exchange resumed with its collapse of the watch, when it lost almost six percent.
This time, the decline is due to a drop in shares on Wall Street.
The response of the market to the result of the vote of the House of American Representatives, who refuses to adopt the Stabilisation Plan of the American Financial Sector, is also perceived by us.
Buying Action in Asia
Asian scholarships have a dramatic fall on Tuesday, even if the indexes have succeeded in destroying part of the losses during the day.
The Hang Seng index of Hong Kong's stock exchange loses four percent during the trades, but later it reduces some of the losses and reduces the decrease to about 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Index Entrepreneurs following the movement of Chinese shares in Hong Kong's stock exchange lost 3.8%, the markets being closed in Shanghai.
Sydney's stock was lost by more than five percent, but eventually we managed to reduce losses to 4.3 percent.
According to its index, the Taiwan Stock Exchange lost 3.6 per cent.
"The hesitation of the rescue action in the United States will affect the financial markets of the world," observes Joseph Yam, head of Hong Kong's monetary office.
Although Hong Kong is part of China, it establishes its monetary policy itself, i.e. independently of the Chinese central bank.
Interest rates in Hong Kong have the same level as in the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, US legislators should quickly resume negotiations and adopt the proposal for support for the financial system.
Otherwise, other countries would be at risk.
The U.S. Blood Bath
On Monday, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the draft support for the financial system, to which it had to devote up to $700 billion (about 12 billion in Kč).
The legislators thus renew the appeal to support the project of President George Bush.
According to Bush, the project should address the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
On Monday, U.S. shares run a blood bath and the main action indicators have been the biggest drop in the last 20 years.
The Dow Jones index has lost nearly seven percent, having suffered a fall from such a huge for the last time in 1987.
The index was already lost during the vote, but when it appeared that the proposal was not adopted, it was in free fall.
Congress grants: US government can inject 700 billion dollars into banks
The leaders of the U.S. Congress and the government of President George W. Bush agreed on a broader form of the financial assistance agreement to the U.S. financial system.
It shall be put to the vote at the beginning of next week.
The US legislators made a decisive turn in the discussions on the adoption of a rescue plan in the form of financial assistance of $700 billion (about 12 billion crowns), granted to the US financial system.
Success is not so sure.
Indeed, before the final version of the law can be published and put to the vote, Congressmen must complete a number of details of the agreement.
The support plan of the financial system will be discussed at the House of Representatives on Monday.
It says Sunday to Reuters Barney Frank, the chairman of the Board's banking and financial regulation committee.
According to sources, on Wednesday at first, the plan should be put to the vote in the Senate.
According to economists, the announcement that the rescue plan will be adopted should be a first major psychological factor in reducing financial markets.
However, given the complexity of the mechanisms by which market aid can be effective, a "dissolved" will follow.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made great progress.
We have settled our divergent views on the form that should have the package of measures to stabilise the market," Democrat Nancy Pelosi told Bloomberg.
According to it, the final vote could be taken as soon as Sunday.
On Saturday night to Sunday, representatives of the legislators met with the US Minister of Finance Henry Paulson to give the government a final form.
It should buy from financial corporations the real estate assets that lead financial enterprises to significant losses and threaten the stability of the system as a whole.
"We are about to agree on a plan that will work and that must also be effective on the market.
There is still a need to pursue this plan to restore markets, but I think we are there," Paulson said.
A signal for Asian trade
The global financial crisis has a significant impact on the emerging stock markets.
According to the Democratic Senator Harry Reid, the legislators are making sure that Congress reaches a final agreement on Sunday.
They therefore want to calm investors before the start of trade in Asian financial markets, which are located in the first time zone, where Congress' decision could affect Monday's trade.
At the moment, however, it is impossible to state with certainty when the two Houses of the American Congress will vote, even if the negotiations are not at risk of being blocked, at the last moment, by such a problem.
The legislators hope that it will be adopted during the coming days.
However, the law will still be subject to many changes.
The total amount to be allocated to the system shall be divided into two parts.
The first 350 billion dollars, as President George Bush wanted, must be available as soon as possible.
However, if Congress has the impression that the programme does not fulfil its function, it has the possibility to block the remaining amount, in two stages: first of 100 billion additional dollars, then, to end, 350 billion dollars.
Mr. Bush welcomed the progress made in the negotiations
Although the President may vote in favour of this decision, Congress has the opportunity to vote in minority.
Despite these changes, the main idea of the program, which was to obtain funds for the purchase of bad real estate securities, including the value of the shed, because hundreds of thousands of Americans are unable to pay their mortgages, was maintained.
"All the work is done.
The House of Representatives should be able to proceed on Sunday at the vote of the law, and the Senate Monday," said Senator Judd Gregg.
US President George Bush himself is pleased with the progress in the negotiations.
His spokesperson Tony Fratto said that Mr Bush was pleased with the progress made on Saturday and appreciated "the bilateral effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy".
Limitation of gold parachutes
The President of the Banking Committee of Senator Christopher Dodd, a negotiator in charge, said that the legislators agreed on the responsibility of the financial programme, the protection of contributors against losses, the agreement of defaults, the implementation of the time-frame plan.
The new Act also provides for the limitation of gold parachutes for the directors of the participating companies and establishes a committee that will ensure the supervision of the fund.
The latter should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard on the issue and made significant progress towards an agreement that will work and be effective for the market and for all Americans," Paulson said.
The plan also provides assistance for real estate owners who have problems paying.
The government should negotiate new responsibilities in the case of mortgages that it will purchase, while reducing the monthly earnings of debtors and allowing the latter to keep their homes.
Marek: A psychological aid
According to the economist head of Patria Finance David Marek, the proposed plan is a good idea, but its achievement will be very difficult.
"This is due to the fact that we are unaware of the mechanism and the price of the purchase of assets to problems.
This will be crucial to close the gap between the financial sector and the government," says Marek, this week, to the iHNed.cz server.
Whether the plan will be adopted now, or at the beginning of next week, it is not, according to Marek, so important.
"It is much more important that the congressmen agree, as soon as this week, that they support this plan and that they will devote it as soon as possible.
This psychological significance of the agreement, providing for the adoption of the plan, matters most at this time," Marek stressed.
A fight to the extreme: MP3 players against the mobiles.
We will advise you how to choose
While virtually all mobiles know how to read MP3 files, no MP3 reader knows how to call.
It seems clear from this that it is better to buy only one phone.
It does not prevent sufficient reasons for seeking an independent reader.
The choice depends entirely on the manner of use and the requirements of the future owner.
It would be absurd to buy for the house a cheap high-end gramophone to put on Maxim Turbulenc's new album.
On the one hand, such music products do not come out on vinyl disc, and, from a quality point of view, there is no objective reason for this to happen.
Now, if there's in your layers of vinyl disks, with rock, jazz or blue art, you're at least probably dreaming of such a gramphone.
The same is true of music during movements, i.e. of compressed music, to say it in a simplified way - of music in MP3.
There are also categories based on price and quality.
For one, it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns for a reader, just as a Pink Floyd fan would have trouble supporting listeners bought for twenty crowns on the market.
These are two extremes, between which there is enough space for everyone.
The choice is wide.
The life of the batteries is also decisive
Some high-range music readers are capable of much more than just reading music, but this is, of course, unknown functions of most mobiles.
No current device is as universal as the phone.
In addition to the first functions, telephone calls and text messages, it is able to read music and movies, record the latter, it has a photo of variable quality and can, for example, even serve as a navigational tool.
And if you take the smartphones and the communicators into account, you'll have a small computer in your pocket.
Since no fridge knows how to grill meat and no television will take photographs, we are practically watching a miracle.
However, the universal character of the furniture is not without inconvenience.
The more the number of functions you use is large, the more the interval between two recharges will be reduced.
And reading music is one of the most important energy goinfres.
It is rare for the mobiles that are able to read from music for ten to twelve hours, in most cases this figure is significantly lower.
In this respect, the music players (especially the most rudimentary) are much more powerful.
In the case of good market furniture, tell them that they will only play music for a few hours.
If, in addition, you get to call in time, look for, to be out, a second recharge for work - this is even valid for the most expensive devices.
There will be no problem for MP3 readers, who are capable, following a rechargeable, continuous operation of at least 9 hours, including the least efficient.
Another problem arises when recording music in the cell.
Unfortunately, a limited part of the devices has a universal USB connector, so much so that not all can be directly connected to the computer without a special software.
Of course, you can record music directly on the memory card, but few card readers can take without reduction, given the small sizes of memory cards used in mobile phones.
With regard to readers, you do not need any software except iPod.
Just fill in, through the USB connector, the music device from the computer.
Most mobiles and readers will themselves create a media library classified by the name of the interpreter, the title of the album, the style, or then by the user's judgment.
Some devices only display an index with a tree structure, in the way Windows Explorer, others are capable of both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, intelligent phones with operating system).
The readers are easier to manipulate, the mobiles have more know-how
In choosing a specific device, you are especially interested in the life of the battery, the memory capacity, the quality and type of sound output and, of course, the ease of control.
If music is for you, essentially, a background noise and if in the day you're going to listen to it for a limited time, for example by taking the tram, it's enough for you to have any mobile reading the MP3.
Almost all mobile phones are capable of doing so today.
You are not even obliged to pay too much attention to the music formats that the mobile or the reader is able to read.
All come to read the MP3 and the great majority of the music that will reach you will have just that format.
It is part of the most widespread formats and apart from it, the vast majority of devices also come to read WMA format music.
The AAC (format used by Apple firm and its iPods), as regards it, is less common.
High-range mobiles also allow for, for example, the purchase of online music.
Just visit the operator's website (or other supplier's) from the mobile phone and buy the song or album in question.
This service to him alone should be a convincing reason to provide a musical mobile.
The offer of operators is unfortunately miserable and, in most cases, is limited to fast-track radio tubes.
The prices are no longer the lowest.
However, it is generally considered that this way of buying music (either via GSM, the Internet, or the wireless Internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people always wear their furniture on themselves.
Every time you want to listen to something, you only have to get the mobile out of your pocket, while you forgot your MP3 player at home.
Now, it's also important if you always have listeners or a handfree with connection.
If that's not the case, you can use the built-in spells, which have practically all the mobiles, but a minimum of MP3 readers.
For many, the main advantage of musical furniture is their price.
The least expensive is normally less than three thousand.
For a price of three-four thousand crowns, you can have a walkman already very suitable.
But, in most cases, you will be limited by the absence of exit for ordinary listeners.
The price of the best phones and the best outfits, also provided by an entry for ordinary listeners, does not exceed 15 thousand.
On the other hand, readers have the advantage of having an easy command.
Indeed, anyone who manages to command the most rudimentary readers - who do not necessarily correspond to the least expensive ones (see our choice).
A minimum of functions; and the similarity of the order with that of a cassette post, commonly used in the past, or of a gramophone, is evident.
There is no risk of collision in the form of a random-connected mobile Internet, followed by a huge data transmission bill.
Which device to use
Even the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. the Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for interchangeable memory cards (type M2, microSD, and so on).
Even taking into account the additional purchase of such a card, you will not exceed two thousand crowns.
But be careful.
Basic models only support cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB.
Only the most expensive go out even with 8 GB memory cards.
If you already have a mobile and you still want to buy a good MP3 player, take a Cowon, a Creative, a Sony, a Samsung, an Emgeton, or an iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB), you must not spend more than 1 100 crowns.
If you are part of the most demanding audiences, choose specialized walkman mobiles (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices are equipped with independent control keys for MP3, and this is how the command's tool approaches the one of an independent MP3 player.
Sony Ericsson, whose mobiles in the walkman series have the same user menu as MP3 players sold separately, is the one that has gone the farest in this area.
The same service, in the same price category, but with a memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and a life span of the battery (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours) is provided by an MP3 player produced by one of the above mentioned brands.
A first virtual operator will win the Czech Republic this year itself.
Maybe
The mobile market in Chechnya is relatively advanced, our operators offering virtually the same services as their partners in Western Europe.
Despite this, we still lack something - a virtual operator, which would force the classic operators to lower prices.
He may not be missing for a long time.
We have already mentioned on Mobil.cz the fact that Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe.
The CTU (the Czech Telecommunications Office), which reported that the price of a SMS was higher in us than in the rest of the Union, has also confirmed it.
As a result, following the European Commission's last steps in the regulation of roaming charges, a paradoxical situation may arise - the SMS sent from abroad will be for some customers of Czech mobile operators less expensive than in the country.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic remain so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is a lack of competition that would really want to get into the fight.
This may seem paradoxical, since we still have three mobile networks and a penetration that is well over 100 per cent.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this regard, Pavel Dvořák, the President of the Czech Telecommunications Office Board (CTU), who said several times that there was no room for another operator in the Czech Republic, complained to the operators.
It is probably true that a classic operator with his own network has apparently no more chance (at present he would find only difficult frequencies).
But there is still a possibility - a virtual operator.
It is precisely the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market that has led to a significant decrease in prices, to which the traditional operators also had to respond.
However, even before the entry of trouble parties such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile on the market, voices similar to those heard today at home were being heard in Britain.
However, it appeared that there was room for such operators and that they could have real success.
We are not obliged to go too far to find examples.
In February we informed you of the launch of the virtual Mobilking operator in Poland.
In just six months, this operator has managed to win over 100 thousand customers and become the fifth operator of the country.
Let us add that behind the Mobilking, there is the Penta financial group, which has among other things the U:fon in Czech Republic.
The advantage of virtual operators is the possibility of focusing on a much more concrete target group.
For their operation to be effective, they really need much less customers than a classic operator.
They are, in fact, exempt from the costs of construction, operation and entry of the mobile, relatively high network.
Thus, in the world, virtual operators profile as low-cost operators - they offer cheap calls and SMS, which is often counterbalanced by a limited service offer.
For example, Tesco Mobile offers, in Great Britain, at least two times less expensive SMS than its competitors.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, missing on an unusual target group can also be a good time for advertising.
Indeed, this operator specifically targets men.
"The real men choose Mobilking - an operator they like and they can trust," said David Seibert, the CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, exploiting this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say, if such a concept would be possible to walk with us too.
Miroslav Čepýk, Vodafone's spokesperson, in doubt: "The Czech market is relatively small for a segmentary approach, on which most virtual operators are based.
As much as it is relatively saturated from the point of view of the offer of services."
In Chechnya, no chance, the mobile operators say
However, it seems almost certain that if there is a virtual operator in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
"We are discussing the expansion of this project successfully, but negotiations in Chechnya are not very provocative.
The launch of Mobilking will take place in other countries in our area," says Jana Studnikkova, spokesperson for the Penta financial group.
It thus indirectly confirmed that the operators in the Czech Republic were, in any case, not in favour of this idea.
On the contrary, they try to do their best to make a potential competitor appear.
The GTS Novera Group, which would like to take a new step in order to become a real competitor of Teleika in the area of business customers, does not hide, for quite a long time, its intention to launch a virtual mobile operator.
"We have a lot to be able to offer our customers not only fixed telecommunications services, but also mobile.
And the sooner it'll be the better.
We have already conducted negotiations on this possibility on several occasions with all the Czech mobile operators.
With some, we have succeeded in moving forward in the negotiations," said the spokesperson of the Pavel Kaidl group.
So the future may be promising.
According to non-official information, it seems that we might be able to welcome the first virtual operator by the end of the year.
But for the moment, his creation is accompanied by total silence.
"At this point, we do not believe that there is a place on the Czech market for a virtual operator as such.
The Czech market is compared to other very specific ones.
For the time being, no matter provided with a complex and serious project in this area has contacted us," Vlastimil Sršený of the Press Department of Phoneika O2, mentioned in his statement for Mobil.cz.
Other operators also refer to the specificity of the Czech market.
T-Mobile spokesperson Martina Kemrová says in a rare agreement with the O2: "We have not recorded for the moment a viable and bilaterally beneficial project, which could serve as a basis."
And she adds: "It is practically excluded that a virtual operator appears in the T-Mobile network by the end of the year.
To operate in such a limited time frame, we should now have a concrete agreement."
Vodafone, on the other hand, directs its attention to the compliance of requests to obtain its own 3G licence.
Miroslav Čepiký said in this regard: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, and especially in the area of shared costs and infrastructure.
This is what we believe to be the most important contribution from the point of view of customers.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is the discovery of a partner to establish a common network for a fast mobile Internet."
Responsible authorities: in phase with operators
The approach of mobile operators is easy to understand, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would have led to a lower price and thus a lower profit.
So what's good about making it easier for such a competitor?
As far as their interests are concerned, operators know how to understand themselves as they do. The chicane accompanying the creation of the U.S. background also testifies to this.
The biggest apparent pressure on CTU, during the creation of the U-Fon, was the one exercised by the T-Mobile company.
They testify to the information available to the public from the CTU website.
Now, today, the U:Fon is ready to use as an argument not to accept a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová noted in this regard: "The competition on the mobile market has also been recently amplified by the entry into the market of a fourth mobile operator.
In view of the nature of the mobile market in RT, it is clear that the entry of an additional player will submit it, and especially its services, to high requirements."
However, given the attitude of the mobile operators here, the indifference of the Czech regulatory bodies appears to be disappointing.
However, this is not only the attitude of the CTU, which, contrary to Britain and other developed countries, unfortunately does not have the power to intervene in economic competition in the Czech Republic.
It belongs exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (UOHS).
However, the latter adopted, in the face of this problem, its typical position.
"The entry of a virtual operator on the mobile market would be possible following the conclusion of an agreement between a mobile operator and the virtual operator in question regarding the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
No such agreement has been reached for the time being, because the offer of potential stakeholders did not give sufficient priority to classical operators," Kristián Chalupa of the Department of External Relations of the ÚOHS said in response to our question.
A statement thus made would not surprise the representatives of the operators.
However, on the part of an office, which must represent the interests of consumers and, among other things, also take care that no one benefits from its position on the market, such a statement is more than a waste.
The more Kristian Chalupa adds: "In foreign countries, where virtual operators are normally present, it can be seen that their market entry has contributed to a decline in mobile phone service prices."
However, pressure in the sense of an honest functioning of the market and a price reduction is apparently not part of the interests of the ÚOHS.
What is really shocking is the almost touching agreement of the three mobile operators, resulting from their reactions.
The question, if this is really a coincidence, is of course a matter.
Similarly, a price of strictly identical essence to all service stations is probably due to the accident and hard fighting of competition.
"The office has not, in this regard, recorded signs of anti-competitive behaviour, so it has no reason to intervene in one way or another.
None of the operators have a dominant position, none of them therefore have an increased corresponding responsibility for their behaviour on the market.
The tools needed to open the mobile market to virtual operators are probably even lacking to the telecommunication regulator," said Chaloupa in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of the many points of disagreement.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets developed by CTU, according to which telecommunications is, from the point of view of economic competition, a single market.
None of the Czech operators have a dominant position on such a market.
However, some law experts suggest a different view of things: in order for a virtual operator to be able, it is necessary to obtain, at each time, the consent of the network operator.
And the mobile operator has quite logically the monopoly on its network.
This is how he necessarily plays a dominant role in a certain segment of his activity.
However, even without admitting this argument, it should be at least worrying for the ÚOHS that three mobile operators are manifestly performing in a similar manner.
However, the complaints of many interested parties (including the company GTS Novera, already mentioned) show that they face similar constraints in the negotiations with all operators.
Reducing responsibility for CTU is a fairly common turn in communications, whereby the CTU washes the hands of the case.
We have already met this kind of attitude in several similar cases.
Unfortunately, there has been no success in the modernization of the telecommunications Act, which has recently been adopted, an extension of CTU's powers in the field of economic competition in telecommunications, although many specialists promised an improvement in the situation.
This is something that the representatives of ÚOHS need to know very well, but their interests are apparently elsewhere.
When no one looks, it can go
That says, the operation of a kind of virtual pseudo operators, several in the Czech mobile networks, remains undetected.
These are companies publishing their own price list of mobile telephone services, but the latter are only partially public.
In most cases, it is a matter of firm dealing with multi-level marketing.
This is how specific mobile phone services are offered by Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others.
The price lists of these companies are generally only available to the electorate.
The magic tour consists of the fact that the company is performing before the operator is a classic company client, which controls a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important customer, it receives special price (and other) offers.
The problem is that the commercial conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit such a return.
"If what you say was happening, it could be a violation of the contractual conditions that we would consider and that could result in a ceasefire with the company in question," answered our question about this problem, Martina Kemrová.
However, it is unlikely that an echo of such an activity has not been reached to the managers of the mobile operators.
In particular, in the case of the three companies mentioned, thousands of customers may be involved.
However, no operator shall object to such a procedure.
Indeed, the activities of these firms bring them unresolved benefits, and, at the same time, in opposition to true virtual operators, they do not threaten them at all with their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepýk indicates the possible problems: "The law allows such speculations, however, the services of these companies are used only by a percentage of negligible customers.
In addition, they are obliged to admit that the SIM card in their phone is not registered on their behalf, so they cannot have it fully available as regular customers of mobile operators."
However, this is precisely what should be strange in the CTU.
In addition, there is another question in the ÚOHS.
If mobile operators close their eyes on such a procedure, why do they block the creation of a virtual operator?
It should be added that ÚOHS has relatively wide powers to open up such an activity, and if it does not wish to be content with the operator's explanations, which claims to have no idea what would happen, their contractual conditions prohibit it.
When we're no longer the most expensive country
As we have mentioned several times, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market has led to a significant decline in the price of services.
In almost all countries where virtual operators appeared, however, classical operators were increasingly, less and less, trying to prevent their creation.
The arguments used by the latter were practically the same - a market too small, or too saturated, problems with the quality of services, etc.
However, it is precisely at this level that in developed countries, regulatory agencies, which did not defend the interests of mobile operators, but those of their clients, have intervened.
Both through formal measures and through informal pressure, they ended up getting the creation of a first virtual operator, followed by others.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulators are dealing with this issue in the way of a hot potato that is depleted by passing it to a close target.
As a result of the experiences we have, we cannot get rid of the impression that confusion in their skills is more than beneficial in these cases.
But don't throw the trigger after the cognition.
If the information is true and a virtual operator will soon appear at our home, the Czech mobile market may be moving back.
If one of the operators has accepted the creation of a virtual mobile operator, the ÚOHS can hardly remain impeccable in the face of the rejection (discrimination) of other stakeholders.
And maybe we will stop calling more expensive than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech Hymne has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four achievements of the new version of the Czech National Hymne.
On Sunday, on the day of the Czech Nationality, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek solemnly presented the new recordings of the National Hymne Where is my home? (Where is my home?).
Hymne was re-registered by the National Theatre Orchestra under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
We have four versions - with a male or female solo song, an interpretation with heart and an instrumental version.
The song is provided by Katerín Kniežinková et Adam Plachetka.
Otakar Jeremáš and Jaroslav Krček are the authors of the Hymne arrangements.
You can listen to the four new versions on the iHNed.cz server.
Bělohlávek considers the Czech national song to be one of the most beautiful hymns.
As he had previously entrusted to Český rzhlas (Czech public radio), he chose to interpret the solo versions of the singers with young and representative voices, which are marked and appreciated.
"From the beginning, I tried to make sure that both singers, as well as the heart, had a good sentence, so that we could understand the words, that they sing simultaneously," he said.
The Czech National Hymne will celebrate its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Kde mův můj můj held for the first time in 1834 on the boards of Stavovské divadlo (the State Theatre) in Fidlovča (Kermesse des saviers), the original Czech play by Josef Kajetán Til, accompanied by the music by František Škroup.
It has become popular and people have spontaneously adapted it.
After the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918, the first couple naturally became an integral part of the National Hymne.
It will remain one of the seven national symbols even after the establishment of the independent Czech Republic.
How the "new" sounds hymne
Common transport (MHD) Prague will introduce the pus in their ticket system on Wednesday
On Wednesday, October 1, 2008, it will be recorded in the history of Pražský Doprarní podnik (the Prague Transport Agency) as the date on which the first passengers will get into the subway, trams and buses, which, instead of having a paper ticket, will have an electronic coupon in their pocket.
At the moment, the latter is accessible to almost one hundred thousand people, owners of the Opencard puzzle card.
Passengers can buy a coupon for 30 days or 90 days (it will be valid from 1 January 2009) and both to record it on their card in the information points and offices of the Doprarnní podnik (the Transport Agency), located in the metro stations Muzeum, Můstek, Nadrazi Holeshovice, Andel, Rostyly, Letňany, Kobilisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
From yesterday, there is also the possibility to buy online coupons on the Doprahrní vodnik websites: www.dpp.cz.
Over four hundred people benefited from the service in the morning.
Those who will start using the online store can permanently forget the tickets in the metro stations, where they had to so far become impatient in long queues in order to obtain tickets in paper.
In fact, they will buy their coupon online and will be registered on their Opencard card in one of the thirteen Městská knikhna (municipal libraries).
"In these contact points, there is the availability of passengers with trained staff, which will help those interested in online purchases and will also record the coupon they bought on their card," said the spokesperson of the Martin Opatrny project.
In addition to libraries, it will also be possible to record electronic drops on the Opencard in automatic distributors installed in the vestibule of several metro stations.
What do these distributors look like?
They are red, recalling the machines to compose the tickets and passengers have perhaps already noticed them in the metro stations Roztyly, Budjejovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"Today, the city has five, but by the end of the year, there should be twenty-four," Opatrny added.
A machine will control the coupon instead of the driver
The machines that will work from tomorrow are easy to use.
Just enter the Opencard deck card and the coupon previously purchased will register itself on the map.
Electronic coupons are valid from tomorrow not only in the capital, but also in the vicinity of the city.
It is known in the periurban trains and bus lines 300 to 499, which mainly use the inhabitants of the municipalities of central Bohemia to access the capital.
"In the trains integrated in Pražská integrevaná dogrea (integrated transport of Prague), the controllers are equipped with card readers, with which they establish the temporary and zone validity of the coupons," explained Filip Drápal of Ropid, who designs the schedules for common transport in Prague.
Periurban buses are equipped with players of integrated cards in the driver's seat.
When boarding it is therefore necessary not only to show the deck card to the driver, but also to place the Opencard at the place indicated on the side of the box.
This is how the driver controls the validity of the recorded cuts.
"In case the passenger needs to verify the validity of the registered coupons, there is nothing simpler than asking the driver for this information," Drápal said.
Passengers who do not take the periurban buses and do not remember the date on which their coupon expires may re-enter the automatic distributors, initially used to record the coupons on the map.
This is where information on the validity of their document will be displayed on the screen of the device.
The Sutes were demanding a referendum in the United States
The Germans of the South asked in 1945 for Shumava to be integrated into the United States.
This comes from a letter deposited in the collections of the Jihočeská vedecká knikhna (The Scientific Library of the South Bohème).
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live at least under the US patronage.
In 1945, certain groups of Germans in the South addressed the President of the United States with such a wish.
This comes from, among other things, a letter preserved in a private archive, which is now deposited in the collections of the Jihočeská vedecká knikhna.
From the Germans of Český Krumlov in the letter, the US President does not allow "shuavská zupa" (a region of forests south of Bohème) - annexed by Hitler under the Munich Agreement - to be returned to Czechoslovakia.
"We have well understood the situation, and we want to be sure that the words proclaiming that American troops come into the German territory not in oppressors and enemies, but in liberators," is written in the letter "People to whom the fate of the Shumava is at heart."
Given that the relationship with Czechoslovakia is not allegedly promising - knowing the Czech national character - that of brutality, indifference, misunderstanding, oppression and bondage, the authors of the letter ask the American President to take in his hands the protection of the Shumava for now and forever.
"We cannot believe that you would give this territory to a foreign state, which oppresses and destroys minorities and which has not contributed to the victory of the Allies without taking into account the opinion of the four million inhabitants," the letter says.
The alleged reason why the authors cannot sign the letter is the fear of the desire to avenge the "Czech oppressors".
If the President of the United States doubted the opinion of the Germans in Shumava, he would only have to organize a referendum in the region, according to the authors, to establish whether his people wanted to be part of the United States, or to live under the United States patronage.
Although the text contained in the letter may, given the current knowledge of the history of post-war, appear to be somewhat naive, according to some survivors, it well illustrates the expectations of the Germans of the Southers of the time.
While the Czech Germans had to at least consider that the issue of their expulsion from the republic was going to take place, very few of them had had such an opportunity.
Some expected that the United States and Britain would obtain a certain type of autonomy for the South.
Others believed that they would simply remain in Czechoslovakia.
The famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice, confirmed it.
During the war, he was, as a German of České Budějovice, engaged in the navy in the Baltic countries.
When he was captured by the English at the end of the war and placed in the capture camp in the Holstein region, dozens of Czech Germans came to see him to teach them the Czech language.
"They believed that once they returned home, the Czech would benefit them," said Chalupa.
None of the Germans who lived in Czechoslovakia before the war loved it, according to him, that, following the Beneš Decrees, he would be expelled from the Republic.
You don't think about it. You pay!
An Emotional Campaign Attacks Drivers
The most expensive road safety action in Czech history.
One way to characterize the emotional media campaign is to launch the Ministry of Transport on Wednesday.
Minister Aleš Rébíček's office believes that she will discourage drivers of dangerous flying behaviour.
This campaign of 150 million will appear on television, radio, cinema, on the Internet, but also on tracts.
It should discourage the drivers of fast driving and alcohol on the wheel.
But also remind them to take the belt before it starts.
In particular, she wants to touch the conscience of young drivers, motorists, pedestrians, without forgetting professional drivers.
What's going to happen in the spots?
Especially personal stories that will attack emotions.
It also bears witness to the slogan "sangling" throughout the campaign:
You don't think about it. You pay!
The phrase "Don't Think" is written in capitals on the registration plate.
Then, in a blood bottle, there's the phrase "You'll die."
Which must symbolize that one can pay for life a moment of attention.
Spots are going to "hold" the spectators until 2010.
The Department was inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where images can be seen commonly with dramatic images of the victims of accidents.
He believes that this will lead to a decrease in the rate of accidents and the number of deaths on the Czech roads.
Spots were prepared by Euro RSCG.
The Strategy for Sugar and Fouding Against Drivers
"What goes with drivers is the system of sugar and fuuette.
For them, sugar is represented, for example, by earning time when they spark a red fire.
The fool, it's the threat of a fine or an accident.
The risks must be recalled to the drivers," says Martin Kořán, the transport psychologist at the Na Homolce Hospital.
That is how we need information campaigns in the press, and especially negative advertising, the psychologist considers.
Panels reporting the danger to drivers are already less effective, according to him.
"When a static panel that warns against a danger is installed, it will probably soon merge with the environment and the drivers will no longer notice it," Kořán said.
Olmert would exchange peace almost all occupied territories
Ehud Olmert, the president of the Israeli interim government, spoke for the return of virtually all the occupied territories in 1967, including the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan, in exchange for peace with Palestine and Syria.
He made this statement in an interview published on Monday by Yedioth Ahronoth.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to make almost all territories (occupied) or all," Olmert said on a daily basis.
"We will keep a certain percentage of the territory, but we will have to give the Palestinians a similar percentage (of the Israeli territory), because without that, peace will not be achieved," he added.
He admitted that the possible return would include East Jerusalem.
"He who wishes for security in Jerusalem, and especially does not wish for any tractors and bulldozers to break his feet, as this has happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up to parts of Jerusalem," Olmert remarked, referring to the two attacks in the city, in July, when several people were killed and dozens of injured.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Mount of Temple, the sacred and historic places" within the Old City.
"He who wants to maintain Israel's sovereignty throughout the city will be forced to integrate 270 000 Arabs.
That won't work," he said.
Retirement of Golan's heights
Olmert also advocates the withdrawal of Israel from the Golan, which he considers to be an indispensable condition for the conclusion of a peace agreement with Syria.
However, this would also require some efforts on the part of Damascus.
"I do not propose to conclude peace with Syria only on the basis of a retreat from the Golan," he said.
"The Syrians know very well what they're going to have to give up to get the Golan.
They will have to renounce their current relations with Iran; they will have to renounce their relationship with Hezbollah (the Cheetah movement); they will have to give up their constant support to Hamas (the Cheetah movement), Al-Qaida (the terrorist network), as well as that of the jihad (the Holy War) in Iraq," said the Prime Minister.
Questions that arise after the accident: Are the Stewards in the car illegal?
The law ignores them; walking in a long distance is prohibited
In the context of the tragic car accident of the Student Agency near Padoue, Italy, the question arises whether the drivers and passengers can move within the car during the journey.
"If the law was to be strictly and formally respected, the activity of a Steward is contrary to the Road Traffic Act," says the spokesperson of the Transport Department Karel Hanzelka.
The accident in question, during which a 22-year-old guest died, was apparently caused by the driver of a truck that crossed the highway.
The young girl was currently unfortunately sitting next to the driver, on the most dangerous seat of the vehicle, although she had two other seats at her disposal.
However, the car may have an accident, or even a sudden stop, even when the driver serves the coffee or distributes the newspapers.
What matters is whether the car is based on its technical sheet equipped with standing or not seats.
If the standing equipment is not approved, passengers must remain seated.
The long-distance bus drivers Student Agency do not have standing places; what was confirmed in Aktualně.cz by the company director Radim Janchura.
"It is a matter that we have dealt with with the ministry and, at the beginning, it prohibits any movement of passengers.
Then they canceled it and we found that passengers can go to the toilets during the journey, provided they have their own seat," he revealed his position.
The law ignores the Stewards
"There is no single legal interpretation of the Steward role - no legal requirement deals with this role.
On the other hand, no legal requirement no longer prohibits the carrier from offering services.
The Road Transport Act only knows the terms of the vehicle receiver; it does not define its rights and duties," adds Hanzelka spokesperson more ambiguity.
Josef Pokorny, director of the Road Traffic Department, believes, on the contrary, that the law deals sufficiently with the problem.
"All depends on whether the autocar has in its approval the permission to offer standing places.
Everyone lives there," he said.
Car cars are divided into urban areas, where there are standing places and a limited maximum speed, interurban with standing places and a higher permitted speed and long-distance parking spaces with the highest permitted maximum speed and seats equipped with safety belts.
As in the plane, an expert says
Jaroslav Horín, an expert in BESIP (safety of road traffic) in transport, does not see the movement of the Stewards on board as a major problem.
"In regular traffic, there is no danger. The situation can be compared to that of the service in the aircraft.
No more, it's not sure when there's a turbulence and the hostess of the air can pick up your head."
"Or, if the autocar had been abruptly suspended, the laws of physics would obviously be valid.
Just like a bus or a tram.
The carrier must manage the safety of the Stewards by internal requirements," he said, and also believes that from the point of view of the law, the problem is not solved.
Janchura is ready to delete these services
Student Agency is the only bus carrier to offer Stewards services.
He hires two hundred.
Even after this accident, the Director does not consider their business to be a risky business.
"However, as soon as I have the impression that this is a risky business, I will delete it.
Passengers can receive their coffee and their newspaper on board.
This would also reduce costs," he said.
The security concern is the reason for the absence of Stewards in its vehicles by the director of Asiana Alexei Litwine, who ensures, in comparison with SA, a very small number of lines.
"We don't have any guests, we've been opposed to them since the beginning.
Sooner or later this will end by a fatal accident," he said, a year ago, at Týden.cz.
A Great Tragedy Has Come
A young host of the Plzeň region, who has been working for society for two years, died during the accident on the Naples line.
A Slovenian truck probably left the emergency stop band without using a clignant and he blocked the road to the car.
The driver of the driver tried to avoid it by means of a sharp handle, but he broke it on his right side.
Janchura refuses that the two seats reserved for the rest of the Stewards have been sold.
"In the case of long distance lines, it is not possible to book these places, they are blocked."
The company has a complaint against the truck driver.
For the benefit of the young girl's family, the agency will not wait for the court's judgment, but with regard to financial compensation, it also counts on the defendant.
An amendment to the law?
No view
An amendment to the Act, which has been being developed for more than a year by a group of thirty experts from the Ministry of Transport, could provide details on the movement of the driver on the bus.
"Or, it did not lead to any conclusion on this point.
In fact, it is not too interested in the bus, but rather in the point system, at the maximum speed on the highway and the use of the portable to the wheel," says expert Horín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activities of the Stewards to be a fundamental threat to passenger safety," concludes spokesperson Hanzelka, stating that the control of passenger safety is under the authority of the police and the office for safety at work.
The hopes of the Düsseldorfois are based on Frankfurt.
The main words were not lacking in the letter addressed by the WestLB Steering Committee to the household employees.
By means of a union of the financial institution of Düsseldorf with the Deka-Bank of Frankfurt, "the central institution of the financial markets of the financial group of the Sparkasse" could constitute, according to the mail made public on Monday.
WestLB would provide a double "competence block" of sustainable productivity in such a case.
In total, such a relationship could be the decisive point of sending to other concentrations in the banking sector of the Netherlands.
This is what it looks like when a steering committee wants to demonstrate its ability to act in difficult times.
Because the WestLB, injured, is always under strong pressure.
It is not only the European Commission, but also the Federal Financial Services Supervisory Authority, which has only recently made it clear to the Government of the North Rhine-Westphalia that the time was spent looking for a future solution.
However, it has been a matter of some time already - also on the side of Frankfurt - of a relationship of any form between the Deka bank, who knew the customers of the Sparkasse from their investment funds, and the WestLB.
The head of the Deta-Bank Franz Waas reported in the presentation of the figures in the late August semester that he saw no sense in the merger of the Mainzer Landstrasse's house with a land bank, either Helaba or WestLB.
However, the Board of Directors of the Deka, each half of which is supported by the banks of the Land and savings fund groups, has commissioned the Steering Committee to conduct talks with WestLB for joint commercial activities.
It could then be the flow of the financial market, or parts of it.
However, the talks only begin, it is said in the financial position.
This is not the first time that Deta-Bank, who, with its 3000 employees, has one of the most important employers in the financial area of Frankfurt, is involved in the issue of strengthening the savings sector.
In 2003, it was believed that Deta-Bank could merge with the Bank of the Land of Palestine and Halbab.
However, nothing has emerged from this outer mouth.
The plans had hardly been made public that the Hesse Government had voted against any participation of Hellaba in them.
Next, the other two houses were no longer joining together.
The Bank of the Land of Rhenia Palatinate was linked to the Bank of the Land of Bade-Wuttenberg in Stuttgart.
But there have always been new discussions on the grouping of the Deka-Bank with Länder banks.
Last but not least, Günther Merl, Chairman of the Hellaba Steering Committee, had voted against any commercial merger strategy with his bank.
Regardless of this, the feeling seems to be spreading that the grouping of the various public sector institutions is particularly urgent.
Now that the election in the Parliament of the Bavarian Land has passed, a union of the BayernLB with the Bank of the Land of Bade-Wuttenberg could come first.
For Helaba, this is not particularly good news.
If the pressure imposed on new mergers should increase, the potential partners will gradually escape it.
In the South, she would now be a junior partner, although she has so far been more resistant to the crisis than the Munich and Stuttgart banks.
The Hesse-Thuringe savings and rotations group, which owns 85 percent of Helaba's capital, in contrast, drew a lock at the beginning of the year on any union with WestLB.
It would be hard for the NordLB.
However, such geo-strategic reflections reflect only one facet.
Another facet raises the question of how the different business models of each of these banks can take place.
In June, Merl stated that the decisive issue, namely, which commercial model would ensure the future capacity of banks in the Netherlands, had not so far been resolved by the German group of savings and changes.
Finally, a WestLb decommissioning could take place, decommissioning which is obviously not desired here.
This is also the case in the letter from the Steering Committee in place: in any case, a 'global solution' for the institution would be addressed.
How will all of this be put in the same basket with the union of certain entities with Deta-Bank still to be seen.
The second weekend of the beer festival is also known as the Italian weekend.
For Elena, it's the first time, for Luca already the third or fourth time.
But this time, Elena accompanied him as a little friend, so nothing is the same, he said.
Behind them, about a ton of five litres of beer from the Kaiser brand, is a well-built barbu that shows about 200 visitors to the beer festival which sounds deep in its delight.
Elena taps Luca first, then kisses him.
From Bologna, they came to Vérone.
From there, from the train station near Puorta nova, four buses take off this evening at 2345, `destinazione Monaco, party della brewa', arrived scheduled at 630.
Three buses are reserved first and foremost for Italians, in one of the buses traveling exclusively from Brazil.
In one corner of the parking lot, the South Americans sang gold and already beside their flag, they already celebrated last night.
And also loudspeakers, explains Marco Guarda, it's not for Italians.
The buses belong to Marco, which has a long double coat of fake fur and glasses with large silver mountings.
For five years, they've been going to the beer party, already three times nothing this year.
They go there at night, stay the day at the party, and return at 10:30 p.m.
And spending the night would involve unnecessary expenses, explains Marco.
The trip costs EUR 75, including the welcome pot with a Kaiser beer, wrapped in accordance with the Bavarian purity law, sickness insurance and a German-speaking group manager - Marco made a language course in Frankfurt.
And the buses are already rolling in the night on the Autostrada direction `Brennero'.
There's no beer, not yet.
Quickly, everything gets calm in the bus, the passengers sleep.
That's better, they'll still need their strength.
Breaks will be made in Bressanone, and in Holzkirchen, while a large number of other buses with Italian registration plates are once again taking a break before Munich, on highway 8.
When in the early morning, the Marco group finally arrives at six thirty hours as planned on the parking near Thérèse, almost 50 other buses across Europe are already there.
Elena, Luca and the others gather together, Marco has a last speech, explains the attack plan.
First of all, it's made of the little yellow casket.
Above is written on the left "Bier Party", in Gothic, and next to the internet address of the travel agency of Marco `konscersiviaggido.it".
Second: "When the doors of the beer chapter open, we're short," Marco cries in the morning.
Run!' Run and book places at the bottom of the tent.
"Don't go ahead, or we're stuck, and not all the yellow helmets on the same benches, you have to split them into the room!"
The cup, called Marco, costs 8.25 euros.
And don't forget the sign!
'Show the security agents that we behave well!
As soon as you leave your seats, they're gone!'
Third: `This night, to come here is ten hours and a half!' You understand?
And that's it, it's gone to the beer party.
On the road, someone nine of the yellow caskets to the trees to find the way, the panels and even an electoral display of a large popular Bavarian party.
We have to be ready for the return.
This is the second weekend of the beer festival, known as the “weekend of Italians”.
There are no specific figures; 50 000 are spoken of going through the Alps and falling into the beer kiosk, 10 percent of the visitors would come out of Italy this weekend.
The municipal police are strengthened by seven South Tyrol policemen, by Italian volunteers who support the Bavarian red cross, which produces statistics on the countries where the Italians occupy the first place in the British (60 interventions) and Austrians (approximately 80) with nearly 200 medical interventions.
The one that is particularly appreciated by the Italians is the tent of the Hofbräu brewery.
Insomnia nights for the shareholders of Hypo Real Estate
The German banking system was relatively stable, and the Federal Minister of Finance insisted only a few weeks ago.
What a chance the politician used the word "relatively" and that he pretended that the German banking sector would not be spared by the crisis movements.
This one actually happened this weekend.
The finance of the Bavarian real estateer Hypo Real Estate (HRE), next to DAX, receives a billion-dollar loan from a German bank consortium to protect itself from market turbulence.
One person in the confidence of the situation told Reuters Monday that the aid appropriations were issued up to EUR 35 billion.
Hipo Real Estate should now pay interest on the fraction to which it would be entitled.
Money comes from both private banks and public law banks.
In the background, it's Depfa's subsidiary that supports the losses.
The state finance was, according to a newspaper article, refinancing very short-term for long-term projects for which it had borrowed money - which is no longer possible since the lack of confidence in markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's liquidity reserve had been reduced from 95 per cent to 2.37 million euros, and the equity rate also slightly decreased from 1.6 to 1.45 per cent.
Current and net profits from financial transactions were, in comparison with the same period, zero-point gains from the allocation of fixed assets and securities, as well as the recovery of provisions in credit operations had fallen by more than 70 per cent to 5 million euros.
And it is only because of the significant profits from the reimbursement of off-balance sheet costs resulting from the restructuring of the former Depfa group, as well as from the reimbursement of interest according to the book of tax procedures and commercial purchases for companies in Konzern that the deficit of profits of about 16 per cent has been moderated.
After privatization in 1990, the former state financial had first mis-species on real estate industrial loans, which had then been affiliated to the Aareal bank.
Because classical state funding was not profitable enough, Depfa was then more intensively engaged in infrastructure projects and in financing joint projects between private and state investors (Private-Public-Partnership, PPP) and diversified internationally.
On the value of the subsidiary, the Real Estate Hypo has to do with amortizations that should have an essential material effect on the calculation of the profit and loss of the group, which still remains rather vague.
The fact is that the dividends have been amputated.
By 2007, they had been crushed to two thirds.
Hypo Real Estate has been a highly important investor since Depfa's purchase.
It is stronger than other institutions dependent on refinancing on the interbank market since it does not have any customer deposits.
With the failure of the Lehman Brothers investment bank two weeks ago, the allocation of credit between banks was again considerably low, the banks had accumulated their liquidity.
The Real Estate Hypo needs an annual share - about 50 billion euros - of all the Depfa's loans of a short-term refinancing method.
According to a communication from Hypo Real Estate, the group's funding needs are covered by medium-term credit and the company protected from the influence of international financial markets far beyond the state of the move.
Other sources say that refinancing would be provided through funds until the end of 2009.
On the other hand, HRE Director Georg Funke explained that the Hypo Real Estate group should no longer use the medium-term financial markets.
The Federal Bank and the Federal Establishment for the Monitoring of Financial Services (Bafin) are based on the principle that the capacity of the Hypo Real group on the market is now guaranteed.
The bank's shareholders and creditors are only waiting for it.
However, given the dynamics and the impossibility of the crisis, there is no certainty.
It is not inevitable, however, that it will not fail to use funding throughout its scope.
But the opposite can no longer be removed.
After the bank is, according to the latest communications, still at the doors of insolvency Sunday at the end of the night, this rescue for the least temporary will not be able to secure the spirits no longer.
The rate of action was 75 per cent to 3.30 euros.
On the other hand, the rates of obligations are particularly good.
While the debt to the first boss has barely moved, the second-level loan rates are flashing.
The most affected are the investment funds of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo and those with a life span beyond 2009.
The obligations of the Bank Hypo Real Estate seemed to be an alternative speculative position, and their value should now be considered to be dependent on the stability of the international banking system after the net hardening of the banking crisis and the crisis of the institution itself which led to the crisis in the establishment by the Depfa bank's purchase.
As long as the less affected emission institutes, governments and commercial banks are still ready to support the system, it is possible to assume that there is a time-consuming response.
Or what is not likely to happen at the moment - that the financial crisis can be overcome in the next 15 months.
But in the face of the renewed noises of partial nationalization, the probability of approaching suerity today has become a simple foundationed hope.
This should reserve insomnia nights for all long-term creditors to decide whether to separate from their commitments.
Short-term investors can always use this on what they have drawn a deal to make a return on losses for the next few years on the income tax of the capital of automatically taken stock gains.
Sylvana and the secrets of the box in Bento
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16 years old, is due to be present for the first day at the Tachibana High School, the girls begin to laugh: Germany is so "kawaii" !
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knew this word thanks to the Mangas - in her new trade log, she speaks of Japan.
"The first day of the course in Japan.
What I was excited about.
I was afraid of going to school already.
I live in Tokyo in the direction of Kawasaki and take the train 40 minutes to the Tachibana High School.
I have to find the way alone, I'm glad I didn't lose.
The beginning of courses does not seem to be fixed as strictly as we do in Basse-Saxe.
The students show up after each other from eight hours, until nine hours less than twenty, a table tour begins with the teacher, the "home room".
But before the course started, it was for me to introduce myself.
I'm not exactly like to talk to people, especially a class of 40 students.
As I have not yet had the uniform of the school, I put on an old jacket from my mother, as well as a shirt, blue shoes and black leather shoes.
So in this shop, I was introduced to the paper, and I tried to pronounce everything correctly: 'Sayonara Wo She Sylvana...' - I'm Sylvana, I come from Germany and my birthday is in a week.
At that time, I was very happy to have started to learn the language two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class all made the lowest, could laugh and make signs, and I constantly heard the word "Kawaii".
I already knew him through my sleeves.
It belongs to the essential vocabulary of the survival of Japanese ado and it means "mignon, chou".
Then I quickly slipped into my seat.
The girl next to me made me a big ironic smile, she found it an honor for the corresponding woman to sit next to her.
The rest of the time was calm enough, but when the gong resounded, I was struck by the rules.
Everyone was talking to who was better, could laugh and ask me many questions - in this case, it's hard enough to understand the English Japanese.
During the break, they all left their Bento.
My host mother also made me this kind of lunchbox - it's really different from the miserable Germans.
I had rice with aromatic herbs, small sauces, a salad of concobre and algae, fruits and a kind of meat surrounded by Tofu.
Most of the time, I have no idea what I eat right here in Japan.
Things have a strange appearance and a completely new taste.
What's certain is that everything's really good.
All right, except maybe the fried salads, brrrrr!
Bentos are not just lunches in Japanese schools.
Sometimes a girl offers a bento to a boy she has prepared herself, and then she is prepared especially carefully - in the hope of having a little better knowledge of the boy during the break.
I read it in my sleeves.
I'm curious to know if I could observe it here as well.
"Why Japan in particular?" my friends asked me when I told them that I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
I've always said:
"Because it's fascinating to me, what"
After all, reading mangas, that's what I've preferred for years.
And in order to better understand the mangas and culture that is there, at some point, I also began to learn Japanese.
For me, it was really clear that I had to travel there one day.
Because I also have a weakness for traditions, customs and customs.
And here, they're given a lot of importance.
On the one hand, Japan is the country of the most recent technologies and trends - on the other hand, it is severe, disciplined and traditional.
And since everything is so well organized, I've never felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the largest city I've ever seen."
Rats also have sensations
A rat or a cafard was in danger, does that mean he feels fear too?
The neurophysicist Joseph LeDoux is convinced of this: many animals also have feelings.
But how can we verify that he is testing the same thing when he acts in the same way as us?
In the online magazine "Edge", contributions have been published for several years by famous scientists.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series of articles on the answers to the question "What do you think is true without being able to have the proof?"
I believe that animals have feelings and other state of consciousness without me or anyone else who has so far been able to prove it all as one cannot prove that other human beings have a conscience.
But in this case, we can at least hope that all human brains will have the same configuration.
As soon as we turn to other species and approach the questions of the senses or in general of consciousness, we will enter difficultly practical fields because the Hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, it does the same thing as many other animals: it causes death, flees, or attacks.
Human beings behave in the same way, so some scientists deduct a comparable subjective life from it.
I don't believe it, though.
Two aspects of the brain structure make the transformation of our subjective life to that of the difficult animals.
One aspect is that the circuits associated with human consciousness almost always include the frontal lateral cortex (because of its participation in short-term memory and in management and execution functions).
This vast region is much more developed in human beings than in other primates and appears to be completely absent in other beings.
Thus, at least for these aspects of our conscience, which depends on the prefrontal cortex, including the consciousness of who we are, and the ability to predict and decide, it is reasonable to assume that the human being is even different from the other primates.
Another significant particularity could reside in the linguistic nature of Man: a large part of his existence is linked to language, which often means that his consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
But even if consciousness was not to depend on language, it would certainly influence it, so that animal consciousness, whatever the way it is produced, would probably differ much from most of our state of consciousness.
That is why it is so difficult to determine what the consciousness of other animals may look like.
If this, internal and subjective, does not allow itself to be measured or, because of this particular hardware, to be analysed on the basis of our own experience, then its observation poses serious problems.
Most of my developments refer to the content of conscious life, but there is another aspect of consciousness that should be more easily accessible scientifically.
Animal awareness processes could be examined without taking into account their content, and that is exactly what happened in short-term study of primates, particularly with the example of visualization.
But in this approach followed by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, we focus more on the nervous correlations of consciousness than on causal mechanisms: both can be identical or not.
Curiously, this approach also highlights the weight of the Frontier Cortex in the realization of visualization.
But what is the result for emotions?
I conclude that an emotional system such as that of fear is activated in a brain conscious of its own activity.
So what we call "fear" is the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its suites, such as the reactions of the body) takes hold of the living memory.
As noted, emotions are closely linked to the regions of the cortex that characterize the primates and especially the Human.
A subtle degree of feeling, associated with our voluable nature, emerges, because we can, with the help of words and grammar, distinguish and categorize states to impose them on others than ourselves.
To the contrary, Antonio Damasio thinks, for example, that sensations from primitive activities are born in the regions of the cortex and the brain trunk, as well as Jaak Pankseep, who focuses more on the brain trunk.
As this network has not changed much in the course of human evolution, it could fully participate in transversal sensations in all kinds.
From a purely theoretical point of view, I cannot contradict it, but I believe that is undisputed.
Pankseep argues that what looks like fear in men and rats is probably as sensitive as it is in both cases: how can we still verify if rats and men feel the same thing when they behave in a similar way?
A cafard was in danger, but if he feels afraid?
In my view, similar behaviors are not enough to prove identical vecus.
Of course, the nervous comparison helps: rats and men have similar brain trunks, but on the other hand, the cafards do not even have a brain.
But is the brain trunk the origin of the sensations?
And even if we could prove this to Man: how could we demonstrate it in rats?
I think rats and other mammals, perhaps even the cafards (who knows?) have feelings.
But I wouldn't know how to prove it.
And because their feelings are probably completely different from ours (because human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I prefer to explore emotional behavior than emotional feelings of rats.
In all cases, progress has been made to the level of nerve to the extent that we eat the same thing in rats and in humans.
As I don't explore language and consciousness in rats or sensations, I don't know if they exist.
We could think of it as a short term, but I prefer to go ahead rather than get caught up against a wall all the time.
I'm really a pragmatic emotional.
Platini, President of the UEFA: a grace period for Poland and Ukraine
The Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Wasjunik explained that preparations would soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government considers the UEFA decision in Bordeaux to be evidence of trust in Ukraine and its ability to organize, in collaboration with Poland, the European Championships," Wasjunik announced.
"But it's not amnesty for our country.
The work is just beginning, and there is still much to be done in both countries."
In the construction or destruction schedule of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, both guests run after the time.
The number of stages for the European Championship could possibly be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We must work at the maximum speed," said the President of the Ukrainian League Grigorij Surkis.
"UEFA has kept an eye on us."
An even more radical measure was decided in Poland.
The leadership of the Polish football league PZPN was suspended by the National Olympic Committee after many scandals and replaced by Robert Zawlocki, an independent administrator.
The Committee met at the request of the Minister of Sports Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There would be "a real danger that the PZPN is not able to act in the rules," Drzewiecki of the Polish PAP press agency said.
"We have provided a letter to the President of the UEFA that the preparations for the 2012 European Championship would not suffer."
Several members of the First Division League have already been convicted in the previous season for the handling of compulsory relegation; in the end, the start of the League has even been delayed in the last minute.
Dennis Quaid indicted against attack
She wanted to make the promotion for a new film, she talked about her private life in an interview - and now she's having trouble with her ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan lifted the veil on her former adult Dennis Quaid.
He enamels - and counter-attack.
A late War of Roses for the former couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors deliver themselves to a humiliating battle - the sight and the south of the world.
Last week, Meg Ryan expressed himself in an interview for the American newspaper InStyle on the causes of marriage failure: "Dennis has been unfaithful to me for a long time, and it was very painful."
She would have known the extent of the deception only after the divorce.
The reason for this striptease of thought lies in Ryan's press relations for his new film "The Women" - it tells the story of an adult.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his unfaithful husband's qualification clearly fell: it would be "Monstrelle", he said to the "New York Daily News", 54 years old, that "Meg restores the history of our relationship and manipulation."
It would be more "reparable", than "the pain and turmoils that cause a divorce for each child are once again in public" for their 16-year-old son Jack."
While Ryan lives alone since the divorce, Quaid has remarried and will soon become the father of twins.
So his answer was, "In any case, my life continues.
I'm happy to have a wonderful family that's going to the best."
Air ticket prices and hotels drop
In the first half of 2008, flights and night hotels were less expensive than the previous year.
In Germany, according to a current study, flights would be even reduced to 50 per cent.
Flights and hotel nights would be beneficial - this is the result of a study by the provider of financial services and American Express travels.
The company analysed its reservation data in the first half of 2008 and, after an increase in prices in the first quarter, established a net decrease in profits in the second quarter.
After prices on the hotel market have increased for years, hotel nights have already decreased in many places.
From January to March, prices increased in 41 of the 48 European cities under review by 6.9 per cent on average compared to 2007 in 41 of the 48 European cities under review.
From April to June, however, prices were already 3.6 percent lower than the previous year.
The trend was clear in Paris and Rome, where travellers had to pay from 30 to 37 percent less than one year earlier.
The causes of all of this would be for American Express in the low dollar course that led to a "deviation of low travel by American tourists".
Financial places such as Frankfurt or London would be as much affected by the rise of hotel prices as industrial sites such as Hanovre, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Swedish city, hotel prices are rising by 26.3 per cent, the record in Europe.
Also in terms of flight prices, the trend was increasing in the first quarter:
Due to the increase in the price of kerosene, economic-class passengers have to pay on average 7.1 per cent more than in 2007, long-term flights, very fuel-consuming, even increased to 29.2 per cent.
From April to June, the prices of tickets in economic class fell by 12.5 per cent on average compared to the previous quarter, in business class and in first class, however, price variations were much less pronounced.
In Germany, prices have fallen even more significantly than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices increased by 11.9 per cent, in the second quarter, by 23.6 per cent.
German domestic flights were even divided by two according to this study.
The reasons for this fall in prices would on the one hand be flexible economic growth, the firm explains.
The request would be granted from the ground in many segments of the air travel market.
On the other hand, there would be an increased pressure on competition under the "Open Sky" Treaty which liberalises air traffic between the United States and Europe.
The sign of the trend is the removal by airlines of non-profit routes, as well as the high number of airlines that would have submitted the budget during the first half of 2008 - they were 24 companies nothing but in Europe.
HSV bat Gladbach 1:0
With a simple purpose and methods, the Hamburg SV becomes the first of the ranking.
In Borussia, Luhukay has still failed to find a functional eleven.
De Kristoff Klein. Grondir. Disaster landing for international player Marko Marin.
The Gladbach player will only come back late in the game and his shot up failed against the target framework.
His message was precisely formulated, it was out of his lips convincingly.
He just knew he was right.
"We need this second goal," siffla Hermann Rieger in the back of the Hamburg arena.
It wasn't a big deal in the clothes, the mid-time was over, and most of them were in their place.
Rieger has been the physiotherapist of HSV for nearly three decades, he enjoys a great reputation as well as a number of former protagonists.
And that's why his application was received at strategic locations.
Assistant Coach Cornelius Jol acquired and raised the pulse to approve.
Cornelius is the brother of the coach in the head of Hamburg Martin Jol.
Because the orders seem to have been similar: and that jumps with this second purpose!
There was a lack of practice.
"It wasn't very nice to see you today," Marcel Jansen later said.
Bastian Reinhard would have "southern also to be more relaxed".
This 1:0 (1:0 at mid-time), the Hamburg team owes it to a hit on the head by Mladen Petric (at 11th minute); and the fact that the very weak players of Gladbach could not hurt the weak players of Hamburg.
"It was a victory hall," said Marin Jol.
The SV of Hamburg will celebrate this Monday its 121-year-old.
As early as Saturday afternoon, the supporters celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arena and the provisional ranking tables on the giant screen that indicated their club as the first of the class.
It's going to be a birthday without a real party.
"We know how to take care of it," said Marcel Jansen.
It is believed that the mid-term result of the table reflects more the unpredictable character of the first League than the domination of its HSV.
The team with its late arrivals - the Brazilians Neves and Silva, the goalkeeper Petric as well as Jansen from FC Bayern - is formed very slowly, but it does not shine yet.
"We need more charm and more dribble," Jol demanded.
After the failure of the vote
At Wall Street, the fear circle.
The first news of the failure of the rescue plan dropped the Dow Jones temporarily from 700 points.
It was the biggest loss of points in the space of a day in history.
Later, Dow Jones got a little caught up.
By about 2030, the world's largest stock exchange index was 10,579 points with a drop of well five percent.
The Nasdaq technology scholarship index was 1548 points with a drop of more than seven points.
The most losers of Dow Jones were at that time American Express who lost almost 14 percent and the Bank of America with a loss of about 12 percent.
No title could report any more benefits.
Bank Goldman Sachs' shares charged a decrease of almost ten percent.
Just a few days ago, the big investor Warren Buffet was associated with the company.
As part of the rescue plan, the means must be mobilised for the purchase of what is called grated mortgage papers.
However, the amount must not be paid once but gradually.
On the other hand, the State should recover options on the shares of the financial company that could be exchanged in relation to the evolution of the course in order to reduce the burden on the Public Treasury.
The courses of action in Europe and the United States of America
Billions of aid to banks in Europe and the United States do not address investor concerns.
The course of action of the great German bank Hypo Real Estate collapses and pulls the Dax towards the bottom.
The U.S. Dow Jones index collapses despite the rescue of the financial market provided by the State.
The German index (Dax) led to a profound deficit in the course of Hypo Real Estate and the Commerzbank.
The operation of the Bavarian real estate fund lost three quarters of its value in spite of the rescue operation of the federal government and private banks, the Commerzbank has charged a decrease of more than 20 per cent.
The Dax clearly slipped below the significant psychological bar of 6,000 points and was at 5,839 points with a 3.7 percent deficit.
Worldwide, the stock markets have fallen to the knees.
In New York, Wall Street was working with significant losses.
Investors feared that the US Government's $700 billion heavy rescue plan could not be sufficient to restart financial markets.
The Dow Jones at 10,809,25 points lost in the first opening time 334 points or 3.3 percent.
The House of Representatives of the United States intended to vote on the rescue plan, the vote in the Senate should follow on 1 October.
The other European scholarships also knew only one direction: in London, the FTSE 100 index charged a reduction of 3.2 per cent, the CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.9 per cent.
In Asia, the main Japanese index of Nikkei fell to 11.743,61 points after an increase of 1.26 per cent.
In Hong Kong, the Hang-Seng index ranged from 2.1 per cent to 18.286,90 points.
In India, the main index of Sensex lost 506.43 points to 3.9 per cent and closed to 12.595.75 points.
In the MDAX, Arcandor's shares fell after the announcement of an increase in capital.
The private bank Sal. Oppenheim has subscribed to 23 million new shares.
The commercial and tourist multinationals have made it clear that the shares will not be sold in Thomas Cook.
Of the dark matter affects the flight of space probes
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has left researchers in perplexity: the dark matter has influenced the speed of space probes while called gravitational support manoeuvres.
Experts fear that the general theory of relativity is not entirely correct.
For almost 18 years, the space probe "Ulysses" has been flying in space.
Because of soon-frozen fuel runs, death is a threat.
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has led to the development of researchers - the anomaly of gravitational support.
Gravitational support is a manoeuvre of space probes, through which they obtain an additional enamel in the gravitational field of a celestial body, for example, the Earth.
So the probes can save a lot of fuel.
The American-European research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical tool, as well as the Ulysses solar probe.
This is surprising for researchers elsewhere for years: flying objects do not always behave 100 percent of the way they expect it according to the venerable laws of gravity.
Moreover, irregularities appear at speed level.
The probes become unexpectedly faster or slower.
Until now, physicists have been unable to explain this effect.
They baptized him the anomaly of gravitational support.
Some experts were afraid that Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity, which describes the force of attraction of the matter because of the curve of space, could not be entirely correct.
American physicist Stephen Adler of Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study always believes that Einstein was not mistaken and tries to explain the anomaly of gravitational support by what is called the black matter that astronomers have identified in the universe.
"Black matter could be responsible for this anomaly, which is also near the Earth," he writes.
Space researchers have known the existence of black matter for only about ten years.
It appears to be an attractive force whose effect is observable on other celestial bodies.
On the other hand, it is completely invisible, i.e. it neither sends nor reflects any electromagnetic radiation, especially any visible light.
According to the calculations of scientists, black matter would still represent a good fifth of the entire mass of the universe.
The tourists removed from Egypt are free
After ten days at the hands of their admirers, the kidnappers in Egypt should be released as well as the Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs confirmed it.
The Sudanese raiders had demanded a ransom of several million euros.
During the shooting prior to the release, six hostages would have been killed.
In southern Egypt, five Germans were kidnapped.
Negotiations for the ransom would already be initiated.
Germans are constantly in the kidnapper's collimator.
WELT ONLINE represents the most important cases.
European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are clearly free.
This is what the Egyptian state television, the Al-Arabia Arab television channel and the Italian media have delivered in concert.
The Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs Franco Frattini confirmed the release after the Italian TV radio tickets Sky TG 24 : "Our citizens and other hostages have been released.
We're checking their health status," Frattini said.
The five Germans, the five Italians and the Romanians as well as their eight Egyptian companions behave well and are safe, the Egyptian national television announced.
The 19 participants in the trip to the desert should already be on their way to Cairo.
The circumstances around a rifle before the release of the hostages remain still fluctuated: thus, the kidnappers would have been nearly put to a standstill, according to an Egyptian security officer, before the Sudanese army kills six of the kidnappers without shouting a strike.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed with a ransom," the agent said.
It was only to collect the hostages," when suddenly, "this surprise" occurred.
Sudanese soldiers had killed six of the rebels this Sunday in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt, and had arrested two of them.
The tenants had demanded from Germany a ransom of six million euros; the money had to be delivered by the German woman from one of the hostages.
The daily "El Masri El Jom" said that, according to a German mediator, the release of hostages was delayed because the kidnappers feared for their safety.
According to the article, the barbers wanted to release the women's hostages after payment of the ransom.
The men were to be detained until the predators found a safe way to escape.
The German Embassy in Cairo refused to comment on this account.
The abuse of a father-in-law "who resorted to suicide"
A court has been informed that years of abuse caused by her father-in-law have led a woman to commit suicide.
Michael Treise, 57, of Stithians, in the Cornwalls, was imprisoned for six years after admitting eight charges for inconsistencies.
Truro's grand court referred to him as reading his beautiful daughter, Stéphanie Randle, during his childhood, from 5 to 7 years of age.
Treise wrote in a letter of confession: "I feel responsible for her death."
The court was informed that Melle Randle, aged 34, committed suicide at Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007.
When she was living in Coventry, Treise had tied her up before forced her into sexual acts, while her mother was working in the pub.
Treise and his wife divorced in the 1980s, and he will live again in the Cornwalls.
His beautiful daughter went to Plymouth.
But the court was informed that Melle Randle, a volunteer assistant of National Trust, was suffering from abuses that had been inflicted twice a week.
The Attorney General Ramsey Quaife told the court that friends had told me that Melle Randle, who was a good surfer and cyclist, had been "emotionally dead" since 2006 and "lost all hope of life."
In April 2007, his real father, Terrance Randle, found him dead in his apartment in Plymouth.
We think she killed herself by suffocating with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle addressed his daughter's beautiful father who had also written a letter of confession that ended up as follows: "I regularly attach and band."
"I didn't abuse her sexually.
"I feel responsible for his death."
Judge Christopher Elwen said to Treise: "You are really weird as a fetishist, your victim must certainly be terrified, especially at the age of 7.
"This devastating saga ended up with the victim's suicide.
And what's even more surprising is that if she didn't do this, her story would certainly never end in court."
He added: "I particularly stress, as his father and mother describe it, the effects of your crime committed over the years on Stéphanie.
"Without them, she would certainly be a happy, promising, and successful young woman today."
Condemnation for loss of official data.
The Office Cabinet ministerial officer who had forgotten the top secret documents, in June on a train, will be convicted by the Official Secrets Act, with his BBC.
The man of the Ministry of Defence was moving when he forgot two highly classified documents on a waterloo train.
The documents were passed into the hands of the BBC before they were delivered to the police.
This is the least serious condemnation of this act, without any insinuation of criminal intent.
The BBC correspondent Frank Gardner said that this episode had a lot of Whitehall people.
"They would have thought that this case would remain between the walls of the Ministry of Defence and the Cabinet Office," he said.
The employee who cannot be appointed shall be charged with violating section 8.1 of the Act, i.e. the clause relating to the protection of information.
.The Crown Prosecution Service suggested that the departmental officer be placed under the care of the Metropolitan Police, given the very sensitive nature of his work related to the Associated Committee of Secret Services.
The documents he lost contained appreciation of Al-Qaeda as well as of the resources of the security forces in Iraq.
He was informed of the decision, Monday morning and was then transported from home to a secret place.
Building companies in front of the B&B bill.
British building companies could have to pay more than £80 million to cover the savings of Bradford & Bingley bank.
The Government provided £14 billion to protect the deposit of the 2.6 million savings from Bradford & Bingleys.
The interest of this loan will be paid by all companies that collect the money of the savings, including 59 companies in the building.
The Director General of Building Societies Association (BSA), Adrian Coles, said that it is "irritant" to know that companies and their members will have to pay the broken gates...
The loan of £14 billion will be repaid when Bradford & Bingleys' mortgages are disbursed.
But the interests that are going to increase at the same time, will be debited every year to 700 financial companies that collect deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme has confirmed to the BBC that the 59 building companies are included in this list.
It's annoying to see that institutions that have had prudent behavior... now have to pay some of the bills of institutions that were much less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It is proclaimed that each company must pay a sum proportionate to the deposits it holds, and that intermediate companies must pay approximately 18 per cent of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that the interest in the loan will rise to £450 million in 2009.
This means that companies will have to find £81 million to settle the interests of the first year.
Adrian Coles, Director-General of the Commercial Committee of Building Societies, told the BBC that this decision seemed unfair to him.
It's annoying to see that institutions that have had a prudent behaviour when the real estate market resume now have to pay for much less prudent institutions.
According to the BSA, no company has failed since 1945, date of the first years.
"We need to consider all aspects of this case over the next few weeks, to evaluate the options to be adopted to avoid the fact that the building companies and their members pay this salad bill," said Mr. Cole.
Interests for 2009 cover seven months, from the end of September of this year to the end of March.
In 2010, the interests of the whole year will have to be paid, which could also double.
Since the building companies are non-participating organizations, their members end up paying the bill either by higher charges or by lower interest rates for savings accounts.
The milk increases to five pennies per litre
Jersey people have to pay more for their milk
Jersey Dairy announced that she was going to increase the price in fat of her milk, from five penny per litre, from Monday.
This is the second increase in the price resulting from a two-penny increase in February, and is due to a research carried out by a consulting company.
Retail sellers must decide whether they go to their turn, increase the price for consumers.
Before the increase in February, the wholesale price of Jersey's milk had been changed for the last time in 2002.
An ex-Pm from Bangladesh has been denied bail
A court in Bangladesh rejected a request for bail at the former PM Sheikh Hasina, which could thus be arrested on his return to the country.
His lawyers said that the court had refused to grant him his bail because of his review for exorcising a man, 50 million Taka ($729.00), when she was PM.
This case is one of the many charges against him.
Khaleda Zia, the always rival of Sheikh Hasina, was released under bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina should return to Bangladesh a few weeks ago, but her party, League Avani, demanded that the country's interim military government give her full freedom first.
Correspondents stressed that the terms of his release were contradictory because if he was allowed to leave the country for medical reasons, he could not see why he could not remain free to return to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers announced that she would now appeal to the Supreme Court against the order of the Supreme Court.
"The Supreme Court rejected Sheikh Hasina's application that she did not need a guarantee since she had been authorized to go abroad for medical reasons," said his lawyer Rafique Huq.
"We will appeal against the order of the Supreme Court"
Her lawyers argued that she needed this security to return to the country in order to prepare the elections in December
Sheikh Hasina should return after 17 October, a former leader of the Awami party said.
She was detained last year after the military early government took over power, but was released in June to care for abroad.
Sheikh Hasina, like Zhaleda Zia, denies the accusations they are making.
Concerns for the Afghan anti-polo campaign.
In Afghanistan, nearly 200,000 children were missing the recent polio immunization campaign due to Taliban-related violence, the United Nations said.
The United Nations carried out a vaccination campaign in the six provinces last week.
But she said she was unable to contact children in the dangerous Helmand and Kandahar areas, located in the south.
A United Nations spokeswoman stated that despite the Taliban's promise not to attack or stop the thousands of nurses during the vaccinations.
BSkyB loses the ITV court battle
BSkyB has lost its trial following the verdict of the Competition Commission, which would force it to reduce its participation in its rival ITV broadcaster.
The Competition Appeals Tribunal ordered BSkyB to reduce its ITV shares by 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
The Committee stated that in the past, MSkyB's participation had prevented competition and had allowed it to influence ITV unfairly.
BSkyB purchased its shares in 2006 following an agreement aimed at preventing NTL, now called Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Fair Trading Office reported that the purchase by BSkyB, of ITV parties, had raised doubts about the effective independence of ITV, thus encouraging the Competition Commission to investigate
Virgin's patron Richard Branson, a group of consumers and the Ofcom regulator were all contrary to this purchase.
BSkyB argued that the need to reduce its share of ITV would not be reasonable and, on the other hand, was excessive – especially since BSkyB has just given up voting rights.
New investigation into the case of U.S. prosecutors.
The U.S. Attorney General appointed a special prosecutor to check the issue of the release of nine U.S. prosecutors in 2006.
The whole was born from the report of the case of the Inspector General of the Department of Justice, who criticized the actions of certain ministerial officers.
The report was critical to the officers of the White House, the legislators and the former Prosecutor General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation is based on the thesis of lawyers who argue that their dismissal is due to political causes.
The Special Prosecutor, Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether the officers interviewed during the investigation lied to the investigators, thus obstructing justice.
"There have not been any full and complete confirmation of potentially unfounded serious criminal charges of conduct," said Inspector General Glenn Fine in his report.
The appointment of a special prosecutor capable of forcing witnesses to file was one of his greatest recommendations.
The dispute began with the radiation in December 2006 of nine U.S. prosecutors formulated by the U.S. Department of Justice.
At the time, the Department had declared that the prosecutors were licensed because of medical benefits.
However, it would then emerge that the licensed prosecutors were no longer criticised by their other colleagues, which would encourage some observers to attribute a political connotation to these licences.
Some of the prosecutors were accused of being close to the Republicans of Congress, while others would have refused to investigate allegations of fraudulent voting against the Democrats.
U.S. prosecutors are investigating and pursuing judicial proceedings for the government.
It is certain that they can be licensed at any time, but cannot be for political reasons.
The head of the Department of Justice, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, has been charged with being involved in this licensing case, and in the end he resigns.
A number of ministerial officials from the Department of Justice have also resigned.
The Inspector General's report was very critical of Mr. Gonzales' role in this case, stating that he considered it "the first responsible" of these licences, and ended by "abdicating" his role as leader," which was remarkablely successful not to be involved in this case.
Other ministerial officers, including former Bush collaborator, Karl Rove, were critical of failing to cooperate during the investigation.
Meat Loaf's age must be honored.
The Rock Star Meat Loaf must be honored at Q Awards for its epic song Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will receive an oscar during the ceremony in London next week, said he was "honored" to get this recognition.
The nine-minute and fifty-second song was the title of the hit of the album by Meat Loaf in 1977.
The night of the price surrender is presented by Coldplay, with this year, a restricted selection of four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said: "There are songs that transcend things such as time and gender, and Bat Out Of Hell certainly goes away
The song, written by Jim Steinman, demanded a great voice like that of Meat Loaf.
It starts with an instrumental section that lasts almost two minutes.
The song was placed in the United Kingdom, as a single in 1979, in the fifth place.
In addition, his Bat Out of Hell album remained nine years in English rankings, and it was sold to over 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf- or Marvin Lee Aday, of his real name, has suffered health problems in recent years, even undergoing surgery to heal his heart beat irregularly, after having collapsed on stage in 2003.
In 2007, a strong laryngitis forced him to cancel concerts.
Then he was found a coast in the vocal cords.
A Shadow Street in the City, often forgotten, and Maybe Etre Welcome to Sale.
New York has hundreds of adventures, Boulevards, Streets and other parallel routes, some famous, others only functional.
. And even some veterinary taxis as well as long-term local residents can't give indications to go to Extra Place because they've never heard of it.
The street is located in the East Village and travels north of First Street- not to be confused with Second Street- between Bowery and Second Avenue.
About 30 feet wide for 120 long, it looks like a dusty goose instead of an active artery.
. No panels indicate the street.
It is virtually impossible to find it on a standard atlas.
This street, however, has admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the builder of the recent luxury buildings on First Street.
He would like to resume Extra Place, and create a smoother passage to shops and shops, which should open in new buildings.
Other admirers, including long-term neighbors, said to be charmed by these shortcuts simply because there remains one of the last and oldest streets in the house.
But the Department of Preservation and Real Estate Development of the city that manages the street has no interest in keeping it.
This month, at a meeting of the neighbourhood owners committees, representatives of the city agency and Avalon Bay issued a proposal authorising the real estate manufacturer to buy the street.
But the Committee prefers the street to remain in the city's hands, and has asked for a new proposal to be submitted next month, said Susan Stetzer, the local manager of Committee No.3.
"There are only few spaces in the city, and we would like the city to preserve Extra Place" she said.
"They could propose to restore it and manage it, what Avalon could do elsewhere, but we want to keep it public."
Avalon Bay announced a number of months ago that she wanted to refurbish the small street and install seats there, some would also be used by a coffee to which the builder would grant space.
The proposal for this potential acquisition was made public at the meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, the spokesperson for Avalon Bay, said that although the company wants to exploit the street, that does not necessarily mean that she wants to be the owner.
"The main interest of Avalon Bay is to relook at this abandoned passage, and make it public," she said, stressing that it was the city to suggest the sale."
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for Immobilier's Preservation, confirmed that the city wanted to sell the street, stressing further that the agency's mission was to develop property rather than manage it.
Compared to his most colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place left a slight historical print.
Some believe that Extra Place has been bearing this name since 1802, when the legacy of the large farm of the many children of Philip Minthorne was divided, leaving aside this small piece of land, which has been abandoned.
The later CBGB entrance, a closed punk rock monument in 2006, opened in Extra Place; the street is certainly more famous thanks to the photo coverage of Ramones' album "Rocket to Russia"
"This place was wonderful," said Danny Fields, the Ramones Manager, who took the photo in November 1976.
It was full of irons, olives, barricades, posters, leaves and ropes."
Some residents, including bloggers who had already talked about evolution to the luxury of the East Village, opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, saying that this humble small property should remain public.
Others have proclaimed Extra Place as a true rare- a virtually identical fragment to the city that should be fixed in peace.
Jeremiah Moss, who conducts a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (sub-titled "The Book of Contests: A Nostalgic Look on a City in the Extinction Process") relates the story of the City and Extra Place, published in 1952 in The New Yorker.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a narrow, dark, dark day as night, and delimited by the doors of a rusty iron warehouse and the blinds, full of newspapers last week that circle along the gouts."
With few exceptions, the street always has the same length.
A rat is short at the bottom of the street, close to a door that was driving at CBGB, and has now become the seat of a store of chic clothing.
Graffiti on the walls, a 22-ounce bottle of beer, lies next to newspapers that just have been thrown out.
A few passers-bys have stated that they rarely think about Extra Place, and have suggested that it be appreciated.
Mr. Field, on his side, said that some understated the attractiveness of the street in his current state.
"The best years of my life," he said, "have taken place in dark, wet and dehumid places."
The Bilingual debate: Immersion in English
In this part of the Education Supervisory Program, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the position of candidates on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, former student in California, and former director of the Department of Education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of the book "not as well as Good as You Do Not Think It. Why middle classes must be able to choose their school."
To attract the favor of Hispanic voters is a complicated business.
Barack Obama's proposals on education are an interesting example.
Mr Obama's campaign emphasises that "African and Latino students are less likely to graduate than white students." It is a true fact.
In order to combat these differences, Mr Obama's education programme, in particular, supports so many other subjects, "transitional bilingual education" for those who learn English.
However, the question for Obama is whether his desire to achieve bilingual education that defends instruction in languages other than English is also of interest to eliminate differences.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an elementary school in the east of Los Angeles.
Students in this school are largely Hispanic, and low incomes.
More than a third of the students, consisting of many new arrivals, study English.
Among the CM1, 100% students passed the 2008 peer status review, an expert level.
Similarly, almost 93% of students passed the English-language-d'arts examination
This incredible success was achieved through another ingredient that was advanced by Mr. Obama.
Sixth Street developed a constant assessment of capacity and an exemplary attitude.
In addition, and here is an example that Mr. Obama could copy, Linda Mikels, head of the Sixth Street, has introduced the instruction of the English language "full immersion".
The total English-language immmersion focuses on the almost constant use of English in instruction.
Melle Mikels, contrary to bilingual education, said, "We had an enormous success with a student who had just arrived from Mexico 12 months later, if you went without his class, you would have had no chance of identifying him."
"That's going, she's watching, "it's going for us."
Mr. Obama should not take the example of the Sixth Street Prep and replication it in other schools composed of most Spanish students learning English.
The excellent results of this school talk about themselves; but the policies on education within its party (the National Education Associations have long supported bilingual education) and its enormous support for bilingual education, obscured the forecast of Mr Obama's response.
Although it is favorable for immigrants to learn English, Mr Obama recently considered this issue insignificant, when he announced that we should all stop discussing the wording of the English-language laws.
"On the contrary, he will say, "you must make sure that your child speaks Spanish."
If Mr Obama really wants to eliminate the differences, then he should consider carefully the models of education that work, rather than denouncing them or treating them as insignificant.
Cute Nete du Petrole following the New Concerns of the World Economics
Oil prices have dropped significantly on Monday, as people fear that the rescue plan for financial developments will not be able to give life to the economy.
Gross oil operations fell by 7 per cent to $99.80 in the barrel. The New York Market Stock Exchange, on sale this morning.
Prices have dropped by more than $20 in the lobby since last Monday.
In the last two weeks, the markets of raw materials have been driven by the financial turmoil of Wall Street, as well as by two powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After having met in July, an increase of $145.29 in the barrel, prices fell to nearly $90 in the barrel this month, before redoubled to the deep uncertainties of financial markets.
This Monday, investors are again concerned despite the rescue agreement, the largest in history, concluded this week by Congress leaders.
The news has been mitigated by recent concerns that the crisis would be lasting.
In the last episode of this financial disaster," Citygroup will purchase the bank operations of the Wachovia Corporation, the government said on Monday.
At the same time, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalized the European financial conglomerate, Fortis.
The analysts at Barclays Capital said that the Frequent negotiations of this weekend, concluded with the rescue agreement, appear to have failed to renew the market."
While the economic situation deteriorates, the demand for raw materials, including oil, should be slowed down.
"The perspective of global equity, interest rates and market exchange has become uncertain" Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a letter to their investors."
"we believe that the raw materials will not escape from this contagion.
"As far as raw materials are concerned, our most pressing concern is to understand until the American virus spreads globally and in particular in China."
The bank's analysts have reduced their expectations for the next year, given the drop in oil consumption due to the slowdown in economic growth, they were therefore obliged to decrease by 20 per cent, the oil and gas prices forecast for 2009.
The Second Time Determining Festival for Team Record Improvement.
After spending the last eight seasons, more time than anyone in uniform with the Jets Shaun Ellis, the defender thought he had seen everything.
He was looking at the second time, when the Jets turned a 0 to 0 into an explosion.
"I've never seen anything like this," said Ellis.
The second time began after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals played wildly under dark clouds.
Then the fourth back Brett Favre managed to take a walk to Laveranus Coles, allowing a 12-yard touchdown, a precursor from one afternoon during which their relationship made a bond in the past.
Favre found Cole for two more touchdowns, the first when a back corner fell and the second, 10 seconds from the mid-time.
"I'm not out of my area" Favre said about all his steps in Coles.
"it's a mediocre player."
"We communicate extremely well, despite what people think."
While Favre and Cole were in the trap, the defense beat the Cardinals' quarterback, Kurt Warner.
Darrelle Revis, corner back, intercepted a lost shot and made 32 yards to the touchdown.
Eric Smith made another pass and intercepted it.
Linebacker, David Bowens let the balloon escape because of Warner.
At the last change, the loss of Bowens' ball, could well be the most charming event
The Cardinals took control of this property for the last 10 seconds, and then the Jets recovered the balloon, Jay Feely made a 20-yard goal taking advantage of 34 to 0.
It was best that the Jets had been able to mark in a while.
"The Jets coach, Eric Mangini, to whom we were asked to describe this madness, said "the second time or the third?"
When he was told the two - the Jets left 21 unquestionable points in the third time - Mangini said: "I can tell you that I have more appreciated the second time than the third time.
"Many points have been marked in a short time."
Gebraselassie retired, exceeds his world record.
Haile Gebrselassie, Ethiopian, again proved to be worthy of his title as the best background runner of the century, after having beaten his own record of the world at the Berlin marathon Sunday, becoming the first to run 26.2 miles in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a victory at 2:03:59 from a comfortable course on the course, Gebrselassie fought for 27 seconds his record of 2:04:26, fought last year in Berlin.
At 35 years of age, Gebrselassie won the 26th record of his wonderful career during which he won the world championship or the world record for any distance of 1600 metres from the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie had missed Beijing's Olympic marathon, frightening - it can be excessive in today's eyes, - that air pollution does not increase its asthma problems.
On the contrary, he promises to run to Berlin.
Under almost perfect- sunny weather, 48 degrees from the start, 55 to the arrival- Gebrselassie won Sunday, now an impressive average of one thousand in 4 minutes 43 seconds
The track runners such as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat, both Kenyans, converted to background runners, have contributed to the decline in the record of marathons over two minutes in the past ten years, since 1998, when Brazilian Ronaldo da Costa won Berlin at 2:06:05 .
After the Sunday victory, Gabrielassie told the reporters, had suffered cramps at the mill two weeks before, and had missed training for a week.
It is obvious that the rest allowed him to stay bright, but not rusty.
"I'm so happy," he told reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I was released last week, and today I had doubts; but at the end, everything went for the best."
He was blamed in Kenya, the rival is African of Ethiopia - for having too much orchestrate his races, avoiding the world's marathon stars, counting in fact on the books as if they were in a race, and considering more world records than the sense of competition.
But this criticism does not diminish the capacity of Gebrselassie as a background runner.
On Sunday, Gebraselasia, preceded by four Kenyans, recorded a time of 1:02:04. on my way.
Two Kenyan elite runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, continued to report to Gebrselasia after the file heads disappeared.
A little over three miles from arrival, Gebrselassie made her final lift to separate from Kwambai, which ends up second in 2:05:36, improving her best personal record of five minutes.
Kamathis arrived third at 2:07:48.
In the women's race, Irina Mikitenko, born in Kazakhstan, now German citizen, completed a remarkable year of the seventh time of 2:19:19.
English Paula Radcliffe holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko surprised everyone who won the London Marathon at 2:24:14.
She was not able to participate in Beijing games because of a bad mortgage on her back, but promised to win in Berlin, improving her third marathon, her personal record of almost five minutes.
It ran using a skilled strategy, allowing the group of Ethiopian runners and Kenyans to take a good advantage, then passing them about 18 miles 1⁄2 after.
Ascale Tafa Margasa from Ethiopia arrived second at 2:21:31, while Helena Cyprus, Kenya, finished third at 2:25:01.
In a City in Part, the Pride and the Trials of the Black Life
Hidden in the development of its immense park, just a few miles from the sunny, brilliant and giant Orlando, there is a small quiet town where the pride and complications of the African-American experience are born.
"Eatonville, the first completely black city to integrate, the children's house of Zora Neale Hurston, this description she made in 1935, is no longer so simple as to make our days."The city with five lakes, three shorts of croquet, 300 dark leather, 300 good swimmers, full of goyaves, two schools and not prison".
She has now become a pilgrimage city
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to Zora Festival every year in Eatonville, to pay tribute to Hurston, the most famous writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
And in various ways, the city she described has become a tourist thanks to her inclusion in the Florida tourist guide published by The Depression- era Federal Writers' Project- remains a separate place.
She is also independent, worthy, and private that she was not already in the 1930s, when Hurston reported that Florida's black rural population was often reluctant to share her true thoughts with the white man, who "we know so little, he doesn't know what he's losing".
Although this is the year of the election of a black president, Senator Barack Obama, who has also called for an open dialogue on the subject of race, many here remain cautious in the eyes of the stranger.
"we are very careful about how to tell the story," said Hortense Jones, 59 years old, who has always been the oldest Parisian of the city.
"it needs to be consistent with reality.
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and struggle.
It represents both a historical model of a black-powering and a community of almost 2400 people where poverty rates are twice the national average.
It is a central point but also an example of a South-South black rural culture - a few times broken down, sometimes aclamed - that reminds us of the birth of American slavery.
This would explain why the residents are both proud and protective.
The interest in the image of Eatonville born with Zora, which everyone here calls Hurston.
She presented her hometown to the whole world through sincere books, full of dialects, such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Wee Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs in the Florida Guide transformed this city, located just on the exit of Route 17, a road that crosses the centre of Florida, often forgotten, which ends in the chapter of black history and human drama.
As bold as a large box in life as in literature, Hurston led readers to the property store of the first mayor of Eatonville, Mr. Joe Clarke, who was then divided into several private parts.
"passed the road to the left," she writes, "you will find the modern black and white public school, with its gardens and these well preserved gaming areas, which Howard Miller has always taken care of, although he knows only to read and write.
She also mentioned the new husband of Widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn" sells drinks of all kinds as well as anything that can serve passersby.
So, hardly a hundred words, Hurston associates Eatonville with a government car, but also with illiteracy, remarriage, and sex.
Of course, Fodor wasn't like that.
It wasn't actually a portrait that everyone liked.
Zora well described the reality " said Ella Dinkins, 90 years old, one of Johnson's young daughters who has immortalized Hurston, quoting the colourless songs, interpreted by men who praised their beauty."
She added: "Some people have not appreciated."
Hurston is always remembered as a living and eccentric person, who often came back after his family moved to Jacksonville, Fla.
Augustus Franklin, 77, recalled that Hurston was habitual in the city without warning, on the side of a large Chevrolet, a cigarette in his mouth and wearing pants here, where even today, we are proud of traditional habits.
Many residents were fascinated, Mr. Franklin told, while many were laughing at her.
"People were always happy to see Zora" he said.
But he also adds, balancing in his post-fare chair that gives on Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was certainly baptized, that "she never remained too long".
At Hurston's death in 1960, she was poor and her books were out of production.
Eatonville and the whole world seemed to have forgotten it.
Although she was already a star of literature, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman in Barnard College of the 20s, she was buried in a tomb somewhere in Fort Pierce, Fla, where she lived.
In Eatonville, no great commemoration, no plate for the great public.
I don't think they understood the contribution or inheritance she offered to the world "declared Valérie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows", a Hurton biography published in 2003.
A crucial moment is happening in the 1980s.
Orange County public officials wanted to take a five-way highway to the city to replace Boulevard Kennedy, the main street in the community.
The development of Orlando has already moved Interstate 4 to the west corner of the city.
The proposal was made when Eatonville just moved away from a difficult period of his history.
Enforced integration, among other things, ended the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the dispute over the mix of races led to hatred at the door of the community.
"At that time, a band of white young people came to launch oranges or objects against the people sitting on the side," said Franklin.
"a lady is even dead."
They're throwing a paste out of their car."
In a 1955 letter addressed to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the application of the Supreme Court for forced integration, defining its decision in Brown v. Board of Education" insulting rather than glamorous of my race."
The residents now declare that the elimination of racial segregation in schools, although positive in some respects, has diluted the cohesion of Eatonville and undermined the confidence of young people.
"Black children were used to being kissed - I remember well - we kissed our master in the morning, and also in the evening," said N.Y. Nathiri, daughter of Ella Dinkins, as well as director of the Community Security Council of Eatonville, a non-profit group.
This took time, she added, until the teachers and students no longer came from the same place.
"You don't kiss your white teacher because he's white. I mean, there's a line of cultural demarcation here," Melle Nathiri said.
Civil rights, on the other hand, have created space for many other Zora Neale Hurston- black writers, actors and artists who have gone beyond the harm, such as her, armed with a cheerful confidence and lines of conduct such as: "How can they escape the pleasure of my company?"
That's too much for me."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker went to the anonymous tomb of Hurston and began to struggle to revive her reputation.
Five years later, an accommodating biography on Hurston by Robert E. Hemenway, a real best seller, reintroduced it to the American cannons.
The highway project came just when Eatonville's most famous girl had found her attraction.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbors viewed her as a lifesaver.
The community began organizing a Hurston festival to demonstrate the catastrophic consequences of this highway.
Hundreds of fans came to the opening of the festival two years later, and many come back in January to commemorate it.
After many years, the county rejected the proposal for the highway.
"The five-way highway fiasco, extremely fast, is a true civic pride," Melle said. Nathiri.
Melle Boyd summarized all the statement that "Zora saved Eatonville".
The victory against the motorway project allowed him to change his own image.
Non-residents, such as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who has been attending our church since 1993, began to come in large numbers, and residents began to reconsider the past.
Eatonville has been a historic city since 1998.
A single theme library (recognised, of course, Hurston) will open in 2006, on a beautiful Kennedy Boulevard, revamped.
Today, Eatonville remains an anomaly for Florida: six miles from Orlando, it can at any time be seen as a back street during a summer rainy day, small as it was when it was founded by 27 black families in the 1880s.
(90 per cent black today)
Foreigners who have come to find out the story of Eatonville, its reason for being, are still being treated with caution.
It is necessary to ask permission for most interviews, and some things – like the walls of the old church of Eatonville, painted by the white man, illustrating black men in the fields – should not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Melle Jones, a courageous teacher who has a low living red, are always afraid that their island community is not well understood.
However, given the expansion of the Hurston festival, a certain level of local pride is emerging.
Young people in particular tend to consider Eatonville as Hurston considered its entire race: beautiful, problematic and everything, no better or worse, but also proud, creative, bossy, crazy and mixed than other ethnic and racial groups in America.
It is a matter of sincere civil affection that we hear in the voice of Mr. Franklin's nephew Edwin Harvey, 18 years old, who plans to return to Eatonville after college to work for the local government or police forces, who need additional forces.
And even for younger people, such as Alondra and Alexia Kenon, 11-year-olds, winter Park twins, seem to have learned the Eatonville description correctly.
"Most people who go through this area will think:" oh, this city has nothing compared to others" Alondra Kenon said after the last Sunday Mass.
But if you stop and take the time to contemplate the story, it's a very beautiful city."
Here in New York, they all talk very well.
Still, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan were away from the kiosk and giant TV screens in Times Square, they would not realize that they are in the eye of the cyclone.
They could never think that in the glass and bee offices above their heads, the bankers and cover fund managers that monopolies New York, pass the worst "workday in the office" since 1929 crack.
The suppliers continue to falsify on the sidewalks, with their carriages and muffin plates for the morning meetings.
Latinos are always drawn between residential buildings, such as mules, a 50-thousand luxury shirt hanging on a yoke set on its shoulders.
Office employees continue to make the queue to buy their morning sandwich to the traveling merchants, and it is still impossible to find a taxi between 4:00 and 19:00 a.m.
I did not feel the crisis despite the completely pessimistic stories until this afternoon when I decided to open a new savings account.
Fortunately, I was planning to work late in the afternoon, because I found out about my local branch of JP Morgan Chase, a dozen people making the queue.
Not in front of the cashier's kits, not to remove the species or make a payment, but in front of the customer's kit, where the usual customers ordered their bosses, the tourists asked for directions for the Macy store, and the new customers would open accounts.
Most of those in front of me, I would learn later from Starr, my "authorised personal banker", were all making the queue for the same reason I did.
In the same way, because they had already removed their savings from smaller banks, such as those of New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Staten Island.
They removed their money from the accounts of savings called victims (such as a building company), credit associations, and the type of local savings funds and their subsidiaries that function only in a state, and who say they treat customers as their family.
In a recent past, 15 of these banks have failed.
In these last days, Washington Mutual, a bank in the capital of $327, has resorted to the bankruptcy syndic, and while the New Yorkers were going home for the weekend after Friday night, another bank, Wachovia, was looking for a savings account of $440 million, desperately looking for a buyer to save it.
The office and the store employees who are in front of me, derailed from another potential debacle, transferred their money to a bank that seems to them to be reliable, which makes Wall Street the most lifesaving.
Some New Yorkers have become very familiar with the world of finance in recent weeks.
"I understood a lady at my Chinese local supermarket, speaking on the phone of Lehman Brothers, the bank that failed, and his senior director-general Dick Full, with the same familiarity she might have had to criticize a colleague.
And Lyn, the uniform concierge of my furniture, changed the subject of our usual conversation about Brad and Angelina or the delivery of my fruit and vegetables market.
She told me, following my visit to the bank. "I put all my savings in the money market.
"I've changed, I don't want to take any chances."
Muslim graves profaned while Austria turned to the right.
Heinz-Christian Strache, who left the right wing of the Austrian Freedom Party and , Filip Dewinter of the right Belgian Vlaams Belang, took part in a demonstration to present the organization of "the cities against Islamization" in Antwerp on Thursday, January 17, 2008.
They carry road panels illustrating red-haired mosquitoes.
The Police accuses extremists of profaning an Austrian Muslim cemetery, the weekend ends of the victory of the political parties of extreme right to the general elections of the country.
More than 90 graves were seriously damaged at Traun Cemetery, near Linz, between Friday night and this morning; this is according to the police, an organized action.
The offenders painted several graves, such as the Star of David; however, the detectives think that this could have been done to dispel the hatred of extremists against Muslim immigrants.
This accident could be in some way related to the elections.
A spokesman for the Islamic Local Community stated that he was "deeply shocked" at the announcement of this profanation, which occurred just during the religious month of Ramadan, which reached its end.
Austria is seriously thinking of finding its courage, following its oscillation to the right during the parliamentary elections yesterday.
The two extreme right-wing parties, which attracted almost 30 percent of the votes, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, had launched an anti-immigration campaign. Some of their slogans were even considered, according to criticism, as xenophobes.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party, who won more than 18 percent of the votes, campaigned against the port of the fould and burkas, and even expressed his opposition to the food alaha.
During his final race in Vienna, he spoke of "a European brotherhood" to avoid the rise of Islam.
The two parties are trying to prevent the construction of mosques and mines, proclaiming that they would be a political symbol of the Islamization of Austria and Europe.
The polls and analyses carried out just after the elections have defined the extreme right as the country's strongest political bloc, which is demonstrated by the majority of young voters who have made the difference because their concerns about the future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter prohibits travel abroad.
The courts banned the rock star glamour, Gary Glitter, accused of sexual abuse on children, expatriation in France and Spain.
The magistrates imposed a six-month ban on Glitter, after he had expressed his intention to return to Spain through France.
The police in Kent had granted this prohibition of travelling on Thursday after proving to the magistrates Glitter's guilt for sexual abuse on the child.
Glitter, or his real name, Paul Gadd, was not present at Ashford's hearing, but was also represented by his lawyer Corker Binning.
A court-martial door declared " Thursday, 25 September, at Ashford's court, Kent's police requested an application to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd from travelling in France and Spain until 25 March.
"Paul Gadd wasn't present then."
Glitter, 64, informed the authorities that he wanted to go abroad, leaving to be registered in the list of sexual abuse charges.
He must inform the authorities if he wishes to go abroad for more than three days.
It must also inform the police, 7 days before its expected departure date.
If he does not communicate his movements to the authorities, he may punish up to five years of imprisonment.
Kent's police said it would not discuss specific cases or possible movements of Glitter in the county.
A spokesman for the Kent Police said, "Kent Police will do everything necessary to protect our children as foreigners.
"We think it is easier to monitor someone who lives in the UK because we have devices capable of managing any potential risks, in a much more effective way.
"protecting the people of Kent is the most expensive intention of the Kent Police, and we monitor closely the behaviour of those accused of sexual abuse in the region in order to minimize potential risks to the public."
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month, after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abuse of two girls, 10 and 11 years respectively.
When he was released, Glitter took the plane to Bangkok from where he would have to board for a flight to London.
But he says he's not feeling well, and he refuses to leave for London.
The Thai authorities blocked him in the control of the passports, and in the end he left in Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities refused to enter their territory, and were therefore obliged to depart to Bangkok; the Thai police and immigration officers insisted on his return to England.
He finally arrived at Terminal 3 at Heathrow Airport on 22 August and, while his lawyer, David Corker, went to Uxbridge, West London, for registration in the list of persons charged with sexual abuse, as requested by Scotland Yard.
In the past, Glitter had already been sentenced to four months in the United Kingdom for holding child abuse images.
A source from the Ministry of the Interior said that Jacqui Smith, the Minister of the Interior, was reassured and happy to know that Glitter had been banned from moving to France and Spain.
"I photograph the master outside the scene to capture elements of his character" Günther Bauer - Photographer
We don't even wear clothes.
The essence of the great masters of the flamenco, freed from all tensions to obtain the private aspect of man or woman.
On the one hand, the artist.
The other one, the person.
Inseparable except in intimacy, at these unknown moments of the great public, where we discover intimate gestures and stolen eyes of artists who do not care about getting on stage.
German Günther Bauer mixes in "Flamenco - people" theatricality of some scenes with singers, dancers and guitarists with this less known side of artists.
In this project, the photographer captures the particular iconography of the flamenco under different angles.
Included in the programming of the Flemish Photography Month, the exhibition "reflects the international importance of flamenco, larger every day", explains the creator, who explains that "Flamenco - people" "may be any one but, having seen the photos, the observer realizes that they are not typical images of artists on stage.
These people photographed "in the street" are artists capable of conveying on stage the passion, sadness, joy... captivating the public.
In order to capture moments of personality of these artists, there is no need to take photos on stage.
They have a personality and a proper character.
What I was interested in was the creation of an intimate atmosphere that allows me to capture with the camera of the flamenco star personality moments."
With the festival "Cant Popular des Mines", Bauer started a long trip in 1997 to photograph the singers, guitarists or dancers with a photo on board.
These are portraits that, thanks to the choice of the camera and the equipment, remove the classic photography.
The implementation of various stylistic means breaks with the classic side of the image, giving it a touch of modernity, this reflects the perception of flamenco according to Bauer: "A music with very traditional roots that evolves and surprises every day."
This is not about dancing or singing in itself, but about the personality and character of the artist who captured the audience with his art.
The search for the essential and magic was the constant work of the El Fotómata gallery these days.
The flamenco beads such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among other things, are part of the selection made from approximately sixty photographers.
The project has become a flamenco anthology, which will soon be published in a book collection of portraits exposed to the gallery.
The passion for the portraits of Bauer led him to repeat the idea two years ago with the "portraits of old sports" ("SportARTproject").
Although the concepts are different in "Flamenco - people", the photographer admits that he loves photographing the portrait of people, knowing them and being able to enter their lives for a longer or longer period of time.
I think in photography the portrait is the most difficult kind.
You're in front of people, people you don't sometimes know or leave just a few minutes to get a picture of them.
Despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to make my ideas come true."
This collection of portraits of the current flamenco, entitled "Flamenco - People", is exhibited at the Galerie El Fotómata, located on the 20th Street of Mata (parallel to the People's Republic of Hercules) which will be opened until next October.
Vargas Llosa confesses that the novel he writes is "true courage"
The novel takes place in places that no one knows and deals with unknown subjects, but once again, Mario Vargas Llossa is determined to move forward the new project on which he works, a novel that has for the main character Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived for twenty years in the Congo and has passed through the Amazon.
The Nobel Prize in Literature admitted yesterday at the Hay Festival Segovia, that the novel that currently deals with it "is a real courage" and that "all it shows he shouldn't write it."
"If I were reasonable, I wouldn't, but I'm going to do it and I'm hoping to finish it," he concluded in his speech at the Festival of Exchange of Ideas and Thoughts, which for four days saw hundreds of writers, historians and journalists and thousands of people in the city of the aqueduct.
The author of "The City and Dogs" was the most expected character of the third edition of this festival and fulfilled his contract.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival award to the majority of the participants, made a perfect room at the Juan Bravo theatre.
The Festival's presenter, Félix Romeo, met with a fascinating audience who did not see the time when Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and with a large dose of humor, retraced the birth of his literary vocation, which is due to "the thirst for reading" and "to live new experiences"; how he wrote "very methodologically" through intensive documentation, correcting and rewriting a part of the text to face his "miss of inspiration"; how Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas influenced his vocation and how his memories inspire his novels.
Hispano-American novelist admitted that "there is no way" to measure and know if books change life. "But I refuse to believe that literature is a pure fun, an ephemeral experience," said Vargas Llosa, who said that it "has effects" and "renders less people alike," because writers were asked "not to let themselves go to the frivolity" and to assume their vocation.
The bad weather wastes the hole of Pozoblanco
The party of the banners that completed the taureal races of the Pozoblanco fair was suspended yesterday morning, after the horse torsors verified that the arena was impracticable.
In this way, the organization committee, in agreement with Fermin Bohorquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonard Hernández, decided to suspend the celebration of the taureal race.
The evil of time has come upon this fair, as finally two parties on three could not have happened.
It is the rain that prevented the celebration of the second scheduled tariff race.
At the show, there was José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista, who had to face in the arena of Castilblanco.
So only Friday's party did I take place
Friday, the winner was Daniel Luke who cut three ears and was brought in triumph, after having made hand movements in front of the bull with taste and aesthetics.
The afternoon itself, Alejandro Talavante concluded on two banners planted on the back of the bull and a cut ear that the discovered gradients applauded more than his fighting himself with the bull.
Woe again to El Juli, who entered the arenas of Los Llanos without pain or glory.
In his fight with the second bull, after a much better fight, he suffocated most of the audience.
Police control of a van in the province of Alava: two thousand kilos of hachisch found
Five hours less than ten in the morning.
Traffic control of the police of Euskadi (Ertzaintza) at the border of the Municipality of Arminéón (Alava).
Police officers arrest two staff members from a van and the two of them take the flight.
Their load, more than two tons of hachisch, is what to stop them from.
The police continued and arrested one of the two prisoners, a 28-year-old man, identified as A.A. J., according to the information released by the Ministry of Interior of the Basque Government.
The individual arrested was charged with drug trafficking and document falsification.
The incident occurred when various employees of the Alava Traffic Unit carried out a vehicle check on the N-1 border of the Arminón Community.
They agreed to stop a van to inspect it when the driver disobeyed the orders, hurriedly accelerated and control began.
The police have started their pursuit until the vehicle stops two kilometers away on the bottom, where the two occupants are down to flee into an empty area.
The Basque police finally arrested one of the two occupants and seized the 2,178 kilograms of hack that they were carrying and found after inspecting the van, an Iveco Daily.
The later part of the vehicle was loaded with hashish balloons. Then they moved to a police station for a thorough inspection and to weigh the drug.
In addition, officials found that the registration plate had been "false" since it did not coincide with the written on the grey card of the van, that is why they charged the detainee with a falsification offence.
Ertzaintza continues his investigation to arrest the other suspect, who has managed to escape and to determine the origin of the drug seized.
The detainee, A.A. J., of 28 years of age, has been alerted to the various approaches and will be judged within the following hours.
Actor Heather Locklear stopped for driving under the influence of a drug
Actor Heather Locklear, the famous Amanda of the Melrose Place TV series, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) for driving under the influence of a medicine.
A witness saw him perform strange maneuvers trying to get out of his garage in Montecito, after a spokesman for the California police patrol devolved to the People magazine.
The witness pointed out that around 4:30 p.m., Locklear "assisted deep on the accelerator, making a lot of noise, trying to get out of the garage, and walking back several times, she rolled on her sunglasses".
Shortly after, the witness, who had not initially recognized the actress, saw Locklear stop in the middle of the highway and left his vehicle.
This person then called emergency services because "she was worried about Locklear's life".
When the police patrol arrived, she found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, which partially blocked the road.
"She had disoriented air," that's why agents led her to the drug and alcohol center to perform a test.
According to a police spokesman, the actress showed a cooperative spirit and alcohol abuse was eliminated from the beginning, although "according to the observation of police officers at first sight, we thought Locklear was under the influence of a drug".
Locklear was arrested as he was suspected of leading under the influence of a substance that was not specified and was incarcerated at 7 p.m. and released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear left Arizona clinic where she was hospitalized to care for a nervous depression.
Llamazars asked the Andalusian Federation of the Union Gate to assume its responsibilities in the Silva case
The Union Gauche General and Member of the Commission, Gaspar Llamazares, said today that it is the regional federation to decide on the case of the former Counsellor of the Youth and Sports of the Municipality of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after being charged with treating members of his family.
"In these cases, I am very federalist, and this will be the Andalusian organization that will take on its responsibilities," Llamazares said about the behaviour of the political party he will have to adopt within the municipal council of Seville.
However, the leader of the Union Gauche requested that investigations be carried out "transparency" for the irregularities that Silva could have committed: "The Union Gauche has always defended this kind of business so that they have a maximum degree of transparency."
He also stressed that the political party has "very strict ethical codes for all officials".
"Mayo's blood," Garci's oasis pari
By inspiring the stories of Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Garci relives the famous battle of the Spanish against the French in "The Blood of Mayo", which is the most ambitious film of his filmography with nearly 15 million euros in budget.
The filmmaker has tried "to stage many characters and illustrate the social analysis" that he has always admired in the work of the famous novelist, has he explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the head of the long list of actors.
The film of more than two and a half hours," Blood of Mayo » will be released in the cinema halls next Friday, which will then become a television series for Telemadrid for more than four hours.
The great admirer of Galdós' literature, José Luis Garci, ensures that with this tour, he has performed "a child's dream" thanks to Esperanza Aguirre, who charged him three years ago to turn a memorial film for the two hundred years of May 2 Madrilene, which he always accepted when the story was held to the national historical facts.
The EUR 15 million provided by the Madrid Community is a "unique opportunity" for Garci to reproduce with appropriate decorations and clothing the ambience of "a Spanish who has failed to fight, as the struggle for independence has led the people to rebellion under Ferdinand VII", he reported.
But the filmmaker regrets that he did not get funding as for the films"Captaine Alatriste" or "The Ghosts of Goya" - more than double the one obtained for "The Blood of Mayo" - because he could not turn a few written scenes into a script signed by Horacio Valcarcel, with which he collaborated during almost all his career.
The filmmaker of "Volver has started" has influenced his usual way of working, on the stage of the actors, with whom he has the habit of repeating before starting the tour and to whom he does not make a casting, since it seems to him to be "humiliant" and considers that "the role of the filmmaker is to go to the theater and cinema to keep himself informed."
Many actors in "Sangre de Mayo" repeat in front of the camera, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larranñaga or Fernando Guillinén Cuervo.
Four times a candidate in Oscar (he won one), Garci considers that the three candidate films representing Spain this year at the Hollywood Academy, "Seven French Billiard Tables" and finally the winner, "The Blind Turners", are not representative of the young Spanish cinema, "who would deserve to be better known," he said.
With this Garci movie, they don't wait for a price.
"At first you think you're working for dessert, and then you realize that you're working for prosperity, and now you're happy to make an extra film," Garci explains after more than 30 years of professional career.
Isabelle Bayón gets into the skin of the sevillane dancer Tortola Valencia
A sevillane dancer will pay tribute to a sevillane dancer as well.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, daughter of a Catalan father (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and a mother of Andalusia (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), is born in the district of Triana and will live in London with her family at the age of three.
He was a free dance dancer and a specialist in eastern dances.
She was a passionate life, pioneer of the liberation of women, such as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was Buddhist and vegetarian and filed for the abolition of the corset that prevented the free movement of women.
The life of this woman, who marked the history of the dance in Europe of the two wars, fascinated Isabelle Bayón.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and the latter suggested that I interpret the Sevillan dancer Tortola Valencia and that seemed incredible to me."
According to the dancer, "we're not trying to tell her life but to translate her way of thinking.
The titles of his dances made me think of flamenco.
Thus, "the dance of the papillo" made me think of a popular Cuban dance and "the dance of the snake" in some tangos.
Her dance was sensual and they told me that my way of dancing was identical to her," she said.
The show was made thanks to two remarkable contributions: the one by Miguel Poveda who would sing Isabela again in one of his shows, as he had done at "La porta aperta"; and the one by Professor Matilde Coral, who had exceptionally wanted to work with the one who was his student.
"Matilde transforms Tortola into a mature character.
I am happy because she has agreed to play a role in my work and it honors me."
The performance was also made thanks to the musical composition and guitars of Jesús Torres y Paco Arriaga, the popular song of Michel Ortega, El Pulga y Moi de Morón; the percussion of El Pájaro, and the rape of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfra Juárez, who plays the role of the eternal companion of such artists who were considered to be divine.
This work also relates, in a way, to the life of this woman who has been in places so far away, especially for the time being, such as India, the United States, Russia, but also throughout Europe, since she usually lived in London.
"I wanted to remember it because I think it's these women who have an enormous influence in their time and now no one knows or appreciates their work," said Bayón.
The show will start at 20:30 at the Lope de Vega theatre
The publication of the "Newly Married Poet's Journal" concludes the Triennat
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Newly married Poet's Journal" in the church of Saint Stephen's in New York, where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities planned by the Ministry of Culture of Andalusia to celebrate the "Triennat Zenobia and Juan Ramón " (2006-2008), organized to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize in Literature and their deaths.
In this way, the "Triennat Zenobia and Juan Ramón " comes to its end with the re-editation of this work, with the International Congress that took place in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel Museum and with the traveling exhibition " Juan Ramón Jiménez: This light-popular" which was opened last May and which, after traveling in the various Andalusian provinces, will be in New York at the International Congress.
Similarly, the Ministry of Culture of Andalusia has purchased eight hundred copies of the "Newly Married Poet's Journal", edited by Pedro Tabenero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to perpetuate the work of one of the most famous Andalusian poets.
America Please Less Without Paul Newman
"Sometimes God creates perfect people
Paul Newman was part of it."
This phrase is from actress Sally Field, who worked with him in "No Malik", and well illustrates the despair of American cinema, and of all America, in view of the striking idea that Newman is no longer in this world.
It was a pain to get an Oscar.
He hasn't been back since 2007.
Everyone knew he was sick.
That was a hard time for everyone.
"Sometimes what a person feels exceeds any expression, and now I have lost a great friend," cried Robert Redford, "my life and my country were better thanks to his existence."
No one was afraid of becoming ridiculous or exaggerating.
One of the fathers of the cinema and the country died during a particularly dark period, where terrorists and the stock markets were afraid, American estimates fell very low, desperately looking for reasons of dignity.
When times are so hard and there is no reason to live, there is nothing left to human beings but admiration and it is not necessary to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
He incarnated an ideal of beauty and truth for everyone.
He was the enemy of Richard Nixon and the defender of lost and defeated causes, such as the foundation for the fight against drugs created in the honor of his elderly deceased as a result of an overdose and the creation of his own brand of bio-food.
It was a victory for a country that had the penalty to impose on a suicide food culture.
This widespread wave of admiration hit Hollywood without paying attention to the nationalities and passports.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, found that no James Bond died before him.
Another Englishman, Oscar Sam Mendes, said working with Newman marked the top of his career.
The bad boy who arrived from Australia, Russell Crowe, dared to name Newman as his greatest inspiration.
"He placed us at the top of the bar," said George Clooney, who may be the only one today who tries to capture the screen as Paul Newman did: being very honest and having a serious private life and far from goals.
It is still not easy or possible in the media jungle of our day.
But there's someone who's trying, and Paul Newman is an example.
After a divorce, he was married for 50 years in Joanne Woodward, to whom he was loyal even though he did not lack opportunities to be.
"But why should I eat a hamburger out of my house, if I have a steak in my fridge?" he used to enjoy.
In heaven, he proudly attends the meeting of his daughters with his fans on earth, something that is not so common in America.
"Of all the great roles he interpreted, he was never as proud as the one of the devoted husband, the loving father, the caring grandfather and the philanthropist," he said.
Madrid in the 2016 Olympic Games event
And yes, the dream of many of us is that Madrid can organize Olympic Games, after failure in 2012, it could happen in 2016.
But I wonder if we're ready.
If we take the example of yesterday's race, we're not!
They call it the perfect race, but I think it was the worst race I've ever had.
If they had taken into account all the errors that occurred during the race, they would have been the subject of an elimination note.
But let's look at it in detail and at the beginning.
Errors start with the withdrawal of files, which forces you to move forward.
This is not bad, but if they move you it would be better than they give you everything (including the electronic puzzle for the races).
Not at all.
They only made you go down there to take the file (first error, move only for this) and (after a long waiting file) surprised! there was only the size ' S ' for the puzzle (second error, because I need an XL size)
In what world do we live?
Is it because of the crisis that they have decided to buy more than small size bubbles with less fabric and at least less expensive?
Well, this is nothing compared to what happened on the day of the race.
Apart from the fact that you need to go there very soon to remove the electronic puzzle, the waiting file is 15 minutes and, moreover, you need to leave your bag behind at the entrance.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible as 11,000 people are expected for these races.
Since there was a long waiting file, the competitions began and we had not yet left our back bag at the entrance, although once it was done, the withdrawal was worse.
In addition, the rain accompanied the wait for more than 40 minutes during which there were riots and raids in the barracks.
I believe that about 500 people will have pneumonia tomorrow, and some people like me will not even be in the classification with the exact time, because of the pus they gave me who, I think, did not correctly mark the departure.
Of course, if they asked me to cite a perfect example of race, it would not come to my mind.
So I think we can always dream of becoming the city host for the 2016 J.O.
Microsoft is looking for a receptionist (virtual)
A new system of image recognition and human interaction was presented at the Microsoft Emerging Technologies conference, a species of artificial intelligence with little intelligence but able to perform some basic tasks, such as calling a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a shuttle to move into the company's campus) in response to what he was asked to do during a conversation.
Thanks to a camera and a system of recognition of shapes and faces, this "receptionist" can know how many people there are in place, who are - including recall what positions they occupy - and listen and hear the key words of their conversations.
But also group them by conversation groups
In the presentation video, the receptionist detects a third person, but she understands that she does not belong to the group that is talking to her and that she is not part of the company.
She asked if she was here to visit someone and she told her that she would answer in a few minutes.
All of this without a blue screen.
Impressive.
But of course this represents the future.
Now the company has other things to focus on, for example on the next version of its operating system, Windows.
This week, more than one change in Microsoft strategy was discussed.
Windows 7 will be lighter and will no longer have so many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer discovered that if computers were sold with the indispensable instead of useless applications, they would be five times faster.
This is a discovery because Microsoft, version after version, has not stopped adding functions and "extras" to Windows.
The change in strategy is welcome.
Microsoft is right, its operating system loses importance but also its software.
When Google Chrome arrived on the network, I was one of those who joined the theory that Google Chrome is the first step on Google to compete with Windows.
Several people rightly pointed out that an Internet browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary as it is the essential basis for the computer equipment and software to be understood.
It is the same as your wife or husband when you have something to say to your mother-in-law.
That's right.
It will never disappear, but it is necessary to see the "death" of the operating system not as an absolute truth but as a relative truth.
This week, Ballmer confirmed this idea.
People are less and less attentive to the operating system, but more and more to the Internet browser.
The computer is only used to turn Firefox, Browse or Chrome and every day people spend more time browsing the Internet than walking through windows.
Who use half of the applications provided with the system?
Who can do the least.
And Windows 7 will have to contain fewer applications, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, months covered, less complex.
For the moment, Microsoft is more interested in launching its own online services to finally become an alternative to Google.
They desperately need this, indeed, and I'll show you an example.
The photo in this article was taken at the beginning of this month in one of the rest rooms reserved for Microsoft employees in Redmond.
On the drink distributor, a view shows them a request to use their own search tool - "Your search. Our future".
In 2006, a study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees were using Google to search for information on the Internet.
Last week a delay occurred in the new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It will not expire at the beginning of 2009 but by the end of 2009 or see in 2010.
Microsoft will certainly try to launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
The phone, after all, looks more and more like a computer.
But the launch of Android is late and the iPhone is already on the market, it will cost them dearly.
Le Fabulux Marcel
Pablo Picasso finished his work on the Côte d'Azur, Leonardo di Caprio, carrying one in Edward Zwick ' ' s Blood Diamond, as well as Al Pacino ' s in 'Le Parrain ' de Francis Ford Coppola and is part of the holding of the Muscle Gay Association.
And if we were to list all its appearances, we could also quote this mostachu cost that raised weights in a walking circus.
It's just a simple male cotton, molaring and without sleeves.
The English call 'tank' but the Fabulous Marcel de Bruxelles stands out among all others.
First of all, by his flamboyant name - although known as 'Marcel ' - which has to do with sport, since he takes the name, according to legend, of the boxer Marcel Cerdan, a lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
Marcel is distinguished from others by his excellent cotton, his unisex cup, his distinctive logo and the little Belgian flag (unrecognizable) that the most well-known body mallows have in the tail.
But be careful, because the Belgian brand only produces top tanks.
But it also produces sweat-shirts, retro boxers, cashmere cardigans, cotton pants, babies, mini-shorts...
Clothing designed for the comfort of underwear.
Even if it's bad to wear them only as underwear.
They have too much charm.
"I want to be a young mother; the candidate doesn't worry about me"
His enormous resemblance to his sister did not prevent him from developing his own personality.
Monica Cruz is small but full of vitality.
Today, the sisters of Cruz take their new activity very seriously in fashion.
According to Monica, they are only beautiful and famous girls who lend their name.
She was present for the promotion that the Mango brand made in Paris at its new social seat, but also for the presentation of the most important prices of the fashion that the Spanish home sponsors.
Monica is hot and shy.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I have come to present the new collection that my sister Penelope and I myself have created for Mango for the new autumn and winter season, but also to attend the presentation of the second edition of the Mango Fashion Awards and the dinner of the Opera in the honour of Valentino.
A very intense day, but, at the same time, exciting, awaits us.
On what basis is your new collection created for Mango for this fourth season?
The film of the 1950s and the 60s enthralls us and inspires us a lot for our collections.
I love to dance in town and observe women to see how they are dressed, how they combine their clothes, I often do so.
Dancer, actress and designer, you're a very polyvalent woman, aren't you?
I believe that yes, but at the end of the day everything comes together and these activities have a lot in common.
Since I was little, I liked the clothes; I'd like to go to my grandmother's house to look into my aunt's arms and see her clothes.
It was great, almost better than going to the attraction park.
Then, when I became a dancer, I was always trying to take care of my clothes.
Dancers love to dress well for courses and tests, to look in the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of actress, when you wear clothes it's at this time that you really put yourself in the skin of the character.
All of a sudden, it's all connected.
You haven't been there for 30 years. Has that been hard for you?
Not at all.
I feel better than ever, my 30s are happy.
I find that the woman is more mature, has more experience and enjoy life with less problems.
The biological clock doesn't scare me.
I've done all the things I've wanted to do since I was little, and this has given me a lot of inner happiness.
So you think you're going to be a mom?
Of course, I want to be a mother because my body asks me to be a young mother, and I also want to be a young mother; I don't want to lose that.
As for the candidate, I'm not worried.
What I'm going to do is give my son a lot of happiness and raise him with a lot of love.
Come on to the movie, you're waiting for the different movies you've been playing last year to come out.
It's true, I'm afraid they're coming out.
I who am a woman from the theatre, I am very impatient and worried, I would like everything now but of course it is not possible.
I'm hoping to get the films 'The Last Hour' and 'In search of the tomb of Christ'.
Let's see what you're gonna think...
A few days ago, you started on the pass with Naomi Campbell, didn't you?
Don't say that!
I'm not up on the passageway to make the mannequin.
Just because Naomi Campbell called me, I have known her for some time, to invite me to participate in a charity show in London for her association in support of women and the clothes we showed - I showed two clothes from our collection created for Mango - were sold to auctions to collect money for Naomi's NGO.
The people that Naomi is a tender person.
They say so many things about her, I know her, many things aren't true.
Besides, I'm so fascinated by Naomi's good side.
She asked me to show up for such a noble cause, but if she had asked me to make the pier, I would have done it anyway.
The important thing is to make life better for the women of the third world.
Residues of alcohol on the wheel will need to install the 'alcohol' system
The Minister of the Interior wants the driver who has had more than three administrative sanctions for alcohol, to install a system in his vehicle that prevents the vehicle from starting at work, or if it does not suffer.
The initiative has already been announced in June and now appears in the report of the Minister of State in which this initiative is considered a pilot project that will last a year.
Its purpose is to reintegrate the driver by offering him road re-education courses.
The Minister of State responsible for road safety, but also the Directorate-General for Road Safety and the Institute of Technology for Auto Safety, will participate in this initiative.
According to the statistics, between 30% and 75% of motorists arrested for driving more than once in work, the car recovers.
The alcohol would avoid this because it is a vehicle-related system that measures the alcohol rate in the wool and prevents the vehicle from starting if the driver does not breathe before; or when the driver's alcohol rate is higher than the authorized one.
Its cost is more than EUR 1,000 and is in charge of the driver.
In this respect, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with this device were reducing up to 65% of infringements during the first year of installation.
And in Spain it is estimated that this could save 115 people every year.
This measure only applies to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to deal with these behaviours before they become criminal offences.
And to facilitate its implementation, as legal reform can be done on a regular basis, but the reform made by criminal ways requires a reform of the organic law.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial form, although some industrial and functional vehicles already have an experimental one.
Just tomorrow, the Congress of Members will vote on an initiative by the Spanish Socialist Party that proposes to install this system in school buses as it was done in France.
In Mexico without 'peep-toes'
At 5:40 p.m., the Spanish air force aircraft in which the Asturias Princes were travelling landed in the Presidential Hangar of the Benito Juárez Airport of Mexico DF.
The sun was on the alert to sleep, but his rays were still forced to put the hand in the visage to see the royal couple down from the plane.
At the foot of the staircase, the Spanish ambassador and other authorities were present.
A few hours earlier, I had asked in the street, the taxi driver, if it was aware that the Spanish Princes were visiting the city to complete their official trip.
- Oh, very well, you're not gonna be able to go to the airport to get customers at this time... are you here or then...?
- No, sir, I'm Spanish, but I've lived here thinking for two years.
- Oh, very well...
But the Mexican press knows very well who the Asturias Princes are and knows the importance of the trip.
They are several waiting in the airport hangar near the red carpet and a military range of 27 Marine soldiers.
The Prince is smiling and dressed in marine blue, the Princess, when she has her hair in the wind, is very well dressed and does not wear her usual 'peep-toes'; perhaps they had told her that a storm threatened her.
They make a brief stop to photographers before going to the room where the official court is waiting for them.
At the door of the hotel where they live, one of the four largest hotels in the city, a regular journalist of Mexican television awaits them.
The most prestigious price of fashion
There is certainly no more suitable place in the world to present a fashion price than Paris and there is certainly no designer who lives more wonderfully and lives well than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of the Mango Fashion Awards, to strengthen the international image of the new fashion talents.
The winner will be rewarded at a price of EUR 300,000.
Hir Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at his models in Mango's window at the 54th Boulevard Haussmann in Paris and she almost cried for it.
Of course it is the second largest brand in Europe that has just been opened with 1,335 square meters of surface.
The first store is in London.
The events, as well as the desire to thank the stylisticist Valentino, president of the competition board, made us find ourselves in a luxurious dinner at the Garnier opera in Paris.
With a table next to the extraordinary Chagals family, the presidential table prepared by Mango seemed even more spectacular.
Having grown up in the heart and making a good heart against bad fortune, due to the recent death of his brother, Nati put on a mango garment and some ELAH pairs, which cut the breath, and arms on it, arms down with his son Luis - a beautiful man almost two meters high – she accompanied Valentino to his dinner prepared in his honor.
Andik, the owner of Mango, a gallant man, as well as Baron de Rotchil, finished the undressed evening because they had lent them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who presented herself to the store with a pants and a shirt – from her own collection – and who for dinner was metamorphosed by wearing a long sexy and black dress, was excited when during the night visit of the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us the ball's dining room and recalling the good old time, she caught up with one of the bars and she made the gesture of a big fold.
Inés Sastre did not remain for the visit of the palace's dependencies, but she showed us first on her mobile phone photos of her son.
The next morning, we had the pleasure of seeing Olivier Martínez – another beautiful man who moved on a motorcycle – and John Travolta, who arrived at the intercontinental hotel in Paris, with his drawers, his towels and having asked the front desk, that there were no smells in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh there, that's life.
1001, the number of stress
There are only 1000 but 1001 ways to forget the chaos and frenzy of daily life.
And to crown everything, they are all listed in a book that will bring relief to the librarians on September 30th.
The morning wake almost attracts us when it sounds every morning at 7 a.m., but it's even worse when we think about the pace of activity that imposes on us the present life.
The office is synonymous with tension and the computer of back pain.
The stress represents the evil of the 20th century.
But there are neither two methods to combat daily fatigue and problems related to the world of work.
But it's 1001, not one more or one less.
Apart from yoga positions, classical massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott gathers in the pages of a book all a 'menu' of methods adapted to taste and time of each.
The anti-trafficking work is entitled ' 1001 ways to relax ' and will come to the libraries directly from the editor Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If anyone believes that it is impossible to gain peace in relationships such as work or through personal relationships, this 'manual' is demeaning such a belief.
In addition, this manual offers other methods such as contact with nature or natural revenues that help you relax.
If adrenaline does not cut into your veins to restore your body balance and if stress has become a problem, it is time to sit in the couch, disconnect from your mind and concentrate on reading.
Talking and sleeping
Some kids talk during the night.
I do not report to those who wake up very waking up by telling us something that happened the day before, but to the children who talk during their sleep.
The first time that this happens can surprise you, but actually it doesn't matter.
It's a welcome change in sleep called sleepiness.
This is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
Of course there's more than one who talks during the night.
This phenomenon may appear very sporadic (once in life, for example, associated with a severe fever episode), or more periodic (every day, once a week, once a month...), the day after the child is no longer remembered.
There is no single cause that determines its appearance
They are often linked to other sleep disturbances such as nightmares, night terrors, night eneresis (infant pipe to bed), or somnambulism, but this is not always the case.
As we have already said, they can also be associated with very strong fevers, stress or over-excitement situations.
Anyway, it's a little studied phenomenon.
The intensity with which it occurs is also very variable.
He may speak with a quiet little voice, with isolated words, murmurings or, on the other hand, with screams, tears, long speeches ...
If sleepiness becomes very common, it would be wise to observe the child and consult a specialist to check if there is a problem that causes much anxiety and to get an explanation for the problem.
We said that it is a welcome alteration, so there is no treatment, except if it is related to another alteration in sleep that can be cared for (e.g. if it is related to sleep apnea or stress).
What can be done is to take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite the child before going to sleep.
Therefore, find quiet games and avoid TV programs or series that are more or less violent.
With very nervous children who have the pain of relaxing, relaxation techniques can be used to help them calm themselves internally.
This will allow the child to have a more peaceful sleep.
As soon as the dreams appear, try to stay calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the next day he will not remember more than what happened.
Useful tips
Don't wake him up.
It's useless because he's unconscious and you'll wake him up.
Even if he speaks, he sleeps and rests.
Remember that if you show a lot of anxiety, you are advised to consult a doctor or check what causes so much anxiety in the child.
If you understand what he says (which is not usual), do not have the temptation to question him for information.
You won't get anything, because you're sleeping, he's not conscious to be able to organize his mind.
Moreover, you will hear what he says, but you will not know what he is dreaming about, from the moment you pay attention to how you interpret the information and the conclusions you draw.
Never tell the child that you can question him during the night to know his secrets.
It's not even fun.
This causes a lot of anxiety.
In conclusion, don't worry, it's nothing bad, it's an episode that only takes a few minutes.
Illumination... finally
Illhaeusern finally found the way of victory on his field after a long period of dissertation.
Without making a big match, the Young and Blacks have created the largest number of opportunities and have succeeded in transforming one for the win of the game.
The rhythm was not very supportive during this meeting where attackers were ill to express themselves.
After a first attempt by the Captain Kaufmann who was blowing the candle on a remote shot, Illhaeusern was going to take the climber and turn the Fonderflick away, then with Hirn above, Roman on the foot or Diebold came to the defense of Dannemarie.
In front, we were stuck in the middle of the ground and left the Riahi hostage at the point of the attack.
The beginning of the second half time would be decisive with the first two times signed by Riahi and Temporale for Denmark, and immediately after the opening of the score for the Illouisians by Marais, well positioned to resume a restful dance on a first attempt by Diebold (53e').
But the Illouisiens bouter will not be able to enjoy his happiness for a long time and will be forced to get the clothes back a dozen minutes later and leave his teammates in digital inferiority.
But Dannemarie won't be able to take advantage of it and will not put big problems on an Illhousian Eleven who just withdrew a little to "compact" his defense, except in the last seconds of the game where, after a big blackout, the ball passed very close to the transversal.
Sarkozy at the meeting of the angry fishermen
Before he leaves for the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will take a tour of Britain.
In view of the demonstration of the strength of the fishermen who had seriously disturbed the access of several British and Nordic ports on Monday, the President of the Republic decided to return to the port of Guilvinec, in the Finistère, on Tuesday morning to meet with their representatives.
The latter promised to welcome him "in a constructive spirit" and hope that he will "come with concrete proposals".
A presidential visit at the same time as a general meeting of the "crisis committee" established by Breton fishermen to obtain measures against the fluctuation of gas oil prices, which reached a record of more than EUR 1.14 per litre.
According to Elysée David Martinon's spokesman, the president will "determine with them solutions that can be imagined to help their businesses find their competitiveness and to secure the conditions of employment and remuneration for the marines".
Nicolas Sarkozy is expected to stand firm by fishermen.
On Tuesday morning, they carried out scaffolded operations in Morbihan and Calvados, which resulted in holes close to 10 km.
Quiberon's pleasure port was also blocked, but links to Belle-Île were not stopped.
A filter bar was run on the island of Quiberon.
The marines have already shown their determination on Monday by burning tires and pallets in front of the fuel deposits of the ports of Brest, and Lorient, while demonstrations took place in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports of the Atlantic and Manche façade, such as the Sables of Olonne, in Vendée, where the slaughterhouses remained on track, or in Havre, where twenty vessels blocked the movements of commercial ships.
The fishermen of La Turballe and the Croisic, in Loire-Atlantic, stopped in the evening the block of the important Total Donges refinery.
Those from Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait for the Wednesday meeting in the department to decide on any action.
In Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" has to decide on Tuesdays to give the movement and its participation in the slowdown planned for the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by officers of the National Fisheries Committee, who did not support their movement.
"The strike will continue" because "fishers will not miss anything" and "don't want to move to Paris," said Liliane Cariou, president of the Lorecent Fisheries Committee.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay taxes on the gazellel, are currently paying about 50 cents per litre, but they believe that the cost threshold of a boat is only reached with a gazell less than EUR 0,30 per litre.
Paul Newman is beautiful
The unforgivable interpreter of "Bitch Cassidy and Kid" died from cancer at the age of 83 in his home of Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford, and Sam Mendes welcomed the legend of the film and the committed actor, Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains his delivery forecast in 2008
The Brazilian aircraft table on 215 aircraft delivered this year despite the threats of recession that are taking place on the world economy.
The fourth global aircraft manufacturer, Embraer, maintains its delivery forecasts for 2008 with 215 delivered devices, said Fredrico Fleury Curado, its president.
In the first half, the aircraft delivered 97 planes.
The Brazilian manufacturer looks forward to the Chinese market, particularly for its aircraft from 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer delivered 41 devices to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would consider giving more than 15% of its assets
The American International Group, which the U.S. Monetary Authorities have broken down, plans to allocate more than 15% of its assets to repay the 85 billion dollars that were advanced to it, according to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times.
AIG is ready to study the sale of most of its activities beyond its international life insurance and its retired activity in the United States, states the newspaper that mentions sources close to the file.
The Board of Directors of the AIG met on Sunday evening to consider possible transfers, according to the FT.
No confirmation was obtained from AIG.
The assets that AIG intends to separate include its International Lease Financial Corp., its share of 59% in Transatlantic Holdings reinsurance and its real estate portfolio and its investments in private equity, adds the FT.
No final decision has been taken on these transfers, continues the FT.
AIG must quickly realise liquidity to repay the loan of 85 billion that the Federal Reserve has allowed it to see US authorities taking 80% of its capital, diluting current shareholders from two proportions.
Analysis Paris History of the meeting Morning Meeting History Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange charged a historic drop on Monday after the release by the Paulson Bank Rescue Plan House: Dow Jones lost 6.98%, or a never-showing loss of 800 points, and Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) dropped from 777.68 points to 1O.365.45 points.
In terms of points, the strongest fall in its history (684.81 points) had previously been recorded on 17 September 2001, the day of the resumption of the trade after the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
The Nasdaq index, which is technologically dominant, has increased to 1,983,73 and the standard & Poor's 500 8.81% (i.e. 106.85 points), to 1,106.55 points, according to the final closing figures.
Already depressed at the beginning of the meeting, Wall Street drowned after the rejection by the House of Banks' rescue plan representatives that had to allow for some market stability.
By 228 votes to 205, the representatives rejected the Secretary's request for funds in the Treasury Henry Paulson.
Nearly two Republicans on three rejected his plan.
"It is a bad signal sent to the market, which sees Congress unable to adopt a plan," said Lindsey Piegza, of the Financial FTN.
"This shows the extent to which the market was in this regard," she added, fearing that a project adopted in several days would not "be too late".
"If the project is actually dying (...) then the relay will be passed quickly to the Fed (the American Central Bank, etcr) and to other central banks to manage the crisis, which would increase the credit conditions," said Brian Bethune, a head of economy at Global Insight.
And stressing more the sense of urgency, "every day that comes to a financial institution" in the United States, Ms. Piegza stressed.
After the failure of Washington Mutual on Friday, the authorities organized the purchase of Wachovia's banking activities by its Citigroup rival.
In Europe, the crisis has rapidly accelerated, leading to emergency interventions for banks in the United Kingdom, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, and sign that markets face "not only an American crisis, but a global crisis", the FTN Financial analyst added.
The bonding market has been very high.
The 10-year Treasury's return to 3,632 per cent, compared to 3,827 per cent on Friday night, and the 30-year-old to 4,161 per cent, compared to 4,357 per cent on the watch.
Obama, winner at the points of the first television show
In the first Friday debate between the two candidates at the White House, another one happened to know who, from John McCain or Barack Obama, took it.
No surprise, Republican and Democratic campaign QG announced their own victory in this television duel that would have been followed by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain's performance, although honorable, was not "bright enough" to allow him to record his downfall in the five-week presidential polls.
The Gallup Institute, whose opinion survey was published on Saturday, gives a five-point advance to Obama (49 per cent versus 44 per cent to McCain), considers that it was the democrat who pulled his fist out of the game.
Among the indecisive voters, who count, Obama won 39% of the polls, while 25% of them won McCain, according to a CBS poll.
Obama should be able to confirm his progress on Thursday with the expected good performance of his colliery, Joseph Biden, during the first and only public debate with his rival, Sarah Palin.
"It would be a mistake to underestimate her.
She's got good instincts," said Bill Clinton this weekend.
The seven-year-old McCain has not ceased to put forward his indisputable experience in foreign policy, while stressing the "Naïvety" of his opponent on these issues that were at the heart of this first face-to-face.
"Sentor Obama doesn't seem to understand that..." he accused him of several times.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge needed to be president," he said.
A hammered attack angle since yesterday in the Republican TV advertisements.
Obama, he, stressed that he represented the future.
Without being disassembled, he became clear and precise.
He has put forward his ability to make good decisions, and to restore the image of the United States in the world.
"McCain has still not understood, while Obama, yes," said, this weekend, a democratic spot reproaching the Republican for not taking all the measure of the impact of the crisis on the "American Street".
"For the four and twenty-ten minutes of debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you, he denounced Obama yesterday, before 20,000 people assembled for an election meeting in North Carolina under a rainstorm.
He did not even pronounce the words "average class" or "workers." The financial passage clearly benefits Obama, who is considered by the Americans as the most likely to save the economy on the edge of the precipice.
"The next week could be a decisive turnout," he estimated yesterday, the influential democratic senator Charles Schumer.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, an elder of the Clinton administration, compared Obama's "good economic instincts" to Bill Clinton's during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the democratic candidate, the current debate "is the final verdict of eight years of a bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain".
Reaffirming that it would still be possible to reduce taxes of 95 per cent of Americans despite Wall Street's bribes, the Illinois Senator also indicated that the country's possible energy independence through the promotion of renewable energy was its first priority, with the establishment of a health insurance system.
McCain, he, wanted to build a park of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
Prudens, the two candidates failed to address the financial saving issues of $700 billion (470 billion) adopted yesterday by Congress and extremely unpopular.
In Minsk, "Did you notice there was an election, you?"
Young people and opponents showed up on Sunday night at the main location of Belarus's capital to advance the results of the legislation.
A few hundred of Belarus gathered on Sunday evening at the closing of the polling offices in central Minsk to protest against the fraudulent nature of the legislation.
While no results had yet been announced, many young people had come to protest against President Alexandre Loukachenko's power: "the dictator, resignation".
Some admit not even to vote: "How good, because they will do what they want from my voice," says a young man.
They do not believe that the regime that has done good is for foreign observers in order to regain language with the European Union or be ready to make a democratic turn.
The sanctions, including the prohibition of visas for 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections were considered by observers.
They haven't been there since the opposition.
"We have been held apart from the electoral commissions and our observers have not been able to participate in the delay," said Jouri Potemkine, the spokesperson of the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous group of twelve parties.
"It is a cosmetic change, notes Alexandre Milinkievitch, former opposition candidate to the 2006 presidential and leader of the pro-European movement, because it is important that it counts the votes, and in us, it is the executive power.
If members of the opposition enter Parliament, they will be appointed, not elected.
But their entry into Parliament may mean television space, meetings in the regions and legislative proposals."
The opposition must therefore enter the political game because "the dialogue with the European Union must begin.
Because if our economy, which is heavily dependent on Russia, is in crisis, and we do not reform ourselves, we are at risk of becoming a Russian protector.
But we want to be independent."
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has followed the electoral process, does not recognize the validity of the vote.
She stressed that the participation figures were too high, and that the generalization of the vote by advance (26%) of the voters in Minsk) had opened the voice to all manipulations.
"You noticed that there was an election, did you? question the social-democratic leader Alexandre Kozuulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August of this year.
There was no one in the polling offices.
And there will be at least five Members of the opposition to Parliament, those who agree best to power."
The silence of the night falls back on October.
On television, President Loukachenko and members of the Central Electoral Commission welcomed their success.
Interview - From Safely Revengeed Blood
Hema-Québec celebrated yesterday the 10th anniversary of its foundation, and its president, Dr. Francine Decary, had reason to rejoice because Hema-Québec has become one of the most secure and effective blood suppliers in the world.
And above all, he gained confidence in the public who had been seriously shaken by the scandal of blood contaminated in the 1980s and 1990s.
As we know, national blood reserves managed by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Service have been contaminated by the acquired immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In February 1994, the Government of Canada launched a public investigation, chaired by Judge Horace Krever, to shed light on the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to make recommendations so that such a disaster would no longer be repeated.
While Judge Krever was delaying his report, some provinces had then set up a committee aimed at planning a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee fulfilled this mandate.
Following the reports of Gélineau and Krever, two suppliers were established in Canada: Hema-Québec to serve Quebec and the Canadian Blood Society to provide all other provinces and territories.
"In 1998, when Hema-Québec began its activities, only 38 per cent of the people still had confidence in the blood system in Quebec, Dr. Decary recalled.
The situation was discouraging.
With efforts to improve the safety of blood products and work on the ground during the years that followed, we regained the public confidence," she said before she said she was proud that in early 2008, almost 94% of the people of Quebec now had confidence in Hema-Québec.
Dr. Decary, however, maintains that "trust is something extremely fragile."
On 28 September 1998, Hema-Québec applied the precautionary principle.
At that time, many cases of the human form of the disease of the mad cow, a new variant of the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, were seen in Europe.
"And we didn't know at all if this disease could be transmitted by blood.
It was then based on one of the main recommendations of Krever and Gelineau's reports, which, when unknown and that a serious disease can result, the Creutzfeldt-Jakob's disease, which is characterized by a degeneration of the brain that inevitably leads to death, includes exclusion measures.
Thus, in April 1999, the blood of persons who had been in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980 was refused.
But a few years ago, it was no doubt shown that this disease is transmitted by blood.
This episode thus showed us that the precautionary principle applied had meaning."
In 1999 a much more sensitive HIV testing technique appeared on the market: nuclear acid (TAN) tests that directly detect in donor blood the presence of the virus itself, not the anti-virus antibodies, on which the tests were used until then.
The TANs have allowed the period of mutagenicity, which extends between the time the person was infected and the time the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our technicians, explains the specialist.
This period was reduced to less than one week.
This has significantly reduced the risk of some donors being infected without knowledge and cannot be detected.
These improvements have led to a significant reduction in the risk of contracting AIDS through a blood transfusion.
Today, a person of 12 million is at risk of receiving HIV-contaminated blood.
"In other words, this means that 12 million blood products will have to be distributed before someone is infected with HIV.
As Hema-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood products each year, it will take more than 24 years before a case of transmission of HIV by a blood product occurs.
I believe that today we can feel comfortable receiving or prescribing a blood transfusion to recover health," says Hema-Quebec's head of management.
"Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
We never know which pathogen is going to emerge in the system.
Not later than last year the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of the Meeting, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted by an insect in the blood.
Hema-Quebec must also provide adequate supplies before it is emphasized that, in addition to a security supply, hema-Quebec must be constantly vigilant."
"The needs are increasing because the population is getting older.
As anticancer treatments are more aggressive, patients often need a recharge in red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also has consequences on the network of blood donors, which has an average of only 3% of Quebecers eligible for blood donation."
However, every healthy person, aged 18 and over who meets the eligibility criteria, can give blood every 56 days, or six times a year.
On average, 14 per cent of those who offer their blood are not accepted because they are affected by AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have been travelling in a country where malaria occurs, they will be excluded for a period of one year.
"With these 3%, we can maintain an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals.
Poverty is very rare.
But there is a need to renew the members of this network of donors as they grow older and can no longer give their blood.
But it is difficult to convince people to give their blood, but especially to hold them back and to encourage them to become regular donors.
Today's life is so frowned upon, we rarely find time to spend an hour to give her blood," says Francine Decary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Hema-Québec provides not only blood products but also human tissues, including bone grafts, heart valves, eyeballs and skin that are almost exclusively used for large burns.
These fabrics are analyzed, processed and frozen before being stored at Hema-Québec, which also manages the only public blood bank in Quebec.
The umbilical cord that was already considered a biomedical waste is a blood rich in stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
"We celebrated, a few weeks ago, the launch of our thousand sample of cordon blood and is expected to take more than a thousand per year.
It should be started to be proposed for scratches at the beginning of next year," says Dr. Decary, who describes this blood supply program as very popular.
"Several mothers are disappointed that they can't have access there," because Hema-Québec has no way to propose this complex and expensive program in all Québec hospitals.
Soccer - The Mid-End Impact
The impact of Montreal was qualified for the semi-final round of the final series of the first division of the USL, thanks to a victory of 3-1 (4-3 in total targets) at the Suunders de Seattle, yesterday, during the second and final match of the fourth series of goals at the Saputo Stadium.
Antonio Ribeiro's field environment marked the decisive goal at the 90th minute of the game.
After a first half with no purpose on either side as on the other side, the David Testo and Rocco Plancentino field environment marked the other lines of montalais training.
Roger Levesque was the only one to enjoy Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
Let us remember that during the first round of the return series, Friday, the Impact had suffered a 2-1 defeat at the Starfire Complex, in Tukwila, at Seattle.
The impact will be measured at the Vancouver White Caps in half-final.
On Saturday night in Minnesota, Thunder completed a 3-1 deficit in the return match to bring it back 4-3, but the Whitecaps also joined the semi-final round 5-4 in total goals.
The Impact should address the Whitecaps Friday and Sunday, but the details of the series will be confirmed today.
In short - Winning Bull of Kovalev
The trio number one from Canada is ready to start the season.
Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostsyn, the unit, has launched the attack in a 3-2 Canadian victory against the Florida Panthers, last night, at the Bell Centre.
Kostitsyn, the first star of the meeting, marked a goal, Plekanec took two aids, and Kovalev picked up a pass in this win, the fourth of the Tricolour in six preparatory games.
Kovalev won the victory by marking the only goal of the shooting.
"I'm not ready yet, I've warned the Russians.
I need another match to feel comfortable."
"He tried too much to do in the first period," noted Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he appreciated the end of the game.
He had a good ovation."
Charest on the North
The Prime Minister does not exclude the holding of elections before the end of the year
In place of the general council of the Liberal Party, Jean-Talon, in Quebec, where the new Minister of Health Yves Bolduc (left) tried to elect on the occasion of today's partial election.
"Refine the limits of our last large northern border": such is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented with visual strength while remaining in the broad lines, at the end of the general council of the Liberal Party of Quebec, Lévis, yesterday.
Behind him, during his speech, was designed a kind of Moulin with images.
On three huge screens, there were spectacular hydroelectric dams, mining, Québec-based maps, and so on.
Large means, as in an election period.
On the other hand, the Prime Minister refused to exclude him from the elections this fall, even though he noted that his schedule was very busy.
The "Northern Plan" is the fourth bread of a "vision" that the Prime Minister claims to have for Quebec, the one of a "new economic space", which includes an agreement on labour with France, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario.
Often mentioned in the Prime Minister's recent speeches, the opening of the North - the northern territory at the 49th parallel - had never been the subject of a presentation.
However, the Prime Minister was reluctant to explain why the North was "a jewel to the immense potential", but did not give up, investment amounts, or specific priority in future projects.
At least a few avenues of what could be further developed: in particular hydroelectricity, forest, but especially mining, doubled by the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
The North contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamonds", according to Mr. Charest's enumeration.
This "territory twice as large as France", "is home to us, it is in Quebec.
Not only is it in us, but it is in us," he insisted, as well as showing that he was seeking a national founding myth.
Québec has built much in its relationship with the North, has it emphasized: the road towards gold in Abitib, the Québec engineering, the Bay James.
"It's for us, it's our future," he added, after having taken a theatrical break to contemplate the immense map behind him.
The North, 70% of Quebec's territory, includes a portion of the Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, the Prime Minister stated in the press.
"It is a traditional position that all governments have reiterated.
There is a border line on which there has been no agreement for a long time and, when the opportunity arises, I repeat that position on behalf of the government," he said.
In addition, "with climate change, we need to rethink our vision of the North," he said, speaking of the North-West crossing, which will be opened all year round because of the source of the ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the prime minister believes the occupation of the territory is a duty.
What about the inhabitants of the territory, the First Nations and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Government of Quebec would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, particularly young people.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourau (former Pakistani member of Hungary), have already started consultations with about thirty communities.
An inter-ministerial committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) had an important job started.
The Prime Minister does not exclude a large meeting, "not necessarily a summit", but a moment when "a common vision will be given".
The development of the North would also be in line with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be "concerned, ordered and respected by the environment", he promised.
Jean Charest described this vision as continuing with that of the former Liberal Prime Minister.
"As the Liberals that have preceded us, we have thought otherwise of transforming challenges into new opportunities for growth and development."
This was also one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which began on Friday by a large cocktail to highlight the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's arrival at the party's head.
One of the resolutions that were adopted proposed was the reappointment of the Beauharnois Central in Barrage Adélard-Godbout.
"From Godbout, who created Hydro-Quebec, to Lesage who made the Pacific Revolution and the nationalization of hydroelectricity, to Burassa who made Baie James, our party had to force the future," said Jean Charest.
In the press, he called for another reference, which preserves that, the program "Roads to the North" by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
In addressing the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydro-electric barrier project, Mr. Charest stressed that his deployment was planned for 2012.
"It's still between us, but I'm going to be there," he entrusted his militants to them with nourishing applause.
In fact, the Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no election in 2008 and certainly not in 2009, did not fail to trigger a vote this fall, as the law permits.
He stressed, however, that his timetable was met, particularly by a federal council mission in China and a Québec-New York summit.
The General Council at the end of the week provided the Liberal leader with a platform containing nationalist resolutions, including "constitutional aspirations" that were passed as a letter to the post: PLQ in particular calls for recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution.
He also wanted Quebec to appoint members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council and to have a veto on the decisions taken in Quebec.
On the side of the opposition, the main lines of the North Plan were welcomed with skepticism.
The Pequist leader, Pauline Marois, highlighted the development policy of North Quebec that the Landry government had launched in 2001.
According to it, the liberal government, reaching power in 2003, refused to apply it.
If he had done so, "we would have made more progress today," said Ms. Marois next to her candidate in Jean-Talon (scrutin that is taking place today), Françoise Mercure.
ADQ said to support the adoption of a North Plan by the government.
"But what we want is that it's not just a show," said leader Sébastien Proulx, instead of Mario Dumont, who is back on vacation today.
Letters - A Dishonored Country
It was Mr. Vic Toews, former Minister of Justice (or irony) in Harper's office, who was allowed last summer to say of Louise Arbour that she was a "hunt" for Canada.
This is how to challenge this woman who has fought an incessant fight for justice and who deserves all our admiration as long as the Prime Minister is surrounded by Stephen Harper himself.
We are here in front of a government that is the only one, among all the Western countries involved, not to have repatriated its resident in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
A government that takes no note of the fact that Omar Khadr was a young teenager at the time of the facts that were brought to his attention.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, renegotiates its word and leaves a child soldier under inhuman conditions.
The only one who refers to a parody of justice to assess the defendant's guilt.
Recall that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association, including Omar Khadr's repatriation, are being launched to receive an equitable trial in Canada.
It is this same government that closes its eyes on torture: it does not care that a young adult is now mentally destroyed, no doubt ever after so many years of exaction.
We do not realize it yet, but we are now seeing an insidious erosion of our rights, our freedom and our "democracy", this word that Harper ceases to burn and that sounds so loud in his mouth.
Here comes the time when no morals exist: one can abuse, torture, arbitrarily imprison a Canadian citizen according to the good will of a government leader to this minority (which will be after 14 October...).
Many voters believe that they will find salvation in a party that advocates the Vertu, the Law and the Order: they do not see that this government has renounced what was doing the reputation and dignity of our country.
The shame, Mr. Toews, is here, in this resignation, and not elsewhere.
Free Opinion - Barrick Gold's Orwellin discourses
In its issue of 17 September, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, Vice-President of the Canadian Mining Barrick Gold.
In pursuit of an Orwellian logic, it states that the world's largest aurifer company has attempted to continue spreading six million against three authors and a small unsolicited publishing house in order to launch a "transparent public debate".
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth that they judge, especially in the case of prosecutions for defamation, but the law.
No surprise, this fundamental difference is completely hidden by Mr. Garver.
Because, for Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate would be to lead to the ruin of anyone or to support a position contrary to hers?
No matter the outcome of the trial, the authors and editor of the book Black Canada will have to spend considerable amounts to prepare their defenses and fight, with very uneven weapons, against an army of lawyers supported by the pockets almost without the bottom of the mine.
In these unequal struggles, however, the tactics are often used to ruin the defenders in order to impose a settlement on the friendly who will baillonder the opposition, in addition to excruciating anyone who dares to rethink the issue.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it was in the public opinion that she should have presented her vision of facts.
Contrary to what is done in many countries where Barrick Gold is working, discussions in Canada are usually conducted by the exchange of ideas and not at the same time.
It was therefore sufficient for the mine to open its books, records and establish a real debate through the newspapers, the media, the publications and the funding of independent research teams that could have shed light on the issue.
But Barrick Gold seems not to trust the public opinion and rejects the petition and letter of support to the authors of Black Canada.
Perhaps Mr. Garver could explain how he can both ask for a "public" debate while ignoring the opinions of the same public?
In the Vice-President's world, it seems that this word refers only to the lawyers who are paid a lot rather than all of the Canadians; this is a rather narrow view of the concept.
In democracy, even detractors have the right to speak.
What you don't understand - or you don't want to understand - Barrick Gold, is that the audience that supports the authors and publishers of Black Canada does it first because it rejects the brutal way of the mine.
This audience is ready to hear Barrick and judge, but on the basis of civilized exchange of arguments, and not as a result of what many perceive as a continuation of the "public debate", Barrick Gold has, moreover, lodged a stay at the site of Black Canada's authors urging them to stop using this term....
In addition to Mr. Garver's surreal speech, the pursuit of Barrick Gold is a direct attack on university freedom and the quest for truth, essential to any democratic society.
It rejects the right to quote credible sources and to debate facts and interpretations, which represent the very basis for intellectual work.
If it is impossible to study and discuss topics that are moving to the rich businesses of this world in a country like Canada, under repetitive persecution, who will be able to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could do so in accordance with the scientific standards used by the Black Canada authors.
She has a right to reply.
The university environment we belong to has long been able to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold's tireless pursuit clearly shows that, contrary to what she claims, she has no desire for a transparent debate.
It is a loss for the university world, as well as for the public debate in Canada, and it is time that governments put in place devices that limit such abuses.
Wall Street Rescue Operation - Democrats and Republicans understand
The Bush administration and the Congress's leaders, both Republicans and Democrats, have finally reached an agreement yesterday on the largest economic rescue plan since the Great Depression in the 1930s.
The new version of the US $700 billion plan to halt the financial crisis that has been depleting Wall Street for months is still to be introduced by the two Congress Chambers.
It includes: a better control by the electors of its implementation, new mechanisms to ensure the reimbursement of the public money committed, new provisions to contain the number of houses seized for default of payment, and a right to look at the salaries paid to the managers of the securitised companies.
The US Secretary to the Treasury, Henry Paulson, President of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, and the Republican representative at the negotiating table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes after midnight, yesterday, at the end of a two-day negotiation marathon.
"We have made great progress towards an agreement that will be effective in the markets," said the representative of the Bush administration, Henry Paulson.
"Everything has been done to open up the real economy and ordinary Americans of the current crisis at Wall Street," the Democrat explained.
"This is the fundamental point: if we do not do so, trauma, chaos and disturbances on the daily lives of Americans will be immense," said Republican Judd Gregg.
The negotiations had turned to sprint in the last few hours, fearing the effect that would lead to a new failure on investors' mood.
The deadline that had been granted was the opening of the markets this morning.
In late negotiations, the two candidates for the US presidential election proved rather favourable to the agreement, but did not fail to express their discontent that they were forced to reach this end.
The Democratic Senator Barack Obama has been awarded the addition of certain provisions to the agreement, including to allow owners to keep their home and the salary of the heads of state-resourced companies.
"When taxpayers are asked to take special measures because of the irresponsibleness of some, there is nothing to congratulate.
But these measures are necessary," he commented on the waves of American television.
Interviewed on another channel to find out if he would vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent, John McCain, said, "I would like to see the details, but I hope so."
"The great lines that I have read [show] that this is something we are all going to have to digest and with which we are going to be able to move forward.
The option to do nothing is simply not acceptable," he said.
The 700 billion plan aims to purchase, with taxpayers' money, the suspicious, risky and inventible loans from US financial institutions.
It comes after 14 months of a crisis triggered by the emergence of a real estate bubble that first led to the collapse of risk mortgages (substances) before extending to other broader forms of credit securities (CCAA) and triggering a liquidity freeze and the disbanding of banks and financial institutions.
It was a group of Republican electors who had headed the first draft agreement last week.
It is believed that this impasse has been removed since the democrats agreed that some "toxic" assets of the firms in difficulty are secured only by the government, rather than purchased.
In order to round the angles for everyone in Congress, a provision has also been made that if the government had to make losses for five years with this programme, it could set up new taxes to help it recover.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first instalment of 250 billion to which 100 other billion can be added if the President deems it necessary.
The payment of another 350 billion should be made by another Congress vote.
In exchange for his assistance, Washington will receive shares in the securitised companies that will be worth dividends to him in case of profit and that he will be able to resell when the torture is over.
The federal government will have the opportunity to delay the arrest procedures for housing related to the real estate loans concerned by this plan, as well as to set limits on the remuneration and benefits paid to the managers of the affected companies.
The architects of the plan would like to see it submitted to the vote of the House of Representatives from now on, and to that of the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all their efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will have the green light.
Votes have indeed continued to rise against this project yesterday, both in the Republican and Democrat camps.
"Of course, Washington doesn't hear you," said Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House's Finance Committee, at the address of his electors.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not the one that is about to benefit taxpayers."
An animator of a small group in Congress named "the caucus of skeptics", the Democratic representative Brad Sherman presents things differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred prominent economic professors, including three Nobel Prizes, wrote to us: we are asked not to press and carefully examine the way to take it," he said yesterday.
At the same time, in Europe, there was once again evidence of the global nature of the crisis.
At the end of an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for EUR 11.2 billion (16.3 billion).
The intervention of the Governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg had been made necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas indicated that it had refused to acquire its full-fledged competitor since it lost EUR 2 billion (2.9 billion) in the US's risk-risk mortgage crisis.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of the twenty-largest European banks and ten largest insurers.
"This is not of the money lost, said yesterday the Dutch Minister of Finance, Wouter Bos.
In exchange, there is a right to vote in the bank and influence.
It's just something that savings people and households now appreciate that time is getting uncertain."
Meanwhile, on the other side of the Manche, the British government seemed to nationalize another bank maltreated by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take into account all current loans from Bradford and Bringley, of which more than 41 billion (US 75.5 billion) of real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander said yesterday that it would buy the UK bank's branches and customer accounts.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank, after Northern Rock, that the British government should nationalize from the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of an icon committed
His beauty in the azure's eyes was long his map out, some will say his weakness.
Was he released from the narcissistic mirror, the American actor to the charming smile?
Yes and no.
Its power, sensitivity and a talent that flowed from source will also have removed it from the register of power that gives birth to the true sacred monsters.
But that big background runner!
Paul Newman, who disappeared on Friday, at 83 years of age, from a lung cancer in his connecticut race, remains one of the last icons of American cinema in the fast years.
Less monumental than Brando, to whom he looked and for a long time was a kind of rival to the screen, more cautious in his game, certainly more fragile, but also an apostle of the freedom and break-up of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often makes beautiful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, a Jewish father of German and a Hungarian mother of origin.
These European roots will be born one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
No ego dismeasured, last quality mark.
Because it was designed by a whole state of self-made man, of the Pacific war fighter, injured in battle, who at the beginning of the 50s studied drama art in Yale and then attended the Actor's Studio in New York, before triumphing in the theatre, television, soon in the cinema.
The same man who was fighting for civil rights was also the car driver who ranked the second at 24 hours of Mans in 1979, doubled by a six symbol, although members of a model couple formed since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
The shadow areas of this secret star, discreet, engaged, allergic to the show-business cracks, which will not be completely lost.
An honest man, in the most noble sense of the term.
The disappearance of Paul Newman sought the vertigo of the filmmakers this weekend, while his great roles on the black screen of the memories are intertwined.
More than half a century of a seventh American art in perpetual mutation shows through it.
In memory of Butch Cassidy's charm cowboy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man rejected his sensual wife (Elyzabeth Taylor) in La Chatte on a suitable burning roof by Tennessee Williams in 1958.
Closer to us (1990), we refer to his sensitive Mr. Bridge, troubled by an old age by a marriage that did not fulfill all his promises.
So many other Paul Newmans have gone to history.
This boxer Rocky Graziano, a criminal, tortured, violent, unforgettable in Someonebody Up There Likes Me (Marked by Hate), by Robert Wise, a role for James Dean, once again after his death, who actually launched Newman in 1956.
This nice malfrat in the brilliantst The Sting (L'Arnaque), Oscar of the best film in 1973.
Billiard player loves and avenges in the magnificent The Hustler of Robert Rossen (1961), he will resume his character on the return to The Color of Money of Martin Scorsese, which he valued in 1987 by his only Oscar on nine nominations.
That face over the ages, it was him.
Still him.
The times are crammed through its course.
Young people are especially familiar with him through George Roy Hill's cultic Slap Shot (1977), in Reggie Dunlop, coach of a little orthodox ice hockey team.
His fans found him in The Hudsucker Proxy of the Coen Brothers in 1994.
With a last role as a sponsor of the Irish mafia in the Road to Sam Mendes Lost in 2003, the loop was closed.
In the face of several legends of the cinema that were early in the trade, Newman will remain in the seal for a long time, while denouncing Hollywood, its gold, its fastings and its concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier considered it, not without humor, "as a challenge living with "underplaying" judging his performances too supported.
The profession has not always been tendered for the beautiful Paul Newman to whom the roles have long fallen all the cooking in the bec.
However, it was less often the young than the marginals: nervous, alcoholic, salaud or desperate, whose perfect traits reflected the derivatives and revolts.
As a director, Newman reveals unknown faces of his true pudic sensitivity.
His Rachel, Rachel, in 1968 (after the novel by the Canadian Margaret Laurence), with his wife, Joanne Woodward, in the main role, drew an end to a female portrait of melancholy.
He who lost his son Scott by overdose dedicated his film to Harry and Son in 1984, working with dust and sadness.
Among the men's rains that swept over Newman yesterday, his great partner and former partner of Robert Redford's weapons (they had played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said, very attested: "His presence has made my life and this country better."
Generosity, love of existence are vivid traits of the missing actor.
In addition to his career as a legend, there is also a great militant for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, a Hollywood contestant.
We'll have seen a lot of his boutique troner on wine cellars, sauces, biscuits and other foods, judging the process of getting bad taste, though gag at the start.
However, the benefits of these sales were paid to its Children's Foundation in difficulty.
Newman, instead of sitting on his myth, he'll be engaged to the end.
He left to his five daughters a letter containing these phrases: "Today and to the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was a privilege to be there."
And a privilege for us to follow the course of an American artist so bright and so generous.
Citizen model, sum and up.
What could Zuschlag &amp; Company do in their invoice factory?
Next, on 8 October, the hearings relating to the current criminal proceedings will begin, against János Zuschlag and his colleagues.
Politicians and their associates are accused of fraud, in the form of a criminal organization, in a permanent and regular manner, which has caused particularly serious damage. Other accused leaders have been held against them, such as, for example, false and false use.
According to the parquet, the money from grants was spent for personal purposes, while the benefits were justified by false invoices.
The state and municipalities' money, about 65 million HUF in total, went on one side in the boxes of the Fiatal Balldal movement and on the other, in the pocket of some people.
Their method, which was also made public by the authorities responsible for the investigation, was to touch the money of the grants obtained by issuing cost invoices, after which no real benefits were provided and thus the associations never complied with their commitments.
According to the indictment, most of the invoices were false.
For the latter, they were looking for invoices in the Jozsefváros market, while they were making the secrets in Kisunhallas.
For the names of companies to be included in the invoices, it was decided, inter alia, during the tours in the northern province of Lake Balaton, carried out by István Lados, at the request of János Zuschlag.
According to the deposit of the latter, he had to report pensions and restaurants.
For its personal consumption, he asked for an invoice, on the model in which they would make the other invoices they would introduce, among other things, with the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, as well as the Municipality of Capital for access to grants.
The majority of the invoices were created by István Lados and his companion András Õri, who, according to our information, was primarily concerned with drafting the files needed to obtain the grants.
In a "discovery circuit", one of Lados's choices was a bistro.
According to the two invoices issued by the Zuschlag in 2003, this place ensured the restoration of a group of 90 people, members of the Biztos Pont Egyesület Association.
However, according to the manager, it would have been impossible for so many people to occupy this place at the same time.
In the same way, in the summer of 2002, the invoice established on behalf of the Jobb Jöv‐ert Foundation, which will then bear the name of Együtt to Harmadid Évesredért, grew with errors of form and background.
A pension, located in Badacsonytomaj, had only three rooms, and up to ten people could spend the night there. However, the bill mentioned one hundred thirty customers.
In their accounts, neither the name of Job Jöv‐ert nor the name of Hoppá appeared in the park, according to the information given in the park.
The manager of the company said on the hvg.hu site that when the park called on him and showed him the invoices, he immediately knew that it was false documents.
"The name of our company and our tax number were placed in a bad place on the cache."
He added: "In addition to the form, the fact that, according to the bill, one hundred people had settled there, they did not take any more, since this facility only counts eleven rooms, which do not have so much room.
In addition, the invoice also mentions meals, and our restaurant has been closed for a long time."
The broadcasters of yellow invoices did not learn any more about Budapest travel agencies, which were part of their choice, but were organizing only foreign travel. Thus, naively, they indicated that they stayed in Hungary on invoices to settle in cash, which also goes against the Agency's accounting practices.
In addition, as shown in the investigation, they also add VAT to these documents, while travel benefits, whose destination is outside the European Union, are invoiced without VAT.
Similarly, the VAT rate of the four invoices established on behalf of the Réfülöp Hotel in the order of Jobb Jöv‐ért was incorrect, since the company's benefits do not support a 25% VAT as indicated, but a 15% VAT. Furthermore, hotel employees only remove printed invoices, while the counterfeits were handwritten.
The survey of the parquet reveals that the "sendors" also made mistakes by mentioning as a provision the transport of goods by road, that the invoice issuing company could not exercise, since its profile was the investment council.
In addition, it is also for vices of forms, such as types of improper invoices and false secrets, that invoices issued by Együtt a Harmadi Évezredért Alapitvány of XXI. Századi Culturalis Egyesület and Biztos Pont have proved false.
Just like in the case of Ravenna Bt. or Kunfehértó sports stadium, both of which are not the authors of the invoices issued on their behalf.
The complainants no longer paid attention to the fact that HIB Kft., established in Nyíregyháza, was in liquidation at the time (in 2001) the group of Fiatal Városért Egyesület was supposed to take a meal at their home. According to our information, that is why the liquidator of the company did not issue this invoice.
Bills deliberately established
Another category of invoice issuers is the composition of those who were fully aware that they were asked to issue invoices.
The Esély Budapest Alapítvány Foundation, at the request of the group of Fiatal Balldal - Ifju Socialisták, established an invoice at the order of the Együtt Foundation at Harmadik Évezredért, for a sum of four million HUF.
According to the indictment, the manager of Colllab Kft. was brought to issue false invoices by one of the defendants, Ludovic Györfi.
Also, he cooperated with the Zuschlags, Biogate Kft., which is currently under liquidation and which in 2003, issued invoices under the Job Jöv‐ért Alapitvány Foundation, the Atlas Egyesület Association and the Association Vörösfenny-Egyesület, for an amount of about five million HUF, but after which no benefits were actually provided.
No financial movement has taken place since the invoices issued were subsequently cancelled, but the agencies have been careful not to mention it in their accounts.
The following category of invoice issuing companies is that of the companies directly related to the defendants.
Thus, the administrative delegate of the Director-General of Delta Trió Kft., dealing with fuel trade and motor vehicles, whose seat was in Budapest, but where it was not possible, was Ivan Kubatov.
In October, November and December 2005, the company issued several invoices for the sale of computer equipment, amounting to approximately 18 million HUF.
According to the survey, these equipment would have been purchased by the Cash Investment Kft. of Kisunhalas, which has been in liquidation since 14 September 2005.
The director of this company was a Romanian-born man, to whom Iván Kubatov would also have obtained documents relating to the company between 2002 and 2005.
According to what we know, Kubatov acknowledged during the investigation that he issued invoices on the orders of Atlas, Hoppá and Együtt companies to Harmadik Évezredert Alapítvány, and that he hid their counter-value.
It is precisely at the request of Ivan Kubatov that Romanian masons created Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
In fact, none of these companies worked, as the accused explained by the fact that they did not receive employment.
Even so, he served these companies, since at the request of Master Zsolt Szente, co-accused as well as editor of the founding acts of companies, he established invoices on their behalf, in the order of associations related to Zuschlag, such as the Atlas and Y-Generació associations.
Kubatov gave companies, 15 invoices in total, issued by Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, for a value of 14.2 million HUF.
The parquet thought that 10% of the invoices and VAT were in Kubatov's pocket.
The man even used the company Szi-Beri Bt. to establish fictional invoices that were used in the Biztos Pont grant application.
In January 2006, the Association Y-Generácio and Sövetség in Modern Magyarországert introduced an application for a grant to the socialist party's public utility organization Táncsics Mihaly Alapitvány (TMA).
They received this subsidy for a sum of 500,000 HUF twice, but these amounts were not used for the purposes indicated in the application.
To avoid this, five invoices received from Works Team Kft were submitted to the TMA.
Moreover, these invoices were found during the search in the Office of Arpád Kemecsei, at the Ministry of Education.
At the hearing, some of the accused reported the method of making invoices, as she had already done before the parquet.
What might be really interesting would be that the chief accused, János Zuschlag himself, decided to lift the veil over the whole story.
Until now, his eyes are not very detailed, and although he has promised to tell many times the details, he has not yet done so.
The question is whether it is in his interest, or, if so, the Socialists would have concluded an agreement that in exchange for the reimbursement of a large part of the 50 million HUF, Zusi would bear the hat alone.
Today, the latter is likely to be old, as applications for his lodging in a supervised residence, on the basis of the relief of his detention conditions, are constantly in the ear of a deaf person.
While those who have caused much more damage, and the perpetrators of non-reparable economic offences, walk freely or at least, waiting at their own home for the end of the procedure.
Over-the-counter psychology: why do we spend more money?
In the course of sales, buyers tend to spend more, and overestimate the merchandise.
Researchers in neurology and economics at the University of New York have been able to update the neurological and economic bases of this well-known and apparently irrational behavior.
According to their study published in the journal Science, human beings do not want to be distanced from this type of competition, such as sales to eBay auctions, and that is why they even prefer to pay too high a price.
These research has attempted to develop a neurological scheme of this kind of "game" with the help of sales to experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers played the lot, while the other group participated in a sale to the gaming auctions, while with the help of a functional magnetic resonance process (IRMf), researchers analyzed the active brain areas of experimental subjects.
In both games, participants were able to earn money, but during the sale of the auctions, an essential element of which is the overload of a third, the whole under the brain trunk, called striatum, was moving intensely during the loss of the part.
This part of the brain, along with several other functions, plays a role in the "auto-stimulation" mechanism of the nervous system.
Therefore, according to researchers, the rise of prices is explained by the leak in front of the violent reaction of the striatum.
In support of their theories, the economists of this group of researchers continued financial monitoring analyses.
In these cases, three groups faced a partner, under different circumstances.
They simply informed the control group of the actual value of the product in question, and thus they did so.
To another group, they promised that if, in addition, they were winning the party, then they would receive 15 additional dollars, in reward.
While the third group received these $15 before the auctions, the members of the group also lost that money, if they lost the auctions.
The difference between these two groups is in fact that the emphasis was placed at one on victory, while at the other on failure.
By thus proving the hypothesis of neurologists, members of the team of players "against failure" were available at higher positions than those carried out by the control group and the group "for victory".
"These results cannot be demonstrated by any already existing economic theory.
In fact, each of them did not explain the phenomena found in sales to auctions, but by the pleasure of winning and the parade at risk.
Only the methods of neurological imaging have helped to eliminate the contradiction between the two theories by now starting on a third explanation." - Andrew Schutter, professor of the Faculty of Economic Sciences at the University of New York, observed.
Hepatitis: when do we have to consult a doctor?
In the world, about half a billion people suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, while in Hungary chronic liver disease is mentioned among the first causes of death.
There are hundreds of miles of hepatitis virus patients in Hungary, but only seven miles of treatment follow. This is because often the patients do not know that they are carriers of the virus.
Hepatitis is a generic name given to infections affecting the liver and caused by different viruses.
There are many similarities between their symptoms. The inflammation of the liver and jaundice are characteristic, but pathogens and diseases are different from each other.
Hepatitis viruses, according to pathogens, are mainly spread in two forms: hepatitis A and E through the digestive tube (e.g., food or contaminated water), hepatitis B, C, D and other blood viruses and organic fluids (sperm, vaginal secretion, saliva).
For travellers, it is recommended to be vaccinated against viruses A and B. There is no vaccine against C.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after consumption of contaminated foods, generally accompanied by a bad general condition, weakness, stomach and nausea.
Then it develops on the skin and on the white eye a visible yellowish, the cells become clearer and the urine takes a more dark color. The healing can take two to three weeks.
Around the world, every year a million people die of the most serious form of this pathology, such as cancer or liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B.
The main reason for this is that, according to estimates, only one patient in ten receives medical treatment.
Hepatitis C may also have serious consequences: if it is not treated, it may lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer.
Most patients do not know how to get the virus because the pathogen destroys the liver cells in a subtle way. In many cases, the first symptoms appear only after 20 to 30 years.
Therefore, early prevention is very important, as well as regular testing tests.
Contamination is much higher than the average of a population of three groups: individuals who had undergone a blood transfusion before 1991, drug users and tattoos.
Currently, patients with chronic hepatitis C in the world are estimated at 200 million.
Since the disease can be detected by a routine laboratory examination, it is recommended that you consult your doctor to treat symptoms of unknown origin.
The disease can be cured, if it is detected in time. The virus can be eradicated from the body, thus the risk of infection disappears and the development of cancer is prevented.
On 30 September, the World Day of Hepatitis was first organized by the agencies representing the sick of the four corners of the world.
Its aim is to draw attention to the cirrhosis of chronic liver caused by viruses, to the causes of its development and to the importance of early diagnosis of the disease.
Does anyone who believes in God feel less pain?
According to the results of recent research, religious belief would work as a sort of analgesic, which would have helped to make the death of Catholic martyrs more bearable.
British daily Telegraph published an article that says that researchers at Oxford University have made an interesting experience by analyzing the level at which belief in God could influence tolerance to the pain of the human being.
As part of this experience for the least bizarre, 12 Catholic believers and so many atheists were subjected to electrochocs, while each observed a painting representing the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to exclude a large part of suffering.
Thanks to a human brain palpation technique, Catholics were also able to activate the part of their brain responsible for the regulation of pain.
This analysis is the first of a series of experiences to which academics, scholars, philosophers and theologians participate from different sectors of the university.
More specifically, the experience takes place in the following way: an instrument that emits sparks and spreads electrochocs is fixed on the left hand of the experimental subject.
The researchers asked the participants of the experience to look at two paintings in a sustained way, one being the Virgin Mary painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th century and the other, the Lady at the Hermine painting by Leonardo de Vinci in the 15th century.
Researchers from the origin of this experience hoped that the view of the Virgin Mary evoked a sort of state of faith among believers, while the choice of the painting of Da Vinci, not very different from the first, brought on its soothing effect.
Experimental subjects spent one and a half hours in an IRM scanner, and during this time, received 20 electrochocs in four parts succeeding, while looking at either the painting on a religious theme or the painting on a more general theme.
The Catholics said that in the view of the Virgin Mary, they felt as "in security", as one of whom we "care" and they were "slow, and peace has invaded them".
In view of the painting of religious themes, they reported 12% of their pain unless they looked at the work of Leonardo.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who himself took part in the experience, thinks that the same effects can be achieved with any other strong image, in the atheists, provided that the appropriate photo can be found.
"We should find an image to which they respond very positively, such as a mother or father," said the psychologist.
Tom Wright, bishop of England, welcomed the results of these research.
"The practice of faith should change and in many cases, really change our personality," Wright added.
After these excellent results, there is no longer a question of what would be the effect on the regulation of the pain of subjects if we show believers a Madone painted by Leonard or a painter of the same caliber?
Would the view of a better-quality Virgin Mary produce better results?
You're what you reveal about you.
On the occasion of its tenth anniversary, Google claims that it can be found in the bottom of people's pocket as the sky above their heads. He knows where they spent their holidays, what specialists they consult and what are their centres of interest.
However, it is not yet enough, according to Eric Schmidt, who is one of the influential people of society.
While as far as skeptics are concerned by paralleling Orwell's vision of horror, they just don't see the essentials of web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently stated in the Financial Times that Google’s main ambition is to gather even more information about its users. This is necessary so that Google founders can meet their original purpose that sounded as follows: “Let’s gather all the information from the world in a system!”.
According to Google's interrogated leader, after ten years of a work of global camouflage, they are always only at the beginning of their goals of being able to process all the information.
To the question: what will happen in five years? Schmidt replied that he would like Google to be able to answer such questions as "What can I do tomorrow?" or "What is my best job?" However, software will not be able to answer such a question simply at first sight, that the day they will know enough about users.
It is not perfectly clear for all internet users that the words used during Internet research, the IP address of the computer that launches the search and the pages then consulted by interested persons are specifically listed.
Through the Personalized Search program launched two years ago, users can, for example, store their own history of research and can consult what they have been looking for. Thanks to this, in the long term, Recommendations, a program based on the same logic, will be able to provide a much more personalized response, and will submit products and services based on our previous statements and our registered preferences.
What happens if someone uses my data against me, if he sees what my work is? ask users, who are worried about watching Google's info monopoly.
In most cases, it is the potential power represented by the society that can cause fear, and it is not the regret, the fear of punishment, the desire for freedom or possibly the rebellion against the power that can cause a counter-reaction in the internet.
However, it is confirmed that the terms sought are not only recorded, but in justified cases they are transmitted to a third party, and in such a legal case, nothing protects the personal rights of internet users.
The most repetitive example of these recent times is probably the coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, during which Google sent to the Brazilian government the information he had collected on the public page called Orkut, thus enabling identification.
Concerned human rights netizens were able to raise a sigh of relief in May, when Google, arms down with the EFF's electronic legal protection agency, proved its right to the court in front of the FBI. According to the ruling made, in the future, Google will not always be forced by any of the points of the constitution to disclose information on the secret request of the FBI, of any kind.
(At the same time, the federal government has successfully obtained some 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 terms of research that it had obtained in relation to the strengthening of the Child Protection Act, voted several years ago, but in the end, it has failed to obtain the lists of private users' research, nor the full list of websites and keywords of the last two months.)
Google's judgment is therefore rather contradictory: it is fickle by those who fear the transmission of their personal data, because they think that their intimate sphere and their private domain suffer when they start using Google services. Therefore, they attack them in the spirit of rebellion that they manifest against the proud multinational societies of their conservative image.
During this time, the American geek culture and its "savages" bring together the passions, activists and enthusiast users of the computer that appear in many countries see Google the next generation of big companies, the "connected corporation", by opposition to its rival, Microsoft, cataloged as the world's invasioner because of Windows, and that, even though both fight for the same goal.
This can be explained by the fact that, unlike Microsoft, Google does not ask its users for identification code, it does not ask for money for its applications. The document code and the program package, continuously refreshes, has a much more accessible, younger and cool effect, against the practice of the official software giant.
The reason may also be that the geex see very precisely the problem of the relationship between the rights of the person and the internet, and that the Web 2.0, the most widely proclaimed word in recent years, is just behind it.
In fact, Web 2.0 does not concern anything but collaboration, that we deliberately leave traces behind us, and that we serve communication channels that we have at our disposal, and while the size of these changes one by one, the essential remains the same: we expose ourselves.
A young person, in general, can have a profile on several public pages, from Facebook to Xanga, and he can even connect them to other benefits, such as Twinter, or last.fm, listing his musical habits. Then he can connect them to a tracking system, such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. These young people can also have blogs, in which their most recent photo galleries appear automatically that they store on Flickr or on Picasa.
While many examples can be learned, such as that of the little friend who easily understands the pictures of the morning, taken by the circle of common friends, with whom his unfaithful friend spent the evening, or that of the company who licensed one of his employees, nothing but for the sincere opinions that he wrote on his blog about top management, one can be on one thing: the term of private life is entirely to be considered today.
He who lives an online life is made up of what he shows himself, and this is how the principle can be defined by hiding behind the behavior of today's young people.
He wants to hide something, or at least, he wants to try to reverse Google's monopoly, he can do it (starting, for example, with Scroogle, using the Google search system, but at the same time leaving intentionally no trace).
The number of people who deliberately fail to register on public pages so that it is not possible to find them is no less. Google online services, passing through text processing to image processing, to reading information can be replaced by alternative versions, which are not connected to huge parks of servers and which do not resemble our best profile, which have existed so far.
Public opinion awaits, without really hiding it, the moment when Google will reveal its true nature.
The company, with its current value of $156 billion, is worth more than $140 billion, Intel $124 billion, or Coca-Cola $110 billion. AdWords/AdSense advertising areas threatens the number of advertising agencies’ business, while the services introduced at an increasing rate provide serious migrants not only to Microsoft, but to many other software developers.
However, critical observers find, on the other hand, contradictions with worrying effects: for example, the company's top management has refused, in its entirety, employee protests, after it doubled the company's mother's price and after the company has considered the multiple daily restoration too costly, taken at any time. All of this seems to be detractive in addition to the fact that already in 2006, Google has acquired before the Chinese government and in accordance with the terms of their agreement, the company detects all the results that hurt the good taste, as well as the interests of the Chinese regime.
According to one of the company's internal rules, the new services are announced only when they can be used. What is more, in the coming months and next years, they will move the world on new points. While some think that Google's draft scan and archive of books and magazines takes such important dimensions that the company will soon face the United States Supreme Court, others shaking in front of its Health system, as in this, we can build a full medical benefit from our previous analyses, our doctors and our problems.
The fact that Google builds a genetic database can give a good first to the next generation of science-fiction authors. The famous Cory Doctorow novel, written with half-tonnes of Orwellians, describes the future in which a man could be approached effectively nothing but through Google data.
Two minors helped to eliminate the traces of the double homicide of Ozd
"The police called two minors to question them in the double homicide case of Ozd. According to the suspicions, they helped to eliminate the traces of the crime." - said the spokesperson of the Department of Borsod.
The young people have recognized the facts that have been blamed for them, and for the time being, they are being accused of complicity.
The two minors, who, according to the information provided by MTI (Hongroise Telecommunications Agency), are young girls, are free to defend themselves.
The complicity of murder can lead to detention that can last up to 5 years.
The suspect of the double homicide of Ozd, a young man of the 23-year-old corner, was placed in temporary detention on Sunday.
The charges against him are multiple homicides, committed with premedication and interest.
During the investigation, it was found that the 23-year-old man owed a large sum of money to a 53-year-old man.
The suspect did not want to settle his debt and that is why he would attract his creditor, on Wednesday last, to a site of Ozd where he killed him, as well as the little girl of this man, who was 9 years old.
According to information from the ITC, the young man has prejudged his crime. The weapon with which he was going to commit his hidden crimes at the crime scene is evidence of this.
The police examine the weapon and the circumstances of its use with the help of specialists.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange makes a proposal for the purchase of the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange offered two hundred million euros, about five billion Czech crowns, for the 100% purchase of the Prague Stock Exchange Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed this proposal that the Polish had made despite the fact that the Czechs had previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the circle of the new potential owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason for this exclusion is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in the hands of the State.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish State that wishes to separate more than 60% of its shares in a few months of activity.
According to the Czech economic daily E15, the Polish proposal represents the highest bid made so far for the purchase of the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press, the Vienna stock exchange, the Nasdaq transatlantic stock exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London stock exchange and the Deutsche Börse made an offer to date.
Petr Koblic, the director of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that among those interested, the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the least good owner, and did not rule out the fact that this could result in the disappearance of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague Stock Exchange is estimated to be between 5 and 10 billion Czech crowns by market specialists.
On the basis of an agreement between shareholders, some 90% of the paper would be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is Patria Finance, with approximately 25 per cent of the stake, followed by 14.7 per cent of the Ceská Sporitelna Bank and Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5 per cent.
The financial crisis from the point of view of the European press
In their comments on Tuesday on the international financial crisis, the European press's leading newspapers are already calling for a "second 11 September".
"The global financial disaster, we owe it to the U.S. President" - charges the daily newspaper of Rome, La Repubblica. "The President has not even been able to block with his own party behind a bill, improvised to the White, aimed at bringing relief to a desperate situation..."
Instead of a new Pearl Harbour, as the billionaire Warren Buffett said, it is more appropriate to speak of a second September 11th.
A part of the Madrileen press also sees the emissary hole in Washington.
According to the daily El Mundo vision, these are the shortcomings of the political leadership there that led the world economy on the brink of collapse.
The danger of the collapse of the American financial system is increasing every day, and then the whole world is going to pay the high price.
Bush's plan was far from perfect, however, after the Congress' vote, a real dangerous threat, which Washington does not propose a political tool to deal with the crisis.
The world economy hangs in the void, just when in the history of capitalism, one of the greatest transformations takes place.
We cannot ignore the threat any longer - underlines the Genève Tags-Anzeiger.
Some states can still hold a lifeline for their financial institutions, and thanks to the money of their taxpayers, they can save them from bankruptcy.
Of course, if more banks are going to do so, then neither financial resources nor new improvisations will be sufficient.
In the long run, we need the European Union states to do little about their national selfishness, and to centralise control over divided financial markets.
On Monday, the weak financial institutions received more than EUR 100 billion - recalled the Vienna daily Der Standard, which adds that the fears that European taxpayers will also have to put their hands to the pocket, very deep, in a similar way to the Americans in order to remedy the crisis, become increasingly realistic.
Until now, the EU has not really taken care of the crisis, which, like a tsunami, is going through, partly, the old continent.
The "saviors" should not burn at least one hundred billion euros at a time, so it would be fair if they were to note in which case it would be reasonable to touch the taxpayer's money, with the aim of preventing further damage.
The Smart Car Imitates the Flights of the Bourdon
What method would be better to develop technologies capable of avoiding an obstacle if it was not the imitation of an existing obstacle detector in nature?
For example, the one with the bees.
In the amazing project presented at CEATEC, taking place in Japan, the baroning bees gave the strategic idea of departure to Nissan engineers to inspire them on how to design the next generation of obstacles detectors.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan built a mini robot, a bio-inspired auto-robotized system, type BR23C, which he equipped with bees, the ultimate goal being to encourage the development of a system capable of avoiding all obstacles.
In its flights, each bee is its own area, oval-shaped, which, in reality, looks much like our safe-guarded cocoon - explained, at the exhibition, Kazuhhiro Doi, the director of the Department of Research and Development and the technology relations of the brand.
The bee facet eye plays a key role, as it is able to see in all directions, in an angle of 300 degrees.
To imitate the function of the face-to-face eye, engineers have addressed the idea of the laser telemeter.
It identifies the obstacles in an angle of 180 degrees and at a distance of 2 metres in front of the BR23C, it evaluates the distances and sends a signal to the microprocessor, which transforms it into an escape handle immediately.
The perception of the obstacle takes place in a fraction of a second. Then, the mini robot, imitating the movements of the bee, immediately changes the direction of its wheels by turning it from an angle enough to avoid collision.
In contrast to any existing system at present, this prevention exercise takes place in an instinctive manner.
"If not, the mini robot could not react quickly enough to avoid the obstacle," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and the robotized car project.
It must react instinctively and instantly, as this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable and the most internal layer of the protection envelope, a layer where the collision is now considered inevitable.
All this process must reflect what the bee does to avoid the other bee.
The process must take place in an eyelid.
Unlike bees, the difference cannot go up, down or diagonally, it can only be two dimensions, and only in the direction in which wheels can rotate.
In this way, instead of the infinite combined bees that have the bees to avoid the other bees, in our case, only the rotating movement, acceleration and slowing as manoeuvres at the disposal of the mini robot
The BR23C uses lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and whose energy concentration is larger, making their life longer than in the Lithium-ion version.
According to Andoh, it is the instinctive intelligent reaction that is primary, not data processing, and even less storage capacity.
This mechanism must treat only a few signals coming in a second, and respond to them.
It is not necessary to store them and react with intuitive logic based on the data of previous maneuvers. In this way, it uses only a few dozen kilo-octets of continuous memory.
We don't need memory of a giga-octets capacity, or even mega-octets.
This is the first step towards the design of a technology used for instant avoidance. According to Nissan's estimates, this system will enter the cars manufactured in the next ten years.
Another application could be its integration into the GPS satellite navigation system, so that it can guide the driver to its destination by avoiding obstacles on its way.
We even gave a name to the baby at a price.
The written version of the $700 billion economic saving plan, which aims to purchase the suspicious bank credits, and to use several times, is ready.
In the first round, half of this sum will be spent.
Reuters announces that in the course of new debates extending until midnight, Saturday, local time on the east coast, Congress leaders have agreed on the disputes that have existed for days and days, around the rescue plan of a total of $700 billion.
"We have taken a serious step forward" - said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic President of the American House of Representatives, after which there is no longer any left to put agreements on paper.
The compromise, based on the plan, is supported by the two presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain.
The U.S. Secretary of Treasury Henry Paulson said by commenting on the results of the compromise that the program will work and will be effective, but other measures still need to be implemented. According to Pelosi, there is no question here about the saving of Wall Street, but about turning the wheels of the economy into a different way.
The written version of the plan was made public before the opening of the Asian markets, Sunday night at 20 a.m., local time of Washington (i.e. Monday at 2 a.m., at the local time of Central Europe), but did not cause a spectacular rise in scholarships.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will be the first to vote on the bill in response to the 2008 Emergency Economic Stabilisation Act. It will then be among the hands of the Senate.
On Saturday night, President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi, and then the White House also welcomed the news of the agreement.
"We are satisfied with the progress made this night, and we greatly appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and to protect our economy," said Tony Fratto, the spokesperson of the White House.
In addition, the program differs from the initial proposal made by the Bush administration, which it mentioned that the $700 billion had to be spent only once for the purchase of securities on questionable credits.
The first 250 billion will be issued immediately after the adoption of the Act by Congress, probably on Monday. The first half of the 700 billion will be available to the Treasury Secretary to purchase suspicious bank claims, while the use of the 100 billion additional dollars will be left to the discretion of the President.
The programme will be supervised by an independent body in which the President of the Federal Reserve will also take part.
The expenditure of the second half of the 700 billion depends on a new decree of Congress.
Under the law, the Treasury secretariat will be able to establish a combined strategy: at the same time, it will be able to buy suspicious claims, securities on suspicious mortgages and mortgages, as well as other types of "toxic" claims.
The department's competent persons stated that the purchases may take place in the context of a sale to auctions, but also directly.
The rule gives the companies concerned the opportunity to take part in an insurance programme, where the Treasury Secretariat guarantees the tools of concern, for which companies will have paid an equivalent premium to the expected damage.
Henry Paulson stated that the law provided the necessary tools to spend $700 billion on the urgent needs of the financial system, that it was a large purchase of suspicious claims, insurance, or to avoid the risk of seeing the system leading to the collapse of one or the other important financial institution.
"We will take the necessary provisions to be ready for the application of the law as soon as it is signed" - he added.
On the other hand, bank leaders who are in poor positions and awaiting State aid can expect their starting benefits, called simply a parachutist in extra-Atlantic, to be limited by the government.
The ceiling of wages is only mentioned in specific cases. Moreover, the limitations depend on how the Treasury secretariat offers its assistance to the company.
The principle of ceilinging means that if the Treasury Secretariat purchases in the context of a auction sale, they will receive an excess tax on the debt parachute, unless the disparity bank president participates in the pension.
Directly after the purchase of suspicious claims, the government will act aggressively to ensure that the amount paid to the leaders is not excessive.
In order for the image to be complete, it is still necessary to add that the existing gold parachutes are not modified. The ceiling only concerns the new contracts, which thus motivates participation in the plan.
This is the first time in the history of the United States that legal ceilings will be in force on the appointments of the Directors-General - the chairman of the Committee on Financial Services of the House of Deputies, Democratic Barney Frank, commented.
In addition, the State has a right to acquire shares in the banks taking part in the plan, thus reducing the risk of taxpayers, as they may even be winning in the case as soon as the economy and with it the banks saved will fall on their beds.
The draft law states that in the next five years, the President must introduce to Congress a proposal which will determine how the losses will be repaid to taxpayers from the financial sector.
On both sides, there were, of course, those who expressed their doubts about this plan.
That is not why American citizens have sent us, this does not protect taxpayers' dollars - said the Republican MP in California, Darrell Issa.
His Democratic colleague of Ohio, Mary Kaptur, thinks it's the same as those who are taking action, and those responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
Industrial prices continued to increase

Industrial export sales prices increased by 1.1 per cent compared to July 2008, while compared to those of one year ago, they decreased by 3.9 per cent.
As a result of domestic and export fluctuations, industrial production prices increased by 0.7 per cent compared to those of the previous month, and 3.2 per cent compared to those of the previous year.
The domestic industrial sales prices increased only to a lesser extent: 0.1 per cent compared to the previous month.
The domestic sales prices of the processing industry were only slightly increased by 0.1 per cent compared to July.

The higher prices of plastic and chemical raw materials have resulted in a significant monthly increase in the prices of the chemical and manufacturing sector (1.6 per cent).
This resulted in a decline in the oil processing sectors (1.4 per cent), the manufacture of machinery and electrical equipment (0.9 per cent), and a minimum increase in the wood processing sector (0.1 per cent).
The prices of paper production, publishing and printing activities have not changed.
The other sectors of the processing industry have recorded an increase of 0.2 per cent and 0.9 per cent.
In the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sectors, which represent an important weight in national industrial operation, prices increased by 0.3 per cent in August, mainly due to the effect of the increase in the gas price introduced by the authorities since 1 July.
In a 12-month comparison, taking into account the domestic sales of the processing sectors, these are the prices of the oil processing sector that have experienced the most significant increase (32.4%).
In the manufacture of metallurgical products, an increase in prices of 13.2 per cent was observed, while in the important area of food production, beverages and tobacco, prices increased by 11 per cent.
Prices decreased in the textile and textile production sectors (2.5 per cent), as well as in the production of electrical machinery and appliances (0.3 per cent).

In the production sectors of consumer goods, inflation has been measured by 6.8 per cent, while in the profit-initiating sectors, a decrease of 1.4 per cent has been observed.
The export sales prices of the industrial sector in HUF increased by 1.1 per cent in August compared to the previous month, while they decreased by 3.9 per cent over 12 months.
In one month, our national payment average decreased by 1.7 per cent compared to the euro, and 7.1 per cent compared to the dollar. Compared to August 2007, it increased by 7.5 per cent compared to the euro and 15.9 per cent compared to the dollar.
Next year, will we still need a visa to go to the United States?
King Göncz believes there is a good chance that by 12 January, the American-Hungarian visa exemption agreement will enter into force. That is what the Minister of Foreign Affairs said in Chicago, in front of the leaders of the local Hungarian community.
According to it, "now everything depends only on the time when the extra-Atlantic electronic entry and control systems will be put into service."
At all times, she drew attention to the fact that in the new system, there will be no entry visa, but tourists will have to register before departure.
The head of the Hungarian diplomacy will be in negotiations from today in Washington.
He will meet with the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Condoleezza Rice, to whom he will return the decoration of the Commander's Cross with the Star of the Order of merit of the Republic of Hungary, and will have an interview with the foreign policy advisors of candidates to the presidency, Democratic Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain both support the bank rescue plan
On Sunday, Barack Obama, like John McCain, the candidates for the two major American parties, supported the Government's 700 billion-dollar rescue plan, but there are politicians who demand the resignation of the US Secretary in Treasury.
After the marathon negotiations that lasted days and days, representatives of Congress and the Administration finally announced, on Sunday at dawn, that they had concluded principles agreements on the bank's rescue plan.
This funding plan, with the objective of demarcation of the Wall Street crisis and the paralyzed credit market, has become the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain even present themselves, each as fit as the other, to drive the country out of the economic crisis.
According to recent surveys, with the introduction of economic issues, Obama has again managed to make some progress. McCain's advance, obtained with the appointment of Sarah Palin as a colister just after the Republican Convention, was founded.
During a campaign meeting held in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed his hope that Congress would quickly vote for the 700 billion rescue law.
He stressed that the proposal contained consumer protection passages that he also supported.
"It is now necessary to act, with responsibility (...) a danger threatens your work, your economies, the entire industrial sectors and the stability of the whole economy" - he said in front of a crowd of 35,000 people.
There has been no lack of qualification for McCain's economic ideas of exceeded.
In an interview with the ABC channel, McCain said: "We will all have trouble doing it (...) but nothing to do is a possible way."
The Republican Senator stated that the proposal mentioned the creation of a Treasury Control Board and the ceiling for the starting allowances of senior executives, and that it was personally very attached to these points.
Obama told CBS that McCain had no role on the ground in the negotiations, while he was in daily contact with the Treasury Secretary.
Nancy Pelosi, President of the House of Representatives, said on Sunday that there was a serious hope that the House would vote on the bill on Monday.
The press review of the German language territory
The right-wing camp is intact, it is only in the heart of the party that the voters are becoming more aware - it is as it is called the Der Spiegel, the low score of the CSU in the Bavarian country.
Haider is ready to rule Austria, to prevent the coalition of reds and blacks.
The mirror (speckle.de)
In the online edition of the German left-wing information magazine, Franz Walter analyzes the causes of CSU's dramatic failure in his article entitled "The Revolution in Bavaria devours its fathers".
According to this well-known politician, CSU's erosion began well before the sad duo Beckstein-Huber took over his duties.
Christian Socialists have transformed Bavaria for decades and now these same modern citizens are turning their backs on them.
This change of times is at the same time the problem of all Christian democracy, and therefore also that of Angela Merker.
For the CSU, failure was not a surprise at all, but on Sunday, a process that was likely to happen, just ten years ago: the indisputable hegemony of the national party ended.
Ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU collected 47.7 per cent, for the first time since the 1950s, with a score below the 50 per cent level.
This was repeated three years ago during the 2005 Bundestag elections, that is, at the time of the so-called Stoiber.
The cause can be attributed to modernization "depleting its parents", established in the region in a consistent manner by the CSU.
This was 40 years ago when sociologists announced this, but they were greatly mistaken about the rhythm. However, secularization, the results of education and the establishment of Germans in the north and east in the Bavarian region, in full development, could not remain unaffected by the loyalty of CSU voters.
Modernization will be coupled with increased opportunities, and the consequences of such a policy are also visible.
The right field is intact, it is only within the party that voters are becoming more aware, more critical and more inclined.
It is also surprising that during the last few weeks, that is exactly the groups of classical citizens who have rather distanced themselves from the CSU, such as the independents, the artisans, the Bactock holders and the graduates of higher education.
In these groups, CSU support decreased by 40 per cent.
The Presse (depresse.com)
In its article entitled "Who? With whom? The chairman of the party is on the reserve to the questions of the coalition", the conservative Austrian daily deals with the situation of the confused internal policy that was established after the Austrian elections.
The Austrian Socialists of the SPÖ wanted to discuss with the conservatives of the OVP.
The OVP prohibits SPÖ from interfering with its internal affairs.
The BZÖ populist party is open for negotiations. The Greens still do not want to agree on the coalition.
Elections took place, now all around the coalition; during public television debates, party leaders were hardly allowed to enter their cards.
Werner Faymann, president of the SPÖ, confirmed that he would like to discuss with the OVP.
SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between the two parties is indeed possible - that is what already exists in some regions and in the socialist partnership.
The question that he would imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current president of the OVP, as a vice-canner, remains open on Faymann's side.
As he mentioned, the Schüssel-Multiterer orientation was, in any case, rejected.
A replica of this combination is out of question.
Multiterer responded with caution to red proposals.
As he has already said, cooperation will certainly be unfavourable if Faymann tries to get involved in the internal affairs of the OEF.
In his party, the choice of opposition or entry into the coalition is currently an open question, and these points must be debated in the OEF.
Jörg Haider, president of BZÖ, is once again open to all proposals.
"To avoid the coalition of reds and blacks, we are ready to assume government responsibilities," said Haider.
Járóka said: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today, in Paris, the European Summit for Equal Opportunities, the host of which is France, began as a representative of the current Presidency of the European Union.
In his message to the plenary assembly, as one of the main spokespersons of the expert consultation, Lívia Járóka, Euro-deputy Fidesz European People's Party, drew attention to segregations in education, because it is a violation of the law that affects the most Roma children and therefore one of the main obstacles to their success in life.
On behalf of the French Presidency, this high-level conference was opened by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Labour and Social Affairs, and by Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Labour, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Among those invited to take part in the consultation are the European social partners, as well as the most prominent representatives of legal protection and European civil bodies in the field of equal opportunities.
According to the press office of the group of MP Fidesz Popular Party, Járóka has predicted that, in addition to the distinctions found in employment, Roma disappear from the labour market, first, following their low qualifications.
"A overwhelming majority of young Roma do not have secondary degrees, and as a result of an elementary education of poor quality, only a small part has the opportunity to obtain a higher degree of education."
In addition, Járóka stressed that education as a fundamental human right plays a key role when it comes to asserting other fundamental rights.
Investment in early education of Roma children means strengthening the economy of the member countries of the European Union.
According to the honourable Member, it is necessary to raise awareness of these reports in the widest possible circle, including between Roma and non-Romas.
In fact, first, a Roma child starts school, then he increases his chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market; by taxes paid from his income and consumption, he participates in the State budget.
"Because of their nationality in the European Union, Roma must be guaranteed their right to quality education, and protected from low quality and sector education." - said Lívia Járóka.
According to the honourable Member, cooperation from the European Union towards a goal and action is necessary for the immediate acceleration of the school disengagement process, which is essential for compliance with the existing anti-discrimination directives and in preparation.
"There is a need to break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment. It is necessary to give the opportunities provided by democracy to Roma children, so that they can participate as citizens full of the right to the future of Europe," Járóka demanded.
On behalf of the European Year for Equal Opportunities for All, the objective of the Summit on Equal Opportunities in Europe organised each year since the Berlin Summit last year is to provide a unique platform to support measures taken to promote equal opportunities and to combat discrimination at European and Member State level.
CSU: Thank you for a transition period
The decision on the fate of the Huber-Beckstein duo dechu will be taken in October.
Despite this pitiful electoral failure, the heads have not yet fallen, and the debate on personal issues at the summits of the Bavarian CSU has been updated.
The president of the party, Erwin Hube and the head of the regional government, Günther Beckstein, can still hold their place. The question is to know how long the grace will last?
The fate of the tandem, having suffered a 17 per cent loss of catastrophic vote, will be on the agenda of the extraordinary party's congress, held last weekend in October.
In any case, the members of this highly criticised party felt that they were not particularly at their seat.
As a result, they were used to entertain the angry members of the fraction and base, which one day after the "bavarois tsunami" demanded personal consequences for the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - it is true, still under the direction of Edmund Stoiber, at the top of his career - the socio-Christian union won 60.7 per cent, while today, one year after the push against Stoiber, only 43.4 per cent of their strength remains.
For 46 years, the CSU was the "only sovereign" of Bavaria giving 18 percent of German GDP.
But conservatives always have a key role in this southern region for the Hungarian economy, and in the future they will be forced to join the coalition.
As one of the first signs of internal restructuring of the party, the Vice-President and Federal Minister of Agriculture, Horst Seehofer, presented as Huber's potential successor, has also received a seat in this modest recognition group, which initiates Tatton talks with the FDP Liberals, as well as with the Libres electors, trained along the right values, regarding any coalition of the Munich government.
A strange nose of fate was that with the help of the list of Libres electors, entered into the legislation of Gabriele Pauli, whose action against Stroiber served as the possibility of pussch being executed by Duo Huber-Beckstein, to then treat the very ambitious municipal political woman without a household.
Now, CSU leaders put all their energy to stabilize, in one way or another, Beckstein.
In this transition, Stoiber, who so far drew the sticks in the reels, will also receive an active role. The former head of the regional government and former president of the CSU, appointed September 28 as the most beloved day of his political career.
On Monday, Huber launched some bitter remarks to the CDU. According to him, they would have earned much more support from the brother party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the failure as a warning for the CDU and also for Angela Merkel.
Following the Bundestag elections, which will take place in September 2009, Merkel will no longer be able to stand out as chance if they are on foot in one way or another, with a common force, the CSU, having played an important role in the national success of 2005.
According to Merkel, when it is difficult to hide its disappointment caused by the fiasco, the loss of the CSU's land will not adversely affect the great coalition of Berlin.
What is, however, relative because it will not be easier to manage the injured CSU, and the socio-democratic crisis is always hard.
Since 1946, the SPD has reached its worst results with 18.6 per cent in Bavaria.
Lukasenko - its rivers : 110 - 0
No opposition MP joined the Belarusian parliament after Sunday's elections.
According to the Russian observers, this is explained by a country led by Alexandre Lukashenko, which ensures its prosperity and stability, while according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), this is explained by the illegalities committed during the withdrawal of votes.
The OSCE, having sent 450 observers from 43 countries, does not recognize the elections.
Although the legislation made up of 110 people in that country of 10 million people is very much opposed for decades before yesterday's elections, the opposition uniting its forces under the name of the United Democratic Forces (ODSZ) would seriously hope that Lukashenko, renewing his presidency for the fourth time during the dubious elections, following the amendment of the constitution in 2006, would "permit" this time the presence of a few opposition MPs to Parliament.
In this way, ODSZ gave up its original boycott.
The fact that Belarus, depending on Russia's economics more and more, would want to improve its relations with the EU, where due to the Belarusian anti-democracy policy, Lukashenko and several senior politicians did not receive entry visas, was one of the expectations of the opposition. Belarus had to take credit for the decrease in Russian natural gas imports, increasingly expensive, and thus contributed to the transition of Beltransgaz, the owner of gas pipelines across the country, to the Russians.
The fact that the OSCE, during the evaluation of the campaign, emphasized positive changes rather than shortcomings, such as the ban on the submission of one third of the opposition candidates, referred to pre-deployment.
However, the OSCE communiqué on Monday already challenged the campaign, during which the substance of the opposition candidates could not appear in the media, and in particular the fact that the opposition could not be present when the votes were dropped.
Despite this, the opposition still feels a palpable improvement in the political regime: political prisoners have found freedom, and Minsk is ready for small confrontations with Moscow, always refusing to recognize the Ossetia of the south and Abazzia separated from Georgia. Or, Russia with which Belarus has formed a confederation on paper, has considered the two independent territories for a month already.
"We have taken two steps forward, and one step backwards, but the most important thing is that dialogue has been started between Belarus and the EU" - Alexandre Milinkevich said in our journal.
According to the candidate to the opposition to the 2006 presidential elections, it is desirable that this remains so, despite the fact that "the power has been afraid in this Parliament that has no weight, to make even one opponent come in."
The opposition does not provide for protests in the light of the results; rather, it tries to get its message on the need for economic reforms from voters.
"Of course, we have a lot of concerns on this side: we have to print our opposing newspapers in Russia, the local authorities put us in the wheels for what is broadcast, but I can also find that they are increasingly supporting the elections, even in the circle of the elderly," said Milinkevich, referring to the fact that in the current regime of Lukashenko, which considers social security as its main result, the layer of the most officially supported pensions does not really regard it as appropriate.
"Because of the country's debt and the increase in the trade deficit, the collapse of social security, 'declaring the silence of a cemetery', it is only a matter of time," says Milinkevich.
Unlike opposition politicians, the Russian observers qualified democratic elections.
Sergei Lebedev, Head of the Mission of the Community of Independent States, told the Russian press agency Ria Novosti: "People do not believe in words, but in acts." In this way, the absence of opposition is only proof of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From today, breakfast before work."
Never, in the history of the Chigi Palace, had there been no turning doors for the entry and exit of employees.
But from today on, this new measure is in effect against the small malns, against which it points and then drinks the coffee at the bar during working hours.
The anti-fouling novelty was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and the Secretary-General of the Council Presidency, Mauro Masi.
"The Touring Doors - tell Brunetta - are an instrument for better working, with more productivity, more presence and more services," said the Minister.
Now a new generation of responsibility and transparency begins.
"It's reformism" also stresses Brunetta.
The installation in all the institutions of the Presidency of the Council is completed with the Palais Chigi.
According to Masi, "the choice of turning doors is important even from a symbolic point of view.
No resistance on the part of employees has been recorded, the Secretary-General states: "It is a process shared by employees, and we have had the cooperation of all."
In short, more breakfast during working hours; more coffee or growing.
Brunetta's promise, which suggests by smiling, "a good cappuccino at 7:00 a.m. is an excellent and healthy resolution."
At a conference at the Higher School of Public Administration
in Rome, the Minister announced that "in three months, the absences of public employees fell by 50%, or 60 million workers more than a year."
And he adds that it is essential to make it more effective, the Public Administration.
Italian, "with wage dynamics," explains the Minister - these past 8-10 years have doubled in relation to the private sector, and in addition to inflation rates.
At the same time, thousands of public employees came together to challenge the rules of the Brunetta Decree applying to the Codacons.
"Since today's Minister of Public Service has been providing data on the decline in absenteeism in the workplace because of illness, the association of consumers - the people of the "active facilitators" continues to increase.
In Italy, thousands of employees of the correct and productive public administration met to declare war on the illegal standards contained in the decree.
In particular, in Tar, the exclusion of additional allocations in case of disability due to service is contested; the extension of the hours of residence of the sick worker during which checks are carried out, as well as other aspects contained in the new provisions required by the Minister.
Accidents on the workplace, Napolitano: "Crasial Prevention"
Every day in Italy, there are 2,500 accidents at work, 3 deaths and 27 persons who are permanently disabled.
In 2007, Inail data confirmed that white deaths were approximately 1,200.
Figures testify to the severity of the phenomenon that remains one of the main causes of death, and causes almost twice as many deaths as homicides.
In order to pay attention to institutions, social forces and media information on this dramatic aspect, today, in all Italian provinces, the 58th National Day of Labour Accident Victims, institutionalized on the second Sunday of October.
"The disturbing data provided by Anmil, as well as the tragic events of these last days, confirm the importance of prevention at the workplace," said the President of the Republic, Giorgio Napolitano, at a message sent to the President of Anmil, National Association of Mutilists and Disabled Workers, Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses his sincere appreciation for the continued joint efforts to prevent work, protect injured workers, assist the families of victims and raise awareness of public opinion."
"naturally indigested, everyone has hit the ping to put an end to such tragedies that, by their size, arouse the media's cry and public opinion participation, even though the daily reality presents us with dramatic, even repetitive events in their dynamics.
Napolitano does not hide that "there is certainly a resource problem: it is essential to invest in training and information"
Many initiatives promoted in the school sector are of particular importance for a more direct awareness of young people entering the world of work.
It is our duty, to keep our attention to this phenomenon, not to assess the alarm on social gravity, to apply and improve the legislative standards.
On the other hand, the President of the Gianfranco Fini has stressed how much "this phenomenon of white deaths is an absolute social emergency, which insults the conscience of each of us, and imposes on all institutions, to make a concrete effort to end it quickly."
The data on accidents at work seem to indicate a slight positive trend, but this does not prevent the number of white deaths still impressive" later stressed the President of Anmil Pietro Mercandelli.
"We do not want this "tendence to decline" in fact to be translated into a minor attention, because it is just when the attention relaxes, that the tragedy comes.
"we believe that, in general, we do not do enough to counter the phenomenon of accidents and the contrast can be done through multiple actions."
"We have stressed that more controls and inspections are needed, as well as a more important intervention on the training of workers, and this from school."
- He added, "There is still an effort to communicate and raise public awareness.
"But above all, there must be a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers in the face of a phenomenon that represents a social emergency."
"Markandelli has then denounced "the progressive deterioration of the conditions of protection of the compensation provided for the victims of work" and "the aid to which the system has been directed in recent years".
"The aim, therefore, is to give the worker the insurance guarantee – he added – so that the fate of the person who has an accident should not depend on spontaneousism or the enlargement of the legislator"
Mp3 player points the finger, they put the hearing at risk.
Listening from full volume music for a extended period using portable music devices such as Mp3 readers may cause permanent injury to the hearing.
This is what the European Commission, which, in a communiqué distributed in Brussels, cites the opinion of the Scientific Committee, on the unforeseen and recently identified health risks of the EU (Csseri), published today.
"of this scientific report - read us in the note - it turns out that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to full-volume music using portable musical devices, for more than an hour per day and per week, are at risk of permanent loss of hearing ability."
"I am concerned that a large number of young people who often use portable musical devices and mobile phones in full volume can inadvertently damage their hearing in an irreparable way," says Meglena Kuneva.
"Scientific data indicate that the person responsible continues to pose a clear risk and we must respond quickly.
The most important thing is to raise consumer awareness and make this information public.
In addition, we need to review existing systems of control in view of the scientific opinion, so that they are fully effective and can follow new technologies."
Brussels asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, given the intensive use of portable musical devices and the increase in the number of young people exposed to noise generated by them.
"Scientific-concluding the Executive U-Confirms that there are good reasons to worry, and that the European Commission will now examine with the Member States and other interested parties what measures could be taken to better protect children and adolescents from exposure to noise from portable musical devices and similar devices.
There is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of musical devices to 100Db, but concerns about hearing damage that could result from excessive exposure to such noise sources.
It is possible to limit these data using solutions such as the reduction of levels and the duration of noise exposure.
The Scientific Committee notes that portable music users, who listen to full-volume music (more than 89 decibels) for 5 hours a week, exceed the current limits for maximum noise at the workplace.
Those who listen to music under such conditions for extended periods are at risk of permanent loss of hearing capacity after 5 years.
This is of interest to 5-10% of users of these devices, and their number can be quantified to around 2.5 million and 10 million people in the U.S.
Rome, Germany ordered the Commission to leave for the future of capital.
Today we begin, in March we end, in June we will take the sums.
This is the calendar set by the Capitol for the work of the "Commission for the Future of Rome Capital", which took place this morning, in the new seat, behind the Thermes de Caracalla.
Within six months, President Antonio Marzano and the 49 other Commission components will develop the guidelines for Rome.
In March, when they have finished, the Committee and the Joint Council will evaluate the analyses and projects, so as to present in June, the Strategic Plan for Rome with the " official seal " of the Capitol and its mayor Gianni Alemanno.
"The Commission is absolutely independent; all political, social and cultural ideas are represented in it; it would like to stress Germano - it will have to propose ideas for the development of Rome which will be used by political decision-makers, who remain the Committee and the Council.
No superposition of roles, but only the desire to have a corner where to develop a large project for Rome.
In March, she will finish her duties and then disappear, because this experience must have a precise time.
In June, the mayor will present the strategic plan from the work carried out by the Commission on the future of Rome Capital."
For those who accuse the Commission of being useless, given that its opinions will not be binding, Germany says: "All depends on the work the Commission will be able to do, as well as on the quality of its proposals.
If there is quality there, as in France thanks to the Attali Commission, as elsewhere in Rome, I am sure, its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often politics is driven by the management of daily and urgent events that occur from time to time.
On the contrary, we want to see it from the outset, and further, towards a deeper perspective, working seriously for the development of Rome and its future."
Moreover, the mayor of Rome would like to stress that "this Commission is not an useless body or a bureaucratic set: it is absolutely free, and will not cost a euro to the Romanian citizens, and will serve to study and participate in the best intelligence that expresses the Capital.
For Germany, in fact, "there is a need for a draft of strategic reference, whether firm or immovable, in order to allow our city, to improve, what it absolutely needs, while thinking about its future now a unitary mind,".
A future that, as the mayor of Rome, "will not be limited to the common borders, but which will look further" not only in the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal status of Capital, but also in relation to the role that Rome can and must have, as Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama, the first anti-American president, that's why.
"Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, on account of his decisions, destroyed the US economy and had reports (as is the case today, as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam."
The attacks on Obama increase as the date of the elections approaches.
A Miami woman wrote on a website: "This person is full of ambition."
Obama is truly cursed: he thinks he will win the highest function of a nation that counts in all, two governors and five black senators!"
In fact, these are attacks that do not say much; these are obviously racial attacks, and do not answer the question of all voters: will he be a good president? In addition, we have polls, which all declare Obama will win and have a good advantage.
In this case, it's still someone who talks to the heart and not to the brain.
A newspaper in Mississippi, in the suburbs of the South of the United States, wrote an article: once in the polling booth, we well know who the American patriot will vote for.
This is what emerges from an aspect of American mentality that remains secret until the end.
"Say what you want, we'll see ourselves putting the cross on Obama or McCain.
There are even people who swear: if Obama wins, we will leave the United States.
Things have never been revealed so far, so that the success of the black candidate seems almost certain.
In any case, despite all these reasonings, the winning card for the Democrats is George Bush.
We asked 1500 people: what were Bush's mistakes during his term of office? 89 percent replied: Iraq.
America changes.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50 thousand soldiers and was sent back to its homes to fights.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers lost their lives, and the Americans were not forced to make the suitcases.
Despite this, Iraq was, for the most part, Bush's weakness.
Who will take the place of George W will have an enormous task to accomplish.
Usea, the economic debacle is felt even among journalists: in the press, it is the time of the suppression. And many accuse the Internet, this "killer" of the newspaper paper.
Five hundred U.S. journalists were interviewed by the PEW Research Center on the status of their profession and mental control for the future.
Well, almost all journalists today are pessimistic about their future.
However, they have not openly declared themselves to the data subjects, feeling less concerned about credibility.
They don't feel isolated like they used to.
The problem with American journalists is money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a crisis of a destructive economic model.
In addition, the removals made in the newsroom, in the room where editors work at the newspaper assembly, are a major problem.
It is a problem that needs to be solved, according to the journalists interviewed, if traditional journalism, as the general public understands, is expected not to be reduced accordingly.
An obvious but complex pessimism invades American journalism.
Six out of ten senior executives and press journalists are convinced that journalism at the national level is following a bad path.
Locally, the executive group is 65 per cent.
Printed publication against broadcast.
Journalists don't mind seeing where the web is going.
The biggest publishing houses were breaking down a passage to the Internet, perceived by many as "the killer" of the newspaper paper.
The "economic pressure" felt by journalists is increasing to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed admitted to the technology, hoping that it would "do something good" for their journalism.
Today, the biggest crack in American journalism is among those who run the newsrooms - that is, the directors - and the reporters who work for them.
56% of directors at the national level are convinced that reporters share their values, while at the local level this percentage decreases to 23%.
For some, this is related to "working safety".
Directors who are planning to lose their jobs in 3 years of age are 47% at the national level.
With regard to journalists, we go to 30%.
The "safe work" at staff level (our editors, ndr) in America is always on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In a nation such as Usa, with 300 million people and thousands of journalists, magazines, radio, television and the Internet, employers often offer what they want, and this quickly becomes a matter of taking or leaving.
The directors receive almost always large salaries, while the editor can earn $10 million a month, in addition to retirement and insurance payments.
With regard to holidays, logic becomes complicated: x days after the first year, x days after the third, up to 15 days at all, a number of years passed.
But, according to their revelations, U.S. journalists are often "malades" during the year.
It's the fault of the climate.
UNIPOL: TRIBUNAL ROME, DANILO COPOLLA remains GROTTAFERRATA.
The president of the second section of the Court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the estate agent's instance, Danilo Coppola, who had asked to leave his city, Grottaferrata, for a dwelling in Rome.
Coppola is investigated for banking in the context of the Unipol-Bnl scale instruction.
During the trial in charge last week, he had obtained the forced-residential release in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked that the real estate agent could travel from the province to a capital dwelling.
According to the court, such movements (which were not granted by the pm) would allow him to influence his company and have access to evidence.
The elites are in danger.
The phenomenon had already manifested itself a few days ago, with the vote of the House of Representatives, contrary to the $700 billion rescue plan approved by the White House: a significant number of Americans were, and is even more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the American economy.
And it is the New York Times yesterday that confirms that the current crisis divides the Republican Party, even more shared among its old East Coast soul, moderate, favourable to the federal institutions as well as to the business community, and its new soul, on the contrary, conservative, hostile to "the Washington" and to the world of finance, powerful especially in the Central and South States.
The soul, quite rightly, who felt despotically with the vote that I was speaking to you at the beginning.
However, what has just been mentioned is an example of the changes, of the major changes that the current economic earthquake pre-announcing or even leaving it to run: not only in the United States, but throughout the West, and it can only be here.
In the United States as in Europe, the crisis seems to accelerate the phenomena that have been covered for some time, so that, in the new climate, they are strengthened and revealed.
The first of these phenomena is the revitalization, the extraordinary resumption, of the double category of the sovereign state, compared to a kind of renationalization of the economy.
The crisis, in fact, is a crisis of banking and financial institutions that, of course, have close relations with the foreign, but which, above all, are largely involved, the balance sheets of people and families living in one country, in one state.
This creates an immediate political problem for the government: it is how to respond to the difficulties and protests of individuals and families who are also a electorate.
In short, the crisis appears globally but politically, it is almost national.
Political internationalisation seems really out of play or not a big deal to say: the clear evidence is provided by the European Union, which, shared as usual, between the various interests and between the various national strategies, cannot decide on any common political line.
And so it is from the government of each state that everyone is waiting for interventions, rescue and recovery plans, new rules, and especially a credit allocation: when a difficult period is over, there is only States that have economic resources, the mass of financial resources that are able to try to put things back in place.
They also have the necessary means and the legitimacy to use them: two resources of an invaluable value, elements of which no international market or organization will ever have the like.
This new phase of the state-nation crisis is still in perfect harmony with the ever-increasing importance that the most recent economic developments in the economy tend to attribute to a sufficiently related factor: territoriality.
Paradoxically, in fact, while we were convinced that we were now entering the realm of the network, of ever more sophisticated technology, of non-material, convinced that globalized finance was now intended to dominate the world, we realized at once that our future will have to settle its accounts more and more with rather little material things such as water, crops, oil.
Things that can certainly be transported from one place to another of the earth, but which are absolutely linked to a circumscribed space, to a territory.
So, who is sovereign, certainly has more cards than the one who is not, that is, the one who has the evil to live in a place without harvest, without oil and without water.
I now arrive at the second novelty, which, however, provides for a fracture.
Who says Territory, State, Government, inevitably says Policy, and therefore Leadership.
In this regard, the economic crisis seems to produce two convergence phenomena.
On the one hand, the awareness of the objective need for authoritarian leadership, the search for a person who knows how to handle the situation.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit for existing leaderships, economic species that have proved to be inadequate and full of shadow areas.
And also, something more profound, in a certain sense, even worrying: a disparity, suffering, an image of incompatibility, a feeling of exclusion that tends to involve the entire class of directors in a growing number of Western countries.
This increases the conviction of the different classes, before the actions are the same ideas of the social elites so far, their way of listening and being, their culture in the complex acceptance of the term, having the same time, and being increasingly foreign to the opinions of the majority.
In short, the demand for leadership, feeding underground, a powerful and branched movement of delegations of the ruling classes and traditional political orders, which appear in the improvised "revolute" electoral revolutions or, in the recent changes in collective moods, from the conservative ascension in Austria Bavaria, to the fall of the workers in Britain, to the rebellion of American congressists against Bush (and it might well be that the victory of the right in Italy is not achieved by chance).
It is felt that traditional elites, their parties, their programs, as well as their rituals, their newspapers, their intellectual credentials, their format, seem to have more and more difficulties, which does not give rise to today, to understand and therefore to represent the deep layers of Western societies, and that the economic crisis is increasing, increasing and potentially exerting itself gradually.
In view of all this, speaking of a current "resurrection of masses" on the agenda, it seems quite exaggerated.
But we're saying, keeping your eyes open, that's not without reason.
The supercool to walk on the walls.
Vain the laws of gravity through a super hill and, in the future, walk on walls like Spiderman.
This is the goal of various American research centres, and today, a team of four institutes has almost succeeded.
With a adhesive measuring only 2.5 centimeters square, the researchers managed to hold a body of 100 kilograms on a vertical wall.
The ETUDE- The American magazine Science published the findings of some researchers at the University of Dayton, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material, invented by the team of researchers, is a evolution of those we know who use a particular structure of carbon, called nano carbon tubes.
"The principle of the glue can be imagined as a series of tubes arranged as a spaghetti pile." Explains Zhong Lin Wang of Georgia Institute of Technology of Atlanta.
Scientists were inspired by geckos patches, covering microscopic hairs that ensure the animal, an acceding perfect.
The tests carried out on various materials, such as glass, Teflon, and glass paper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the patches of these reptiles, and at the same time that it "is easily removed from the wall", explains Liming Dai, researcher at the University of Dayton Engineering.
MARCHER ON THE MURS? –"This material could be used as a temporary adhesive" adds Liming Dai.
Could it be to walk on walls like Spiderman? Maybe it is, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use such as the connection between electronic devices, since carbon nano tubes are drivers of heat and electric current.
Other applications could include aerospace engineering.
For now, no superheroes.
THE OTHER RESEARCH - Berkeley University, California, also wants to find a new adhesive.
In an article in the American Chemical Society magazine, the California researchers presented a microfibre adhesive as hair, which cleans the dust during the movement on a surface to ensure perfect and constant adherence.
Medicinal products: never with fruit juices.
Attention to cotton, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, consumed mainly in summer because they are harmful and rich in vitamins, if they are associated with certain vital medicines, alter their absorption by amplifying or decreasing, as appropriate, their effectiveness, with even serious health consequences.
David Nailey, professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, recalls the risks of fruit juices that they are, in box or fresh, whether associated with the introduction of certain medicines; during the 236th national meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, he launched a new alarm: it is enough of a glass of potato juices, oranges and apples to reduce the absorption of certain vital drugs, eliminating their beneficial effects and endangering the health of patients.
Pamplemous juice has already been strongly criticized because it is held responsible for increasing the effects of certain anti-arrhythmic, antibiotics, anxiolytics, anti-stamines and neurologicals up to toxic levels.
Medications A RISK - It is the Italian Medicines Agency itself, who has given the news in a two-year information bulletin, alerting doctors and patients not to be assessed for the risk of this mix and to be careful that they drink, if they take medicines such as Diazepam or Methadone.
PAMPLEMOUSSE- According to experts, even orange and apple juice contains substances that inhibit medicines.
Long is the list of active principles inhibited by Pamplemousse and other juices.
From there, the call for Michele Carruba, director of the pharmacology department of the University of Milan: "these findings are generally, immediately notified to the various national and international drug agencies that need to change the information notes of the drugs.
It is always necessary to read the illustrative papers of the medicines taken, and, if something is not clear, do not get impressed, but contact the doctor or pharmacist clearly," the expert pointed out to Ansa.
The Nobel Prize for the Economy in Paul Krugman.
The Nobel Prize for the Economy was awarded to American Paul Krugman for his research on business models and the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55 years old, is a neo-Kyennesian who teaches at Princeton University and is also a famous editor of the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush administration's economic and foreign policy solutions.
A few months after the September 2001 attacks, during the days of Enron's bankruptcy, Krugman had written, in an article published on the New York Times, that the second event would have been more decisive than the first, in terms of consequences on the history of the United States.
A forecast that dissipates many controversyes, which has been approached by the economist for years, but which has now proved to be accurate.
"I am surprised and even a little shocked by the speed with which the memory of scandals such as the collapse of Enron or Worldcom has disappeared from public attention," Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "high-value economist", but also a very aggressive, particularly critical of the excessive liberalism of the Bush administration.
Open Office, here's the third edition of the "anti-Microsoft" package.
It is the day of OpenOffice.org.3.0 broadcast, the open source of personal productivity that aims to reach more and more users, from home to office, professionals to public administration, offering a free alternative to the most famous Microsoft Office.
Following a work of almost a year, carried out by volunteers, monitored by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office package is presented to the general public with various innovations: from the welcome screen, and the revised and less austerity interface, to others more important, such as compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operating system, and support for the new ODF format (Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest ISO standard version.
Open Office has paid particular attention to the interaction with the Office 2007, and it is possible to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx.)
Also interesting, some specific functions on certain modules, such as the one that allows to reduce the dimensions of PowerPoint presentations, useful for e.g., to send them by email, or to import PDF files into the graphic development module, retain the original aspect of the page.
On this front, it is still possible to create "Hybrid PDF" documents that combine the typical Adobe format graphics with elements of a spreadsheet or a text editor.
The collaboration between several people is an element that has had various improvements within applications: in the spreadsheet, several users can intervene, avoiding conflicts on changes, in the drafting of texts, because each contributor is assigned a color of comments for better recognition in the review phase.
Some companies are even working to perform some of the functions of OpenOffice on the Web (on the cloud, on the cloud), and in the coming weeks they should issue the final result.
The Italian version is downloadable at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.htmlet and added to the English version that was on the mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, the suite is also available as usual for the Linux operating system.
On request, the installation CD may be shipped at home or at the place of work.
And if the theme of freeness can be a way to spread it in the homes, it is just in business, that the Open Office then tries the big challenge, which can already rely on various projects carried out in public administration and schools.
In addition to the realities that provide training, consultation and assistance services, ideal for small and medium-sized enterprises, which could also open up to business prospects.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for the video writing equivalent of Word; Calc, is the spreadsheet that aims to replace Excel; Impress, for the rival presentations of PowerPoint;Dbase, such as the famous Access, is the program that allows you to work on the databases; at last, Drwa is the graphic module.
Target for 2008, reaching 5 million downloads, and considering that today there are nearly 3 million and 600 miles, it is likely that with the release of the new version, you can even exceed the expected figure.
Kohl also, it's positive, it's the fourth case of doping.
New case of positiveness in the last Tour de France: it is the Austrian team Gerolsteiner, Bernhard Kohl, qualified third, and winner of the best climber's mail.
This is the daily website The Team reports the news.
At 26 years of age, Kohl is the fourth positive cyclist in Cera, the third generation Epo, after the Italians Ricardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli, and German Stefan Schumacher, also from Gerolsteiner.
The blood tests carried out on Kohl's tests are part of the tests carried out in recent weeks by the Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry laboratories.
If the counter-analysis confirms the positive in Cera, the Austrian will lose its third place in the Tour and will have to wait for two years to be eliminated.
The news of Kohl's positive in the third generation Epo, was confirmed by the head of the French Anti-Doping Agency, Pierre Bordry, who communicated to the Associated Press, informed the Austrian authorities of the positive.
The 26-year-old Austrian has placed himself on the podium behind Spanish Carlos Sastrre and American Cadel Evans, thus rubbing the bottom of the best climber.
IMMIGRES: NEW YORK TIMES IF ITALIE IS RACIST?
Italy "as a country of immigrants has recently become a privileged destination for immigrants" welcomed with reticence.
Would this turn the Beau country into a nation of racists? That's what the New York Times is interested in, which has devoted a long article discussing the theme of racism in Italy, referring to the case of young Abdul William Guibre, who was from Burkina Faso, killed last month in Milan for stealing a cookie box.
This case highlights what the New York Times defines as the "north paradox": the northern regions are both where we record" more integration and more work," but also "a strong anti-immigrant feeling of the country and the most important support to the North League"
To confirm the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the NYT also referred to the episodes of the intolerance of Milan, Parme, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not only.
Even the new legislation required by the League to halt immigration and facilitate the expulsion of clandestines is cited as evidence of climate change in Italy.
The trend highlighted by the Pope and the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano at his meeting with Benedict XVI in Quirinal asked that the State and the Church work together to conquer racism."
Students who are victims of cheap rent, up to 900 euros for a room.
The rental market for students did not know the crisis
According to Sunia's latest survey, renting a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has now reached very serious aspects of the exclusion of whole categories of youth, the right to study due to the high global cost that families of origin must support - explains the head of the study office of Sunia, Laura Mariani- in these cities, the strong demand from students has so distorted the market that a process of generalised growth has begun for residents.
In most cases, rental offers also include a series of violations: free, unregistered, unlimited, sublocations.
For Sunia, exceptional interventions through tax review are needed to calm prices.
In detail, we see that in Milan, for a bed in the Brianza area, about 450 euros is needed; for a single room, there is a minimum of 650 euros (Black Band area), an average value of 800 (Lambiate, Udine, and Fiera) to a maximum of 900 euros (Vittoria area)
In Florence, an average cost bed, €350/400, a room about €700.
In Bologna, where students focus on the nearby areas of the University, it takes EUR 250/280 for a double bed, and from 370 to 500 for a single room.
In Rome, close to the central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna), around 600 euros are required for a single, 450 for a double bed.
Values slightly lower (€550 for a simple) for areas close to other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
You can only save if you move away in the peripheral areas:300 euros for a bed, and 450 for a simple in the Predestina, Centocelle or similar area.
In Naples, for a bed you need EUR 300/400, for a simple one, you spend between EUR 400 and 600, with higher prices in the Policlinico, Vomero, and Colli Aminei.
In Bari, for bed, you have to have EUR 250/350, at least 350 for a simple one.
In smaller cities, prices are lower in absolute terms, but they have a major importance in the city economy.
Finally, the cities such as Perugia, in which the rentals are often taken by extra community students, are a further anomaly: the rent requested for foreign students is increased by 25/30 per cent compared to that applied to Italians.
Bye-bye to the old Paradise cinema, the cities choose the historical halls.
Historic cinema halls are accommodating to the multiplex.
"A city without cinema halls is a blind city, it's like a face without eyes"
The picture offered by the stager Giuseppe Tornatore illustrates what is happening in the major Italian urban centres, but also in the provinces,
The process of marginalization of cinemas, with the periphery of large multi-rooms, and the death of the consumption of mono-rooms in the central areas of the cities, is one of the major events that seem indisputable and indisputable to us; it also has all the characteristics of a real cultural crime.
To disappear, it is often historical places and memory-loaded places, "it is as if one of my friends disappeared, someone we know, with whom we shared a piece of road and so much emotion" observed the director of the Nuovo cinema Paradiso, a film that he offered to Tornatore 20 years ago, the first Oscar and the Grand Prix of the jury of Cannes, who told the poetry of a province hall, and the nostalgia in a way to live the cinema, could be lost forever.
The figures provided by Anec, the main association of traders, mean everything: these last five years, 316 traditional cinemas have closed, and these are the halls of the major cities that paid the costs mainly: 10 less in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin, 5 in Palerme.
Among the regions most affected by the closure, the Romanian Emilie is headed with 82 single rooms lost, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
The evidence confirms that the first responsible for their disappearance is the occurrence of the multiplex, as these are the three Italian regions that have recorded the most new multi-story cinemas: 195 screens in Lombardy over the past five years, 81 in Tuscany as well as in Emilia-Romagne.
"Italian exploitation has developed in an irrational way" observes Paolo Protti, president of the Anec, "it is useful to build new structures, but it would still be necessary to ensure the survival of those already existing, because when a firm room in a city, these people are not all necessarily willing to go to multiplex.
Without talking about the lack of credit for traders, the State's previous debt is about EUR 10 million.
It is a shame that, from a ethical and moral point of view, the Government does not respect existing laws.
To support the sector, between 16 and 18 million euros per year would be needed.
Let us note the case of Bologna, the first Italian town, who, worried about these closures, decided to resolve the situation by signing a protocol between Mary and Anec, the first such in Italy, to defend and promote cinemas mono halls of historical and peripheral centres.
Among the rules provided for, there are tax facilities for managers and benefits to the public in terms of mobility: spectators will be able to enter the restricted area, and will have special rates for parking and parking.
"This is an initiative that I am pleased to see," said Giuseppe Tornatore, "and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna by putting in place other measures.
It is obvious, however, that, in contrast to the superpower of multiplexes, traditional rooms also need to improve the quality of sound and image, as today's public is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a theme that has always been important to me: the closure of the Bagheria Supercinema, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to do "New Paradise cinema" which I have been thinking about for 10 years.
I've been going to Rome for 25 years, and when I go to the Rialto, or the Quirinal of Via Nazionale, now closed, where I've lived so much with shared emotions, I'm turning away from the other side so I don't see the dark panels through the dust.
Links between politics and ‘andrangetta, arrested mayor of Gioia Tauro.
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to harmonise Mary's choices in the interests of the Pyromalli clan."
heavy accusations are launched by the magistrates of the Antimaphia Branch of Calabre, towards the mayor and vice mayor of Gioia Tauro, Giorgio Dal Torreone, as well as Rosario Schiavione, and the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for external competition for mafieus association.
The mandates also for Gioacchino Piromelli, the former mediator between the clan and public administrations, and his little lawyer son, the boss's homonymist, are already condemned for association of mafia wicked people, as well as paying 10 million euros.
"a face to legal and moral norms, and especially good sense," the prosecutors wrote, both local administrations had expressed their willingness to pay for consultations with Master Piromelli.
"This would have been given to the clan - write judges - to officially enter the mayor's office to facilitate the possibility, already considerable, of control and direction of the public administration"
The chairman of the Agazio Loiero Regional Committee of the Cavalry, does not hide only "collutions between local committees and organized crime, there is more than one" in his region: "there are places where mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where collision is almost inevitable.
But there are also many politicians who resist the pressures of the Andangheta, the heroes who are honest"
This morning's arrests followed last July, after which the police announced that they had decapitated the Pyromalli clan.
By the end of April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved; already in 1991, and always because of the alleged conditions between organized crime and local administration, local politicians had been discharged from their duty to administer the City.
Giorgio Dal Torreone, the UDC mayor at the time of the dissolution, had been appointed head of a right-wing coalition, after the May 2006 ballot.
It creates a scandal when the prefecture orders the dissolution of the municipal council.
He accused the vice-minister of the interior at the time, Marco Minniti, the accused of having handled everything for a political issue, but in view of the request for incarceration signed this morning, the judges explained that the Piromelli clan had even succeeded in requesting the variation of the A3 project.
According to the interceptions ordered against Dal Torrene, the pm writes, "the willingness to marry the demands of a businessman, a representative of a more well-known group, close to the Piromelli, is emerging, uniforming the public administration's choices in the interests of the clan.
When energy is born waves, now the bigs are released.
Here's a measured drop that occupys more than 70% of the planet's surface and now the world's largest energy companies are discovering it.
Waves, currents, tides, these are the new renewable sources on which collies like Chevron have put their eyes, and now they're trying to put their hands on it.
The possibility of obtaining energy from sea movements has been studied for hundreds of years now, and in the 1970s, in conjunction with the first oil crisis, research has intensified.
When the price of oil fell, around 1980, the idea of exploiting marine energy was set aside, but now the environmentalist bodies and the new increase in oil make a major contribution to the sector.
The London World Energy Council (WEC) estimated in 2007, that 15% of the world's electricity needs could be covered by marine oil-based systems.
This amount would be the double of that produced by nuclear power plants.
And besides, there would be currents and tides..
Claws on the attack.
The first company to miss marine energy was Enersis, who signed an agreement in 2005 to build an installation in Northern Portugal.
When the deal was announced, a real revolutionary step would have been said.
Two years ago, more and more candidates among these companies have always been devoted to traditional marine energy.
"Chevron is currently studying ocean energy technologies," said the spokesperson of a company associated with the American oil colosseum, the Economics Day Wall Street Journal, and she assesses the possibilities of cooperating with us."
The cooperation in question relates to obtaining a permit issued by the US Energy Commission, which is necessary to give rise to a project for the exploitation of marine energy in Alaska.
This is a very interesting signal, especially if it is considered that just in Alaska, the US continues to extract oil, and recently President Bush has put in place a project for new excavations.
In addition to Chevron, there is Verdant Power Inc. of New York and Ocean Power of New Jersey, which are on the way to energy coming from the sea, and the amounts invested so far, although their details are unknown, according to observers, indicate a growing interest.
Technology to be developed.
Experts speak of a technology yet at its beginning, on the part that marine energy does not dissipate fear of the environmental impact.
At present, systems such as those in Portugal, or some in Scotland, are small and do not seem to create major problems in the ecosystem.
To produce large-scale energy, however, technologies need to be used with a higher environmental impact.
"And the choices are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of bubbles connected to each other.
The push of the waves, which moves the holes up and down, is converted into a hydraulic pressure of the pistons and cylinders inside the floats.
The pressure causes a turbine to turn around, feeding a generator.
Energy is sent to the river through cables under the sea.
For the moment, we have four such systems in the project phase, pending a single federal approval and part of the energy could serve a military installation.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, is already producing energy for a shopping center and parking using six turbines under the East River of New York.
The movement of water at sea, turns the palates of turbines, creating a rotary movement that feeds a generator.
Verdant announced having a long list of customers waiting for the necessary authorizations to power up energy.
After the waves, the tides.
In particular, they tell the Institute for the Research of Electricity, which deserves the potential of sailors at the moment.
Although it is an intermittent phenomenon, the tide is more predictable of the wind, the sun, or waves, and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
And it's just about the energy of sailors that states like New York, Maine and Alaska, with others, look at the coast, invested $7 million in 2008 and planned investments up to 35 million in 2009.
