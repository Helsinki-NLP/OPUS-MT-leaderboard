Triomphs of right-wing populists in Austria, they have 29 percent total
According to preliminary results, the early parliamentary elections in Austria led to a significant weakening of the two parties forming the current large coalition, as well as a significant strengthening of the populist parties.
The Austrian People's Party (ODP), where the position of current President Wilhelm Molterer is seriously threatened, suffered particularly significant losses.
On the other hand, the EU electoral leader for the future of Austria (BZÖ), Governor of Carinthia Jörg Haider, prepares a triumphal return on the political scene at the national level.
According to preliminary results, the Socialists (SPÖ) remained, with 29.8 per cent of the votes, the country's first political force, however, compared to the 2006 elections, and lost 5.5 per cent of the votes.
The OVP, which lost nearly nine percent of the votes by 25.6 percent, ended even worse.
These are the worst results of the two major post-war parties, especially for the popular party, which triggered the early elections, the result is literally catastrophic.
In early July, when the OVP left the coalition, the popular party had a considerable advance on the SPÖ.
However, the electorate is apparently horrified to have let the government collapse.
From the first reactions to the results, speculation regarding the possible resignation of the leader of the party and current vice-chairman Wilhelm Molterer was expressed.
Observers believe that this could happen on Monday at the special board of directors.
Such a change would facilitate a priori approach to the outcome of the most likely election outcome, namely the renewal of the large SPÖ and ÖVP coalition.
However, given the strengthening of the two right-wing populist parties - the books (FPÖ) would have gained 18 per cent and BZÖ eleven per cent of the votes - the Socialists at the same time expressed the fear of a repetition of 1999, when the popular party agreed with the populists (at that time the FPÖ was still unified, it was in 2005 that the BZÖ separates itself) on a common government, which even triggers sanctions on the part of the European Union.
Haider, who has already stated that he was ready to work with any party and that he intended to return to Vienna, on the national political stage, apparently on this trend.
The last party to have access to Parliament is the Greens, but they have slightly lost and have fallen, amongst the Austrian political parties, from the third to the fifth.
Of course, no other party crossed the limit of four per cent and did not reach Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India are at risk of cooling
If the problem could not be resolved with regard to the Czech researchers accused in India of illegal cafarding, the Czech Minister for Foreign Affairs, Karel Schwarzenberg, would have followed a certain cooling of the Czech-Indian relations.
The Minister will declare it today in New York after meeting his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee.
"If the problem was not resolved, then yes, some cooling would happen," he noted after the meeting, followed by a Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said, as a matter of fact, that the executive could hardly intervene in judicial matters.
However, he mentioned that in the case of Petr Szvácha, who was dismissed from the charge and punished by a fine, the central government could negotiate with the local government, that of Darjeling, the case being placed under the jurisdiction of the latter.
"His problem could be solved," said the Minister.
According to Mukherjee, the best solution for Emil Kučera, sentenced to three years in prison, would be to appeal to a higher court.
Therefore, he could demand bail and wait for the trial to be released, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirms that his partner expresses himself in the same way during the talks.
"He advises to appeal to a higher court, as a result of what he might be grateful for," said the head of the Czech diplomacy.
The only way in which the Czech side can intervene in this case is to provide judges with "competent legal support", says the Indian Minister.
He also said that such assistance had already been provided by India.
"We wish above all to maintain the best relations with India, which have a tradition that continues over many years.
The Indians also recognize it," Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as he said to the Czech Republic, he stressed in front of his partner that the Czech Republic attached great importance to the problem of Czech entomology.
"We consider the incarceration and accusation of these Czech researchers to be a great shame," he said.
The Minister denied the question as to whether he had obtained from India the promise to take care of the case.
"I have already received a quite large number of promises," he says, "only.
A Czech Arbitrary fight for the seabed
It is approaching a walled electronic map on which Australia and adjacent marine areas are represented.
However, he was not interested in the continent, but a little lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia, as well as the adjacent seabed.
However, this area is as large as the continent itself," said Italian jurist Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of the team of the thirty members of the United Nations Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea.
His head, the director of the division, the Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, follows the presentation and complete time to another.
The burning of work and enthusiasm characterizes the reigning atmosphere.
The seabed hides a little known world so far, rich in natural resources.
Oil, minerals and other mineral resources can be found there, but also living organisms for the unknown moment, which may contain the key to the development of a drug against cancer.
A Wider Background to End Earth
The littoral states have begun to vesicularly in the new subterranean territories from our day.
According to a United Nations convention, they enjoy their rights, on which they agreed in 1982 at Montego Bay in Jamaica.
This is mainly the area of what is called the continental shelf, which is often extended to several hundred kilometres from the country's coast.
The latter may, under the Convention, only claim all the resources of the continental shelf.
"To simplify, it is considered as a continental shelf the part of the seabed and its sub-floor, which constitutes a natural extension of the continent under the sea.
It extends beyond the limits of the coastal sea, often also beyond the two hundred thousand marines that represent the latter an exclusive economy," explains Mikulka.
The request that the country concerned submits to the Commission for the establishment of the external borders of the continental shelf must be supported by a broad scientific and technical documentation based on large-scale prospecting and cost-effective metrics.
It is the result of several years of preparatory work.
"One of our roles is to provide the Commission with legal and scientific assistance.
To date, the Committee has dealt with five requests from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
For the time being, only the last three countries mentioned have been successful," Mikulka adds.
Australia's success, which is the first to have significantly expanded its submarines, has recently experienced a global decline.
New Zealand, too, has won from the territory - the extent of the seabed, which the Commission assigned to it last week, is 1.6 million square kilometers, representing the extent of the country multiplied by six.
The two countries invested millions of dollars in prospecting.
The benefit they will derive in the future of the exploitation of the seabed will, as they intend, be invaluable.
In progress, other countries will submit their requests in turn.
They can do so within ten years of ratifying the "Montego Bay Convention".
There, where the continental shelf ends, the ocean floor area begins, proclaimed by the "common patrimine of humanity".
There, no state enjoys an exclusive position.
The right of extraction in this area is granted by an international institution established by convention.
"Nonetheless, we don't cheat on it, the seabed is not a Klondike," he said, exaggerating Director Mikulka, stating that "its areas are precisely defined and their regime anchored in a contract".
Czech Republic in the Pacific
Part of the seabed also belongs to the Czech Republic today.
It shares it with other States of the former bloc of Eastern countries within the framework of the common organization "Interoceanmetal".
In 1991, under the Convention, as well as the investors of some other States, the status of the one called "a pioneer investor" was obtained.
It has the right to extract in the ClarionClipperton area in the Pacific Ocean, located between Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands and the Kiribati.
The area envisaged by the investor slightly exceeds the area of ex-Czechoslovakia.
The background is moved there, it's a kind of submarine replica of the Tatras.
"It is possible to extract it from an area with a total area of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area represents a rich cast in polymetallic concretes containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," says Ind Pakshi Rajan, another lawyer.
Rober Sandev, a Macedonian division employee, provides an example of this.
She remembers a small potato of earth, or, with a little imagination, the mythical show, which, according to legend, animated the Golem.
German special forces were in place for the release of hostages
The Egyptian government had requested Germany's help in resolving the hostage crisis - the experts have come.
When the situation became serious, the special units were ready but never took action.
More and more details on the circumstances of the release of eleven European tourists from Egypt are revealed.
According to the instructions of the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Defence, the German special forces also participated indirectly in the rescue operation.
For example, both federal army specialists and GSG 9, the Federal Police Air Force and the Federal Criminal Police Office, as well as logistics experts from Technische Hilfwerk, were in place of release.
As the spokesperson of the Ministries communicated to him on Monday night, the German forces were not finally required, the hostages had released their prisoners and had fled when they recognized the imminent release by force.
The Egyptian government would have accepted the aid offered by Germany to integrate it on-the-spot as a support force.
"It was not fortunate enough to do so," said a spokesperson of the Federal Interior Ministry.
The attackers had removed in southern Egypt the group of tourists composed of five Germans, five Italians, a Romanian, and their eight Egyptian companions.
After their kidnapping in the desert south of Egypt, the hostages were transferred to the border area between Egypt, Libya, the Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the hostage takers has so far remained vague, as have the details of the release or possible ransom payments.
In the meantime, those who have been saved have arrived healthy and in Cairo.
Steinmeier stated that the freed hostages were under the protection of the German Embassy.
He said nothing about the details of the release.
For the time being, no information was given on the date of their return to Germany.
According to the magazine "Bild", the five vacationers and the special forces should have withdrawn on board an Airbus from the Air Force and arrived in Germany on Tuesday.
The House of Representatives of the United States refuses the rescue plan
The first chamber of the U.S. Congress had recently failed the financial markets saving plan of $700 billion.
The Dow Jones was tearing up in the abyss.
By 227 votes to 206, the House of Representatives of the United States rejected the rescue plan for the financial markets of the Government.
Despite all the appeals made by the President of the United States of America George W. Bush and the political men at the head of the two parties, the program that was supposed to undermine the chaos of financial markets did not win the majority.
In a dramatic maneuver, the participants had desperately tried to convince the opponents of the well-founded $700 billion heavy plan.
Barney Frank, one of the democratic representatives during the debate, had called on Members to vote in favour, although the plan was unpopular.
"It is difficult to have political recognition for avoiding something that has not yet happened," he said.
During the vote, Dow Jones fell by more than six percent or 600 points.
The reason for this was the concern of investors that the state rescue plan could have.
It was not long before the end of the vote, and then, after the failure was announced, it fell again.
Experts are now designing new serious turbulences in international financial markets.
In order for the programme to enter into force, approval and the House of Deputies and Senate are required.
Organizers report a growing number of reservations
This should be a good winter for German travel agencies:
In the case of reservations for the following months according to a study, the case figure has increased significantly compared to the previous year - for the winter season, even more than 30 per cent.
Despite low economic prospects, German travel thirst remains unsatisfying according to this study.
With regard to the winter season reservations, travel agencies recorded a turnover of more than 31 per cent over the same period the previous year, as the German Federation of Travel Agencies (DRV) entrusted to Berlin on Monday.
According to the survey by the Research Institute of Markets GfK, increasing booking figures already dominate the autumn months.
Thus, the sales figure would have risen to about 11 per cent compared to 2007, according to the RDV.
The sources of these results are the figures of the GfK, which analyses monthly booking data of 1200 travel agencies and makes estimates for the global market.
Travel reservations made since the end of August 2008 would be recorded.
Due to the low dollar rate, travel to the United States would be particularly requested, the RDV said.
There, the increase in reservations would be about a third.
In addition, Spain, Turkey and Greece as well as our opposite would be destinations specifically sought by the Germans.
The specially organized travels are very requested, explained the president of the DRV Klaus Laepple.
In view of the rising prices of energy and food products, the costs would be "more easily calculated for the customer than for an individually organized trip".
Consumers can save money, among other things, by reducing early bookings or all inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
The summer months have also been very high so that an increase in sales figures will be re-registered compared to last year - although according to another study, the number of Germans who took a trip has fallen compared to the previous year.
My first time at the beer party
Ballermann's or Apres-Ski's hits are on the move, beer in litres and celebrities in Tyrolean costumes to design.
A beer party event.
Suzanne Kronzucker and I, we don't actually have much in common.
She is blonde, television animator and wears a fine-sized Tyrolean costume.
I've got dark hair, I'm a student, and my dress is an opportunity.
But one thing relates to us: only three minutes at the beer party, and already the photographers are throwing on us and filling their memory card - very flattering, and that's my first visit to the beer party.
That's how we make friends.
The good market Tyrolean costume seems to reach its goal.
As a tourist of the beer festival and normally living in the north of the equator of the Weißwurst, my sense of well-being in the traditional costume was so far limited.
But once on the Thérèse place, it's half worse.
Each or almost wears a Tyrolean costume or leather pants; no one has the air blown or hurt with shame - it is completely normal.
Only the table of my Tyrolean costume collects a few weird eye drops at the chocolate banana stand.
A Bavarian woman made me note that I would have misattached my table: "on the left is free, in the middle of the virgin, in the right-married, in the rear of the widow."
Discreetly, I trim my back loop on the left.
"That's better," she said, and laughed.
Others do not give themselves so bad for these technical subtles of flirting and wear simple pets, on which it is written "Too drink to get dressed!" and exposes us their naked rear without being invited.
The young man to the exhibitionist attitude is called Bob, who comes from England and comes for the first time at the beer party.
He finds it "gorgeous", with a "oooo" extended.
He tells me all of this after he's relieved of the chop he's been drinking before.
Right next to this fire mouth that everyone thinks is a garbage.
So Bob is one of those sadly famous "wild players".
Others do not have the chance to get rid of alcohol in this way.
At eight o'clock in the evening, rescuers' backpacks run to the place of the party and must take care of poor drinkers.
The nurses, rather, intervene in a bribe - always by four, draw their cover of tent tents.
This works for most visitors to the beer party: we go empty, we come back full.
Those who rest in the circle of the burrows under the bay are not visible.
"These are the ones who can't go down any more," she calls me one of the rescuers in answer to my question and then disappears in the mill.
Police-identified accident victim
A 63-year-old pedestrian died at the hospital after being hit by a vehicle was identified.
Carole Paulson, from Chelmsford Road to Brentwood, was involved in the Friday afternoon accident in town on Shenfield Road.
She was transported to Queen's Hospital, Romford, but died there.
As a result of the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested because he was suspected of dangerous conduct.
He's been released since, under bail.
Turkey expands its diplomatic horizons.
As long as Turkey did not intend to join the European Union, the European powers were eager to enter its country-by-country background.
On the east side of Bosphore, at 20 can not be, from Asia, one of the finest remains of his imperial ambition is destroyed.
The Hydarpasha Station was designed in a neo-renaissance style, by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu.
That's at least what the guides tell us.
The monument is situated at the bottom of the platforms, surrounded by observation towers at each of its corners, like certain German provincial lodges.
The stones are salty.
The whole building is in ruins.
But once inside the billet we no longer have any doubts about the size of the company, which represents a move to the west.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German association, the Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, a delay in the game of imperialism, wanted to achieve its medieval ambitions of domination through this railway that arrived in Damascus, Baghdad and has the most known land under the name of Saudi Arabia.
But German imperialist ambitions broke out during World War I.
His railways were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his Arab irregulars.
The relative isolation of its region around it, which was created by the frozen borders of the Cold War, is over.
The British and the imperial forces further advanced Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies outside Palestine and Syria.
But there was also bad news for the Hyderpasha Station.
In 1917, an explosive ammunition train destroyed its subtle roof.
Turkish sources say it's a sabotage.
Since then, she has slowly fallen into ruin, entrapped in the middle of history.
Today, however, the rail crossing to Anatolia and all the eastern points, at least symbolically, highlights the expansion of Turkey's diplomatic horizons.
The Justice and Development Party, the AKP, has created a new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation of its region around it, born by the frozen borders of the Cold War
Now is the time for a new commitment policy.
The Turkish government has remarkable relations with Israel and Syria, the Palestinian factions Hamas and Fatah, Iran and Iraq, and of course with the European Union and the United States.
To judge the parameters of this new foreign policy, I boarded a car in the direction of Turkish capital, Ankara, to visit the Turkish MP AKP Suât Kiniklioglu, one of the experts in foreign policy.
The next morning, after a 10-and-a-half-hour trip, driven on noisy rails whose cadence reminded the old world of the famous documentary The Night Mail, I finally arrived in the Turkish capital- presented as a new city of a new secular state, turning back to its German past.
But the AKP with its well-known Islamic roots is an example of a change in Turkish consensus.
He suspected the West, and especially in Washington.
A taxi accompanied me to the AKP headquarters, an ultra-modern structure, specifically built in stones and steel, in a developing district, surrounded by half-built commercial centres and many pastries in which middle managers in custom-cravate-men and women meet for morning business.
Suat Kiniklioglu could have been a right-wing politician from any other party in Europe.
Costume, tie and he even has a Black Berry.
" The purpose of this foreign policy is to reintegrate Turkey now into its immediate neighbourhood.
The Cold War was an anomaly" he said.
Turkey has been cut off from its back country.
Now she has to look east and west at the same time.
That wasn't the case with each other.
She had to do both.
"But, here's a moment, "I asked whether Turkey should not choose?"
"Turkey," he said, "doesn't want to choose between the two."
He then highlighted an aspect that almost all those with whom I was able to talk, I was heartened to say: the Turkish railway goes not only to the Middle East, but also to the Caucasus, and around the Black Sea, it is therefore an advantage for Europe and the United States as well as for Turkey itself.
With Turkey's integration, the message seems to draw a Europe that travels metaphorically on the rails to Asia and the Middle East.
Back at Hydarpasha station, after another night without sleep, I reminded these two Germans, Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, who followed the construction of this building 100 years ago.
They would have been surprised to see that the European ambitions of the Middle East could, in large part, be found in the hands of Turkey.
While I was waiting for the terminal, the ferry to cross the Bosphore, I remembered the period during which Turkey was named "the disease of Europe".
At least there is no doubt about the continent that could claim this fascinating country.
Memories of Vernon Handley, and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown wrote: Guildford's musical director since 1962, Vermon "Tod" Handley (decided on 11 September) was responsible for Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
Making part of his musical project for the city, he founded the following year, the fantastic heart of young people, Proteus.
The heart was supposed to include at least 21 years of age, but before Proteus could not sing his last song in 1979, many of us who had been more than 20 years of age refused to give up the heart.
The name "Proteus" (which changed in shape according to mythology) represented the will and the ability of the heart to manage any kind of music that was presented to him, whether it was madrical or Messianic.
The musical versatility produced by such a young heart was often impressive, always exciting, thanks to the inspiration of one man, and his enthusiasm for music, which remained constant throughout the years.
Remember how much Tod was telling us to "let music speak for herself".
He would have said, "The composer knows what he wants."
It's all there in music.
So sing!"
His boutique technique was absolutely clear, precise, even if it was never dictatorial or apparent.
Whatever the music standard, it was much higher.
John Frayn Turner wrote:
If a driver was to be appointed knight, it's Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the decades from 1962 to 1982, when he was driving Guildford Philharmonic.
In the last 40 years, I've seen more than a hundred of his concerts, and I can honestly say that none of them ever disappointed me-- and sometimes they even inspired me.
Tod Handley had so rare this combination of personal size and modesty.
He hated drivers who, according to him, "focused only on some people".
He's gonna miss a lot of us.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett wrote:
Your necrology by William Woodruff (decided on 25 September) states that "in 1946 he resumed his studies in economic history in Oxford, and in 1950 became a member of Houblon-Norma research, while he was doing a BSc, a MA and a PhD".
That's what came from the author of Woodruff in Beyond Nab End, but that's not right.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a professor in economic history at Nottingham University, and at the same time he completed a PhD thesis on the British plastic industry under the supervision of Professor J.D. Chambers; he was then published in 1958 under the title The British Rubber Industry.
In the 1950s and 51s in the United States, he studied at Hoblon Norman, and in the summer of 1952, at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham for Illinois.
The reason Woodruff chose to dissimulate this part of his past remains unknown.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philosophy
"I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino " the Flamenco and life " because his black and white photographs, a documentary style, are fantastic.
They drew me to the attention of their simplicity and strength and because they always treat the protagonists with much respect.
An exhibition that conveys a lot of feelings.
Resino knows how to capture magical moments."
Second taste for the super sales of Honda
In November Honda will begin the commercialization of the second generation of the Jazz model.
If its predecessor already had a good habitat, this new monovolume has an even wider internal space.
In addition to this, a few refined mechanisms, which increase the comfort of conduct and make it possible to save more essence.
A change in the face of a revolution.
That's the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although the new Honda Jazz aesthetically presents a very similar line to the previous model, the changes introduced in this monovolume are numerous.
Among them is an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new engines.
However, before considering the new model, it should be noted that this new Honda Jazz arrives six years after the first generation market.
First, it is noted that Honda has renewed this model within a shorter time than that of other manufacturers.
Although in Europe, Honda Jazz is less known, this model is a sales phenomenon in other markets.
This is the case in Japan, where Honda Jazz was the most commercialized car in 2002 and 2008 as well.
In Japan, almost a million Honda Jazz have been sold since its launch.
The Old Continent, with more than one million cars sold in six years, is in second place.
However, Honda claims that this new Jazz will allow it to increase its sales in Europe.
Thus, while the Japanese brand marketed 83,000 Honda Jazz in 2007, it is thinking of selling 100,000, which would represent a 17% increase in sales on the European market.
On the Spanish market, Honda has marketed 8,000 Jazz since 2002, representing 6.7 per cent of Honda's sales in Spain.
The managers of the Spanish branch expected to sell 2,000 Jazz in a year.
It is precisely the release of the new Jazz that will allow Honda to largely pay for the decline in sales in Spain.
In fact, brand managers expect to end the year with a sales of 22,000 cars, that is to say 4,000 cars, except in 2007, a 16% decrease in sales.
As a result of this increase in sales, Honda increased its market share in Spain by reaching a market share of 1.8%, compared to 1.6% last year.
The Japanese brand also hopes to obtain a market share of 2 % in 2010.
Honda hopes to get this part of the market when the new model comes out.
This is the Insight, a five-door hybrid and a compact size - 4,37 meters long - on which the company Nippon hopes to commercialize nearly 200,000 cars a year around the world.
Depending on the markets and estimates of the Japanese manufacturer, 50% of the sales of Insight will be made in the United States, while the remaining half will be distributed between the Old Content and Japan.
The commercial launch of Insight is planned in the first three months of the following year, after its presentation to the public in January in Valencia.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz is increasing its dimensions.
Its length is 3.90 metres (five centimeters in addition), its width 1.69 metres (two centimeters in addition) and the distance between its axis is 2.50 metres, which represents an increase of five centimeters.
On the other hand, the height does not change as much as 1.52 meters.
The dimensions are increasing and the inner space is also increasing.
This is due, on the one hand, to the introduction of a new platform and, on the other, to the introduction of a reserve of essence in a central position, to a solution also adopted for the Honda Jazz.
Similarly, the box capacity - which has a double bottom system - can contain up to 399 litres, 19 litres of additional capacity compared to the first generation case.
It should be noted that these dimensions are those of the version with a 1.4L engine, since the Honda Jazz 1.2L box capacity is 379 litres.
The other innovation - in addition to external elements such as rear lights or panoramic roof - is the improvement of access to rear seats.
The doors that give access to the rear seats have an 80-degree opening angle, part of the back door of the first Jazz which would open with a 67-degree angle.
Engines are also new to this second generation of Jazz.
At the beginning of its commercialization, this small model will be equipped with two propellers of 1,2 and 1.4 litres.
The two engines have an i-VTEC technology that reduces the fuel consumption and CO2 emissions, which makes the engine more powerful and increases the engine regime.
The first motor of 1.2 litres develops a power of 90 horses at 6,000 t/min and 114 Nm of couple at 4,900 t/min.
This propeller - which on the previous Jazz reached 78 horses - has a fuel consumption of 5.3 litres per 100 km and emissions of 125 grams of CO2.
Compared to the previous propeller, which on the previous generation reached 83 horses, now reaching 100 horses.
The Honda Jazz 1.4L of 100 horses has a combined consumption of 5.4 litres to 100 km and emissions of 128 grams of CO2.
The 'beautiful car' that avoids collisions
In order to advance the development of accident prevention technologies, Nissan was inspired, this time, by nature, especially by bees.
The Japanese company created a robot that, by imitating the flight of bees, avoids accidents.
His name is Bio-Mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C and represents the first step towards collision prevention technologies.
The engineers at Nissan Motor Co.'s Advanced Technical Centre have made this small robot in collaboration with the Centre for Research of Sciences and Advanced Technologies at the prestigious University of Tokyo, Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, the Director-General of Public Relations for Technology and Research and Development of the Marks Management, BR23C is the source of Nissan's security shield.
This robot will allow the vehicles of the brand to prevent collisions.
During his flight, each bee created its own personal space of an oval shape that looks much like Nissan's safety shield.
But the most important are the eyes of the bee, which can be seen in an angle of more than 300 degrees and in all directions, which allows it to fly without interruption within its own personal space.
To recreate this visual function, engineers have developed what is called a laser tracker (Laser Range Finder).
It detects the obstacles that are at a distance of two metres and in a radius of 180 degrees, calculates the distance to this object and sends a signal to the microprocessor, immediately, to avoid the obstacle.
"At a time when he detects an obstacle, the small robot will imitate the movements of a bee and will immediately change direction by buoyating its 90-degree wheels or more to avoid collision.
The biggest difference compared to any other existing system is that the escape handle is completely instinctive.
If that were the case, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid the obstacles,” explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Movement Laboratory and chief engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot be moved up or down; it can only move in two dimensions and depending on what its wheels allow it and not in infinite directions such as bee.
For this reason, Nissan has used a rotation function, but also acceleration and deceleration, so that the small robot can avoid obstacles.
" Every second this device must only process information and act according to these data.
There is no need to preserve the information or intuitive logic of pre-manufactures, which is why it can operate continuously with only a few dozen KB memory.
This may surprise us, but we don't talk about giga-octets of memory, or even megaoctets."
This represents the first for the development of new instantaneous collision prevention technologies, a technology that will be introduced into serial cars in a decade after Nissan.
The robot runs with lithium-polymer batteries, which are lighter and last longer than lithium-ions batteries.
The other possible application of this technology in the future could be the adaptation of this device to a satellite GPS navigation system to guide the driver to its destination by avoiding road barriers.
They're afraid to be hypotheced.
It must be acknowledged that the United States Treasury, in addition to having a lot of liquidity to make plans, is not without genius.
Faced with the crisis, and in order to prevent Americans from embarking on mortgages with solvency banks, they created a game to learn not to fail: ' Bad Credit Hotel '.
That's 'The Hotel of Bad Credits'... or stories.
The ghastly aspect of this accommodation and especially the Master of the Hotel leads us to think again and again if it is the right time to ask for a loan.
And, above all, where to do it.
Of course, this game provides useful but little detailed information.
It's more a game reserved for teenagers.
What to do if the game ends?
Because a dream room appears inside the hotel.
It's better than nothing, because it's impossible to buy a house.
Morgan Stanley opens his capital at MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry to his Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) table tour, Japan's first bank, which will spend nine billion dollars to take 21% of its capital, a new welcome by a strong decline in its stock exchange.
One week after a provisional agreement was reached, the two banks explained that MUFG would purchase 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's regular shares at a unit cost of $25.25, a total of $3 billion.
The retained price is less than 19% than the accounting value of the securities as at 31 August.
MFG will invest six billion additional dollars in the acquisition of convertible securities with a return of 10% and a conversion price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley stated that the global transaction would be based on an average unit price of $29, 28 per cent above its current rate.
However, Morgan Stanley lost 6.79% to $23.07 at 17.00 GMT.
"This strategic alliance is an important opportunity to accelerate the transition from Morgan Stanley to the banking holding status," explained John Mack, director general of the American group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new status last week, which must allow him to diversify his activities but to do so under the authority of the Federal Reserve.
His alliance with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces Wall Street's largest names to adopt a much more cautious attitude than before.
The modalities presented on Monday also show that the agreement has been amended in the last few days: on Monday, Morgan had just announced that he would sell up to 20% of his shares in Japan for about $8.5 billion.
"A week ago, Toshihide Mizuno, the executive director of MUFG, told Tokyo that our pensions would be fully included in regular actions.
But in view of the current situation in the economy and in the market, we wanted to minimize the risks and cover ourselves."
Based on the weighted average price, MUFG will pay its titles Morgan Stanley 7% below their accounting value.
And the operation will result in a dilution of about 20% of the benefit by action.
The agreement provides that the MFG will be able to convert half of its preferential securities into ordinary shares in one year if the latter exchange more than 50% over the conversion price, or about $47, for a given period.
Morgan Stanley ensures that the capital provided by MUFG will enable him to seize investment opportunities, strengthen his balance sheet and increase his liquidity.
However, a group spokesperson refused to provide details on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After the investment of MUFG, Morgan Stanley should display a solvency ratio of about 15% Tier One, one of the best in the sector.
Morgan stated that he had "clearly" relieved his balance sheet since the end of August.
The last few weeks have been tested for the group, which saw its course in Borse half-funding, while the cost of insurance against a default risk on its debt flowed.
This cost was reflected on Monday but remained at a high level, around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other "survivor" of Wall Street's major investment banks after the bankruptcys of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch, announced that he had raised $15 billion, in part with Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett's group.
Rafael Correa in Quito this Monday.
Refound the republic around socialism of the twenty-first century.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
This Sunday, like his counterparts and friends, was the third to put a draft new Constitution to the vote.
Mission accomplished since 64% of the voters voted "yes" at the referendum, according to official results of 80% of the polls.
According to these results, "no" received 28%, 7% of the suffrage was zero and 0.7% were white votes.
In order for the draft Constitution to be adopted, it was necessary to obtain half of the more than one.
On Sunday, two polls conducted at the polling offices and an account of a non-governmental organization had announced a wide victory of "yes", between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa also claimed on Sunday night on Monday the victory of his draft Constitution.
The "Constitution has triumphed dramatically", he assured the Ecuadorians at the headquarters of the governorate of Guayaquil, 280 kilometres south-west of Quito.
Of course, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Chavez and Morales but also his Chilean counterpart Michelle Bachelet.
The vote, which took place in calm under the observation mission of the Organization of American States (OAS), contained a text of 444 points consolidating the "new socialism" advocated by the president.
The draft Constitution dedicates the power of the State on the economy, preserving the "planning of development" of a country that is essentially living from the extraction of oil by foreign companies and foreign currencies that send its migrants.
The project, elected by Correa in 2006, also grants enhanced powers to the head of the State, which will be able to carry out up to two consecutive four-year mandates and will have the possibility of disbanding the Assembly.
Korea has already announced that it would use this power and challenge a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also consolidates the principle of free health and education services that the President has begun to establish in that country of 13.9 million people, with 50% of the population living below the poverty line.
Finally, it provides for a ban on the presence of foreign troops, which will put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington for the use of an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for American drug operations.
The 19 hostages were released in Chad
An Egyptian command launched the siege against the perpetrators of the eleven tourists and their eight escorts captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian accompanying prisoners detained for ten days in the desert were brought back this Monday, after noon, healthy and except in the Egyptian capital.
In the morning, they were released by an Egyptian command in Chad.
Appearingly in shape, the hostages arrived at 330 hours on board a special aircraft at the al-Maza military base, at Cairo International Airport.
They were immediately transferred, without being able to speak to the press, on board helicopters to the Maadi hospital, a resident banley of Cairo, for examinations.
They are in "good health", and "no ransom has been paid" to the admirers," said Egypt's Minister of Tourism Zoheir Garanna on the tarmac.
Captured on September 19 at a safari in 4x4 at the foot of Mount Ouanat, on the coasts of Egypt, the Sudan and Libya, this group of shelters had been shelled by 35 unknown predators.
It includes 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - as well as eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the Egyptian agency, organizer of the safari.
An Egyptian security officer indicated that 30 special forces, trained on board two helicopters, had launched the siege in the night just before dawn.
"A trade in firefights occurred, and half of the predators were killed, the others were getting away," said the responsible who demanded the anonymous.
He indicated that 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the "light" unit had been sent to the Sudan in total, where they received support from German and Italian commandos.
The head of the Italian diplomacy Franco Frattini mentioned Belgrade, where he is, the role played by secret agents and elements of the Italian special forces.
"We must recognize that we have achieved this result through professionalism and the effectiveness of our men's secret services, special forces," he said, without further details.
He also denied payment of a ransom.
The guard, the Sudanese army had claimed to have intercepted a 4x4 vehicle on which the predators were on board, killing six, including the Chadian leader, and stopping two.
The army had claimed that they were linked to a rebel group in Darfur, the Sudan-United States Liberation Movement (SLA-U), which had immediately denied.
Letters - The silent majority of culture
A debate on the financing of culture is taking place and this electoral campaign is under way.
That's better.
But a sector of our cultural life remains forgotten.
Who will rise to denounce the poor sums given to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historical sites that increase hunger?
Who would dare remind the federal government that it neglects its monuments and heritage buildings?
What in Quebec, like Canada, do we not have real laws that effectively preserve our heritage?
Did you know that the French government spend three and a half million euros on the restoration of the only castle in Chinnon in the Loire Valley?
In our American neighbours, it is written in the Constitution of their country that heritage protection is part of American culture and that it must be protected by all citizens, elected and all government departments, in concert.
In Quebec, at the Québec Federation of Historic Societies, at least 40,000 volunteers gathered in 211 historical, heritage, archives and geology companies are concerned about finding history, preserving with three of the monceles of private archives and preserving archaeological sites.
They are often the dogs of our heritage, who protest with the energy of despair when promoters and decision-makers launch their bulldozers against our forgotten old stones and cemeteries.
When do we have a history and heritage court?
Benelux Governments nationalize part of Fortis Bank
The Benelux states come to the aid to the Belgian-Dutch bank, as the first European banking institution in the event of a snowstorm in the US credit market crisis, in the form of partial nationalisation, and the three countries support this financial and insurance institution with an amount of EUR 11.2 billion, which also has interests in Hungary.
This weekend, the Belgian, Luxembourg and Dutch governments agreed to the highest level in this case, also calling on the European Central Bank and the European Commission to compete.
In the euro area, the first major crisis in the international financial crisis that has been widening for more than a year is for the Fortis Bank. From a certain point of view, the decisions that will be taken in the case of this bank will serve as a precedent.
In accordance with the decision taken on Sunday night, the three states will purchase nearly half (up to 49 per cent) of the bank's capital in each country.
The bank is undoubtedly going to sell part of its shares, including, first of all, the activities, mainly insurance, which it acquired last year from the Dutch agency ABN Amro.
Last week, Fortis actions began a vertigo fall. In the second half of the week, serious signs of crisis have already been revealed at the bank.
Analysts agree that with its 85,000 employees, the bank is too large to allow it to fail.
Nothing but Friday, the company's shares fell by 12 percent, to reach its lowest level 14 years ago.
Since January, the shares have fallen by more than two thirds of their value.
Taking into account the current value of the shares, the total value of the group's capital is around EUR 14 billion, which, according to the leaders of the company, is not realistic.
The management of the company accuses the uncertainty of the Atlantic, in relation to the adoption of the US $700 billion rescue plan, of being the source of the fall in Fortis actions.
On Monday, the papers have already received a slight increase.
Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed to the head of the bank, as the new Director-General.
The financial institution also sought private buyers, but has not yet received a proposal on the basis.
Previously, the Belgian government announced that investors should not be concerned, and they would not lose their money.
No panic has been felt within the bank's clientele circle and no agency has been seized.
In Hungary, Fortis has independent agencies and has also purchased leasing companies.
A reindeer in the chicken
In America, life and health insurance companies often refuse to sign an insurance contract with a candidate on the basis of information about their drug purchases.
Information protection experts fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
"There are data protection programs that link the use of information on prescription of medicines, in all cases, to the agreement of the person concerned.
This kind of program must be between independent hands, or it returns to entrust its chicken to a reindeer" - recalled Richard Dicket, the author of the program used to manage the prescriptions of drugs in Washington Post.
Insurance companies depend on the insurance premium and the capital insured in the event of damage, the health status of the client present, and if they consider that the risk is too high, they do not even ensure it.
In the past, they sent candidates to medical examinations, and they did not sign insurance contracts with them until they learned the results.
For ten years, Dick has found a much less expensive procedure: from an identification number, it is easily available to the pharmaceuticals, the data on the purchase of medicines from the person in the past eighteen months. From this, the program determines itself, what disease the person suffers and what his health condition is.
For example, if this person regularly buys high doses of cholesterol reducer, this refers to an extremely high level of fat in the blood, resulting in a higher risk category.
Several versions of this program are in circulation. Some determine at the same time a risk factor, so there is no longer much to be done to the insurer besides the paper. However, there may still be minor problems.
Among the disadvantages of this program are the fact that a medicine can be used for different purposes. For example, some mixtures can be used against migraine or heat buffs, but can also be effective against depression.
This is considered by insurers to be aggravating risk factor, while others do not.
Companies have developed research and data analysis, and they must ask for the patient's authorization before collecting the required information from the pharmacy.
In the meantime, they are forced by the authorities, even though they have not been penalised for their shortcomings in the past.
Since recently, some companies have also dealt with the results of laboratory analysis, and relate them to the data on drug consumption, and thus they are able to provide an even more precise picture of the health status of patients.
More and more companies have access to data, and control of use is becoming increasingly difficult at the same time.
There is a separate law on the protection of medical data, but its scope extends only to practitioners and insurers.
A proposal for a law on the expansion of the supervisory circle of the authorities regarding companies specialized in the provision of data is currently before Congress.
Dick Richard acknowledges that this is not sufficient and that is why he has developed even further before his program, which would require the transmission of data to the individual's exclusive agreement.
It is another question to know whether the person concerned is really free to give his or her agreement, since if he or she refuses, insurance does not sign an insurance contract with her.
Thus and finally, chickens depend on the well-being of the kidney.
The global menu of Marseille
The European Union and India are multiplying their trades by two.
Since the European Union and India are very important trading partners for each other, this theme also dominated the agenda of this ninth summit next to other problems, largely global.
Today, there will also be a summit in France-India where there will be a question of cooperation in the field of atomic energy.
The European Union recognized India as a major emerging democratic power to which a broader right of speech should be given in international affairs, but Member States have not yet succeeded in agreeing on their support for New Delhi for its candidacy as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
They were not too late on this issue, yesterday, at this 9th summit organized in Marseille.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, as the current President of the Union, as well as the President of Commission José Manuel Barroso and the head of diplomacy Javier Solana, welcomed the Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with whom they agreed that in five years they would multiply trade by two, which means an increase of a good hundred billion euros.
Given that between 2000 and 2007, trade in goods has increased from 25 billion to 55 billion, this does not seem to be an ambitious objective.
In this sense, they have legally harmonized the 26 bilateral conventions with India on civil flights, and in this way air exchanges can also take place in the future.
India would like to sign a free trade agreement with the Union by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy has promised to speed up the negotiations.
The objective is to balance the situation on the one hand, India, which is the first trading partner in the EU, and New Delhi, which is only the ninth place among EU partners.
The summit focused its attention on global affairs.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan has been strongly condemned, as well as all forms of terrorism, and an urgent United Nations conference has been called for.
The completion of the Doha trade cycle has also been requested, although both have a large share in the current failure.
The EU has confirmed that it remains loyal to the energy and climate programme, including that it would like to reduce its toxic emissions by at least 20 per cent by 2020.
India also agreed on this point, as well as the need to move through a global market during the climate conference scheduled next year, and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50 per cent by 2050.
They would also like to prevent the rise in food prices, and supported the convening of an international working meeting to discuss the financial crisis.
The Indian head of state is now in French capital, where at a bilateral meeting, he is preparing to sign an agreement on the peaceful use of atomic energy.
In Paris, it is hoped that French companies will receive orders for a value of twenty billion euros for the construction of Indian nuclear reactors.
According to the press agency's information, the agreement would take 15 years.
A Frankfurt, more than three hundred Italian publishers
Large presence of Italian publishers in the International Salon du Libre de Francfort.
More than three hundred Italian publishers present in the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important you become international in the exchange of rights.
The International Salon of the Book of Frankfurt awaits this edition, more than 7 thousand exhibitors coming from 101 different countries that will occupy 171,790 square metres of the Salon with more than 403 million titles on display, and Turkey as an invitation to honor.
This will be the Under Secretary of the Ministry of Cultural Affairs and Activities, Francesco Maria Giro, who will represent the Italian Government at the Italian Papillon's inauguration ceremony: in fact, Italy will be present institutionally, with an Italian Point - 264 square meters of exhibition space.
It will be followed by the press meeting in the Room Struktur, in the Bookmesse 5.0: an opportunity to present the figures, trends and perspectives on the position of the edition in Italy.
According to data, the importance of foreign authors' books gradually decreases compared to total Italian production, and in particular with that for adults and children.
Found Steve Fossett's plane, the billionaire disappeared a year ago.
Steve Fosset's plane's sword, the billionaire disappeared on September 3, 2007 while flying on Nevada's desert, was found.
The debris were found on a 3,000-metre platform in the Sierra Nevada area of Mammonth Lakes, at the border between California and Nevada.
Within the plane, however, no human remains.
The sheriff of Madeira County, John Anderson, avoided the doubts that remained: "The plane was located, we sent a team, and now we have the confirmation that it is the one that Steve Fosset was traveling on the day he disappeared," he said at a press conference.
The sheriff therefore stated that no human remains were found either on the plane or in the vicinity.
In February , the 63-year-old billion was considered dead .
The U.S. Bureau for Transport Security (Ntsb) reported that a team of investigators sent to the places, a few hours after the sword was detected, identified the device: it was well from Bellanca 8kcab, disappeared on 3 September 2007, when Fosset decolla de Yerington in Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, always in California, not far from the Nevada border, some personal effects of Fosset were found by a couple around their Mammoth Lakes residence.
These are two documents bearing the name of Fosset, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, the money and a bullet.
Fossett's research was interrupted a month after its disappearance.
The billionaire had won a place in history through a long series of records.
At the sixth attempt, he became the first man in 2002, to complete the world tour on an aerostatic balloon: two weeks of solo flight.
Three years later, he had made the world's tour on plane and without a ladder.
Of all these records, the one that had stolen 15 445 meters high, on the Andes, but with a co-pilot.
Glk, the advertising you don't expect.
A 4x4 outside the community of an original and well-defined design, with marked lines, wide surfaces and net angles.
Here, in synthesis, Glk, the last born of the off-road "compacts" of the house of the star, with which Mercedes-Benz tried to give a new wind in this sector.
Just by its non-standard, unexpected and non-conventional content, the communication will accompany the launch of the 4x4 Glk, available in the Mercedes-Benz showrooms, starting on 17 October.
So the advertising battle that will accompany the start of the new car will give rise to an unpublished mode of communication, through a 3D futuristic display campaign, used for the first time in Italy by a car fire.
A Maxi exhibition project, organized in three different stages, which will dominate the heart of the Milanian shopping, Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first phase of this new type of communication provides for the presentation of the car in stereoscopic vision, and thanks to special glasses distributed around Corso Como, it will be possible to see the new 4x4 in almost real and three-dimensional format.
In fact, we'll have the impression that by looking at the picture, the car's way out of the picture.
Then, through the use of the Remove8 innovative technology, the new Glk will be illuminated according to the spots, in all its details, to then return to a single image.
It is obvious that with this advertising, Mercedes is trying to introduce something new in the stereotypical field of automotive communication.
Will it succeed with this formula to arouse the interest of future buyers? We'll see.
Here are the Italian hooligans.
From Triveneto, they risk the Daspo.
But who are these 150-200 young boys and girls whom Italy is ashamed of now? They are part of the group "Ultras Italy" which has been following the Italian national team for years, and which has never, so far, created major problems.
He never had any trouble with the opposite typhoids.
The group's extraction is right.
The promoters come from Triveneto.
From Verone, Padoue, Trieste, and Udine.
In Sofia, small groups (unrealized) of Campania and Pouli were added.
They had tricolored flags on which their city of origin appeared: Saturday night, they were all removed to avoid being identified.
They were inspired by the English typhoria.
In Bulgaria, they found a typhoid of real Nazis, that of Levski.
The Figc had made available Italian thiosi, 144 tickets for the party: all nominees, and therefore easily controllable.
And the Viminal had them all controlled: among those who went to Sofia, none of them had a Daspo running, none had been forbidden to attend a stage.
Four Italian thiosi who had a history of stage crime did not have the right to the ticket, and could not make the move.
Now the Viminal is waiting to read the acts that will come from the Bulgarian police, and will then take action: in this case, it may be that the typhoids arrested or identified in the riots are feeding a Daspo for at least five years.
An international Daspo bans the participation of Italian, but also European.
In short, our hooligans will no longer step in the stage.
Good luck.
But now is the time of awe-emulation: that is, others are at risk of adding to the first hundred fifty.
"We must put out this fire immediately, and not legitimize who behaves like this," Viminal said.
So, "keep your eyes open especially for the game of the national team of Wednesday in Lecce"
In the Puilles there is indeed a small core of the Ultras Italy supporters.
Tomorrow, the Observatory meets, Tuesday, the Casms that can even rely on a section of Asia, that is to say secret services, which deal exactly with stage problems.
"Duce-Duce hearts, and the arm held during Mameli's hymn? In Bulgaria, it's not a crime."
Here's the opinion (expressed in a really unpleasant way) of Domenico Mazzilli, recently director of the Viminal Observatory (he took the position of Francesco Tagliente and then of Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was previously prefect in Trieste, where he lived in a nucleus of supporters of the Ultras Italy group, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli said, that in Bulgaria, renting Mussolini is not a crime, but it is certain that the behavior of these 150-200 typhosis has been shameful.
"I am not a sociologist - add No.1 of the Observatory - the crimes must be attributed in the country in which the crime occurs.
So far, this group has remained in the rules, now we will see what has happened, and we will evaluate it for the future.
But let's also talk about the hymn of Mameli: they're also not crimes, but if you let me, they're not cops..."
