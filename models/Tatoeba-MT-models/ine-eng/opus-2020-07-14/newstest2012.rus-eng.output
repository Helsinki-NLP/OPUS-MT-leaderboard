Parliament does not support the amendment that gives freedom to Timothy
Today, in amending the Code of Criminal Procedure, the Ukrainian Parliament rejected an attempt to cancel an article convicted by the opposition leader, Julia Timoshenko.
The amendment, which would lead to the release of the former Prime Minister ' s prison, was rejected during the second reading of the draft law on the reduction of sentences for economic offences.
In October, Timoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for signing a gas transaction with Russia, which was considered to be unfavourable.
The sentence is not yet final; the court will consider the appeal of Timoshenko in December.
Timoshenko claims that the sentence is a political place of the regime; the process in the West has also been presumptuous.
The proposal to repeal article 365 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, under which the former Prime Minister was convicted, was supported by 147 members of Parliament.
The ratification would require 226 votes.
Libya's Victory
In the history of liberation, or resurrection, Libya has already lost.
Muammar Gaddafi was buried somewhere in the desert without him.
It's time to identify the winners.
Islamists are usually defeated in the country; the question is whether they are moderate or radical.
The Transitional Government has declared itself a follower of the usual Sharia law, which we have already heard.
Libya will become a crime-free country, as the punishment for theft is a cut-off.
Women may forget about emancipation; potential rebels will be punished; and so on.
Instead of the dictator, a society consisting of rival clans will be united by the Koran.
There will be an order in Libya that we cannot imagine and which we would hardly wish for.
In any case, our life pattern is not the only one in our own race, nor would it be better or worse, for example, for the people of Libya.
In fact, it is surprising that the Islamic warriors received help from the unbelievers.
Their only justification is that they believe that NATO was not the American General, but Allah, whose greatness they glorified after every defeat.
And if Libya is looking for winners, the West is not among them.
We participated in the shootings, served Islam, and our policies escaped the dictator, their political ally, without any guarantees of benefit.
Given the recent sad experience with Afghanistan and Iraq, we have decided to abandon Libya's military occupation.
The local population should therefore not be concerned about the expulsion of "crestors".
Even if the oil companies are not occupied, will Libya's black gold be virtually worthless?
Probably not, and then the West will finally be able to resort to useless protection of civil rights.
Unless Sharia's followers put an end to it.
The New Wave of Crisis Begins
France and the rest of Europe are at the heart of investors.
A statistical storm passed over Europe on Tuesday.
Individual countries reported GDP data in 3 quarters.
Compared with the previous quarter of the Czech economy, Germany and France have shown growth.
Still, today's debt market is on record.
Investors are not only looking at Italy; they are now focusing on Spain, France, Austria and other countries.
The Statistical Offices of the Eurozone countries in Germany, the Czech Republic and some other countries have published their preliminary estimates of economic development in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP increased by 0.5 per cent; France by 0.4 per cent.
Both countries have also adjusted data for the second quarter, in which Germany had better cases than expected (growth of 0.3 per cent instead of nominal 0.1 per cent). France reported a slight decline, 0.1 per cent (significant information expected stagnation).
In the third quarter of this year, the Czech economy showed a preliminary growth of 1.5 per cent.
However, compared with the previous quarter of GDP, the Czech Statistical Office found this to be a gradual slowdown in economic growth.
The results were worse than the analysts predicted.
Key events:
In the third quarter of this year, the Czech economy showed a preliminary growth of 1.5 per cent; however, it remained stable compared to the previous quarter.
Based on preliminary and seasonal data, Germany's economy rose by 0.5 per cent in the third quarter.
From July to September, both the Eurozone and the European Union have demonstrated growth compared to the previous quarter by 0.2 per cent, which coincides with the analytical forecasts.
Greece's economy has shown a preliminary drop of 5.2 per cent.
Its 10-year-old bond income is 28.45 per cent.
Income from both Italian and Spanish bonds is approaching a critical note.
Even Austria, the Netherlands, France and Belgium, etc., are beginning to experience difficulties.
Although the situation in the region is deteriorating, the income of Czech 1-year bonds remains around 4 per cent.
In Germany, the ECB is the last creditor to save the situation.
The Czech Assembly has passed the Euro team.
In Montenegro, they won the 1:0 and celebrated an unexpected cash prize of 200 million.
The national team has successfully met the most difficult task of the season!
Thanks to the magnificent Chechu and the beautiful hill of Peter Iraček, they won the 1:0.
In the second time, the Czech team was happy to retain a significant benefit after the home team, and it will again take part in the European Championship.
IHNED.cz watched the match and compiled a detailed record.
Almost nothing remarkable in the first time and a great success in the second.
The Czech National Assembly, partly due to the defeat of the team at the end; the Great Czech Republic; and the Heroic Iraq; won 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrated the European Championship.
The Czech team's superior defense allowed the Montenegro team to create dangerous moments only in the second half of the game.
Damyanovic and Vucinic have become the most successful match ever since they lost two great opportunities.
Great Peter Chech is one of the reasons that the Czech National Assembly will not miss the European Championship next year, and the Czech football thus earns about 200 million Czech crowns.
From the first minute, the game was very tense.
Both teams had difficulties in combining; most of the time, they went to the center of the field.
This also explains the absence of pressure on the part of the first-time host team, and further attacks on the defence line were accurately taken by the Czech defenders.
Iranian students are willing to die for their country ' s nuclear programme.
They created a living shield.
Several hundred university students have built a living shield around the nuclear power plant in Iran.
They therefore wish to express their support for their country ' s nuclear programme against Israel ' s potential attack.
On Tuesday afternoon after the students prayed before entering the building, they prayed about the death of both the United States and Israel.
In Isfahan, Iran, several hundred university students have built a living shield around the Isfahan uranium enrichment plant.
They thus demonstrated their willingness to protect their country ' s nuclear programme for their own lives.
In its last report, the International Agency for Nuclear Energy (IAEA) indicated that it was all evidence that Iran had not left an attempt to obtain nuclear weapons.
A possible nuclear attack in Iran was discussed in Israel.
On Tuesday afternoon, the students’ prayers before entering the Isfahan uranium enrichment plant followed a prayer of death, both in the United States and in Israel.
In the case of an attack aimed at maximizing the paralysis of the Iranian nuclear programme, the Israeli press believes that the establishment of both isfahan and Natanze, where uranium enrichment is being carried out, will be the goal.
Question of children suffering from obesity: No breakfast and dinner sausage
More than one third of children between the ages of 9 and 13 are subject to higher standards; while 9 per cent of schoolchildren are overweight, 5% suffer from obesity.
According to a recent study, children who suffer from obesity usually come from families who have an unhealthy outlook on life.
Again, we see the importance of the environment and the models of behavior that accompany a person for his or her healthy development.
For example, colbasa appears on the tables of children who suffer from obesity almost twice as often as in families with children with normal weight.
More than 19 per cent of the children who suffer from obesity have had a free potato meal before questioning the educational event called Obituary was not an accident.
More than that, the families of children who suffer from obesity do not engage in sports; however, this is true of most families of modern schoolchildren, only 15 per cent of whom say that their parents find time to engage in sports at least once a week.
The study was conducted among 900 children.
The study was conducted at the end of last year’s training year, with nearly 900 primary students participating in the whole of Bohemia.
The Ocerija event was not a second-year event, with the support of the insurance company General health insurance company and Unilever.
To date, more than 12,000 students from 4 to 8 classes have joined the project.
Proper food and sufficient sports load are the main determinants that trigger the rapidly increasing number of children suffering either from excess weight or from obesity.
"For example, only half of the respondents said that they were eating five times a day, under the breakfast-perekus-lanch-perekus-food scheme, because it was one of the inevitable conditions of proper nutrition," said one of the findings of the study.
No lunches and dinner sausages.
Experts warn that even relative details are important for healthy development, such as regular family breakfast.
In the Czech Republic, only 23 per cent of school families are staying together.
In most families, everyone's breakfast is separated.
The quickest opening was the fact that in every ten families, people do not have to be late at all.
And yet, tomorrow is the basis of the right daily management.
The study showed that burned food is used more often in families with children who suffer from obesity.
Almost every one, regardless of weight, drinks sweet drinks every day (70 per cent).
Although more than 40 per cent of children are regularly involved in sports, this figure is reduced by more than two to 15 per cent when it comes to their parents.
Create your own menu.
In another part of the study for selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools), it was proposed to draw up their own menu based on the products proposed and based on their tastes and preferences.
"The preference of Czech children aged 12 to 15 is far from ideal for healthy food."
Their favorite food includes a large number of torment, meat and sweet foods.
“A special concern is the popularity of sweet-frozen drinks, ” says the final part of the study.
As the main eaten meal, the shepherd defeated the little bird.
However, the children were virtually uninterested in bees, fish, and vegetables.
Stirred to a Healthy Life - Style
The study also showed that children are ready to change their eating habits, provided they are provided with relevant information.
“Many participants in the study control group have demonstrated a significant preference for healthy food when they completed the survey after the completion of the lesson, which is not an accident,” the project said.
This was especially noticeable, for example, in the case of sweet cold drinks - more children have just preferred water.
In addition, as a primary care, children were more often noted for birds and fish, limiting the number of sweet care and shelters.
A stylist must also be a good psychologist, say professionals
In the first article on stylistic training, I visited the level of information in introductory sessions.
I had no idea what was going to happen.
The lessons of three experts in this area; advice on choosing clothing for non-standard figures; and a seminar on how all of this works in real life.
Further, more.
The closer we are to the final exam, the more information and practical tasks we are awaiting.
Training takes place every Saturday and Sunday, but it is indeed filled with information.
This time we discussed how to dress a woman whose body is not ideally symmetric.
Most women are not fully symmetrical.
In one short neck, in the other little figure without proper shapes, one more weight rule.
The stylist should know how to significantly reduce the width of his shoulders, lengthen his neck or add the missing amounts.
We have been advised to highlight the figure of women such as Jennifer Lopez, that is, the owners of a thicker chest and thighs and a narrow waist, and not to wear them too challenging.
For example, if the difference in the size of the waist and the thigh is so large that it cannot be improved, it is worth at least one thing to order.
You obviously don't regret the funds invested, because perfectly sitting clothes are worthless.
In the jubque, you'll feel much better than in the one who keeps coming, who gets drunk, who gets a plate, and so on.
Small-scale owners may, on the other hand, wear clothes with gloves, application, lifts or bearings.
Taking into account the abundance of information and the types of figures, I'm glad I've had a whole week to realize that.
And yet, I'm afraid it's too much, given the homework we got.
Each participant had to plan two sets of courses for some celebrity: day and night.
We must take into account their modern appearance, their style in clothes and the type of figure.
I have to wear Miranda Kerr, which you can know on Victoria's Secret advertising campaigns.
I'm happy about myself because it's much easier to wear than, say, Britney Spears, Christina Agiler, who's recently fixed to a tone (please, be aware that I'm exaggerating), or quite young Selen Gomes.
We need to cut off or find it online, print and process using graphic programs.
Mudbord - the result of the work - then reflects our own style and attitude to the graphic image.
It is important to keep in mind the graphic style.
The stylist not only wears real people but creates product pages in magazines (based on special instructions such as fashion bags, coat, etc.).
That's what the stylisticist and designer Mario Kamenick told us about.
But it was only on the day of the resurrection.
A Stylistic Need for Common Knowledge
The Saturday lecture, with information on the types of figures, has brought three visitors to life in this area.
Stylist, Honza Podorna; fashion designer, Jacob Polanka; and fashion photographer Ben Rench.
Jacob reminded us that fashion is an illusion and a stylist should use this fact.
A good stylist is able to use one item of clothing differently.
In this case, diversity is key to success.
For example, the coat can be worn in a normal way, above the belts and ankles, as a coat; but it can also be worn on the naked body, without marks, as a plate.
Another option is to hit the sleeve or lift the spine, and the whole image changes completely.
"Play with him," he stressed.
Anyway, I've most appreciated the following advice: "For your work, you must know the rules perfectly."
Then you can start breaking them,' Jacob told us.
So here I finally realized why we're getting all the definitions and rules that we're combining with what and why, when we often see each other in fashion magazines.
I'm not talking about fashion shows.
From Ben, a photographer, I learned that a stylistic must have more options in place than the number of photos he needs to take.
So, for a fashion review on ten pages (equivalent to ten in pairs), I have to be ready to create at least fifteen images.
Now I also know that in the painting, the subject of clothing often looks and works in conjunction with others quite differently than in reality.
We have to keep that in mind when we create an image.
Honza Pokorna confirmed that the image and style are often half successful.
Just look at Madonna, who doesn't have a striking ring, but her image and marketing have turned her into a world star.
Relation to the services of the Czech Republic of stylists is still quite cold.
Even well-known people often think that this is too much (and believe that it's enough to be a specialist in something, and what they look like is secondary).
And if someone finally allows us to create their style, we have to expect them to call us something smaller than what they really are.
Then we go to Google and see if we've written the tabloids anything about the fact that there's some familiarity of the floor/flood, etc.
In the resurrection of Honza and Mario, emphasis was placed on the lack of fashion and the ability to improve.
Our work is mainly about communicating with the people we wear, so it's important to be a good psychologist.
In order to be able to appreciate people, not to create them and maintain their opinion.
"If the manager asks you to look at her clothes and add some beautiful things, you can't throw out her entire wardrobe, you tell her that her clothes are awful."
"Find at least a few things you can praise and see what you can carry with them," says Mario.
He also showed us that the work bag should be specifically replaced.
It's a bag you tie around the plate to carry everything you need.
In addition to obvious things, such as knives, handkerchiefs or English bezels, it should be a nylon thread (stylists use it when collecting some items, such as bag or hat), special clips for fixing back tissue if it is too large (pains and similar items are prohibited because they wear clothes) or a sewing set.
To get away from the lectures and get some practical experience, we learned to make the right shoes.
Even in a study where half a smooth, floor can get damage - not to talk about street deposits.
And that's what we did with the curse.
You don't have to deal with shoes so you don't export them.
This requires the present skill.
I was glad that Mario praised my work.
Those skills didn't come to my mind.
It's just part of what we heard during the second part of the weekend course.
I'm starting to understand that being a professional stylist isn't as easy as they would say.
V Need for Speed: Escape is taking place in America.
Review
What had to be a jobless walk has become a routine morning trip to work due to a series of completely inappropriate and unnecessary mistakes.
Ambition was to some extent satisfied, but it was not important, since no one clearly wanted to do more work.
Before leaving the new version with the title "Pebeig" they had high hopes.
It was expected that it would force the previous series Need For Speed in a new direction; demonstration versions showed that the game would take a decent place in the genre of gongs.
We were curious to see parts of the game where the main hero left the car and ran.
As is often the case with NFS, the result is much different from what we expected.
The game is a rather small arcade race, but the general impression is a few unnecessary errors that have been present in this series of games for several years.
It means, in fact, it's not a mistake, it's an unexplained developer line.
The adventure is starting very well.
You're part of a history that Jack, the main hero, has decided to solve some personal problems by participating in an illegal race through America.
You're sitting in a car on the west coast of San Francisco, and your mission is to get to New York first.
This idea has several interesting features.
The route consists of ten stages separated by more than fifty gongs.
This means that each race is going along its own path, and the individual stages are going in a diverse and interesting environment.
So there is no feeling that the game is always the same.
Although the schedule is at the same level as in the previous parts of the series, some trails are pleasant to see.
Still, the game doesn't give rise to strong emotions.
Although driving through the desert, in autumn prizes or high in snowy mountains is very pleasant.
In addition, the race has been experiencing unusual detail from time to time.
For example, in the desert you fall into a sandstorm, a much lowering visibility.
On the other hand, the mountains need to be careful not to fall under the lava.
The individual races are pretty well arranged.
There's only a few variations, but that's enough.
Some time you're trying to lure a few opponents (usually a normal race); then you're trying to improve the time (the standard race with a second), or you're dealing with one opponent.
Besides, from time to time, you're running into a police force that makes your task even more difficult.
The components outside the car are new.
It's just an interactive animation, where most of Jack's time is running away from someone and you have to help him with the necessary buttons at the right time.
It's all right.
Although it's amazing that these fragments are much less than you could expect (all three to be accurate).
In fact, it turns out that it's good for the game because it doesn't make sense; given all the above, it's one of the things that make the game more busy.
A gonorrhea model follows previous models.
This means that it is no longer something special, but it cannot be considered a lack.
If you're looking for real life imitations, you're going to have to find somewhere else.
However, this driving model is very suitable for dynamic chases, although better options can be found on the market.
It's all right.
However, some time has passed since problems began.
Unlike the driving model, the collision model is not so good.
You don't expect complex changes and clashes from this game, but if you don't have the idea of a collision with an object, how your machine will behave, something's wrong.
Usually, by burning or passing a car in a flat stream, you sometimes have a slight reaction to another car, but sometimes in a similar situation, your car begins to break down.
Or they broke up.
It's not that important because of the restart system, but it's enough to make fun.
Restarts are set so that if you break or go away from the tracks, the game will bring you back to the point where it stopped.
However, only five restarts are available for each race.
If you use them all, you'll have to start the race from the very beginning.
It's useful if something doesn't work, but you can't rely on it.
Sometimes the restarts are not enough, and you have to learn to go to a particular race.
A major lack of play is the fact that the same things often take place in the same places.
For example, some rotations need to be done in a certain way, otherwise you just don't write.
In other cases, you meet civilian cars in a certain location in the same configuration, regardless of whether you arrive first, fifth, five seconds before or a minute later.
This is particularly disturbing in situations when you see your opponent travel easily between two machines moving in the opposite direction, while when you're there, the machines are already in place so you need to either drive them or drop speed.
It doesn’t matter when you get close to them; everything is arranged so that the situation is always going on just before your nose.
The rivals have other advantages.
During the game you find several places where, regardless of the time, the same opponent enshrouds you in the same place.
This is especially obvious at the end of the game, on the long bridge where you go in the opposite direction.
Obviously, your opponent has to stand before you, no matter what.
The thing is, when he walks in front of you, he's making your review worse, leading to one or more accidents on this site.
You can understand the attempt to make the game more interesting and full of adrenaline, but it's so obvious that it's starting to trigger a distraction quickly.
Sorry, because despite a simple driving model, the game is busy and sometimes so busy with events that you don't have time to focus on what's going on around you.
It doesn't matter what won't let you miss -- the concept of fifty unique tracks, the sequence of chases, or something else.
The idea of changing cars during the chase is unusual.
You need to track the devices on the way, because that's what your machine can change on them, even though in most cases it's enough that you already have.
The machines are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are approaching cities; powerful American cars are for direct cut-off bosses; and exotic super-sports for technical driving, for example, on steep mountain trails.
The main story mode mode is closely related to challenging mode mode; it is a race on the individual areas you will know in the course of the game.
Here you win for your personal cause both medals and eyes, common for the challenges and stories regimes.
Many opportunities are available to achieve a higher level of driving: starting from the car and ending the profile.
In addition, the profile is related to the online Autolog feature, which compares, among other things, the results you have achieved with other players and provides a link to the public.
There is another lack that is difficult to understand; this is an example from the last race in sequence.
You and your car fall into the subway tunnel (we'd think you'd be like that) where you're going on the tracks in the dark (we'd think so).
Your speed indicator shows the numbers from 150 to 200 km/h (we'd think so) when suddenly the subway runs on you, turning your car into a metal chest.
For a few days, our editor discussed whether no one really thought or did not think about us during the game, or did its creators view us as such.
The technical composition of the game is nothing special; but the overall impression from the video set is most pleasant, sometimes even surprising.
Although, in some critical moments, the quality of the record is sometimes reduced rather strongly.
This is particularly true of a large number of participants, where a good record would not help you very much.
Sound's fine; soundtrack's on the lover.
In order to satisfy the widest possible young audience, the soundtrack 'was made up of different styles'; but hardly many people would buy the game because of its music.
General impression of Need for Speed: I ran away rather unbearable.
If the game avoided clearly unnecessary errors, we could honestly say that Rung is the best part of the NFS in the last few years.
In any case, the game leaves the feeling of infinity.
Of course, it's a good time, but be prepared to be blinded by the deficiencies as the airport's pilot.

Ambassador to the EU of Vienna:
The Czech reputation of non-prisoners and skeptics for the euro.
"The Lisbon Treaty has caused significant differences between individual organizations."
"I didn't expect such a cruel war to happen."
"It takes five or six years before the situation is stabilized, calmed, and all the players will become accustomed to their new role," EU Ambassador Milena Vizena had a hard start in his lecture at the law school.
She demonstrated how well she was holding her “Clearly and openly about Europe” motto in the first part of her lecture, where she described the individual EU institutions and their relationship so simple and understandable that many of the lecturers from the law school would be jealous.
Moreover, Vizenova praised the work of the new Permanent President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompey:
"At first, critics said that he was a regular series of office mice that could not play any role; I must say, everyone was defeated how well he managed to play his role."
"The person who can listen at the same time to the twenty-seven participating countries is wonderful to communicate with them and has a clear idea of which side the EU needs to develop."
She explained her new post on international relations and security issues as an answer to the question: "Who is the European Union? What number do I need to call?", i.e. how important is the Union's policy of unification and greater transparency with regard to countries such as China or India.
Nobody's going to ban our cheeses.
The evaluation continued to focus on a programme that is key to the EU in the past, the present and the near future.
She called the Czech Presidency a success in the year's invitation.
The Czechs have dealt with the overriding financial crisis; they have overcome this crisis and have organized the East Partnership Summit.
She said that the Government ' s resignation at the time was a negative phenomenon that had caused little damage to the Czech Republic.
Czechs in the EU are currently very busy.
As the Ambassador said, and the Presidency, and the subsequent financial crisis, have caused the ongoing waste.
In addition, a new seven-year EU budget needs to be adopted, which is very difficult in view of the current crisis.
Whether the budget will be poor and economical, what areas will they prefer; what countries will receive more support and what is less; all these issues will be in the future programme.
The Ambassador recalled the key slogans she had brought to Brussels: "O Europe, I understand."
"I really don't like cuts, foreign words and jargon, which no one understands.
How citizens can understand that in Brussels people do not try to sell curves or round hooks, bananas of different sizes, or that someone is going to ban our cheese varieties."
It also intends to make more effective use of the EU environment and attract more Czechs to European organizations.
Multilingual Europe - Our Future
He claims that the Czechs are considered Euro-Speptic; as well as people who note the most negative and not the positive aspects of the matter.
She wanted more representatives of the Czech Republic to be involved in European organizations.
She believed that several factors were involved: for example, the modesty of our candidates and their inability to write motivational letters; at the same time, with little support from the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, it noted the power and cooperation of the Visegrad Group.
"Believe me, when I meet someone from Poland and Hungary, and we join in a word, the Frenchman next to me says, "Oh, what about the assembly?" and he doesn't like the hats.
In the future, the Union of Vizenova is expecting a largely new set of rules for the budgetary policies of the States parties.
Compared to the new European Federation, it considers the idea of two-speed unless multi-speed Europe is more realistic.
"We have both countries inside and outside the Eurozone."
"We have a Schengen area, and we already have an institution for enhanced cooperation."
"For the first time, it was said that countries that wanted to be united, while those that didn't want could remain on the side."
"The number of such institutions will grow; it will be a two-speed Europe," Vizenova expects.
In this regard, it stressed the role of both the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompey in promoting the rule that all issues relating to the EU as a whole should be discussed by all the countries involved, not just those in the Eurozone.
Brand history:
The IBM novel is entering the second century of its existence.
If anyone wants to find a word that best expresses the IMB strategy, probably the closest one will be "long-lasting."
For the general public IBM is a symbol of the technological revolution; the company is considered to be very modern, although it was founded over a hundred years ago.
The company's longevity was founded by her first boss, dreamer Thomas J. Watson-old.
He believed in his motto that many of the world’s problems could be easily solved if people wanted to think.
His slogan "Dumai!" thus became a press that developed the life of the future giant (and also the name of his internal magazine, which IMB began publishing in 1935).
More than that, it was the foundation of a corporate culture that Watson had carefully worked out.
"For us in IBM, long-term thinking means a constant movement to the future.
IBM survived and flourished for a hundred years because it remained faithful to its original values, although it was not afraid to change everything around it.
In our first hundred years, it has allowed us to transform technology, business and company.
In the second hundred years, we hope to achieve even more," says current manager Samuel J. Palmizano on the anniversary.
Complex system
In the 1930s Watson came to the issue of employee care, as was the case in the Czech Republic, IMB staff were one of the first American employees with paid leave, employer insurance, elegant uniform and complex bonus system for the best inventors and entrepreneurs.
Similarly, IBM has long-term relationships with consumers.
From the very beginning, the company has been a brilliant application of talented people, one of the first world companies to eliminate all discrimination, which has given it a great choice.
It is in line with the anti-discrimination strategy and the current plan whereby a woman, Virginia Romatti, will change Palmizano next year.
She worked in IBM for thirty years; she is currently the director of sales, marketing and development.
For the past few years, IBM has organized meetings, online brainstorms, during which many future innovations occur.
It's not surprising that a lot of ideas work in a company of about half a million people.
Organization with good reputation
The strong position of the company in the business is ensured by a strong internal and external image.
"From the beginning, IBM concept was rather an organization rather than a technology company," said Professor of Harvard Business School and author of the book about IBM Rosabet Moss Canter.
"IBM is not a technology company, it's a company that helps solve business problems using technology," adds George Colony from Forrester Research.
As they say in the company itself, there is a difference between going out to the market and creating it.
In a hundred years, IBM, or the Globe Giant, as it is called in the United States because of its logo, has become one of the largest companies in the world.
It seems that it is the most universal technology company, which develops hardware and software; infrastructure; hosting and consulting services, from servers to nanotechnology.
It has the largest number of patents among all American technology companies, and five of its staff have received the Nobel Prize.
Its inventions include, for example, a ATM, a bank card, a financial swap, a strike code and a discette.
With $220 billion, according to market capitalization, IBM became the second-largest technology company (first-place Apple) this year, which has been conquered by Microsoft for the first time since 1996.
Look forward
Not all of its products came to the taste of buyers and entered the era. For example, IBM failed with its OS/2 operating system; online Prodigy and IBM PCjr computers.
"If your business is defined as moving forward, you can't be emotionally attached to the past," says Samuel J. Palmizano.
That's why IBM easily lays the foundations on several platforms - if they don't work, it refuses them.
This differs, for example, from its Microsoft competitor, who is based and experiences the downfalls on Windows, its operating system.
Perspective technology
IBM's main income comes from services, and about one fifth comes from computer programs and hardware in each case.
As in 1990, with double capital, it was a stronger equipment company.
Since 2000, IBM has sold low-income assets of $15 billion, while at the same time investing 58 billion in the purchase of prospective technologies.
It continued to invest even after 2008, when the current economic crisis hit the world for the first time.
IBM follows the example of its first director, Thomas J. Watson, who has increased the number of investments in the years of the Great Depression.
Until it seems IBM has not damaged the current crisis.
Since the beginning of 2008, the price for IBM shares has increased by 120 per cent; the company's net earnings have increased steadily.
IBM's corporate motto is to change everything except its own values.
Therefore, it can be expected that even if another crisis breaks down, this flexible giant will be able to cope with the situation.
History of IBM: from raw knife to space flights.
IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York a hundred years ago, and its original title, "Corporate, Tabulation, Recording" was quite complex.
She named it IBM in 1924, originally called the brand used for company offices in Canada and South America.
The basis for future IBM was the merger of four companies, whose history began in the 1880s.
They had technology, such as the legendary "table hours", i.e. hours when staff members came and left work.
The new company's architect was businessman Charles Ranlet Flint, who also led the company's board of supervisors by 1930.
Flint hired a company director, Thomas J. Watson, to help him manage the company.
The manager then dismissed the founder of IBM in the dark - Watson's ideas remain the basis for unscrupulous corporate culture and individuality.
Watson headed the company until 1952.
IBM, as is clear from the name, began with the production and sale of various equipment for business, from raw knives and meats to cashiers.
For the first four years, Watson's leadership doubled to $9 million, and the company's expansion to all continents began.
Watson became so important to the company that almost forty years later his place in the director's chair was taken by his son, Thomas Watson-younger.
Under his leadership IBM began developing artificial intelligence technologies and created the first language of programming.
In 1960, both IBM staff and computers helped NASA control space flights -- on Mercury, Saturn -- and in 1969 -- human flights to the Moon.
Meanwhile, in 1964 IBM developed the first family of computers - IBM line System/360.
The classic PC, which established computer standards at the time, called IBM 5150, appeared on the market in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold the Chinese company's computers to Lenovo while purchasing the PricewaterhouseCoopers Consultation Office, thus focusing fully on consulting and high-cost services.
In the last three years, IBM has achieved great success with its concept of Smarter Planet.
Its objective is to rationalize the use of technology in areas where it has not yet been planned and to improve the road situation and urban management.
In the area of trade, IBM recently introduced a Smarter Commerce platform that helps businessmen control the whole trade cycle.
IBM traditions are strong even in our country.
In the former Czechoslovakia, as the first country in Central and Eastern Europe, IBM established its office in 1932.
Today, IBM CZ is also managing the strategic offshore centre in Brno.
The headquarters of Central and Eastern Europe is located in Prague, where the world-level research team is also working.
She's looking for her unfaithful husband:
Iveta, leave yourself a fool, I don't need him anymore!
Darina Richtaržova (53) said it was over!
After her husband, Joseph Richtharz (53) became a bodyguard and lover of Barthoshov (45), Darina still hoped that he would come home.
However, she no longer wants to wait, and she has made clear rules for her future life.
"The Pope may return home, but not as my partner anymore," Richtarzhov explained.
When Darina Richtarzhova gave her blood to Bartošov’s home in summer, she probably had no idea what would happen to her marriage.
Although she had Yveta leave Rzycan 30 days later, Pepa did not leave the singer.
Moreover, he publicly acknowledged his love for her.
After a while Darina gave up, and saw that she had calmed down with her Roman husband; and now she's finally forgiven him.
I'm still looking at who his wife was sleeping with.
Even if Richtharz and Bartošov were to break up, his wife would not accept him with scattered ties.
"He's my son's biological father, and if he wants to spend his last days in our house, no one's gonna kill him."
"He will end his days, not like my beloved, lost and found old hole, but the man with whom I am bound," Richtarzhov said, adding that she has already been freed from her husband and insists only on the two.
Joseph had nothing to do with his wife’s rejection.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I'll be with Iveta, I'm not going to change it."
"My wife decided to leave the marriage on paper, and I respect that decision."
"Our union is still functioning; I'm responsible for repair, garden, house and shopping."
"Darina and I are perfectly normal, but we are no longer sharing a bed," Richtarz told Blesk.
He claims that if Richtaržova finds new love, he won't stop her.
"We don't sleep together, and I don't care where she goes, who and if she has a friend.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with Yvette, and I have full responsibility," Joseph concluded.
The worst kind of women are: Are they calling you to account?
When you ask men to call some typical bad women habits, they usually list them all immediately.
Ladies and gentlemen, do you know yourself in the following lines that describe several female habits that make men angry?
Shopping
Your second half complains that you're constantly going to the shops?
You need to buy at least one thing every week?
Do you like shopping for big sales?
If so, your shopping can be considered a stupid habit.
Some women recognize that they need to control their passion for shopping.
And yet, which of you will give up a walk through the stores of clothing in search of ideal sitting clothes and examples of it (if any, in different color options) in examples?
Maybe shopping is a hobby for most women, but for men it can be a real hell.
Just remember how many times you said your second half to wait outside...
Everlasting Dissatisfaction
"I'm too fat?"
"I need to drop at least five pounds -- maybe I should start doing gymnastics?"
"You're still pulling on me?"
Do you know these phrases?
Yeah?
Then you're part of a group of women who are involved in their appearance.
Not that you need to stop following yourself, but many men literally have an allergy to the ongoing complaints of their partners on their external appearance.
The strong gender also agrees that the more often such complaints arise, the more women provoke them.
The Most Important Order and Cleanliness
It's like an endless story.
Mummy glass, chicken cleaning, mummy sex, washing dust, cleaning the bathroom - at least twice a week.
You're criticizing your partner for coming to a clean caffele in dirty bottles; children for sin in clean sleeves and fingerprints on a window window window in a hotel that was so difficult to clean?
If you are suffering from this “refoulement”, try to realize that you are going to get into a very bad situation; and that your family should not be in the first place.
A tireless desire for cleanliness can threaten your relationships as well as your entire family.
Ordering intent
"Put the whites in the basket."
"Are you going to put on dirty legs tomorrow?"
"The open pillows for the dishes should not be on the floor."
If you make your partner’s comments a few times a day, he may feel that it is very helpful.
Of course, you have good intentions, you just want everything to be perfect.
Maybe if men understood that, women wouldn't have to command them so often...
Split
Some women like to gossip, insult, and confuse others.
Women are focused on relationships, so they like to discuss who, where, how, and why.
From time to time, it's likely that each one of us is breaking up.
Let's be frank, that's the kind of nature of all women.
In any case, there are more serious gamblers, women who often cheat and despise others, and they, especially in the women ' s working group, pose a major threat to their environment.
The results of Jagra and Voracheka's transfers helped Philadelphia win
During the NHL match on Monday, two successful transmissions of the hockey attacker Jaromira Yagra helped Philadelphia to win 5:3 on Karolina's ice. He again became the most successful Czech match player.
In both cases, Claude Gyru used the experience of a thirty - nine - year - old star; he added another transmission and was announced by the best gamer.
Two successful matches also belonged to the player in one team with Yagre Jacubu Vorachek.
After his mother - in - law, Jagr, he told the foreign journalists that he had foretold a wonderful evening for the Gyri.
"I told him he'd kill a het-trick."
"I felt it."
"Sometimes you feel such things," Yagir explained, after which Gyru shot the goal at the first opportunity that Fliers gave.
A short time later, the second goal of the team was also the Czech track.
Locking Harrikeinz Vorachek took over the shiba and handed it over to Max Talbot, who killed between the circles.
In a second until the first break of the home game, Patrick Dwyer reduced the break with a number of advantages, but Flyers was again taken back in the beginning of the second time.
Especially the jury.
After his successful release, Yagra killed the third goal; his strike was further turned into the fourth goal by Wayne Simmonds.
"I like playing with him."
"I don't mean to say that he's the best league game, but he's exactly in three of the best," said Jagr, complimenting his central.
"I never thought at the end of my career I'd play a hockey game like him."
"That makes me happy."
"I want to support him."
"All these years in the NHL, my teammates have been trying to help me, and now my turn has come," Jagr added.
Caroline made the match more dramatic with Tuomo Routu and the Dwyer Penalties, reducing the gap to one goal.
The further complications prevented Matt Reed, who increased the gap to two points.
"Fronger worked well in our area."
"He hit on the sidewalk, I rushed, and Reed went to the far end."
"I'm glad it worked," Voraček described his impression from the last goal of the match.
The victory moved Philadelphia to the first place in the East Conference.
The protector of the Montreal Czech team, Jaroslav Spachek, did not complete the match with Buffalo; he left the game in the second period due to the trauma of the upper body.
Together with an experienced Canadian defender, they lost their two-eye advantage and lost 2:3 after a series of pens.
Thomas Plecane was unable to kill during one of their attacks.
More than lost points, the home coach was upset by a large number of injuries in the back row, as the match ended only with five defenders.
"The situation is bad."
"We ended the match with only one experienced game, the rest were young people."
"No matter what it is, we can't do anything about it, we just need to calm down," said Jacques Martin.
"In exchange for replacement, it was offensive and we couldn't resist."
"We had to simplify the game, move the soap out of our area."
"What was our weak side," added P.K.Subban
After thirty attacks, Czech golfer Onjay Pavelez helped Winnipeg win Tampa Bay 5:2.
The naked Jets, who broke the five-year series of defeats, were killed by five different players.
Price dynamics for travel since 1989
By 1989 only five public tourism agencies had been able to work in the former Czechoslovakia: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Recrea and Autotourist.
Since travel to the West was severely restricted, tourism agencies at that time mainly sold tours to socialist bloc countries.
Thus, Czech tourists traveled to the German Democratic Republic; the Soviet Union (Sochi, Crimea on the Black Sea); Bulgaria; Romania (both countries on the Black Sea); and Hungary (Balton).
The only exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when we had the opportunity to travel to Yugoslavia, and the Yugoslav regime then returned to the West, resulting in significant restrictions on the visit of Czech tourists to Yugoslavia.
A major paradox of the socialist period was that citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e. Czechoslovakia) were not allowed to travel individually through socialist countries.
If a Czech citizen wanted to go on his own, for example, to the Soviet Union or Poland, a letter of invitation was required from that country; the second individual journey was impossible.
At the time, tourist agencies offered to travel to the West, but it was necessary either to stay all night with a sleeping bag or to have "good friends" in the agency.
And that wasn't all.
A currency permit was required for a trip to the West, and it was not issued to politically untrustworthy people who were not allowed to travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not freely converted; without the currency it was impossible to obtain money (western currency) for a trip to the West.
Most of the time, the Czechs took their vacation home, which led to the emergence of a large number of cats and summer houses, this habit remains to this day.
Since 1989 tourism in the Czech Republic has thus survived the present revolution.
While before 1989 the GDR or Bulgaria was the culmination of our journeys, the Czechs spent 4.5 million vacations in countries around the world last year.
The great paradox, which we no longer realize, is that by 1989 we could not freely visit Croatia's most popular at present, since it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
At the beginning of 1990, the need for visas in the neighbouring countries of Western Europe had been abolished, and this was the beginning of a huge wave of short journeys mainly in Vienna and Germany.
The Czechoslovaks couldn't get on their way to the West, and they all wanted to go there for a while.
For example, in Paris, Czech tourists slept in parks in tents, since their income at the time did not include a hotel or a pension.
The typical feature of Czech tourism during that period was the desire to bring their own food (conservatives, salads, etc.) to save money.
Another important moment is the introduction of a freely converted Czech crown. After decades our tourists can finally buy the Western currency freely.
Our standard of living and average income grew, which led to another important situation in 1997.
Since 1997, increased demand has enabled tourism agencies to prepare regular flights carried out by charter airlines.
By the end of the 1990s, there was no need for a visa to visit almost all the developed world countries except the United States, which made our journeys even easier.
The next major event in the history of post-revolution journeys took place in 2000 and a major demand led to the historic first direct charter trip from the Czech Republic to the exotic country, Thailand.
Since then, direct charter flights have been delivered by Czech tourists to warm exotic countries, and this winter flight from the Czech Republic will be sent to 12 exotic destinations.
At present, some 100,000 Czechs visit exotic countries every year!
And another important event of this period, symbolizing our development after the revolution, took place in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the United States cancelled the visa requirement for Czech tourists, so our country has always joined the most developed countries in the world.
For the first time in history in 2008, Czechs spent more than half their leave abroad (50.3%); and for the first time in history they spent more than 15,000 crowns per person during the holiday abroad, including their costs in the assignment paragraph.
The general meeting must elect the President, the threat of return
There was no president for about five months in Czech football; there was a risk that the successor Ivan Gashek, the head of the Czech Football Association (FAČR) would not be appointed even after another extraordinary general meeting to be held in Nimburg on Tuesday.
There is still no agreement on what electoral rules to follow.
Without that, the vote for one of the three candidates will not begin.
Integrating Rachel, Miroslav Pelta and Thomas Paclik want to lead the Czech football.
Gasek left his post in June, and he called on his colleagues to unite and find a strong personality that would lead the football in the future.
However, Gašek's era re-loaded football between the two chambers of the association, which cannot elect one candidate.
This was clearly 16 September when a new president had to be elected.
The delegates of the general assembly had recently arrived at the National House in Prague, Smileov, because the negotiations remained blocked, not only by the electoral procedure.
There was no agreement on who had the right to vote in the general assembly, only legal representatives or officials who had been authorized.
This has since been partially resolved by the recommendation of the State and the Law Institute, which makes it impossible for a delegation based on the powers granted.
Disputes concerning electoral rules, however, continue.
The Executive Board also did not help too much, although at its meetings, both ordinary and extraordinary, it was mainly concerned with this issue.
The presentation of voting methods has changed several times, but the key issue remains the same.
The question is, how do you go to the 3rd round and avoid the road?
“The challenge is whether to follow established standards or to find another model,” says one of the Vice-Presidents of FAČR Dushan Freedom, who represents a professional football in the management of the association.
Based on the models provided for by the statute, the winner of the 3rd round is a candidate who has received great support from the chamber from which he is a candidate.
It is alleged that Moravia agrees with compromise that it is the winner of the election of the candidate with the highest number of voters in both chambers.
The Czech side insists that at least two thirds of the vote should be taken by the winner in the overall percentage ratio.
"However, the two previous rounds would then lose their sense; it would completely reject the concept of the two chambers," Freedom agrees with the Moravia arguments, saying it would be better not to change the rules and vote in accordance with the existing rules.
A few unexpectedly, Thomas Paclik agrees with his view, although according to the estimates of the electoral rules established by the statute, Pelta is more than other candidates.
"I would like the elections to go as far as the constitution."
"I want to avoid all possible representational nonsense, as in the previous general assembly," said the owner of Victoria Plzen, who was the first candidate; and in his statements he mostly contradicted Pelte.
Pelta remains an optimist.
He believed that the new president would become known in Nimburg; he also hoped that candidates would cooperate constructively in the future.
"All emotional dissatisfaction will take place after today's expected departure of the national assembly at the European Championship."
"The football will again be in a happy mood, people will be more willing to cooperate," said the representative of Jablonec, who has the most experience in football management at both professional and regional levels.
Rachel's more restrained.
"I hope for an agreement, but the situation is very different."
"It's not between the representatives of Bohemia and Moravia, but there's an attempt to adapt the rules in mind."
"This could cause another collapse of the general assembly."
"I hope that good sense will win," said Rachel.
There is not much time left for the parties to reach an agreement.
According to some information, individual negotiations have taken place directly in Montenegro; but who knows whether football unity will be achieved with the match.
The additional voyage, which had to be delivered, other than the Vice-Presidents Dalibor Doger and Reichla to Podgorica, did not depart from Prague in the morning due to technical failure, and requested an alternative to deliver part of the executive committee to the place of the re-playing match.
At the end of the day, the ministerial meeting, which is expected to be Wednesday, could be crucial.
The Minister of Education, Youth and Sport, Joseph Dobes, would like the opposition parties to the country to come to an agreement.
There are many: government grants; football credit; and the planned general meeting of the CSTV with a new Czech sport directive following the financial problems of Sazki.
Paclik will enter the presidential struggle because he does not see an appropriate candidate
If, before the extraordinary general meeting, the head of the football team, Plzen Tomash Paclik, had seen a strong candidate who would meet all his requirements to the President of the Czech Football Association (FAČR), he would not even claim a high position.
"If I were a worthy candidate, I would fight for him and not participate in the fight myself."
"But such a man has not yet been found," said Paclik CTK.
Paclyk's motive for fighting Miroslav Pelt and Indrezhium Rachel is to try to prevent Pelt, the alleged election favor, from entering FAČR.
Moreover, Paclik stresses that in the event of a victory, he will remain the President only until 2013, when the regular general meeting is scheduled.
In the future, he would like this post to be held by an experienced top manager who is not too involved in football.
"I've talked to a few people that could be considered."
"It was horrible for me to hear some of them say that they don't even want to be involved in Czech football at the moment."
"I would like to change that opinion," he said.
At present, the main dispute between Pazlica and Pelta is related to relations with the last Roman Berbro, president of the Regional Football Association in Plzeň. Berbro is a man of conflicting reputation known as an influential lobbyist who is able to influence the vote of delegates of the general assembly.
Paklik thus considered it unacceptable for Pelta to become president.
"If he wins, the current situation will remain unchanged and the football will not move forward."
"With the support of a capable businessman, it would be even worse for football," said Paclik.
He argues that several years ago, the name of Pelta was recorded during the hearing of the telephones during the investigation of the case of corruption; he was able to avoid convictions.
"I don't know what reward Pelta would bring for football."
"And what would we look like in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said Paclik, he now does not mention his previous statement that he would "sold the Plzeň Club if Pelta became president."
If Paclik wins on Thursday, he could present cooperation with Pelt in the future.
That opinion was shared by another candidate, Rachel, whom Paclik supported before the general assembly in September, which ended in Fiasco.
"He would be the first to call me."
'He's very capable.'
"I can present it to the head of the assembly."
"But he can't run an association."
"I don't have a nose in what I don't understand," said Paclik, who drew a lot of attention to himself in September when he supported the removal of the judge's brigade led by Man Macello, who changed Dagmar Damkova.
Paclik claims that he will risk managing the association.
He referred to his experience in the management of private companies; from last summer, he managed the Plzeň team, which with his help distinguished his first triumph in the league in May.
"I have the strength to make the football environment change, to support its change to the best."
"Restrict the influence of some groups of people who tend to influence the disciplinary and appeals board, leading to repetitive situations," said Paclik. He did not hide his antipathy, for example, with the director of Sparta Daniel Krjetinski.
One of its priorities would be to strengthen the relationship between FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with which it would lobby at the highest political level to allocate more money to sport from lottery collections.
"This is one of the key points that a new president should take care of."
"If taxes are charged with gambling, as political parties say, I understand their arguments, but they must state clearly where the money is going," he said.
Paclik does not consider his relationship with the Plzehn Club to be a burden, although he claims that President FAČR should be independent.
Pelta's connected to the Jablonite, and Rachel with the Prague Doll.
"It's not an ideal option."
"And yet I don't see any point in the hypocritical transfer of my shares to someone else's Plzeň Club when I'm going back there six months later," said Paclik.
Pelta promised new FAČR rules that would avoid the Electoral Pat.
Two days before the general meeting of the Football Association, one of the presidential candidates, Miroslav Pelta, promised that if he was elected, he would fight for the new FAČR rules to avoid any dispute about election rules in the future.
Before the Thursday negotiations in Nimburg, the Yablonec officer remains optimistic and believes that attention from the pre-election struggle will seem to diminish the expected success of our football team today.
Before the failed elections in September, Pelta promised that if he won, he would focus on both representation and financial resources.
He decided to participate in the elections at the last moment before the last general meeting, so the two-month delay could be useful for him to resist his ideas about football in a broader context.
"People at all levels have long been in football, and they expect the president to be known on Thursday."
“They feel that it is now the time for someone to lead an association,” claims the person who is mainly associated with the Jablonite club; but he spent many years in Sparta and the executive committee of the Association.
This gives him reason to assume that he is experienced enough to manage Czech football.
He believed that the present problems were caused by the ephoria that reigned during the reign of Ivan Gashek.
"Unfortunately, the rules that were not so perfect as we all thought were adopted at the general meeting in June."
"If different methods of representation had not been adopted, we would have been president since September," Pelta said.
He referred to the rewriting of the key document of the Civil Association as a false target for delegates.
"If I become president, I will consider it my personal task, and I will take personal responsibility if this attempt turns out to be unsuccessful."
"This is a fundamental question that we cannot exist without," says Pelta.
Besides, he says he's not trying to get into the background of the rivals.
In the past, he had already stated that he could present his cooperation with Jindzhi Ryhl, whom he appreciated for legal education; he was fully aware of the fact that his opponent had to become his first vice-president.
For a long time, he did not attack Thomas Paccik, who constantly criticized Pelta.
"He's been in football for more than a year and has made some success."
"In any case, his attacks were inappropriate, and many people were surprised by the methods of his election campaign."
"That's why some of them now doubt his true personality," said Pelta about his rival, and he claims to be faithful to the declarations he made in September.
He considered his main weapons to be the knowledge of football, from competitions at the lowest level to national assembly.
The national assembly should represent the whole football.
"I would also try to stop all incidents, starting with the case of the Goddess or the consequences of the last year's corruption scandal."
"I would then focus on negotiations with both the private and public sectors to guarantee a sufficient amount of money for the whole football," the forty-six-year-old candidate CTC said two months ago.
He then promised that his election as a football leader would not result in the dismissal of staff.
"I will need to know the official instructions of the individual staff." It was his message to Fearov, where the prolonged period of inter-power was a source of considerable nervousness.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios along with the planned general meeting, he believed that delegates would not come to Nimburg in vain on Thursday.
"If the only issue is how to hold elections in the third round, we can deal with it."
"The football needs the trust he can get, just by choosing his leader," says Pelta, who remains optimistic two days before the key day of his career.
Rachel promises that under his leadership FAČR will start working actively
If the meeting on Thursday at the Yindhji Ryhl, the Vice-President, would be the president of the Czech Football Association, many in the Association would be indisputable.
Rachel promises that if he is selected, a hard time will come.
He wished to establish changes in the system and to make members of the Executive Committee responsible for individual football areas.
It also promises to address the problem of the Goddess; to improve relations with both UEFA and FIFA; to attract more money into football; and to continue the work of the former President, Ivan Gashek.
"As President, I would like to focus on football in general."
"From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA, to national assembly, professional football and football activities for young people".
"That's why I don't want to say that I'm doing it all by myself," Rachel said in her interview to the CHK.
"I am a team player, and I want to allocate powers to the executive committee so that each member will focus on a specific area."
"I'm thoroughly sharing the tasks so that in each of these segments, football takes a big step forward."
“It probably won’t be popular with many people because it will mean hard work, not just criticism of others’ work,” he added.
The atmosphere of criticism in the football movement was supposed to cause him to doubt his candidacy.
"I know I work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know if there's any meaning in this; and that I'm not going to be surrounded by people who put their fingers in my wheels and question my every move," he explained his doubts.
"Nonetheless, many people told me that I shouldn't give up, otherwise others will come."
"That trust I can't throw away," he said.
Moreover, he said that his motivation was to continue the work he had begun with the Gashek.
"A lot of work has been done in those two years, and I don't want to cross it all."
"There have been processes that can produce results in a few years, and I don't want anyone else to stop them," he said, fearing that if another candidate, Miroslav Pelta, would be elected, the situation in the Association could return to what was before Gashek.
"I believe in a systematic approach, and that's what Mirek Pelta is hardly competent to do."
"He's surrounded by people who play soccer so that he's only available to the chosen ones."
"I can be accused in a lot, but it's not subjectivity anymore."
"I'm trying to be objective."
"I want to make football available to everyone, because then everyone will have a good time, not just a chosen minority," said Rachel.
Moreover, he objected to the accusation that he would only be President of the Czech Republic.
"Many people are trying to claim the reverse, and I'm planning to make the maximum for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to think about the division of the second league into the Czech and Moravian parts, whose winners would continue to fight in the first league."
"This will prevent the current situation when there are only three Moravia teams in the league, which is a problem for young players in Moravia," Rachel said.
While Plzehn Paclik has entered the presidential struggle, Rachel is not ashamed to assess his chances of victory.
"Nonetheless, I still feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has elected me as Vice-President, and I see that I have achieved some obvious success," said Rachel.
On the other hand, he partly blames himself for having no unity in the association.
Assuring that Pelta was "removaled from the process of restoring Czech football's creditworthiness", he considers another rival, Paclik, a strong candidate who has what to offer.
"No one can doubt that he worked well in Plzen this year."
"If he is selected, I hope he will continue what Ivan Gashek started, without significant staffing changes in the committees."
"He wouldn't be disclosing the facts for his own benefit," said Rachel about his rival.

She was lying on her back in the water, looking up at the tastefully shaped dome, swimming on marble cherubs waiting for her at the end of the pool, and falling in love with carefully restored swimming pools in the ar-new style.
She was tempted to add every favorite pool to her notebook, with important details about the building and the history of the building.
The history of the Meder architecture has seen more than 200 swimming pools - and has now gathered the impressions of its recently published book Badefreuden (Body of the Cup), where everything went from public pools in Munich to historical baths in the Black Forest and the "functional concrete buildings" in Taunus.
In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, it visited the bathrooms in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania and Poland, and one city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old author is the present enthusiasm for buying culture.
She has very little enthusiasm for sports, says Meder, but in water everything else.
The only lack is that the swimmers should rest with the blue capillary and the smell of chlorine, while the runaways can breathe the enchanting smell of pine forests or listen to the joyful chirping of birds in the park.
"I once asked myself why the swimming pools should always be so horrible," says the resident of Vienna Meder.
"That's how I started collecting beautiful pools."
When the surface doubles the architecture
Swimming in the pool and the oil sought in the sauna is a healing factor in the bathrooms, because in the opinion of Meder, all feelings are stimulated.
And swimming pools can be this pleasure to the eye if the builders take on such work. "Instead of the pool, you have a water surface."
"The surface is very transparent, but it also reflects the beauty of the entire building."
Everything is visible: high floors, colour tiles, and trampling.
The illustrated edition of The Joy of the Cup on 190 pages contains valuable information on the architectural and cultural history of the health oasis - and gives you the desire to dive into water.
The water collector Meder found several outstanding copies during the study in Hungary.
It found rich nitrates in the cassette cave (Pesterna bath in Miskolz-Tapolca) and thermal bath filled with saltwater in a building built in the form of a bottle (Város Termálfürdö in Jasbén), as well as magnificent therapeutic baths, such as 100-year-old bathrooms in Budapest.
Many of the heated open swimming pools in Switzerland and Austria, on the other hand, have a stunning kind. You can see all Zurich from the bathroom on the roof or consider the snowy Arlberg from the open swimming pool in St. Anthony, and there is a couple window that allows you to see what's going on.
Perhaps the most unusual design is waiting for bathrooms in Langenfelde.
The winter comes up from it a few of the three open crabs, which seem to be quite small on the background of the Ectal Mountains.
Algambra in Schwarzvalde
The pools collection was not in every pool of chlorine smell.
Many thermal baths smell a lot of cheese, and the bath names of Arpad in Beckeschabe smell so much oil that you may find it difficult to believe that you're in a healing source.
The smell of hydrocarbons in the seawater, which is almost black from the water, which will stick to the skin as soon as you get into the pool, a healing experience of a certain type.
At some point, however, Iris Meder was disappointed in her search for beautiful places for the bath, and when she tried to visit the open pool of Czech baths in Lugačovica, she found that the territory was sealed.
The bathrooms designed by the architect Dushan Yurkovic in 1902 were closed.
When Meder looked at the apparent red-white-white building windows in the ar-new style, she saw the mushrooms growing between the capillaries.
One of the places where the destruction was halted on hot tracks, the amazing swimming pool in Schwarzwalde, the Thermal Water Palace in Bad Wildbad.
The Basins have already passed three stages of construction, and you will find not only the neo-Roman elements of the post-building period in 1844, but also the Mauritian Algambra-style hall, which was added about 1900.
After a thorough reconstruction in 1995, the Thermal Palace, a favorite swimming pool known as Iris Meder, was not just because it was born in Schwarzwald.
"This achievement is so masterfully combining these different architectural styles," says Meder.
To enter a thermal pool in such a court is clearly a secondary occupation.
Speculation of agricultural production
The Bank is investigating trade in agricultural products.
Christian Titus
Will Doyce Bank stop trading in agricultural production?
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, Joseph Akkermann has commissioned the working group to investigate the impact of speculation on the poor worldwide.
The Executive Director plans to amend in January.
Hamburg
According to one study, 84 per cent of German citizens consider it unacceptable that banks speculate on agricultural products such as wheat and maize.
Two thirds of the respondents demand that the Bank and other banks stop trade in agricultural products, as trade increases the problems facing the poorest people worldwide.
The findings were made in a study conducted by the Institute for Social Research and Statistical Analysis of the Foodwatch Consumer Organization.
The study is based on the report submitted by Foodwatch in mid-October.
The author of the report, Harald Shuman, shows that the world's stock exchange rate is rising prices, and the banks are thus involved in global hunger.
The consumer protection campaign is directed directly against the head of Doice Bank Joseph Akkermann, although large bank houses, such as Godman Sacks and Morgan Stanley, are also trading.
Originally, the goods were thought to be a means of protecting traders from price fluctuations.
In any case, most experts now agree that the players have rejected the rules of the proposal and demand and are being made available to the poorest.
Unlike competitors in the United States, Akkermann has responded to criticism and has promised to investigate the charges and stated that no trade “is worth risking the good reputation of the Bank”.
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, the international working group is currently investigating the allegations contained in the Foodwatch report.
The investigation should be completed by the end of the year when the results will be submitted to the Board of Directors of the Doyce Bank, with recommendations for action.
The Bank ' s head then plans to announce changes following the investigation at the end of January.
Trade in goods may be reduced or stopped at all.
Akkermann's working on his image.
The President of Foodwatch Tilo Bode welcomed the news, stressing his critical attitude towards the financial sector. "The rising food prices are an example of how foolish banks are currently acting against common interests."
As the bank's chief lobbyist in Akkermann has a certain responsibility, in the opinion of Bode.
"Dear Bank must remove from the portfolio all investments that make money at food prices," Bode said.
"It doesn't matter if it's about starving people or the reputation of Doke Bank."
Akkermann's immediate reaction at first was surprising, but in the meantime, the director would like to have an unmistakable image only a few months before his stay in the office.
Doc Bank announced on Monday that the chairman would not go to the monitoring board as planned.
The elimination of the speculative dispute on the food market could improve its image.
He also had little to do with the costs - with the consequences of his successor.
Every second would have refused to invest in goods.
Foodwatch is trying to keep pressure on the manager.
To date, more than 30,000 Internet users have joined the organization ' s campaign.
Bode published a study on Tuesday, which was conducted for the Institute of Social Research and Statistical Analysis of Forsa 7 and 8 November, and 1001 participated.
No more than eleven per cent believe that investments that make food prices are acceptable to the Bank.
Many banking clients would also take concrete steps if they found that their bank was involved in such a trade; according to the study, each second would withdraw the contributions that eventually lead to commodity speculation.
43 per cent had been recommended to leave the bank, 49 per cent had said that they thought they would close the account and move to another bank.
21st - century house in Vienna
Pavilion in the New Place
Ingeborg Vinsovski
Architectural history with escapes, falls and a happy ending. The Austrian pavilion for the 1958 World Exhibition in Brussels won prizes, became a museum in Vienna, was devastated and abandoned.
Now it's being reopened as an exhibition center.
The Pavilion of Austria, designed by Karl Swancer for the 1958 World Exhibition in Brussels, is a well-known example of modern post-war architecture with its simple glass halls that expressed faith in technical progress.
Pavilion Swancera won Gran-pri for his lightweight steel and glass casting in 1958.
The building is considered a hub in modern architecture.
This made the architect so famous that he also built the pavilion of Austria at the next World Exhibition.
Finally, he celebrated the whole world in 1973 with his legendary 4-cylinder garden BMW and her sister, a glass-shaped building.
Pavilion, conceived as a temporary exhibition building, was moved to the Swiss Garden around the South Vienna Station, transformed and opened as the Museum of the 20th century in 1962, and is often referred to as the “House of the 20th century” for this reason.
In any case, the building did not approach the museum for technical and spatial reasons - it did not contain walls on which art could be hung and poor air conditioning.
However, it continued to be used until modern art in Vienna had received a new home.
The house has been desolated since 2001, and its state has become worse and worse.
Architect Adolf Krishanitz has so far refurbished the pavilion, which was called the "House of the 21st Century" and will be used as a museum of contemporary art.
This museum is the Belveder Museum office, which will open the first exhibition on Tuesday evening, in all respects a joyful event.
Agnes Husley-Arco, who became the new director of the Austrian Belveder Gallery in 2007, contributed to a new start.
Husley-Arco, graduate of the Faculty of Art History with a brilliant youth figure career, which worked at Sotheby's, Guggenheim Museum and eventually became the founder and director of the Museum of Modernity in Zalzburg, convinced politicians and conservators to continue reconstruction, attracted public funds and private donations and decided on how the building would be used.
The new museum was to be a permanent exhibition of Fritz Voruba's fund, coffee and bookstore along with contemporary art, and an office building was to be built.
Strict control & limited budget
Krishanitz was then the ideal candidate for the project.
He was well known, of course, because of the restoration and expansion of the Vienna Session Joseph Olbrih, and he won the competition, but he also studied at Schwancer at the University of Technology in Vienna, and the pavilion was for him “an extremely important place”, where he attended “almost every week”.
He knew the original design and knew the tasks that were ahead of the building, the building that had already lost some of its greatness and ease when it was moved to Vienna and transformed.
The problems that have arisen during the last restructuring were much more serious, and the building was "a waste of energy", says Krishanitz.
Window profiles on the glass facade were replaced, reinforced with a glass fibre safe glass, and the glass roof was replaced with a high-end safety glass.
The steel versions of the heat bridge were strengthened or replaced, and asbestos was removed from the floor.
Two floors have created space for the new use of the building, a burning light source between the building and the street provides lighting - almost a new building, but still a swanzer pavilion.
The original outer doors were preserved, and the building was decorated in an old red and corrosive color of protection from corrosion.
Hol, the theater is the same as it was before.
All of this is under the strict control of the museum and with a limited budget.
"We often had to find material that was good, cheap and approved by the museum administration," Krishanitz said, pointing to an uneven style in the basement.
The building remained flexible and easy, despite restrictions, problems and conversions.
Krishnitz recently noticed that the pavilion of Brussels was a rough, typical story of the chapel in the city.
Such an architecture is “not always in its place” and still wants to “stimulate the present awareness”.
The house of the 21st century is in a very right place, as the city's planning has had an unexpected success. A completely reconstructed headquarters with offices and real estate is growing around Switzerland now.
The house of the 21st century can be complemented by the second building of Krishanitz, the French von Gabsburg collector, acquired the Berlin Temporary Exhibition Hall and is reported to have been negotiating with the city on its location in the neighbourhood of the Swiss garden.
Deutsche Bahn is planning a multimillion winter anti-crisis package
Deutsche Bahn announced an anti-crisis plan to avoid the cancellation of winter trains.
The number of staff should be doubled.
The cost will be millions of euros.
According to the newspaper, Deutsche Bahn will spend more than 70 million euros this year in order to avoid snowflakes and train delays.
Referring to the Deutsche Bahn's internal anti-crisis plan, Bild reported that by 2015 the total investment had been planned for about 300 million euros.
Investments are designed to improve the performance of locomotives and rail networks even in extreme weather conditions.
The number of personnel involved in the snow treatment from roads and platforms will be increased by two to 16,000.
The aim is to clean the platforms from snow and ice before work and 90 per cent of the necessary shootings within four to five hours.
Rudiger Grube, Head of Deutsche Bahn, warned of the possibility of cancellation and delays of the winter trains at a meeting with government and industry leaders two months ago.
Last winter, Deutsche Bahn experienced considerable difficulties in passenger transport, as it did not catch up with the reserves at the time of the deterioration of weather conditions.
Many of the new regional trains of the years were expected to be approved by the Federal Railway Service.
There were also some delays with ICE trains.
Deutsche Bahn also had a much more frequent time to check the axles of ICE after one of the ICE trains broke at the main station in Kelney.
Lake Bank will pay millions of fines in the United States
New troubles followed the riots around Joseph Akkermann, Director General Doice Bank: Doice Bank threatens a fine in the United States in many millions of pounds of sterling.
The Doke Bank's last industrial giant in the U.S. now has little problem, and the Doke Bank, headquarters in Frankfurt, will pay $145 million (106 million) to settle the disputes that arose after bankruptcy during the financial crisis of the five largest credit unions.
A problem arose about the sale of mortgage bonds.
The National Management of Credit Unions (NCUA), a financial market regulator, accuses a number of major banks of using false promises to mislead credit unions to buy their financial products.
The value of bonds fell sharply during the financial crisis and led down credit unions.
"We are pleased that this problem has been resolved without the parties being brought to court," said the representative of Doice Bank in New York.
In the agreement, the bank did not accept its responsibility.
The same is true of Citigroup, who agreed to pay $20.5 million.
President NCUA Debby Mattz welcomed the operational response of both banks.
National Credit Unions Management (NCUA), is responsible for US credit unions and is involved in bankruptcy processes to protect consumer contributions.
NCUA is struggling to compensate for the losses that have been incurred from the billions.
This is the first such agreement.
The regulator also drew attention to other major banks, and in the summer, brought up a case against JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
Suspected mortgage bonds are so-called securities secured by a pool of mortgage credits.
They're supported by internal loans.
This led to the fate of several financial companies, when the real estate market in the United States began to collapse in 2007.
The U.S. Investment Bank Lehman Brothers has long ordered to live in September 2008 for a grave financial crisis.
A few years later, U.S. banks are still fighting the storm.
Investors and regulators have made a large number of claims, requiring compensation or punishment for fraud.
The Federal Housing Financing Agency (FHFA) is the biggest wave of claims.
It charges 18 major international banks that they have acquired US credit organizations Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac hostage agreements of approximately $200 billion.
The Bank is also facing a threat to FHFA ' s prosecution of multiple agreements with a total value of $14.2 billion between 2005 and 2007.
The regulator requires that a bank with headquarters in Frankfurt assume responsibility for “substantial losses”, but has not yet indicated the exact amount.
The Bank's daughter rejected the claims as unfounded and reported her intention to challenge them.
Warren Buffett invests 10 billion in IBM
Buffet's financial guru is actively investing in IBM's IT company.
Since March, he has purchased shares of more than ten billion dollars.
So far, the largest American investor Warren Buffett has always stated that he does not invest in computers and IT companies because their long-term development is difficult to predict.
However, IBM's annual report changed its view of investment in this sector.
According to Buffeta, he had to understand much earlier that IBM was primarily offering services and purchasing computer systems for the IT departments of other companies.
In the financial world, Warren Buffett's investments have been assessed as a rickshaw.
IBM, a veteran of the IT industry, has now received the title "sir IBM".
In an interview with the American business channel CNBC Buffet reported that he had acquired IBM shares for a total of $10.7 billion since March.
His investment holding Berkshire Hathaway was one of the largest holders of IBM shares of 5.5 per cent.
Buffett said that even IBM had recently known nothing about his involvement.
He commended the management that had been able to make it even during the financial crisis.
"They've done a lot of work," said Buffett, referring to the management strategy.
A significant time for IBM has been focused on high-income IT services such as dating centres.
The founder of the computer industry, now over 100 years old, offers software and advisory services as well as powerful business computers.
Until now, Buffett has been avoiding technology companies.
He said he only invests in the company he understands.
and invested, for example, in freight transport, in the production of lubricants and in machinery.
His holding Berkshire Hathaway has shares in the long list of major companies, such as Coca-Cola and Munich Re (formerly Municher Rüb), along with some 80 of his own subsidiaries.
The 81-year-old acquires a small textile company, Berkshire Hathaway, in the 1960s, and has built on it one of the most expensive companies in the world.
His life course, however, remained modest.
made it a cultural figure for countless investors all over the world.
His almost invincible instinct in making money brought him the oracle of Omaha.
The price of IBM shares increased by one per cent before the opening of markets after Buffeta's investment was announced.
The Blue Giant, as IBM is called, stands at the stock exchange of over $220 billion, making it one of the most expensive high-tech companies in the world along with Apple and Microsoft.
But Buffett said he wasn't going to invest in Microsoft.
Her founder Bill Gates is his close friend.
Imminent danger
Following the discovery of "in Queequeu" Turkish media became suspicious of the power of the law in Germany.
One of the newspapers is talking about "blood ideology", which is now being re-established on the surface.
The killings of eight Turkish and one Greek businessman between 2000 and 2006 were the result of the right of extremist ideology.
Fear and concern have responded to this communication in Turkey and in the German-German community.
For many Turks in Germany, this news has caused long forgotten fears. Such extremist attacks on Turks have not since been on fire in Mellin in November 1992 and in Zolingen in May 1993.
There was never any doubt, but there was xenophobia in Germany.
However, the right-wing network now found is of a magnitude that is not yet fully aware of.
"Rebirth of blood ideology?" was the title of the internet version of the Turkish newspaper Haberturk.
The Sabah newspaper, on the other hand, notes that one of the criminals was a secret intelligence officer, and expresses concern that the German authorities might be involved in the right-wing extremist plague.
The Turkish community in Germany (TGD) responded in a calm way by replacing the victims of racial hatred with a silent picket opposite the Brandenburg Gate in these exits.
Just two weeks ago, the Turkish community of Berlin at a ceremony with German and Turkish politicians celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish bilateral employment agreement.
Cooperation between the two countries was presented in a positive light - as a history of success.
In some Turkish media, education was like a waste. "A gift from Germany for the fiftieth anniversary" is the title of an article on the Turkish Internet portal "Haber X", commenting on the status of a series of murders.
The German edition Hürriyet also did not allow the case to hold that parallel.
"It makes bad smell" is the name of the column of Ahmet Kulahji.
He noted that people who paid taxes and their work had made a significant contribution to the transformation of Germany.
The conduct of the police and the subsequent successful area were severely criticized by the German-Turkish Internet Forums.
The authors wondered why the German authorities had not thought before about following suspects in the right-wing circles.
Some authors have come to a rather harsh rhetoric. "If they continue to act as closely as they did, migrants will have no choice but to defend themselves."
"This will be the best self-defense."
"The peace in Germany is very much dependent on how the entire network will be exposed and on the justice of the punishment," says Selen.
The crimes in Mellin and Zolingen in the 1990s were an example of the threat of the world in Germany.
The pictures of burned ruins in Zolingen were deeply impressed by the memories of Germans and Turks.
No other event has shown to the Turks here so clearly that they are in danger, and to the Germans, that mistrust and indifference can lead to real violence.
These crimes, however, increased the sense of unity among Turks.
Do not repeat the previous error
The Turkish press at that time condemned mainly the failure of the German police after the attacks, and Helmut Cole refused to visit the survivors in Mellin.
He sent a telegram of condolences to the President of Turkey after the fires in Zolingen, but his Minister for Foreign Affairs Klaus Kinkel-Kinkel took part in the memorial ceremony in Cologne, counting in his speech the taxes the Turks pay in Germany,
It's as if he's setting the value of the taxes that he pays.
Today's coverage in Turkish media has again shown how the mistrust of many German Turks to the present German State has deepened since then.
It was clear that efforts should now be made to identify and reassess the rights of extremist terrorist organizations in Germany.
Bank scandal on the Zurich Lake
Most European banks are not in France or Italy, but in Switzerland.
The UBS has not been embroiled during the financial crisis and has since been constantly fighting one another, another one with the crisis.
Now he has to go back to the German course.
Alex Weber probably didn't suspect he'd have that role.
In July, following his effective departure from the position of the head of the Federal Bank, it was announced that in 2013 he would begin work on at least an effective position as Chairman of the Board of Directors of the largest Swiss bank UBS; unexpected and profitable careers.
Alex Weber was obviously in the woods, praised Switzerland for her beauty, UBS for her renewed strength, and made some friendly remarks to his future colleagues.
"UBS has been able to change for the better."
"I look forward to working with Caspar Fillier and Oswald Grubel."
But it's already become clear in September that everything will be completely different.
Treader UBS in London seized the bank's security systems and lost about 1.7 billion euros.
The executive director of UBS Oswald Grubel, a banker known not only in Switzerland, had to leave.
Since then, the chairman of the UBS Board of Directors has been considered ill, and everyone wants to know: when will Alex Weber finally take his position?
Weber has to consult the bank since February 2012.
And, as the bank said on Tuesday, the President of the Council will be in May, not in 2013.
It's not gonna be easy for Alex Weber.
He is a professor of economics and a specialist in the Central Bank, not a traditional banker, and he will undoubtedly need time to adapt.
He was secondly responsible for the Bank's strategy, which proved that he had long deserved the name "the biggest bank scandal in Europe".
UBS, on the one hand, is very large - until recently he has managed the largest assets in the world, and for years he does not come out of scandals.
A proud Swiss bank seems to be saving nothing.
It all started during the financial crisis.
By 2007, UBS had a wonderful reputation.
The Bank combined the image of a hidden and sustainable but at the same time the fishing asset manager with ambitious objectives and the desire to become the biggest player in the investment banking sector.
As a result, in 2007, UBS managed 1.6 billion, thus managing more money than any other bank in the world,
and as an investment bank entered the league of the world's largest banks.
That made an impression.
Hans Geiger, former banker and professor of banking, who has long taught at the University of Zurich Banking Institute, explains: "I have always led my students to UBS as a model of a good bank."
"I know what we know now, you can ask how I could be so wrong"
He was really wrong.
Only in 2007 did it become clear that there was something going on in UBS.
In the middle of the year, executive director Peter Wuffley, who was considered an outstanding intellectual and, to the same extent, a brilliant banker, suddenly left his post.
A few months later, we were able to guess why he left.
The investment unit of the bank tried to play on substandard securities and had to write billions of dollars.
You want to believe you don't, but UBS reported an increase of 13 billion Swiss francs to face the crisis.
The Bank has indeed been able to find investors - but investors, whose services many banks have recently been reluctant to accept, are one very transparent Asian sovereign fund from Singapore and one Arab sovereign fund, so secret that even its name has not been reported.
It was just the first shot.
In April 2008, things got much worse.
The Bank had to declare new billions of losses, and the chairman of the Board of Directors, Marcel Ospel, the second at the salary level, of the Board of Directors in Switzerland in 2006, retired.
A disaster occurred in October 2008, due to the lack of investment in the financial crisis of UBS, and the State had to save it.
The National Bank bought UBS toxic papers for an uncalled billionaire, and the Swiss Confederation paid six billion Swiss francs for convertible bonds with a binding conversion to become the bank's sovereign.
The whole of Switzerland was in shock: the country was aware of the dramatic consequences that huge banks had had in the small country.
In the end, the UBS score balance in 2007 was five times higher than all of Switzerland's production (see schedule).
"We can't save UBS for the second time," says bank analyst Geiger.
The second disaster occurred soon after the first.
A few months later, UBS capitalized in a tax dispute with the United States and stated that it was ready to transfer data from customers who may have been taxed by the bank.
UBS also agreed to pay $780 million, consisting of reimbursement of unwarranted revenues from business plus fines.
UBS thus recognized more or less that it was a tax-reduction tool.
At the same time, UBS lost what was always his advantage in fighting for rich customers, a secret bond.
After that, the Swiss banking secret was no longer the same as it was before.
The Executive Director and the Chairman of the Board of Directors subsequently resigned, and
The customer's cash out.
In a few months' time, the bank lost confidence in both main areas of its business - in investment due to failed speculation and asset management as a result of assistance and tax evasion.
And it just calmed down, and it seemed that UBS was able to break down the situation, as it happened with an affair dealer, and the only trader dropped 1.7 billion euros before they noticed something wrong in the bank.
Clearly, risk management in the investment office is not yet working.
"Adobolly's incident has clearly shown that risk control has not changed enough," says Martin Janssen, professor of economics and finance at the Swiss Institute for the Banking Case of the University of Zurich.
The financial director of one of the largest German banks is also unquestionable: “The UBS problem is that he does not have a risk control tool”.
It is precisely that long-term caution has been exercised by Swiss bankers by the world's largest assets - not too risky, but safe for money, whether or not the world is broken off outside the Alpine Republic.
Swiss banks have become a symbol of unbreakable reliability, as Lindt and Sprüngli symbolize the fine taste of chocolate.
The UBS headquarters in Zurich still conforms to the image of a worthy Swiss private bank, only a little more.
Its location is just a classic.
The main office of the bank is located in Zurich in Banhofstracs, which leads from the main station directly to the Zurich Lake, in the vicinity of the snowfalls of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are delicious, and the rental rates for shops are one of the highest in Europe.
Among the traditional Swiss shops like Confiserie Sprüngli, you can find such jewelry companies as Tiffany's.
Swiss banks have been available for hundreds of years - from the National Bank to the Court of Creddy Switzerland and elite private banks, such as Julius Beer.
The heavy door leads to UBS.
Along the wall of marble, there are large leather wonders, and a number of the bank's emblem is a large "safe" sign.
UBS knows what his clients need, security.
But the two largest Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, at some point, have rejected Swiss ideas about the banking case - or, as one of the small Swiss banks believes, they have been handed over.
He would not like to see his name in the newspaper - like all Swiss banks, he also cooperates with the two largest banks.
He believes that UBS has become too large - in particular, in investment banking, where very active Anglo-Saxons.
He thinks the Swiss have something to add here.
"And if there's anything, it means they've adapted to the Anglo-Saxon customs a long time ago."
Indeed, it was the Anglo-Saxon Investment Bank that changed UBS, brought him the first major gains, and then the fiasco, and no other financial institution in Europe lost as much money in the jungle as the largest Swiss bank.
The disaster became apparent on 15 October 2008.
"In the midst of this small country's coalition of seven million people, there has been a major rescue operation in the country's history," writes Lucas Hassig in his book Crah UBS.
Politicians approved the grant of 68 billion Swiss francs (about 45 billion euros) to save the bank from bankruptcy.
How could that happen?
If the Swiss banks ask, they will say that the problem is mainly UBS.
Two of the three largest Swiss banks joined a large group in June 1998.
A bank was established, which was already too large for small Switzerland at the time of the merger, and a bank that continued to grow.
This also helped the two banks that formed UBS to complement each other; one was rich, but a step-by-step bank specialized in asset management in Zurich; the other was not so rich, but much more internationalized.
International investment banks suddenly had access to a large amount of money that they could use to turn all-powerful wheels.
Two names relate to the growth of UBS: Peter Wolfley, Executive Director of the UBS Group from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, Chairman of the Board of Directors.
"I always thought that Wolfley and Ospel were a team of dreams," says bank analyst Hans Gaeger.
"Wulfley, an intellectual, a modest and deeply understanding model and statistics, and Ospel with his inner instinct, which went all the way up, starting with an intern in the bank."
But Ospel finally took refuge in Wolfley.
And Wolfley could have made a critical mistake. "He decided his models were a reality," said Geiger.
"It's tragic."
Maybe it's tragic.
Pride is ahead of defeat.
UBS officials well remember the meetings of government members at which Wolfley always repeated the same slogan - to seduce Goldman Sachs.
The American Bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
At the time, he headed the tournament table, where the success of the banks was achieved.
UBS wanted to get to the top of this table.
He was able to make a part of it.
UBS was the biggest player in the trade of currency and public securities.
The management consultants, however, indicated a weakness; according to this parameter, which in banking terminology is called "permanent income", UBS was far behind the largest banks.
UBS had failed in American mortgage products.
To close the door, UBS entered an adventure that hardly cost him his life.
With a view to growth, the bank itself and its hedge fund invested in US substandard securities.
This has been developed in a large mechanism that has pooled securities based on American mortgages and sold them further, continuing to bear the risks themselves.
Even when other banks have long sought a way out of this process, UBS has not stopped.
"UBS bought up until summer 2007, when the American real estate market was already in fire," says bank analyst Geiger.
The higher the rise, the deeper the fall.
One manager came to leave as the attempt to bring the bank in order appeared to be more difficult than it once seemed.
Posts in UBS have become a child-style game with chairs, and so far they remain hopeless.
Anyone who is taking the lead in this huge bank is almost impossible.
He must find a strategy for a bank that has returned back to all existing business models.
Gaeger's bank analyst already had the idea of abandoning an investment banking, focusing on asset management and forgetting its Swiss roots.
Bank, however, is not ready to go that far.
However, it is obvious that investment needs to be significantly affected.
A new bank leader, Sergio Hermotti, plans to present his future strategy on Tuesday.
The 51-year-old Swiss banker actually considered only a temporary solution when the bank unexpectedly separated with its predecessor Grubel.
In the past, he has been able to demonstrate his character and now, as the Zurich bank said on Tuesday, he is head of UBS on a permanent basis.
Ernoty plans to return the investment bank to the state in which it was in the mid-1990s.
It reduces 3500 jobs.
But that's not gonna be enough.
UBS needs a concept of development.
What's the UBS?
How does he plan to make money?
These questions are probably axel Weber himself.
He publicly said only that they and their wife are looking for a apartment in Zurich.
Next year.
Fears of recession in Europe under the US stock exchange
The escalating recession in Europe has worsened the mood of American investors in the beginning of the week.
The change of governments in Athens and Rome had little effect.
The decline in industrial production in the continent has undermined the hope that the debt crisis can be overcome in the future.
The general relief resulting from the change of Governments in Rome and Athens has not been supported.
The euro has fallen against the dollar.
Last week, the Italian and Greek glass was still half-full, not half-empty, but now the problems are back in the first place, said Mark Luskini of Janney Montgomery Scott.
Financial exchanges, in particular, were in the sales lists.
The industrial index of Dow Jones was closed at 12.078 with a drop of 0.6 per cent.
The market barometer in the course of trade ranged between 12,027 and 12,170 points.
A larger S&P 500 index was closed at 1251 points, falling by one per cent.

Eurostat's statistical service reported that in September companies accounted for less than two per cent than in the previous month.
"We're not on the island, we're dependent," said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
He also stated that Europe would hardly be able to quickly get a recession and that banks would demonstrate further signs of weakness.
In an interview with the CNBC, the legendary investor Warren Buffett was able to confirm these fears, and he said that it was still impossible if Europe was strong enough to do everything it had to do to end the crisis.
He therefore felt that it was too early to invest in European public bonds or in banks.
Instead, Buffett issued a ten-year-long principle in the trashy box and invested in the American high-tech industry.
His investment in IBM amounted to more than $10 billion in the sale price of the shares of this older company, almost one per cent against the trend.
The shares were closed, almost unchanged, at $187.35.
Buffett stated that he had paid an average of $170 for the share and now had a share of 5.5 per cent.

Bank of America's shares fell by 2.6 percent, much stronger than the market.
The Bank has converted almost all remaining parts of the China Building Bank into cash, with $6.6 billion.
The Bank is mainly planning to support its capital ratio with net sales profits to comply with stricter rules.
The aircraft manufacturer Boing won, reducing the losses on Dow-Jones.
The share price rose by 1.5 per cent after the corporation received the largest order in its history.

Concealed Gates Filling Cities
Toys are considered problematic birds in many places, and experts today say that these very smart birds will no longer be able to escape from the cities.
Some people like birds, others want to get rid of them as quickly as possible, and centuries of rock was a part of the urban landscape, but people who complain about the grass and noise are growing in many human settlements.
A solution to the problem of birds, however, has not yet been achieved.
At the first symposium on crows, experts in Lear, East Frisia, claimed that the player could no longer be expelled from the cities.
Specialists from all over Germany discussed possible solutions.
Search for alternatives in cities
Conservatives claimed that the root of the problem in cities was the migration of specially protected toys, indicating that the use of chemicals in agriculture has increasingly destroyed traditional habitat areas.
The growing construction and cutting of traditional trees made life difficult for birds.
The gates are protected.
There are large colonies of more than 600 parents in the city of Zest in Westfalia and in the north-west of the Yever, Dipholce, Ahima under Bremen and Lere.
The unparalleled project of shooting the crows in Lere caused unfavourable newspaper headlines in 2005.
Critics described the hunting of birds in their traps and their killings as a special cruelty.
"The normal movement and deployment don't give anything." said the architect and landscape designer Werner Cliver of Lere.
Congestion of water currents or the trees' shells often have undesirable effects, said the environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lara, Baden-Württemberg.
"Lives are scattered, and large colonies are divided and spread to other areas."
Disappointment may be only in the form of an exception to hospitals, elderly homes and schools.
"We have to live with them, and to get rid of them is no choice."
The problem will not be solved in the urban areas, says Mayor Lera Wolfgang Kelner.
A combination of the fear of birds from sheltering and encouraging them to return to other areas could be an exit.
“Information walls instead of benzopils” was a slogan proposed by psychologist and ethnologist Utou Maria Jurgens, who advocates a completely different approach to birds. “We must be confident to live with this problem.”
Jürgens was one of the founders of the educational enemy route in Asherberg in Schleswig-Golstein, where information stands on the lives of very clever players.
The project is already of interest to tourists.
Jürgens also expressed his opinion on the noise complaints made by birds, "The noise transmits a lot of information, and they have to tell each other a lot."
These birds' minds and smiles have come into the legends, and players often use not only tools to control their eyebrows, but also tools themselves.
Researchers at Cambridge University recently protested the measure of a bird’s mind on four players.
In one experiment, the birds quickly realized that they needed to knock on the raindrop to get a mole of prayer.
Without special training, they learned the size and shape of the stone needed to cut the rain.
In another experiment, similar players had to face a more complex challenge.
The researchers put a small weaver with a pencil in a vertical cylinder.
Birds couldn't get a cow.
But the researchers gave them a lot of provocatives.
All four birds took advantage of the propellant to make their wings and use their wings to seal the blade by the handle and pull it out of the cylinder.
Three of the four players have been able to do this since the first attempt.
Ronaldo concludes Portugal on Euro-2012
The hopes of the Bosnians and the Turks for victory in the last minute have not continued for long.
The favorites of Portugal, Croatia and the Czech Republic, plus Ireland, will participate in the 2012 European Championship.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland took the final seats at the Euro-2012 Championship in Poland and Ukraine.
Under the leadership of the superstar Kristian Ronald, who killed for 8 and 53 minutes, Portugal defeated Bosnia and Herzegovina with an account of 6:2 (2:1), ideally designed its fifth exit to the Euro after 0:0 at the first stage.
The chess was enough 1:0 (0:0) in the second round of the play-off against the outsider of Montenegro after a clear victory in the first round (2:0).
Croatia did not miss its chance, played 0:0 against Turkey, and Ireland was easy to get a 1:1 (1:0) against Estonia.
Nani (24 minutes), Nelder Poschiga (72nd and 82nd) and Miguel Velozu (80th) killed the remaining goals for Portugal.
The former Bundesligi professional game from Wolfsburg Zvezdan Misimovic and Captain Emir Spahic reduced the difference by two points due to a 41-minute effective penalty and a 65-minute goal for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic got a second yellow card at 54 minutes.
Portugal has already removed Bosnia from the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.
Portugal had a great start in Lisbon, Estadius da Lus.
Ronaldo took an early start, and a free strike at the door was about 30 metres [30 m] away.
Good four hours later, Nanny demonstrated her long-term abilities, with a 25-metre score increasing to 2:0.
The Bosnians, who did not open the account in the first half, had their first opportunity due to the attacking Edin Jack.
The former Wolfsburg game, led by English champion Manchester City, sent a ball to the lower end of the stand at 33 minutes, but the ball did not cross the line of the gate.
Iraq Kills for the Czech Republic
Then Judge Wolfgang Stark of Ergolding turned his attention to the centre.
Following the attack on Elder Poštig in the Bosnian police station at 36 minutes, Stark decided that the Portuguese game was simulated and showed him a yellow card.
Stark also sentenced suspicious prisoners for playing his hand after Fabian Quentran-Missimovic had carried it out.
After the 2004 European Vice-Champion was interrupted, the account was closed by four other goals.
Peter Iraček developed all remaining doubts about the 81th minute check.
The 1976 European Championships were sent to the European Championship on the fifth occasion.
The team of coach Michael Bilek and the legions of the Bundesligi Mikhael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Thomas Peckhart (FK Nürnberg) also smiled after a mistake at the very beginning that could become catastrophic.
Peter Chech's 9th-minute driver, due to the momentary reflection, prevented the potential autogol of Thomas Sivok.
The best chance in Montenegro was when the duet of Stephen Jovetic and Dejan Damyanovic were on the field.
Damyanovic was hit by a 40-minute strike at the end of the police station, and he just didn't hit Cheh's goal.
After the changa was interrupted, she saved the already-needed World Cup winner of the Czech World Cup after FK Seoul left the field at 50 minutes.
The winning goal was killed just before the final whistle.
At the time, Turkey did not enjoy football in Zagreb.
Four days after the game of 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks could not play better than destroying 0:0 in Zagreb.
While there is no doubt now that the coach of the Gus Hiddink assembly will now release the team's ski team to third place in 2002, the Croatians are the fourth time in the final tour of the European Championship.
Turks were almost ideally able to launch 31,000 spectators at Maximir’s stadium.
Seljuk Inana's remote strike was stopped at the seventh minute, and the attacking Kazim Kazim was unable to turn the ball on the net.
Croatia then woke up and gained more control over the game.
After the Croatian break, the game continued in great shape.
The Legionaries of the Bundesligi Daniel Pranic (Bavaria, Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Aintracht, Frankfurt) were on the field with Mario Manjukich from Wolfsburg, who took over Ivan Perishich from Dortmund at 62 minutes.
Trapattoni is going to Euro-2012.
The Irish in Dublin celebrated their first Euro trip after Germany in 1988.
Coach John Trapattoni's team, who had already looked confident in its place after the first stage 4:0, captured the leadership for 32 minutes thanks to Stephen Ward's naked.
Konstantin Vasilev from the guest team compared the account at 57 minutes.
Ireland took a good start, but only at the 23rd minute Robbie Kin from Los Angeles did the first clean lead hit.
At the last moment, the Estonian defender could not have allowed him to take Ireland forward.
The goal was killed in 32 minutes.
As Paul Londak’s golf course took place, Ward went to the right place and, leaving the ball through the line, changed his account at 1:0.

SAP plans to double the number of workers in China
The largest software manufacturer in Europe, SAP, plans to invest billions and almost double the number of workers in China in the next few years.
The company in Dax's list reported on Thursday that it is going to invest about two billion dollars by 2015 (about 1.5 billion euros).
"We will create more opportunities for research and development and for the work of thousands of people," said Bill McDermott, one of SAP executive directors, at a consumer exhibition in Beijing.

"Now we want to change the scale of our operations," said McDermott.
"Our goal is to achieve sustainable growth based on information in China."
Mass killings - human dimension
The exciting and very good new book by Peter Engunda "Krasota and Grief: The Personal History of World War I" begins with a long list of active people whose hearts die.
Here is the advice as to how to read: Carefully cut this page and use it as a bookmark.
You will meet these people very closely as Mr. England points out, and this list of active persons will be your GPS, your nickname at the moment when, like one of these men and women, you will get out of the way and disappear into the dark of war.
Mr. England is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He was also the new Permanent Secretary of the Swedish Academy, who awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature.
The book he wrote now is unusual, he describes it, quite precisely, as an anti-historic work.
It has few known names, important treaties or famous battles; there are almost no ambassadors, hunters or discussion of tactics and combat technology.
It's not so much a book about what it was, it explains how much "the book about what it looked like." It's about feelings, impressions, anxiety and state of mind.
The book "Krasota and Grief" has combined the experience of more or less unheard of men and women in the 20 years of war, from both sides of the front line, from school students and botanists to alpineists, doctors, ambulances and servants.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Someone falls into a trap, loses his hand or his leg, goes out with his mind or dies.
Their lives die here like church candles: new ones are added to many others, and some will be destroyed at that time.
Mr. Engunda's book is a departure from the historical book standard.
This is an amendment to the assumption that the First World War was only a serious war in the West Front.
"Breath and sorrow" is a gift to other theatres of military action: the Alps, the Balkans, the East Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
There are bees that fall to the soldiers; one of them encounters Christmas in Egypt under pyramids; the unresolved problem is flies.
It's an exciting book, almost from the beginning.
The war covers the lives of these people, like a natural disaster, like Hurricane Katrina, who is inhaling smokeless.
When you're a woman and you're at home with your children, you're gonna stay or you're gonna run away?
So, who's going to do this?
Almost no one understands what's going on and why we have to fight this war at all.
"The lack of facts," notes Mr. England, "is filled with suspicions, assumptions, hopes, fears, compelling ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and hearings."
"Breath and grief" marks the fate of people such as Florence Farmboro, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young sailor of the German fleet of the open sea.
Their stories were taken mainly from the memoirs, letters, and other material that had already been published.
The stories about their lives may be frightening or fascinating, but they are, to a large extent, alive because of the small moments and the fractional details gathered by Mr. Englon.
Many of them are about deprivation and how to deal with them.
Telling the story of a German schoolgirl, he says, "Erzaz, where is Erzaz."
"Foreign coffee, fake aluminum, non-precious resin, paper ties, wood sticks."
He continues to tell about the sand dunes in Germany.
It describes "the meat of the Pressurised Artichoke, mixed with wheat (and the minced meat of the falcon); tobacco made from dried roots and dried potatoes; the juice of which is covered with wood."
It notes that there were "837 registered meat substitutes allowed for the production of sausages, 511 registered coffee substitutes".
Some stories point to honor and courage.
An American observes his own burden of cruelty and says of war: "You feel that, at the end of the day, this is what men were created for, rather than sitting in comfortable chairs with cigarettes and whiskey, evening newspapers or bestsellers and claiming that this show is civilization and under your fine-grained skirts there is no barbarous hiding."
A British soldier, on the other hand, notices that he is likely to die and that no one will notice or be upset.
"When a person is calm with the thought of self - sacrifice, he would like to think that it will happen before the public," he writes.
But it's, on the other hand, awfully like "a convicted man who's hung up in secret."
Other comments concern an old Europe that is being demolished and new forms of fear.
"The conflict has become increasingly economical," writes Mr. England, "a military plant."
He notes the income of what he calls "a new species in the beginning of the world's pastry: a beautiful and ideologically convincing mass murderer in a well-dressed suit that lays a cut, sitting behind a written table".
People act in an unforeseeable way: low-ranking actions are as much as heroism.
Mr. Engund told about soldiers who were trying to bribe the prostitutes with venereal disease in order to avoid service on the front.
"The only gruesome expression of this can be seen in the trade of gonorrhea, which soldiers have bought and slaughtered themselves on genitals in the hope of becoming hospitalized," he writes.
"All the desperate people threw him in the eye, which often led to life's blindness."
Translated by Swedish Peter Gravez by Mr. Engunda, it is flexible but nebrotic, which is perfectly suitable for his humanistic task.
In dozens of small scenes, it shows how the war “released completely uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred”.
People are starting to wonder why their leaders are forcing them to fight.
The best books on World War I were often undirected, such as "Great War and Modern Memory" by Paul Fassela or such novels as "On the West Front Without Change" by Erica-Maria Remarca, not excruciating historical works.
Mr. Engunda's book is part of this untempered pantheon.
His book has the most amazing final I can remember in inhuman literature.
I'm not gonna tell him.
But it's like he's in the book to the page with a list of characters, he's pulled it out of your hands and burned it with a stick.
After the previous error - carefully calculated
Hundreds of police officers, some in protective helmets, were involved in the operation.
Nights from Monday to Tuesday were chosen because at Zukotti Park at that time there should be fewer people.
The operation was kept secret from all except a few high-ranking officers, the rest of whom said that they were on their way to school.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the center of events, and his presence emphasized the importance of the operations of the Department of Police.
There could be no repetition of such episodes over the past few weeks as the use of gas against protestors, which was contrary to the Department ' s rules and caused a hurricane of sympathy to the public.
So after two weeks of planning and training, a police operation to free the Zukotti Park protests began.
The authorities were prepared to observe the expansion of occupations in other cities.
The largest anti-crisis studies were conducted on Randels Island, calculated on Zukotti.
The authorities have increased the number of so-called riot training - counter-terrorist measures to speed up the movement of a large number of police officers - in the light of the Lower Manhattan.
The last training took place on Monday evening on the east-river Manhattan side.
The order to enter the park came in the "last minute", he told the source of the orders in which the order was referred only to as "training".
"The several diggers I know and the ones I've called for didn't say they're being sent to Zukotti Park," said the man who spoke on the terms of anonymity.
"The only people who knew they were going to Zukotti Park were at the top of the department."
One of the reasons for the secret was the lesson he learned from the city.
On 14 October, the authorities wanted to clean up the park, but they withdrew from hundreds of protestors who had slipped within the deadline, hearing about these plans.
On Tuesday, police officers from various police units, including the district forces, were involved in the operation, which were usually used to control the crime scene.
Mr. Kelly said that many people, almost at work, come and leave the park during the day, which makes 1 hour of the night the right time for arrival.
"It was right to do this when there were fewer people in the park," he said.
The life-saving machines with search engines and loudspeakers gathered at Pike-Slip and Franklin Roosevelt-Drive, around the Manhattan Bridge before moving forward.
The prosecutor and the previous written announcements made by the thunderstormers seem to have frightened many protestors.
When the officers of the administrative units entered the park in their blue winds, many protestors simply picked up their things and left.
The police reported that the camps had not moved up to 1:45 at night, giving the protest time to collect things.
Other groups of police, according to the testimony of the witnesses, were gathered on a perimeter to enter if the park needed arrests.
Journalists in the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Brown, the head of the Department of Police, said it was done for their safety.
But many journalists claim that they have not been allowed to see how the police are doing, and that the police have been rude to them.
Mr. Brown said that a car with cameras on Church Street, along the west border of the park, could take a picture.
When the police went west through the chest of personal protests, including bags, plastic bags and polyethylene bags, full clothes, the Health Department's teams followed, collecting what had been thrown away.
Some protestors who refused to leave and went outside soon appeared on the Internet.
The main group of protestors took up positions near the kitchen camp at the park center.
Some built barricades, and the police went inside, methodically arresting them.
About 10 people in the camp's epicenter were shaking their hands together.
And two people came to the trees, Mr. Kelly said.
In order to cut the locks, rescue officers were called up.
There were no arrests in the park until 3:30 a.m., Mr. Kelly said.
The cleaning operation was completed about 75 minutes later, the police reported.
Mr. Brown said about 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most were arrested for "a violation of public order and resistance to detention," he said.
Joseph J. Esposito, head of department and senior officer in the department, was the highest-ranking officer on the scene.
Phil T. Pulaski, head of the department's dry police, was there, too.
Mr. Kelly, although he was present, “he did not manage the operation”, said Mr. Brown.
The second group of police were waiting along the east side of Broadway, between Liberty Street and Sidar Street, if necessary.
The fences were placed in Cortland Street, in the neighborhood north of the park, and in Pine Street, in the neighborhood south.
Observers saw how the police extended the perimeter even further beyond the Zukotti Park.
At one point, observers saw a group of policemen, many with shields, excavating people further.
Some 28 people were on the north perimeter.
Some of the most serious events occurred south of the park.
About 5 a.m. to the south of Pine Street, one of the protestors pushed on the roof of the police car, while the others, according to observers, fired air from the rails of the police station.
At some point, the mob flew a piece of flag.
As a result, one police officer and one of the protestors were hospitalized.
Professional Association of School Service Officers to the City Court for Disengagement
The trade union, representing hundreds of school staff who lost their seats last month, plans to bring them to court in the middle of the city, claiming that dismissals were not necessary and discriminatory because of the disproportionate influence of schools where poor students are taught.
The trial is probably the last means available to the trade union of the District Council 37 trying to abolish dismissal.
Sixty-two school assistants, the coordinator of work with parents and other employees, who were among the lowest in the city, lost their seats on 7 October as a result of the trade union leaders ' political response to their refusal to give the city access to medical funds managed by working groups to close the gap in the budget last spring.
The city officials categorically rejected this charge.
At the hearings at the City Council last month, the school chancellor Dennis M. Walcott said that discharges were part of the budget they signed in June.
One member of the board stopped, told him that there was no indication in the budget that school support staff would be fired.
The representatives of the 37 District Council reported that they had made a statement of claims, warning the Department of Education that a complaint had been filed against it; a press conference would be held on Wednesday to announce a formal application to the Supreme Court of State in Manhattan.
Mr. Walcott and the Department of Urban Education will be referred to as respondents and eight temporary workers are listed as claimants, all of them black or Latin American women, as well as most of the assistants who have lost their seats.
Elizabeth Thomas, a representative of the legal department of the city, said that the city had not seen the demand and could therefore not comment on its specific provisions.
According to the preliminary version of the complaint in New York Times, the trade union focused on a number of dismissals in schools in the poor areas of the city to support the claim of unfair treatment, claiming that poor schools had lost more assistants because they were chronically under-funded.
He pointed out that while there was no dismissal in the Staten Island, while there were few in the schools of the Upper East Side or Tribeque, 17 school supporters lost their seats in the region 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 had to go to Districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.
Noting the loss of five out of eight school assistants working in free secondary school 36 in Harlem, where 68 per cent of the students live in poverty, the claim is: “These are not areas of stable parents who can find money to fill budget gaps”.
P.S. Budget 36 was cut by 3.26 per cent this year, and it also lost money when the city changed its way of calculating additional funding for every poor student attending school.
The trade union also claims that the school director could be misled by the language of the notification allowing the dismissal of coordinators for working with parents.
The notice used the word “survey”, although “survey” is more often used when a teacher from the school’s payroll is moved to the list of existing employees who are paid by the central office.
"Sixty-six coordinators for working with parents have been fired," says the blackout, "and not just translated."
Mission completed, Congress is ready for the agreement on Libya
It seems that the Republicans and Democrats at the Capitol Hill are finally ready to agree on something relevant to the rise in Libya.
All it took was for the fight to succeed, the former dictator Muamar Gaddafi was arrested and killed, and American intervention ended.
On Tuesday, the Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs should consider a resolution issued by President John Kerry (democratic, Massachusetts) along with Senators John McKayin (Republican, Arizona) and Joseph I. Liberman (independent, Connecticut), who praised the Libyans for their successful stand and American troops for their "revelation".
"The purpose of this resolution is to pay tribute to the brave people of Libya when they begin to rebuild their country," Kerry said.
"This is the confirmation of their democratic aspirations by both parties."
The language may be harmless, but no further discussion on Libya was easy.
This summer, the legislators from both parties argued with each other and with the White House on the formulation of a series of resolutions approving or condemning the role of the US army in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McKeein introduced a resolution allowing the limited use of the US armed forces in Libya.
The bill was rejected by the House of Representatives by a large majority of the two parties and did not vote in the Senate.
But on the same day that the bill failed in the House of Representatives, the House also did not support the proposal that would cut the financing of the US operation in Libya.
This left an American mission in some kind of legislative purity - when Congress is angry enough to criticise Obama's approach to the mission, but not so bad as to actually wipe the ground out of her feet.
Then, the indecisiveness of the Congress
In August Tripoli surrendered to the Libyan rebels, and Caddafi was killed on 20 October.
The NATO mission was officially completed on 31 October.
Now the Senate can be ready for action.
The resolution of the Committee on Foreign Affairs “respected of the people of Libya for its incredible courage and unconventional persistence in the pursuit of freedom” and thanked the men and women of the United States Armed Forces and their coalition partners who participated in the military operation to protect the Libyan people for their unusual courage and professionalism.”
The resolution also “confirms the national interest of the United States in the successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya”.
Will the new measures be fully supported by the Foreign Affairs Council, or will the legislators be dissolved as a June bill?
Against the latest version, Senator Richard G. Luger, leader of the Republican Committee.
The representative of Luger said on Monday that he had not yet seen the latest version of the bill.
On the other hand, the Capitol of the House of Representatives this week should vote for a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget, the main legislative priority for almost every Republicor and for some Democrats in Congress.
This measure proposed by a member of the House of Representatives, Bob Goodlat (Republic, Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment to the budget or to any other that will be put to the plenary vote of the Congress of this Assembly.
Other legislators have not yet been able to make their amendments to the plenary meeting, but not because they have not tried.
The amendment of Goodlat is only one of 68 constitutional amendments affecting a wide range of issues that have been raised in this call.
Some were duplicated - the same bill was passed to the House of Representatives and the Senate - and others were minor variations in each other.
There are at least 15 revisions to the balanced budget only in the House of Representatives and several more on “Federal Expenditure Control”.
Some of them are also identical, but they give their authors, mostly newly elected Republicans who want to dress up their abstracts, the opportunity to acknowledge that they have “extended” such a proposal.
The budget control act, which took place in August, required the House of Representatives and the Senate to vote on an amendment to the balanced budget.
In March 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such an amendment.
In addition to the budget, some congressmen wish to limit the number of terms of office of members of the Congress, while a member of the House of Representatives José Serrano (democratic, New York) wishes to cancel the two times limit for the President.
Congressman Jesse L. Jackson-young (democratic, Illinois) proposed a number of amendments that guarantee, inter alia, the right to quality education and health.
An amendment banning single marriages has been proposed for many years, as well as another banning the burning of the flag.
Some legislators would also like to permit the abolition of federal laws if two thirds of the States objected to them.
No matter how Members of the Congress have tried to propose amendments, they are moving no faster than in recent years.
In the 111th Congress, the legislators proposed 77 such amendments, and in the 110th they made 66.
This rate is measured as compared to the early 1990s when Congress members, according to the Senate Library, regularly proposed more than 150 amendments every two years.
But their success was no more than it is now.
The last amendment, which was adopted, was approved in 1992, but was actually introduced to Congress in 1789.
"Baptized, but not convinced," said Giffords in his first television interview after the attempt
Ten months after an armed man shot at her at a public event in Tuson, a member of the House of Representatives Gabriel Giffords (Democratic Party, Arizona) appeared on the federal channel on Monday evening, she sang a melody from the "Sunday Tomorrow" boat show and said that she wanted to recover more than to return to Congress.
With 20/20 E-bi-si News with Diane Sawyer, Giffords had been working hard to formulate proposals and needed assistance in the process.
The program showed her difficult way of recovering from the trauma of the bullet, which crushed the skull and broke the left side of the brain from the front to the back of her head.
Three months later, she unexpectedly returned to the House of Representatives and voted in triumph on the bill on the limitation.
In his first television interview after the January shooting, which killed six and injured 13 people, Giffords laughed, laughed and sang, and called his recovery "hard".
On the question of Sawyer, how she feels, 41-year-old Giffords said, "Very good."
The interview with Giffords and her husband, astronomer Mark Kelly, was part of the 20/20 special issue, which was shown in advance of the release of the new book by his wife, Gabby: History of Courage and Hope.
The special performance described the restoration of Giffords after the shooting on 8 January.
On a video taken by Kelly in the first few weeks, she's lying on a hospital bench with a sharp head and a long scarf on her forehead.
She can only raise one or two fingers at the request of her husband.
A few months later, we're seeing Giffords sitting in a wheelchair, and the physiotherapists are teaching her how to do simple things.
Swim your head.
Get your lips out.
And then her first word, "What."
In a few days' time, Giffords spoke the second word, "toss," asking for a change in the menu tomorrow.
The video shown by E-bi-si shows that music played a central role in the healing of Giffords: we see the congressman singing with the doctors "The girls just want to have fun" Cindy Loper and "Free Fall" Tom Petty.
In an interview with Sawyer Giffords, who spends two hours a day on procedures, she said she wouldn't remember the day of temptation.
Her husband told me that he was reading the Giffords article in the newspaper on 12 March when she stopped it to ask for the first time about the six who were killed at the time.
Suspected attacker Jerd Li Lafner is in Missuri's prison and is being subjected to forced treatment pending trial.
"Many people died," said Giffords Sawyer.
"Burst, heavy, heavy."
Once when she was healed, Kelly Sawyer said, "I'm sure."
"And I said, "Habby, you're not convinced," said Kelly.
You're just beat.
And you're going through it, you're going to get better and you're going back stronger than ever.
Soldiers feel more sadness than respect
The event was a festival at Wall Street, which gathered millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York.
Kid Rock played a ballad about helplessness, disappointment and loss.
Several hundred soldiers, sailors, pilots, and sailors were reportedly built around him.
The tuxedo cheered him up.
"The soldiers were seen as heroes," said David Zaltzman, who organized the spring collection of money.
The senior military officer at the concert, which was also then chaired by the Chief of Staff Committee, Admiral Mike Mallen, saw the role of the other troops.
"They were treated like orphans," wrote an officer in an electronic letter.
I'm sure the organizers wanted the best.
I know that.
But it was not really respect, it was pity.
The very opposite impressions illustrate the difficult relations between the army and the often egotistical, sometimes admired by the American public.
The troops are reaping praise for their sacrifices.
But the praise has their price, the soldiers say.
The public is increasingly acting in a way that seems to be a pity for people in form.
"We are not the victims," said Brigadier General Sean B. McFarland, who has commanded the troops in Iraq and is soon leaving Afghanistan.
"But it seems the only way for some to show support is to treat us as unhappy."
This is a sensitive theme for soldiers who do not want to look ungrateful or disagree with the society they serve.
They also realize that the anger of returning troops in the recent years of war in Viet Nam was much worse.
As a result, most of the complaints are silent and only between the war veterans.
After his two sons returned from military action in the seabed, Colonel Mark Kenshn warned them that people would not be seen in the army from two perspectives.
Some will look at them with admiration, because they used to hug the rivals and stay in exotic places.
Others will wonder if there is “a severe vet under the mask”, said Kenshn, who fought in Iraq and, returning, took a high government position in Washington.
While he was looking for work, he said he felt that some interviews had been carefully asked if he could withstand the pressure of responsible work in Washington immediately after the war.
Kenshn remembers telling his sons, "When you talk about your service, you should expect a negative effect."
The injustice experienced by the military is partly due to the American indifference to war.
Victory in the field of combat is rarely praised by a country that is a little familiar with the army and sees little direct benefits from the war in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"We, as a nation, no longer appreciate war heroism as usual in the Second World War," said Lieutenant General David Berneau, who was commanding US troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the admiration of politicians and the public focuses mainly on the depth of the military suffering.
The troops estimate the number of returns they have made, the number of friends they have lost, or the level of losses.
The army faces increasing pressure from supporters to fight rape
This week, in historical court hearings, it should be decided whether the claim of 28 men and women against the army on the charge of non-violence would be accepted.
If not, hundreds of claimants will face the following.
The first class of Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and 11 weeks pregnant, as she claimed, was raped by her attendant at night.
It was in October 2008, she returned to her barracks at Miramar airport, north of San Diego after dinner with another and met a male servant with a pack of 12 bottles of beer.
He asked if he could go to her room for a drink.
"It was a red flag," says Lyman.
But Tessa's bear has lifted her fears.
I thought, no, he's 19 years old.
"He's from Texas," she said.
"I'm sorry I didn't listen to my instincts then."
A few minutes after they entered the Lyman room, the man came behind her, fell down and raped, she claimed.
On this week, 18 November, Lyman and 27 other current and former soldiers will be eager to wait for the court's ruling at a historic hearing that will take place in Arlington, Virginia, and decide whether to proceed to the court's appeal that they filed against former Minister of Defence Robert Gates and his predecessor Donald Rasmfeld.
The claim claims that Gates and Ramsfeld were unable to cope with widespread violence in the army in violation of the constitutional rights of soldiers.
The claim filed in February by counsel Susan Berk of Washington, D.C., initially included 17 claimants, but grew to 28 in the following months, 25 women and three men, all claiming that they had been raped or threatened by employees and that the army had not properly investigated, prosecuted or rendered adequate justice after the alleged attacks.
Berke says she's focused on the top of the army, because the problem starts with them.
"The army is a vertical structure," she says.
"Who are the people who can destroy the cult of violence?
Berk also said that she had been contacted by about 400 other victims in February, many of whom could participate in future searches.
Its strategy: instead of collecting all the claimants in this case, to put all the eggs in one basket, so to speak, it will open up a lot of cases if it is necessary to support the pressure.
The defence team, led by Federal Prosecutor Neil McBrayda, has taken steps to stop the case.
The judicial documents received by Newsweek reveal a protection strategy, mainly in that former or current soldiers cannot claim the military for the damage suffered by the armed forces.
According to the doctrine of the Supreme Court ruling of 1950, the Federal Government is not responsible for the damage caused by military personnel.
"The alleged damage is the risk of the military service of the claimants," the documents state.
The Ministry of Defence refused to comment on this story.
The situation has changed since the 1950s.
Although women are still officially forbidden to participate in the war, this division exists only in words: modern wars rarely have a clear front line.
In Iraq and Afghanistan, female soldiers play an increasingly important role, especially in contact with local women in the fighting zone.
As a result, 150 women soldiers were killed between the two wars, two thirds of them in battle.
The army also has a time to be modern, says Berke.
She is not alone in her fight; in addition to her request, three others are ready.
In the Yel Law School, the Veterans Legal Service Seminar is preparing a case against four major military academys in charge of promoting the female atmosphere.
The separate non-commercial association of American veterans in Viet Nam is making a complaint against an army, where the diagnosis of “changes of personality” is being made to victims of violence to eliminate them, a common phenomenon, according to activists such as Anna Bhagati from the human rights group of the Organization of Action of Military Women.
Her group filed a complaint against the Veterans Office in December, accusing her of discriminating treatment of pensions by people who claimed to have been threatened by sexual violence during the service.
Nine separate draft laws proposing a number of measures were introduced to Congress by a group of senators and members of the House of Representatives from both parties.
In 2010, a total of 3,158 rape attempts were reported in the Department of Traffic Prevention and Combating Sexual Violence.
But it is known that the attacks are often not reported, and according to Pentagon's own estimates, this figure is approximately 13.5 per cent of the reported 19,000 cases that occurred that year.
This report, published in March, also examines the percentage of cases: in 2010, 20 per cent of cases reported have been brought to court, twice as much as in the civil justice system.
In Berk's case, they only call them first in a number of other traumas.
In the case of Lyman, she declared rape in the military police less than an hour after it happened.
That night, she said, she was asked to report details of rape to policemen, doctors and commanders 11 times.
She collected a set of evidence of rape, and the blood of the attacker was found on her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was sitting in front of a judge during which she was asked if she had had sex with her friend earlier on the day of the attack.
Six people gave a positive feature to the accused, who was finally justified.
"I remember the day when the verdict was read," Liman says.
"I thought I was a flower now - I escaped from the courtroom with a scream."
"They put me in a psychiatric ward, and when I left, I remember my commander saying, "It wasn't his judgment, it was my judgment."
Lyman was ordered to contact a military psychiatrist who finally diagnosed her with a change in personality, which made her unfit for service.
In January 2010, she was fired with an unfavourable wording that did not allow her to receive any benefits.
If the case is brought forward by Liman and her companions on the claim, it is a difficult question, says John Terley, professor of law at the University of Washington University.
But he says, "I think they're in a position to move forward."
Between them and the verdict there is a doctrine that has been criticised since it appeared.
I've been criticising Dr. Ferrez for my whole life.
The army has remained for decades because it has no incentives and restraints that impose responsibility.
He adds, "A lot of chances against them... but it's important for them to try."
These things will only be changed when ordinary people want to fight.
If the hearing is not for their own good, Berk, the complainant's lawyer, will collect hundreds of other claimants for future cases.
"We will continue to fight the army on this issue until reform is done," she said.
Or until we die, depending on what happens earlier.
The wall has eyes: How the researchers are studying you on Facebook
Before becoming a new face of legal extremism in Europe, Anders Bering Bravik was an ordinary man who expressed his anti-immigration views on the Internet.
On Monday, Bravik, who was aware of the mass murder in Norway in July, who had killed 77 people, came to his first open hearing.
Although Bravik could act alone, he was not far away on the network: he spent a lot of time preparing to attack his computer, in association with millions of nationalists who supported legal groups in social networks.
After the summer tragedy, researchers wanted to learn more about these people.
But how do you find them?
It's easy to go to Facebook.
"We realized that they would be better off," says Jamie Bartlett, the author of the recently published report on European Cyber-Populism of the British Research Centre DEMOS.
The storage of personal data in Facebook is so great, Bartlett says, that researchers could easily use a website advertising tool to provide the necessary demographic group with scientific accuracy - that they have been marketing for several years.
The Bartletta team found half a million right-wing fans throughout Europe and then put them on advertising, but instead of showing a new group or diet product, the advertisement offered the user an inquiry into their level of education, violence and optimism about their own future.
With the help of Facebook Bartlett and his colleagues, more than 10,000 participants in 14 extreme legal parties in 11 European countries were able to question, even without leaving the office.
"It's a completely new way to do research," says Bartlett.
Some of the results are not so devastating: online rights groups are most young men, inadequate immigration.
But suddenly, "those who combine their online activity with offline activity are smarter, more democratic and less aggressive than those who just walk behind the monitor."
The work of DEMOS is just one example of how Facebook becomes a new popular tool in the hands of scientists.
Research centres, medical researchers and politikologists use the site to study the world's health issues to the social trends expressed in Laikak, post office and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users, adding an average of three records a day, the “super-current information” of Facebook is a research boom, increasing the number of scientific articles called the website by 800 per cent over the past five years.
For some researchers, Facebook will be able to study people who cannot go on the street with the block.
"In the past, if you wanted to ask people from the British National Party, it would be very difficult to identify them."
"You would have to join the party, and they would never have accepted you," Bartlett said.
"The Facebook excludes all of this - you turn to them directly."
Others say that this site could identify and investigate social health issues.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues showed that students who had discussed their drinking habits in Facebook were much more at risk of alcoholism than students who had been silent about it.
Moreno suggests that students’ entrants, for example, their community teachers, could monitor the site and interfere to help a student who is too often renewing drunk status.
"You can't solve the problem without identifying it," said Washington Post Dimitri Christakis, co-author Moreno and Director of the Centre for Child Health, Conduct and Development at the Children's Research and Research Institute of Seattle.
"We found a way to identify children from a risk group that would otherwise not be found."
Facebook also constantly extracts data about its users.
The data processing team processed the statistics on the relationship and day of Valentine's Day, the appearance of voters in the mid-2010 period, and the National Happiness Index (mostly using the information available only to them, cyber-freedom champions have long insisted that the site should make its extensive collection of data available to the public for research).
But Facebook users know that the site is watching them, they like it or do not - in exchange for the possibility of playing in Scrabble with another in thousands of miles of you, the site can process your personal data.
But what if Facebook users become participants in research that they don't even know about?
While researchers have strict standards for offline research, online data are widely available.
"I don't think many users have thought that the researcher could observe their profiles," says Neil Selvin, a sociologist from the London Knowledge Laboratory, about the study he conducted in 2006 using the public pages of students in Facebook.
"As far as they were concerned, it was only between them and their friends."
Then there is a question of methodology.
Even offline, there is no guarantee that the object of the study is extremely honest.
It is not possible to find out the number of information in the profile and user page.
"What you're saying on Facebook and what you're doing outside Facebook is two absolutely different things," said Selvin.
That is why, despite the years of his work in the field of technological research, Selvin believes that the note and the handle are still the best research tools from those that can be used.
"Nothing can replace the entry into real peace and communication with real people," he said.
"It is assumed that social research is about social, and most of the social is still taking place offline."
Cold and inhuman: Anders Bering Bravik will be brought before the court for the first time
Anders Bering Bravik, a man who was aware of a double attack that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, described himself as a fighter of "responsibility" during the first public appearance in Oslo.
"I am the military commander of the Norwegian resistance movement and Richard Tampleer of Norway," he appeared before 500 in the courtroom.
"I object to the court because you have received your mandate from organizations that support the ideology of hatred and that it supports multiculturalism."
"I admit my actions, but I don't admit my guilt."
Judge Torquell Nesheim interrupted Bravik during this monologue, because he "did not want to give Bravik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform for expressing his own views."
For the same reason, he refused to allow Bravik, who brought with him the previous written statement, to contact the relatives of the victim at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered the police to keep Bravik in custody for another 12 weeks, banned him from accessing the media for four weeks, and said the authorities would take strict control of all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and relatives of the victims visited the audience.
Some were hoping to see Bravik in the eye, others were convinced that he was under the lock.
Everyone came to find answers to their questions.
"I thought he looked cold and inhuman," told the Norwegian NRK channel one of the survivors in Utah.
"It was uncomfortable, but it made it a little easier for me to see and hear the suspect."
Dressed in a dark suit and blue coat, Bravik maintained calm and professionalism throughout his entire hearing and looked at journalists and survivors when he entered and went out of the building.
Despite Bravik's strange idea that he was part of a major resistance movement, the judge decided that he was not fooled, and said that there was no evidence that he was working with the partners.
Some may be relieved by the fact that the attacks of 22 July are said to be the work of one extremist rather than a group of radicals.
But this does not automatically reduce the pain and confusion that the whole nation now feels.
"I'd like him to look like a monster, but it's not like that," said one victim's relative.
"It would be much easier if it were."
7 lessons from Steve Jobs' Lost Interview, shown in the theater this week
After Steve Jobs died on 5 October, some compared him to Henry Ford, describing technical genius as the Great Designer of Modernity.
But what Apple fans can count as the biggest opening in a recent interview, which they recalled in advance of the preliminary demonstrations in the main markets this week, is how much this creative mind had in business processes and production technologies.
He was, of course, a designer, a dreamer, and considered himself hippie, but he was also a sufficient organizer and a modernist of the production process, who believed that many business leaders were suffering from “the disease to think that a really big idea was 90 per cent of work... [but] a large idea from a large product separates a huge amount of experienced work”.
Back in 1995, Bob Kringley created the Triumph Nerves teleserieal about the appearance of a personal computer, and he spent more time with Jobs for a unique long conversation.
By then it had been about 10 years since Jobs had been expelled from Apple, and he had already been working in his new NeXT computer company for a long time on the Internet.
Then, as a small part of Kringley's interview was used in the Nerds, he said that the original interview was missing during transportation.
Only after Job's death was a full VHS copy found in the director's garage.
This draft, a little edited, became the basis for the 68-minute film Steve Jobs: A Lost Interview that goes to Landmark Theatres on Wednesday and Thursday.
For a man known for his hatred for a detailed interview, Jobs seems reluctant to present his technological philosophy and business strategy here.
And incredibly intelligent.
At four different times during the interview, there are large intervals between questions and answers - thinking in 10-15 seconds, where Jobs clearly weighs his thoughts to say more precisely.
There are also moments where perfectionism of Jobs goes out on the surface, where he seems to be angry with the issues of Cringle that make him more important.
In the retreat to the era of Picsar, iPods and iPhones, there is something more prophetic when Jobs assesses what he sees different companies do wrong and wrong, and offers his own vision of future information technologies.
One thing to read about Job's post-mortem evaluations, but there's something that's early and inspiring at Job's, which we see here, a alarming dreamer at the threshold of greatness.
He has a vision of what things could and should be.
Soon after he said everything here, he went and did it.
A small summary of seven significant findings of the Lost Interview:
About how he learned to run a business:
"I've been in business all the time, and I've been asking, "Why do you do this?" And the answers you're always getting, "Oh, that's just how it is."
No one knows why they do what they do, no one thinks about business very deeply.
That's what I found out.
Jobs continues to describe his attempts to rationalize reporting in Apple.
The cost-sharing system, often based on “standard” costs, which were taken from the sink and then driven by “implementation”, created an automated structure that ensured that they were able to track business costs in the past.
About the break over the Pope:
Jobs is telling details about the blue box, which he had bottled with Steve Voznjak, a device that enabled people to effectively break the phone company and call for long distances free of charge.
The device was written a lot earlier, but Jobs' affair here, describing the blue box as an act of handing over to the authorities is contagious.
He tells how he and Voznak tested the box using a phone machine, ordering a conversation and then joining one AT&T network to the other until they connected as many stations as possible.
"We've covered the Earth's layer for half an hour, and you've been shouting in a phone machine, and it's just a minute later in a nearby phone machine," said Jobs with a smile.
"We were young, and all we've taken is that we could imagine something that could control billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world."
We two knew a little bit, but we could imagine a little thing that could control a lot of things -- that was an incredible lesson, and I don't think it could ever happen to Apple without that.
Jobs continued to describe in detail one of the famous outputs he and Voznak had made in practice, calling the Vatican through the blue box at midnight and asking for the Pope's phone, since all the forces were trying to copy Henry Kissinger.
When several members of the Catholic hierarchy were called up at night to talk to an American diplomat, the two burst out with laughter just before the Pope himself was picked up to answer the phone.
About the love of technology (and the cold calling of Bill Hewlett):
When he was 12 years old, looking for spare details to collect a frequency meter, he found Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called him.
Soon after their 20-minute phone call, Jobs received a summer subcontract in Heulette Packard.
"It had a strong impact on me, it was the only company I saw at that age, and it formed my view that such a company and how well they are with their employees."
Jobs later became one of the HP personnel who visited research labs in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desktop computer".
He was the size of a champ, he had a little monitor with an electronic tube, and I fell in love with him.
I used to drive in the HP, and I turned around and wrote a program for her.
About improvised innovation:
In a number of places, Jobs is talking about the invention of new products for the summer.
When he went out to sell a piece of furniture, a buyer asked him to collect a whole computer.
Working 30 days in credit, he had to think about both the collection and the delivery of ready-made devices.
Later in Apple, he remembers the difficulties he faced by developing a computer mouse:
"I remember the fierce disputes... they shouted at me that it would take five years [to collect the mouse that would cost $300], and I was sitting on my throat, and I came out and I found the designer."
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could collect for $15, which was incredibly reliable.
Large energy-loss companies:
Long before he led Apple's rebirth, Jobs had just predicted that many leaders had become confused about the situation and had lost control of their market share.
"Let's say you're working at IBM or Xerox, so you're doing the best copy or printer, and what?"
You have a monopoly on the market, so the company doesn't get any more successful.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, thus [these types of people] who eventually come to the company's management, and people who make products are driven out of decision-making areas.
The genius of a product that has led to this monopolistic position is exacerbated by people who have no idea of the difference between good and bad products - the skill required.
That's what happened to Xerox...
Xerox could capture the entire information technology industry.
It could be ten times more, it could be a Microsoft 90x...
They've been defeated.
About innovation as an art form:
"A great idea from a large product separates a huge amount of expertise ... when you break a big idea, it changes and grows."
You'll know a lot about her densities.
There are compromises you need to go to - some things you can't make you do electronics, glass, robots or factories.
You need to keep 5,000 ideas in your head, these concepts, joining them all together...
In the end, everything comes down to taste -- everything comes down to trying to express itself in the best that people have ever done, and then to try to get it into what you're doing.
Picasso said good artists are copying, great artists are stealing.
We've always had a lot of fun with big ideas.
Part of what he did to famous Macintosh was that the people who worked on him were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians who became the best information technology specialists in the world.
If not for information technology, they would do amazing things in other areas.
Sculia and Thomas lunch with opponents of the Health Act while the court is considering the case
On the day that the Supreme Court met behind closed doors to discuss the political issue, whether it would hear the resignation of President Obama's health law, his two judges, Antonina Sculia and Clarence Thomas, were celebrating the lunch-sponsored legal firm that would challenge the case before the Supreme Court.
This case occurred last Thursday when all nine judges met to discuss the petition.
One item on the agenda was an application supported by 26 states contesting the urgent health review adopted by the Congress last year, which brought together conservative activists from all over the nation.
The judges agreed to consider the process; in fact, the reverse debate is expected at 5 1/2 hours in March 2012, and the outcome will most likely be a mix in the presidential race, which will be in the widest range by the time the judicial decision is announced.
A lawyer who will stand before the court and claim that the health law must be abolished, most likely, will be Paul Clement, who was Deputy Attorney-General at the time of President George V. Bush.
Clementa's legal firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of almost two thousand companies that helped to sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, a long-standing group that consistently advocated conservative legal principles.
Another company that sponsored lunch represents one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pflizer Inc, who had a huge financial interest in weight.
Lunch was held at Washington's hotel a few hours after the court meeting on the case.
He was present, among others, Mitch McConnell, a leader of the Republicans in the Senate and a well-known opponent of the Health Act.
The starters of lunch, Scalia and Thomas.
Nothing new: two judges have been visiting the Federalist Society for many years.
And that doesn't go against ethical standards at all.
In fact, judges are free from the Code of Conduct, which regulates the conduct of lower federal judges.
If they were obedient, they might fall under the 4C Code principle, which reads: “The judge may visit the charitable activities of legal and other organizations, although the judge cannot be a rapporteur, a guest or a reference in the programme of such activities”.
However, the clear proximity of Sculia and Thomas to two legal firms in this case, as well as to a company with high financial interests, was a sufficient signal for ethics activists in the Government.
“It is a shocking violation of ethics and the difference between the code and some judges’ statements that the court remains faithful to the same rules that apply to all other federal judges,” said Bob Edgar, President of the General Court.
"The courts have been drinking and eating at the official action to raise money with lawyers whose cases are now being dealt with in court."
Their presence and assistance in the collection of money for this event undermines all statements of impartiality and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas are hardly paying attention to critics who say they are very willing to mix court cases with groups of the kind of federalist community.
And Thomas' wife, Ginny, is a well-known conservative activist.
Furthermore, conservatives claim that this is an ethical issue for Judge Elena Kagan, not for Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was the main legal service in the Obama administration when the first legal objections to the law were filed at the level of the court of the first instance.
Her critics demanded that Kagan refuse to listen to the case because she was too involved in protecting the law in order to be impartial now.
Kagan didn't show that she was going to do that.
Boeing receives a record 18 billion-dollar flight order
The Emirates air carrier orders 50 broad-fledged lines of Boeing 777 and may order another 20.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner Oman Air, the size of the deal is over $1 billion.
It's hardly news that the company's getting orders for 50 units of its product.
But this is an important event when this company is a Boeing Co. aircraft manufacturer, and the pre-currency price for all these 50 aircraft is $18 billion.
It's so important where Boeing got the order: The Middle East, growing gold lives future orders on aircraft.
The Czech company estimates that the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft worth 450 billion in the next 20 years.
Boeing announced in these exits its largest in the dollar equivalent order for commercial aircraft - 50 Boeing 777 two-pass aircraft.
An amazing order was received from the Emirates airline in Dubai.
The airline also has the opportunity to buy another 20 aircraft, which will raise the total pre-currency price to $26 billion, Boeing said at the Dubai Airport in 2011.
Later on Monday, Boeing reported, Oman Air ordered six Boeing 787-8s, called Dreamliner, which can enjoy significantly better fuel savings and passenger comfort.
The average price for six aircraft is over $1 billion.
"It's really good for Boeing," said Morningstar Neil Diora analyst.
"The quality of these specific buyers is quite high."
Many Middle East airlines own oil-producing countries.
Accordingly, they have not only the money to pay for the aircraft but also the increase in fuel prices, which usually harm airlines, since it is one of the largest items of expenditure, is not so much a waste because the country earns money at high oil prices.
That's important, because they're less likely than other airlines to cancel the flight order when prices grow, Diora said.
"They have natural protection," he said.
The Emirates command reinforces Boeing's leadership on the market of large-fledged aircraft and helps prevent the Airbus SAS opponent's attempts to reach his lordship with its A350 aircraft.
Boeing's victory on the plane took place four months later after Airbus stated that it would delay the largest A350 debut, which was only once from 777-300ER.
He postponed his bid to increase the axle load after the buyers needed to increase the load capacity and the distance of the flight.
Boeing Co's shares grew by 1.5% to $67.94.
Mexico's President's sister obviously lost her election in Michoakane
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that the drug traffickers helped the opposition Fausto Valeho from the IRP in the pre-election race.
The sister of President Felipe Calderon seems to have failed to implement her application to the place of Governor Michoakan during the severe public elections, and she said on Monday that drug traffickers helped to remove the race for one of her opponents.
According to preliminary results, the leader in the race for the position of the governor of the Western state is Fausto Valeho from the Institutional-Revolution Party, or IRP.
"Intervention of organized crime throughout the electoral process and especially yesterday is alarming not only for the Mikhoakana but also for the whole country," said Luis Maria Calderon in a radio interview for the next day after the resurrection vote.
"They scared our candidates, our election workers... they got the polls, they put obstacles... and they made people vote" for the IRP.
IRP managed Mexico for seven decades until it lost its presidency in 2000.
It prepares a return, and victory in Michoakana is an important step in this attempt.
IRP hopes to win the presidential elections in July.
Valeho seems to have only a little bit of a charmed Calderon, who led the ratings to the day of the election.
Kalderon, a candidate for the National Action Party, or the PND led by her brother, refused to recognize Valeho as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, a left-wing candidate for the Democratic Revolution Party, or the DRP, which now belongs to the Governing Board, has suffered a third, serious defeat for the divided and unsuccessful left in front of the 2012 presidential elections.
Aureoles also refused to recognize the preliminary results.
Valeho, the former mayor of the capital of Morelia, refused to contact drug dealers and urged other candidates to recognize the results.
In Michoakane, drug cartels specialized in marijuana, heroin, and methamphetamines have been held for a long time.
It was the home state of President Calderon, and he chose Michoakan to launch a military operation against drug traffickers in December 2006.
Violence is still continuing.
Mary of the PND was killed a week before the election when she was indicting Louisa Maria Calderon, and several candidates left the local pre-election race for fear.
For the IRP, however, as terrible as the elections in Michoakana are, victory will be the driving impulse of the party.
The man who was supposed to represent the IPR in the presidential race, Enrique Pena Nieto, speaking from Washington, congratulated Valeho and said, "I think this victory should be very exciting in the foreword of next year."
ABR Convinced Asia to Help Save the Eurozone
The Asian Development Bank forced India and China to be ready to help save the eurozone from the European debt crisis to avoid a long-term decline that would stop the growth of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, director of the ABR Office in Manila, said that the two fastest-growing economies should "do all they can" to accelerate the recovery of the currency block by either the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He warned that the BRIC countries were looking at the difficulties of Europe "unbiased", and said that Asian financial assistance on the side of European leadership and resources could help avoid a long-term decline in the global economy.
"We're all involved."
"Therefore, anyone who can help Europe to get out of the crisis is useful," he reported in an interview at the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia can be protected to some extent, but she can't be vulnerable."
"So if China and India can help, it has to be done."
The European Monetary Union has been severely undermined by the European debt crisis in recent months.
In the last few days, the Italian funds have grown threatening, and the prime ministers, both Italy and Greece, have resigned.
The emerging debt crisis in Europe gave rise to fears that it could bring the world economy back to recession and led the leading developing economies to meet together to help the euro area find a solution.
Mr. Neg predicted that any Asian assistance would be implemented through IMF, but said that bilateral cooperation -- such as the purchase of the EU financial assistance fund bonds, funds to ensure financial stability in Europe -- would provide enormous power in the negotiations with Asian partners in Europe.
Anand Sharma, Minister of Trade of India, said that "India will do everything it can" to help the eurozone, as its own economy is now experiencing a reduction in exports and a reduction in foreign capital flows.
"No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and restless," he said.
"We have great challenges, and we must maintain a high level of growth."
"It's not a possible option, it's a mandatory condition, because where we find work for tens of millions of our boys and girls."
Others claim that for developing economies like India, there is no point in helping rich Europeans when they face their own deep economic problems.
Ashutos Varshni, professor at the University of Brown in the United States, said it would be very difficult from a political point of view to provide assistance to Europe for 1.2 billion Indians, some 800 million of whom live for $2 a day or less.
"At some point, they'll know that the Greeks are going to retirement for 50 years and they're going to go to parties to the sea, and that's not going to be understood well," he said.
Li Howell, Director of the World Economic Forum, was also asked why India ' s reserves should be used to include Greek numerous and well-paid public sector workers in poorly organized, loss-making enterprises, such as railways.
Mr. Nag said that the eurozone crisis was threatening the "significant direct consequences" throughout Asia.
The ABR forecast for the 7.5 per cent growth of the economy in Asia in 2011/12 has now faced “degradable risks” due to threats from Europe.
He said that vulnerable developing markets needed to develop "an emergency plan" to protect themselves from the fall and significant capital flows from their economies.
Pentagon ' s warning of potential reductions in defence costs
The Minister of Defence, Leon Panettet, called for the conference on Monday, warning that the anticipated automatic budget cuts would undermine national security and call for a financial response from the Pentagon corridors to the fighting fields in Afghanistan on the line and to the civilian assembly.
The Pentagon has already fallen by $450 billion in the coming decade, but it is now afraid that additional reductions of 600 billion or more may be inevitable if the Congress is unable to reach a cost agreement.
"The consequences of these reductions will be devastating to the Ministry," Panettet told Senators John McCain, Arizona, and the Republic of Lindsey Greham, South Carolina, in a letter to the Senators.
He said that the inability of the Congress to accept a budget agreement and resulting from the so-called drought led to a general reduction of 23 per cent and the termination of many new projects.
"It will make most of our projects on shipbuilding and construction impossible -- you can't buy three-fourths of a ship or building -- and will seriously damage other attempts to modernize," Panette wrote to senators.
"We will also have to fire many of our staff and, as a reduction will be made so quickly, we will probably have to fire the staff to achieve our goals."
"These changes will undermine the trust of those who support our army and cause serious war damage."
The cuts will eventually affect the military," Panette said.
"The desire for military funding in foreign emergency operations has not been directly affected by the sequestration, and military achievements have been seriously affected by the major budget collapse," Panettet warned.
“Contract staff will be reduced to the end of the cancelled contracts and the supervisory treaty that the troops support.”
“The staffing will be reduced, resulting in delays in payments to military suppliers, and legal and political support will be violated.”
Two senators wrote to the Panel 10 days ago, requesting details of the possible consequences of automatic reductions in the Ministry of Defence.
"As a result of the fall in the Ministry of Defence, the United States will become the world's leading military power."
"We are persistently opposed to these dragon acts," the senators reported in a joint statement on Monday evening when they announced a letter to the Panel.
"This is not the way we can live with, and this is not the way we should commit ourselves."
"Sekvester is a threat to the national security of the United States, and this cannot be done."
Whether the letter of the Panel or the recent warnings of senators to the budgetary compromise or to strengthen calls for the release of the Pentagon from reductions will be seen later.
The Panel was absolutely sincere about possible reductions, although it had come to work on the Pentagon's leadership after many years of conducting budgetary expertise in Congress and the White House, and was aware that it faced a difficult choice.
At the press conference last week, the Minister of Defence drew a picture of what could continue to follow -- a band with a shell but no kernels.
"This ship has no sailors."
"This team has no bullets."
"It's the wing of a plane without enough trained pilots."
"This is a tiger, an army with barracks, buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers to carry out the mission," Panette said in her opening remarks in the Pentagon.
"This is a force that suffers from the insatiable spirit of war, ill will and unable to fight against potential enemies."
"In fact, it encourages aggression."
In the annex to its letters to McCain and Greham Panette, the new details of how “reductions produce significant operational risks: slowing the response to crises, conflicts and disasters; seriously limiting our ability to be the first in deployment and in response to the world; and leading to unacceptable risks in future combat operations”.
And Panette said that some of the largest defence projects could face obstacles, including those that had already passed the tests, and some only at the early stages of planning.
This list includes a single hit-off F35, planned for a new bomber, a ballistic submarine of a new generation, a new warship of the coastal zone and a new ground-based vehicle required by the Army and the Marine Corps to replace the lobster.
The further development and testing of F35 can save $80 billion in 10 years, but its supporters say it is a vital step to improve and resist potential threats to China and other opponents.
How to get a lie
The runaway view of the last headlines shows how serious and widespread lies and lies are in everyday life.
The candidate for the presidents of the Republics of Herman Kane is in dispute with the allegations of sexual harassment by several women; each party accuses the other in a lie.
The Administration of Pennsylvania University has been charged with false testimony, as they have probably hidden that the retired football coach raped boys.
Last week, French President Nikola Sarkozy was caught when he told U.S. President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu was a liar.
The lie destroys careers and destroys countries.
The Congressman of New York and Internet Exhibitor Anthony Weiner turned out to be a fool, denying his departures, which was quickly challenged by irrefutable evidence.
The former candidate in President John Edwards was charged with financial harassment during a campaign to cover external ties.
And again, none of those living at that time will ever forget the media circus with President Bill Clinton, who lied about his sexual relationship with Monica Levinski during his second post.
The story of fraud in school exams and colleges is a normal matter.
There have been instances when the teacher responded to the tests in order to evaluate the results of his or her activities.
Teachers who must learn the opposite send a message that lies and fraud are acceptable.
What number of lies do we face?
During one day, as research shows, you can lie from 10 to 200 times.
It is now assumed that much of this is a lie to salvation.
Another study showed that strangers lied three times in the first 10 minutes of each other’s acquaintance.
The identification of a lie or the distinction in a lie is necessary for every skill for both personal and professional purposes.
Unlike the room game, like, let's say, the charades, where we need to call "Damn!", the discovery of a lie is a serious science-based knowledge that has been collected in the last six decades at prestigious universities engaged in comprehensive research projects, especially psychology and physiology.
One result of the study is that most of the old myths of the lie have been disbanded.
Lies are looking in the eye.
They don't always stop, they're stuck, they're red or they're sweating.
It is not worth concluding that the liars find it difficult to spot and unveil.
The experienced teller of the lie can reach the truth by observing the structure of the allegations, the myth, the structure of the issues and the temporary characteristics.
I have spent several years studying scientific discoveries in a wide and constantly growing segment of the knowledge of lies, and it is clear that finding a lie is a modern skill that is easy to learn and that helps to guide our difficult world -- especially if your professional responsibilities include recruiting, interviewing, negotiating or managing.
Good liars are superior to others, making them feel helpless, managing their own emotions, and intuitively, how others view them.
We know from the study that extraterrestrials are more often than introverts, that men are more liars about themselves, while women are about others, usually to protect someone's feelings, that married people are less involved with their partners than non-women (but the lie they say is more often inflexible).
We also know that if you are perceived as a liar, others will feel less guilty of lying to you.
What do you mean, they're lying?
First, observe the normal behavior of your object.
It's called "the baseline."
This helps to ensure a starting point for further assessment of changes.
Watch for the position, smile, and voice characteristics of your object.
You'd better know if a person knocks on his feet in a normal state, then you don't make unfair accusations when you see a kick in the middle of a meeting.
Then look for a group of misleading verbal and nonverbal actions.
Treat these groups as red flags, not as evidence of deception.
Forgers can record the top part of their body when they try to remember their history, they can put their steps towards the door, turn to the exit, change their belts in a certain way, or demonstrate "relief after the interview" -- this excessive breath of relief and change of the belt when all the difficult questions are behind.
The investigators often falsify the closing of the interrogation to just look at this relief after the interview.
So, focus on your object.
It is known that Scott Peterson has fallen back and used his past time, claiming that his murdered wife is alive, which has led to her being searched all over the country.
Pricing people can also use distance in saying, "I didn't have sexual relations with this woman... Ms. Levinski" or repeat the difficult question completely.
The most typical verbal indicators are barely catchable.
Someone can use the "qualification language" when he answers the difficult question, "Well... I'm telling the truth... how much I know... how much I know."
This responds more emotionally than actually, and is often a red flag.
There is no magical means to identify a lie, but it is possible to master the art of inventing a lie.
These skills will increase the chances for everyone not to be a victim of professional and personal experience.
The dispute plan for the construction of the pipeline needs to be reviewed after the US threat to postpone its approval
A few days later, after Obama's administration threatened to postpone the approval of the planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico -- by causing the wrath of the trade unions, but by calming the environmental defenders -- the oil pipeline company claims that it would be willing to revise the project to resume its work.
TransCanada announced on Monday evening that it would remove the planned oil pipeline from the environmentally sensitive sand dunes in Nebraska and that the project would still be approved.
The company sounded this decision at a press conference in Nebraska State Capital.
The official representative of Trans Canada, Alex Purbass, said that the company remained confident that it would eventually be granted oil pipeline approval, although with another route.
This follows the statement of the State Department last week that it will postpone a federal-level decision until it explores new possible routes that do not affect the Nebraska and Ogalala sand dunes area, a huge underground water supply.
"This is a real step forward," said Fox News Congressman Li Terry, a Republican of Nebraska.
The new environmental expertise commissioned by the State Department will probably refuse to take a decision before 2013, after the elections next year, although the authorities denied that the decision involved policy.
Both in a written statement last week called for a decision by the State Department and expressed support for it.
The oil pipeline shall be 1,700 miles from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
He has to transfer 700,000 barrels a day from the province of Alberta to oil-fired factories in Texas.
To accomplish this, he needs to cross six states.
It is hated by environmental defenders, but it is loved by trade unions that rely on some 20,000 oil pipeline-related jobs.
However, Nebraska lawmakers, who object to the plan, are considering a bill to speed up the movement from the Pescan Holm area and the Ogalala Aquifer, the main source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current study of the State Department of Environmental Impact showed that the project would only have a limited negative impact on the environment, but a source of energy in the industry stated that the Department ' s audit had commissioned a separate examination process based on two issues.
One is a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was a adviser to Hillary Clinton in 2008, conflict of interest to the programme.
Another was the choice of a company that was hired to conduct an initial study that was inappropriate as it was related to TransCanada.
Patty LaBell was brought to court for she probably caused the child a lot of fear.
The New York family claims that Patty LaBell's disco-wives began fighting in the lobby of their home in Manhattan, scaring their little daughter to the extent that she was afraid of it.
"Lady Marmalade's tirade scared 18-month-old Geneva Monk so much that she carried on "a change of personality, sleep disorder" and "a strong fear of strangers," says her family in the Supreme Court of Manhattan.
This happened on 10 November last year, when Kevin Monk, his wife, the teacher of the children, Rosanna, and Geneva were about to leave for a family trip.
While Kevin Monk was hunting a car, Rosanna Monk went down to the lobby of the building on the Riverside bubble with their luggage, carrying Geneva.
Rosanna Monk said she stopped by the door and let her daughter down for a half a minute.
"Someone came back to me and said, "Do you know what your daughter is doing?" I said "yes" and went to pick her up," she said.
LaBell cordito made a statement by a pregnant woman.
"She aggressively said, "You shouldn't have left your daughter at the door," said Rosanna Monk.
"I told her, "I don't care what you say or think."
She got angry and began to use abuses -- the word "C" and the word "F" -- on the high tone...
She had a bottle of water, and she started to pour water from a bottle on me.
She said that she had a girlfriend in Geneva.
"I told this woman, "Look what you did to my daughter," said the mother of the child.
LaBell went to the mother -- who still held Geneva -- and her companion had to hold her and get her into the waiting car, Rozann Monk said.
The little girl cried so much that she was touched, she added.
Later, the family sent a note to LaBell requesting an apology, but she didn't get the answer.
Lawyers and representatives of LaBell are not responsible for the calls for comments.
The amount of compensation for the damage is not reported, but family lawyer Sam Davis said that he had taken the case for free and that the family was planning to sacrifice any money that would be provided to children with cancer.
"The goal is to make Patty LaBell take responsibility for his actions," said Davis.
"This behaviour is totally unacceptable, especially with regard to a child now with an 18-month-old child on his hands."
Climate problems slowed the economy
During the first year of Mario Lopez's reign in Sinaloa, unemployment and the illegal labour market increased, foreign financing decreased, and the economy was weakened.
The year 2011 will come into the economic history of Sinaloa as the first year of the Government of Mario Lopez Valdes, also called the year of change, which gave rise to great hopes for the development of the economy, but in view of the adverse climate conditions of the beginning of the year, there has been no growth, but a decline in key economic development indicators has been recorded.
Low temperatures in February have not only led to the loss of millions of agricultural sectors, but have limited the growth potential of the public economy by reducing overall economic activity by 3.6 per cent in the first half of the year, mainly due to the historical decline of 31.16 per cent in agriculture, which has affected the dynamics of other sectors of the economy.
According to the report, 835,582 hectares were affected by the areas affected by the frost provided by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, of which 78.03 per cent were wholly affected and the remaining 21.07 per cent were partially affected.
The decline in economic activity led to a steady increase in unemployment in the state by November, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, in the first three quarters of the country, an accelerated increase in unemployment was recorded from January to March 55,053 of the population of Sinaloa, by 4.53 per cent of the population in the second quarter, and by September it continued to rise to 6.19 per cent, which was estimated to be more than 74,000 people in the population of Sinaloa, which was 18.969 per cent higher than the first half.
Liquidity reduction
The unemployment in Sinaloa during the year has been covered by many factors, for economist Gerard Lopes Servantes, Director of the Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences of the Autonomous University (UAS), and the increase in unemployment can be explained indirectly by the actions taken in public policy.
"What we see now is an increase in unemployment, which is linked to several factors, including the loss of liquidity on the market, in order to limit the resources imposed by the law, which was adopted at the Congress to combat money-laundering, because people who illegally own the dollar simply work with them, invest and use them in something," he said.
Immigration
Lopes Servantes said there is still a demographic factor in unemployment growth.
"The number of people who leave the state in search of work abroad has been limited in the United States, primarily due to the difficulties of entry, and in the second, because once they have gone, they are already facing very many difficulties in finding work, so the group of people remains and requires jobs here in the state as a result of increasing unemployment," he said.
Violations of formal requirements
The analysis of the labour market of Sinaloa has become worse if a large number of violations that prevail under the labour conditions, according to INEGI, 60.38 per cent of the state's active population are working without being mentioned as workers in a social protection institution.
In addition to unemployment and abuses in training, another reminder of work in the state is presented by low wages; in the state the lowest wages in the country, according to the records of the Mexican Institute for Social Security and the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare.
The average monthly income of the Sinaloa workers was 5,352 pesos by September, much lower than the country's average, of 7,375 pesos.
Reduction of FDI
In addition to the decline in economic activity and the high unemployment rate in 2011, the highest rate of foreign direct investment has been recorded over the past 10 years, according to the Ministry of Finance, between January and July, the state had a total of $630,697. This shows a decline of 87.74 per cent compared to $5,143,312 over the same period last year.
For its part, the Ministry of Economic Development of the State has recorded only 17.280,000 pesos of investment during the year, which have mainly come to services companies.
Long
In the light of the economic downturn, the Government requested, at the State Congress in July, a loan of 3 billion pesos that would be used to invest in infrastructure projects in 18 municipalities to revive the economy, a total of 2,600 million pesos were approved at the local level, and no benefits were expected in any sector of the state economy until November.
Reactions
For business representatives, the first year of the Government of Mario Lopez Valdez demonstrated a lack of opportunity for the Government.
Miguel Loredo Lopez, President of the National Chamber of Industry, said that during 2011 there was no agreement on the wishes of the various sectors, including the Government alone.
"The efficiency of the economy in Sinaloa this year was indeed low, it has to be a lot of work to restore the positions lost this year, in 2012 we have to double our efforts, we have not been able to agree on all efforts and, above all, the good and synchronized work of a new government team, we hope that the next year will be much better," he said.
Economic slowdown
Lopez Loredo said that events such as early freezes had stopped the state economy this year and its efficiency and growth were limited.
"The low levels of the economy are the result of several events, including frost, one of the main effects was a slow economy, which does not become fast enough to create an economic dynamic that allows for an acceptable level of processes, goods and services, and therefore we close it down at the end of the year," he said.
Revision of direction
Theodoro Salazar Uriarte, President of the Federation of Employers of the Republic of Mexico in Sinaloa, said that the state should continue its most dynamic productive activity.
"In general, we have found that we have been working on this, we believe that a long-term programme that will redefine the direction and economic course of the state must mobilize all the material and human resources that Sinaloa has," he said.
Forthcoming work
President Coparmex stressed the importance of defining the future direction to better direct the efforts of the Government.
"In general, I would say that the Government is trying to be successful in various areas, but there is little progress in terms of economic development, but it is important to develop a long-term programme," he said.
He noted that the current administration had demonstrated progress in its own public policy approach.
"There are facts that allow us to say that the Government is beginning to get involved in work, and that I can say that some work has been done, and I think the Government is aware that much more is needed," he said.
He's sentenced to 20 pounds [8 kg] of marijuana
Five years of imprisonment and a 100-day income penalty, such a sentence was issued to the citizen of Navolato for the storage of eight kilograms of marijuana.
The Public Prosecutor ' s Office reported that the convicted drug dealer, Omar Alexis Valensuel Sandoval, was convicted of a health crime, in this case the storage of marijuana for distribution.
According to the AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/MI case, Valensuel Sandoul was arrested by the Mexican military on 7 June 2010 during the patrolling of the Kypriano Valdes Street, ahead of post No. 80 in the city of El Castillo, Navolato.
A drug dealer was behind a white car, a pickup truck, carrying a black bag in a box in the car, and on a passenger seat, a small backpack, where soldiers found eight kilograms and 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, the detention was transferred to the Second District Court, and the accused continued to remain in the Centre for the Legal Impact of Crime.
Contributions to work
Public work related to programmes such as the Family, the Saving of Public Spaces and 3x1 for migrants is at risk of being incomplete or long delayed due to the lack of funds, Miguel Angel Lopez Miranda said.
The Director of Municipal Social Development pointed out that, although the work programmes have so far developed, they are in danger, since the Government is unable to make appropriate contributions, which amount to over 11 million pesos for all three programmes.
He noted that the total funding of all three programmes was about 50 million pesos, of which 25 per cent had to be made by the state, and up to now only the Federation and the Municipality had provided resources for work, so it was still possible to delay their completion.
"They have to invest almost 12 million, and even though the year is over, they have not given us any cups when they had to give us a share from the beginning of July," he said, "to avoid delay, we have started work and they've moved very forward, but we need money."
He mentioned that last year, during the reign of Jesús Agilara Padili, the state did not make the contributions it had to make, so at the beginning of the reign of the municipality, it had to make money to cover more than 7 million, which had not been provided by the State administration in that case.
"This happened to us in the previous administration, because the state had no financial opportunities to participate, and the programmes continued to develop, and this year, in order to gain access to these programmes, we need to find resources to cover what remains of the state," he explained.
While the State authorities had an obligation to provide these resources, he said that the request had been made on behalf of the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villareal, to increase its efforts so that the percentages relating to them could come as soon as possible.
"They've got to make almost 12 million, and even if the year is over, they didn't give us any digging."
The Court will approve a "digital television transition" in Mexico in 2015
The replacement of analog signals for numbers is one of the most important changes that have reached the world in recent years.
The Supreme Court (VC) rejected the constitutional claims made by the Senate and by the House of Representatives against the presidential decree, which conveys the so-called “transition on digital television” from 2021 to 2015, as there were no eight votes required for its cancellation.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silvu Mess, believed that President Felipe Calderon had not exceeded his mandate by issuing a decree with a detailed description of action for the transition to digital terrestrial television.
As a result, the constitutional claims made by the Senate were rejected because of the lack of a qualified majority of eight votes necessary for the court to speak on the constitutionality or non-constitutional nature of the decree, and it remained in force.
The draft statement, prepared by Minister Olgoy Sanchez Cordero, proposed that the decree be declared unconstitutional, because the regulation of the radio and television programme is a law enshrined in the law of the Federal Commission for Telecommunications (Cofetel) in violation of the principles of hierarchical subordination and the legislative reserve.
Only Salvidar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sanches Cordero voted for the project.
Under this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies held two constitutional debates to challenge the decree and support complaints, Minister Sanches Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all the actions referred to in it regarding the transition to the digital broadcast.
The ministerial meeting also decided to reject the request of the Chamber of Deputies, without entering into the discussion of the draft, also under the responsibility of Minister Sanches Cordero.
In his speech, the Prime Minister said that he did not agree with the project's arguments in that the federal executive authority could not define the general rules of the measures to be prepared by the State administration.
"I also do not believe that if this happened, it would affect the autonomy of the governing body," and reminded that planning public policy in strategic areas, such as the telecommunications sector, is relevant to the federal executive authority with a constitutional mandate, government.
The replacement of analog signals to numbers - one of the most important changes that have taken place in recent years - has led to better use of the radio-electric spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
The postponement of the transition, he said, would mean the deferral of benefits from conversion to digital form, which includes meeting public needs, which not only has a technical dimension, “as it covers economic, social, political and national security”.
These issues, he said, “needs the work of the whole system, established by the principle of public economic governance, to include a group of authorities that the Constitution brings together into the State executive authority.”
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world had already completed the digital broadcast and had done so through the executive authority, despite the availability of remote technical facilities.
From that point of view, it cannot be concluded that the Government, by adopting the decree under discussion, which in any case affects the competence of the Congress, ensures administrative compliance with the laws adopted by the Legislative Assembly, he said.
In Michoakane, they analyze the possibility of counting the vote.
According to the data transmitted to the PRTR, the difference between the first and second seats in the governorate elections is only 27 per cent, even without counting the votes of 879 of the total number of protocols in 6.074.
The possibility of counting the vote is real, as regards the electoral process in Michoakana this year, where, according to data obtained from the Preliminary Electoral Results Programme (PRI), the difference between the first and second seats in the governorial elections is only 27 per cent, even without the counting of the votes of 879 of the total number of protocols 6.074.
In the light of this, the President of the Board of Directors of the Miquelon Elections Institute (IOM), Maria de Los Angeles Linderal Saragos, recalled that a few days ago, on 9 November, the electoral corps adopted a package of principles to harmonize local rules with the federal electoral reform.
It should be recalled that Michoacán did not adopt the Constitution or the Electoral Code of the State or the Electoral Law Act, since the Congress of the State approved the reforms shortly before the legal period for their entry into force in this electoral process and the Governor, Leoniel Godoj Grangel, did not include his publication within the time limits set out in the Law in the State's Official Journal, stating that he had some objections.
On the same day, on 9 November, the Supreme Court of Justice (CIJ) decided on a constitutional claim issued by the local legislative assembly and called the “ineffective and illegal” vote of the representative of the State on constitutional reform, since he does not have the right to “resolve or support them”.
In an interview with the possibility of "voting" Maria de los Ángeles Linderal, the General Council of the IWC has stated that the adoption of the appropriate principles will enable a partial or full counting of votes by the local electoral authority.
Thus, a partial recalculation of one or more electives may be made on the condition that: the results of the protocols do not match; there is no minutes of vote and count of documents in the minutes or it is not in the Chair; or when there are obvious errors or corrections in the minutes.
In addition, the overall re-calculation of votes in all ballots may take place when there is a sign that the difference between the alleged candidate winner of the election is less or equal to one per cent, provided that at the beginning of the session there is a request from the party representative and/or the coalition, which presented the second of those candidates.
A total recalculation of votes will also be made if, at the end of the ordinary count, it is found that the difference between the winner and the candidate who took the second place is less or equal to one per cent, provided that there is a request from the political party that the candidate took the second place, in the event of the deletion of the ballots that have been taken into account in the partial recalculation.
It should be noted that in this situation there were elections in Morelia, where, according to the PRS, the difference between the first and the second was only 0.16 per cent, even without considering 129 votes in the total number of minutes of 923.
His Last Will
His dust will be scattered in the mountains of Sapalinam, the family affirms.
The rest of Felipe Basio Cortez's pilot arrived in Saltillo, his home town on Sunday evening; on Monday, a visit and a quiet meal were held.
According to the family, the Colonel's last wish was to unravel his dust in the mountains of Sapalinam.
After condolences with other people who died in a disaster, the Basio Cortess family returned to Koauila capital on board the Mexican Air Force aircraft, and the closest people visited the ceremony at Campo Marta.
In the afternoon, the Colonel arrived at the time of the storm at Nazario Ortis Garcia, where the family and friends arrived.
At 5:30 p.m., he attended the Santillo Institute of Technology, organized by his former high school and football team associates, who had been a member of Felipe Basio during high school education.
"His wish was to return to Saltillo, and to have his dust spread in the mountains of Sapalinam, he always said it to his family and friends," said Sandra Cortes Basio, the pilot's sister.
In her view, the Colonel has fulfilled all his dreams, she believes that he was in the rush of his life, "He was a successful man, an incredible father, a son and a loving brother who was devoted to his family."
Felipe Cortez Basio left the city of Saltillo very young to go to the Airport College in Sapopan, Halisko.
Some did not believe him, they said that he had a head in the truck, but he always wanted to fulfill his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Davil Basio will remember him as a very good man, "as soon as he came to Saltillo the whole family wanted to greet him as he brought Marta Saagun to Saltillo."
He remembers that even when he was seven years old, he went to Sapopan for his family's graduation ceremony, so he knows that his grandfather died, doing what he loved most in life: managing the plane.
It's being conducted in the last way.
Shots from the weapons were set up in honor of Lieutenant Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Cortes Basio, led by Governor Jorge Torres Lopes, people from the village and government of the state, the Mexican Army, the Sixth Military Zone, the Mexican Air Force themselves, the leaders and students of the Central Technology School in Saltillo, where he was taught in 1985 and was successful in training and in sports.
Basio Cortez died recently when the helicopter he managed was subjected to violations, together with the Secretary of the Government of the province, José Francisco Blake Moroy, and six others, all representatives of the Ministry.
At 18:05, the remnants of Basio Cortez, the resident of Saltillo, arrived to be handed over to the funeral office of members of the Mexican Air Force to the head of Major James Martínez, at the training school, where he was already waiting for his family, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Christina, her mother, brothers and other relatives, disciples and teachers.
Three bodies were found on the L.L.C. farm.
In a few hours prior to the discovery, the military authorities showed 11 persons in the media who had been detained in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crime.
Three men were found shot dead in different parts of the body with a controlled shot at the abandoned farm in the municipality of Kadereit Hymenez, Nuevo Leon.
The discovery was found at a distance of 1.5 km from the Cadreit Road to Santiago, at the height of the commune known as El Castillo.
Several passersby noticed that the door was open in the village house, the wall of which was decorated in a refugee and brown.
When they looked inside, literally three feet [3 m], they found the bodies of three men, and they immediately let the authorities know.
One of the men was dressed in a yellow football with black jeans, without shoes, and next to him was another man in the white mother.
Almost one metre was the body of another man, in a red robe and blue jeans.
All three were lying face down.
According to evidence collected there, three men were killed elsewhere, as there was no gils in the place.
There are signs of one organized criminal group of another in the village house, as well as several holes in the gates.
11 understood in the Coderate
The Ministry of National Security introduced 11 persons, including minors, who were part of the criminal group, which was mainly in the municipality of the Cadereit, and who were accused of kidnappings, murders, fraud and secret funerals.
According to the information published, eight persons were detained in the Los Alvero colony on 11 November, and one person in the hostages was saved.
They were provided with three homes and a telephone, requiring them to become members of a criminal group called Los Zetas.
Another event took place on 12 November at 06:00 a.m., the military personnel were patrolling the village of Old Rancho in Kadereite when he saw the car without a number of signs with two men in the salon.
When they were stopped and inspected, the soldiers found a rifle, a patrol, and 18 patrols.
Later, on 13 November, at 14:00 a.m., one of their allies was arrested on the public land of La Prada, who, having seen the military, tried to flee.
He is accused of secret funerals in the municipalities of Hernal Teran, Heina and Kadereit.
The new Italian Government will be formed on Wednesday.
The appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monty, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to present a new Government that will face the crisis that put that country at the edge of the economic disaster.
The appointed Italian Prime Minister, Mario Monty, will meet with the President of Italy on Wednesday to present a new Government that faces a crisis that puts Italy at the brink of an economic disaster and damages the whole of the eurozone.
A statement from the Presidential Court stated that Monty, appointed on Sunday, would meet with President George Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm that he could form the Government.
It is expected that it will present an office composed mainly of technocrats, although it is unlikely that the new executive authority will take up its position.
Monty said he would present to the President the results of his negotiations with political parties in his attempt to form a Government.
"I want to reaffirm my full confidence in the ability of our country to leave this difficult period," said the former European Commissioner to the reporters.
Monty did not directly say that he was able to form a Government, but a tone of his comments showed that the obstacles had been overcome.
"The structure is now well-defined," he said.
Monty completed the process of forming a government less than three days, which was much less common, as Italy was struggling with a political and financial crisis that had raised their debt to a critical level.
The administration under the leadership of former European Commissioner Monty should approve the package of the severe economy required by European leaders to return to Italy.
On the basis of the pressure on Monty to speed up, unstable markets have established incomes from Italy's BTP bonds for 10 years at a rate of 7 per cent, at which Greece and Ireland had to be saved.
Emma Marchegalia, head of the Italian Federation of Employers, told reporters after meeting with Monty, "We said we would actively support this Government."
We believe that it is the Government's last chance to get out of this critical situation.
Monty's chances of success were largely based on support from the LDP's Silvio Berlusconi party, which had been forced to retire on Saturday because of the crisis.
"We believe that Professor Monty's efforts must lead to a good outcome," said the reporter Angelino Alfano, Secretary of the right-wing party.
The support of the LDP, the largest party in Italy, is important because so far many of its members have opposed the Government's majority of technocrats formed by Monty.
Parliamentary support
The new Government of Monty must have strong parliamentary support for reforms that are likely to result in unpopular reforms of a harsh economy.
Any blocking or stopping of these attempts may lead to a new and destructive attack on financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks has increased the pressure to warn that Monty's failure can be a disaster.
Monty began his consultations with political parties, unions and business groups on Monday, as well as with youth and women ' s organizations.
He's gonna finish the chain of his meetings Tuesday night.
Monty was appointed in the Sunday of Napolitano, which allowed a very rapid transition to the crisis.
After a brief transition at the end of last week, when it became clear that Berlin would retire, Italy's debt value has now reached a critical level in the face of uncertainty whether the new Prime Minister would be successful.
Italy's public debt savings of 1.8 billion euros would be too much for modern eurozone financial defenders.
Monty said that his Government would exist before the next elections for 2013, despite widespread forecasts that policies would only give him time to reform before appointing new elections.
Monty said he would like to include politicians in his office, but the main parties insisted that he should be made up only of technical experts, demonstrating their dissatisfaction with the financial situation affecting the process.
Political sources have reported that mutual mistrust and disagreement of parties make it difficult to include political figures.
Spanish toy experience more than Ticos
Of the 22 players reported in Spain, ten have already played 50 international matches.
By Costa Rica, only one of the 22 alleged players played 50 matches.
A minor contrast with Costa Rica, if compared to 22 games caused by both countries to a match today at 3:05 a.m. at the San José National Stadium.
As in the world and Europe champions, the number one in the FIFA monthly ranking, there is a whole list of Class A weapons games, Tricolor has only the defender Michael Humana as the only one who played 50 international games.
This figure was achieved last Friday in the game against Panama (0-2), at the Rommel Fernandez stadium.
Spanish football players playing all the stars in the League and in the strong British Premier League clubs were very active during this year in the League and in the local Cuban competitions, and they are high-level players in the European Cups and the League of Champions.
To this end, the experience of the Spanish Führer in a complex qualification in the Euro or the World Championship should be added.
The Tikos players, however, have limited international experience in the area such as CONCAFF, which is considered the lowest level in FIFA.
We see that he is taking the lead in the list in the Spanish collective golfer Iker Kasilias, who, last Sunday against England (a 0-1 match played in London) repeated the record of former golfer Andoni Subisarreta, with 126 international matches.
Casilias is playing against Tricolor today and will set a new record in 127 international matches for Spain.
In Hawaii, Ernandes, Barcelona's game, 106 matches.
Cassillas and Hawaii were recognized as the best in the last week of the UEFA together with the other player of the Iberian team, Subisarreta, with 126 match and bomber Shalk Raul Gonzalez with 102.
Almost close to 100 Charles Powell with 97 games.
Havi Alonso followed them from 91, Fernando Torres, from 90, David Villa and Sergio Ramos, from 81, Andres Inesta, from 62, Sesk Fabregas, from 61 and David Silva, from 53.
On the side of Costa Rica, close to Michael Humana, left-hand Hunior Dias with 48 match and bomber Brian Ruis, from 45.
In addition, only five of them survived the border in 30 games: Kaylor Navas from 31, Randall Asfaif from 32, Mikhael Barrantes from 31, Carlos Ernandes from 36 and José Luis Lopes from 35.
Let's go.
More than 30 matches in Spain in Gera Pike (37), Sergio Bussets (36), Santiago Santi Cassorla (32), Alvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raul Albiola (31).
In a collection of less than 30 exits, there are Roy Miller with 26 matchmates, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Murray with 23.
The rest didn't even reach 20.
Then, like Nacho Moreal's only four games, and Hordi Alba's two games, in Costa Rica, Victor Bolivar's only one, Olman Vargas and Nelson Edder have not yet debuted.
The leading Spanish game David Willia with 50 goals followed by Fernando Torres from 27.
For Costa Rica, Brian Ruis became the one who brought more points twice as many as Carlos Ernandes and three times as many as Roy Murray and Parks.
Quintet enrolled the country in the tour in honor of a 20-year career
A trip to Costa Rica is a dream.
In an exclusive interview with Viva bassist Jeff Ament from Pearl Jam, the group is ready to give one of the best concerts at the next Sunday at the National Stadium.
It was more than 20 years of expectation, but the group said it was also a reality dream for them to play in that country.
This was a statement by the bassist and founder, Jeff Ament, who gave an exclusive interview with Viva from Brazil last week.
The group is in the South American territory in the course of the tour for the twenty-year period of work and on Sunday, 20 numbers will make its only stop in Central America.
On that day, they will perform at the National Stadium, starting at 7:30 p.m., along with a team from Los Angeles The X and the local group of Las Robertas.
It's a piece of conversation that's fully decrypted online in The Nation.
For your Costa Rica fans, it's a crazy dream that Pearl Jam is playing in Costa Rica?
A trip to Costa Rica is a dream come true for us too.
It's just our second visit to South and Central America, and it's all going well.
I was in Costa Rica only once -- on vacation, it's a beautiful country, and I think we can stay there for a few days.
That's why we're so happy to bring our music there.
I'm asking because there's some kind of loyalty to the group; fans live in tension days before the concert.
What would you say to your most devoted fans?
Thank you for being with us all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica, thank you for waiting so long, and we're sorry we've had so much time to get here.
Some people, waiting for your concert, belong to him as the biggest show of the year.
Does that add some tension to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we've played over the past 21 years have been held in the last two weeks.
We've had some great shows in São Paulo, and we hope this has brought us into the form of this concert in Costa Rica.
Actually, we really want to play here.
We love this country, we love to deal with the serfings and the jungle, as far as these two things are concerned, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you find out about Costa Rica and her surfing waves?
We've got a lot of friends, and I have a good friend who lives in Tamarindo, and the waves here are amazing.
My friends always go to the Serfing in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, as well as in Mexico, it's a great place for the Serfing, as we've learned from people who love the Serfing.
Looking at the tour, you can say you did a great show with a lot of songs.
What did you plan to do in Costa Rica?
Since we've never played there before, we have no limit to what we can do.
We're trying to make the best show of the most diverse songs possible; we're trying to play a few songs from each album and present to our fans a great variety of repertoires.
You never repeat a repertoire.
How's it going?
I think that's partly because we have nine plates and we can play more than 120 songs, and everyone likes different songs, so it's hard to choose which songs to play every night.
When we have two or three songs that we haven't played for a while, it keeps us in the tone and surprises us because it reminds us of the reasons why we loved these songs and what we could forget.
That makes the show more interesting to us, and that's why I think it makes it more interesting to people.
That's what you've been doing for 20 years.
Looking back, it's hard to believe everything you've done?
Yes, of course.
First of all, I think none of us could ever imagine that we're in a rock band and that we've been doing this for more than 20 years makes it like a dream.
We are happy with our successes and we are very excited that we can continue to create music together.
We all love each other and love to create music.
We're happy to go to places in the world where we always wanted to go.
We're all very good at it.
What does it mean for you to be a major part of the branch?
It has always been an honor to be part of this group of large communities.
We're good friends with guys from Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
Healthy when movement grows out of a group of friends, and that's unusual.
From time to time, a group from one city appears, but much more strange when five or ten groups appear simultaneously in one city.
We are proud and honored to be part of a group from Seattle.
I still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden during their tour, so we were happy to be friends with them all, and we were honored to be part of the sound of Seattle that came.
It is also very strange that the group of your kind stays together in the same composition for so long.
Yes, four of us were together for 21 years, and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which in itself is much longer than many groups.
First of all, I think we're lucky we're still alive, and second of all, we'll take care of others.
We are all very close friends, and thanks to this, we have also opened up the musical pathways that give everyone the freedom of the experiment.
We trust each other's music, and everything could not be better.
Your attitude toward the word of glory was not easy, but thanks to your success you were able to do everything you wanted.
How do you balance it?
When we grew up, it became easier to find a balance.
We'll take care not to be too long in the tour, because it's easy to get into this game of big crowds and people who love your music.
As long as you remember that people here for music, it reminds you that you have to respect music and what you did, not to be famous and to be rock star, which none of us really care about.
What do you remember your other project, Manother Love Bone?
I think we're writing really good songs, and at first it was great.
We have been a group for almost three years and have not released any albums until Andy's death.
It was a lot of disappointment because it took so long, and the most important thing that we still have close friends with Bruce (Ferveser) and Greg (Gilmore), who started with us in the group, and when I hear a song or see a photograph, I think of the incredible person who was Andy, and how he made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to go to work, laugh, talk about music and football and a lot of others.
He was an amazing man, and we miss him.
The local group of Las Robertas will be responsible for opening a show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you're familiar with her work, especially Eddie Wedder, and that's why you chose her to open?
Yes, the producers sent us a few videos, and it was a group that we liked most, so we don't hesitate to see that Las Robertas could be useful, and that must be very exciting.
Why do you keep changing the words at Yellow Ledbetter at the concerts?
That's Eddy Wedder's question, so I don't know.
He's biting her, and I think he's using the first thing he's got in his head.
Who influenced you like a bassist?
They're so many.
Among the first to come to mind, Gizer Butler, John Entwiss, Si Jay Ramon, John Dow, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukovski...
They're so many that I can talk all day about the bassists I love.
How did Pearl Jam succeed in maintaining the border's relevance, despite the fact that he's no longer in fashion?
I think we're all feeling some deviation from the words of the branch.
When I think of him, he reminds me of groups that I mentioned earlier, such as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all that appeared at the same time, and if it's important now, I think it's wonderful, because it's the music that's worth listening to, and the Mudhoney teams now create music better than ever.
At first, your music was darker, and now it has become more positive.
How would you explain this change?
That's interesting, because, I think, there are a few songs in the album that might seem easier, but there are songs like The End or Just Breathe that are considered very dark, even though they may sound a little positive.
From the time Ed played them, I cried when I heard them, these songs were very dark.
I think when you grow up, and there was some trauma in your life, and you lost a family member or another, these events are beginning to affect your creativity and your music, and these two songs, of course, reflect this for me.
So, I think you can be a happy person and still be able to create dark music.
Peru:
Fuhimori was again hospitalized for medical examination
The former president, Alberto Fuhimori, was hospitalized on Tuesday in a public hospital, to investigate the loss of the muscle in the leg, informed his family doctor.
Fuhimori, 72 years old, who was sentenced to 25 years in prison for human rights violations committed during his reign (1990-2000), suffers from several diseases, including language cancer, which led him to surgery four times and was under surveillance.
Congressman Alejandro Agigna, who is his personal physician, told TV channel N that Fuhimori would be examined in three days at the National Institute of Non-Plastic Diseases to determine the cause of pain and loss of force in its lower limbs.
Agina said that he believed that Fuhimori should be a candidate for the benefit of an apology from humanitarian considerations; however, he said that he did not want it because he knew that he was innocent.
He carried four operations into the cancer of the tongue, lost a total of 18 kilograms, added other diseases, such as strong erosive gastrointestinal gastritis, iron oxides, stones in the hips, high blood pressure and blood pressure problems in the legs, and listed the doctor.
Fuhimori has been in prison since September 2007, in the National Police Office of Special Operations.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the murder of 25 persons by the forces of the destruction of the army, which operated secretly in the first years of his reign.
Muhika is sent to Mexico to strengthen political ties
The official delegation, headed by the President of Uruguay, José Muhika, and composed of several ministers and businessmen, will arrive on Tuesday with a visit to Mexico to increase trade between the two countries and to start negotiations on the political problems of the region.
Muhika will meet her Mexican colleague, Felipe Kalderon, next Wednesday, the most important item in the comprehensive plan of meetings with political, commercial authorities and meetings with the Uruguayan community in Mexico, as published by the Uruguayan leadership.
The meeting of two presidents in the city of Guadalahar would be “blessed to exchange information on political relations between the two nations”, as the South American leadership published on its website.
According to local media, Muhika is seeking support from Calderona for Uruguay in an incident with France, which occurred when French President Nikola Sarkozi included the South American country in a tax letter to the G20 meeting in the French city of Cana.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude those countries that remained tax havens from the international community, a statement that provoked the protest of Uruguay and responded to his letter ' s consultation in the European country.
Mexico has been chairing the G20 since November, a group established from the most highly developed and developing countries, and has, in fact, with the South American country since January of this year an agreement on the exchange of tax information in order to avoid double taxation.
In recent years, the Government of Uruguay has sought to accelerate the conclusion of tax-sharing agreements to leave this “serious list” of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development made up of countries that do not benefit from international tax cooperation standards.
With regard to the trade plan, the 2004 Free Trade Agreement (STS) in Mexico and Uruguay, which has increased trade between the two countries.
The watertight conductor will be three-dimensional with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has been constantly fighting over 25 years to save Princess Pitch from the evil lap of Bouzer, but never before has he done so in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the love of girls in stereoscopic technology.
The publication, which will appear in shops worldwide this month, was created taking into account the characteristics of the Nintendo 3DS port console, which allows to play in three dimensions without the need to use points.
"Mario is a hero who has to tell us how to work with a no-eye stereoscopy," said Nintendo's head of the press in Spain, Omar Alvarez, at the time of the Madrid game.
Alvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first Nintendo video game, specially designed under this platform", because so far successful products such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D" have been adaptations to existing games.
The representative of Nintendo said that, despite the existence of 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is a "accessible" video game that allows you to enjoy a fast and moving game.
Alvarez said "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part "simple" to attract less experienced users.
On one occasion, most experts will go "on the second round" to the levels of games that are more complex at this time.
In addition, users can choose in real time between "D aggressive" or those who only affect the depth of action, but who need to play in three dimensions to overcome various obstacles and "not be subject to optical illusions".
This invasion of Super Mario in three dimensions also means the return of the hero to the port console, which has not occurred since 2005.
In this game, Nintendo moves the series fans and repeats a successful formula from the previous games, the watertighter with everyone has to go through dangerous decommissioned platforms to free Princess Pitch.
However, the game will discover new movements, decorations, costumes and enemies as well as the "playing" Luigi.
Col. guarantees the extradition of Portillo to the United States
President Alvaro Colum said on Tuesday that the Alfonso Portillo extradition process had begun to respond in the United States to a 70 million-dollar contract.
This is the end of the process in which Guatemala responded to the request of the northern country, which required the extradition of Portillo to judge it there.
At the press conference, Cole said that his decision was related to the independence of the judiciary and the executive, taking into account that the Court of First Instance had already signed an extradition.
He claimed that during his term of office, he had not “applied his hands” to legal decisions and had adopted all the extradition procedures he had ever known.
Along with Portillo Sergio Ruano Morocco, he will be extradited for murder and serious bodily injury, as well as for Edgar Estrad Morales and Victor Estrad Parades, both for drug trafficking.
What Coloma has done shows the executive process after all legal and constitutional courts have been exhausted in order to prosecute the ex-heading of the State from 2000 to 2004.
In accordance with the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CPC), the Portillo will be extradited once with a decision on its legal situation in Guatemala and guaranteeing its human rights.
The portal was recognized as innocent in the Q120 million record in the Ministry of Defence during the presidential term, which was a process of previous extraditions, but the Ministry of Public Relations appealed and reopened the case.
Trinijove helped 6,000 young people at risk
The organization was established to prevent the marginalization of young people without education
The results of the first 25 years of Trinijove's social support organization are important: 6,000 young people under social isolation have helped to overcome difficult situations during this fourth century.
It is worth adding more than a hundred jobs created for this social group.
The anniversary was an occasion for the ceremony held at the old Fabra I Coats factory, where more than 300 people arrived.
Trinijove appeared in the world near the Trinity of Wales in 1986 to help young people with a lack of education, lack of work and drug problems or marginalization.
Yesterday's celebration in Sant Andreu gathered a large number of responsible organizations and agencies that had cooperated with the association during these 25 years.
Different political representations during the elections showed the same work done by Trinijove.
After the President of the Generality, Artura Massa, and his predecessor, Hordi Puhola, visited the ceremony by former socialist education consultant Ernest Maragal, and former mayor and current eco-occupianist, member of the City Council, Richard Goma.
There was also Fabra I Coats, the current Social Welfare and Family Adviser, José Luis Claris and the SCEO for the Social Work of La Caixa, Haume Lanaspa.
He said that Trinijove appeared to light in a very difficult time and that the current period was also difficult, but added that the work that has been done so far is "a good base".
The President provided the example of Trinijove as an example of combating the bad conditions and the universal hope of people suffering from difficulties.
"The crisis is not new for the organization and work done by it," he said.
Encapsulated building, where mass parties were organized, was evacuated
Catchers occupied 11 of the 13 floors of the building on Balmes Street, 51
12 Occupants left the building yesterday at noon without fighting
It seems that the nightmare that was experienced by the neighbors living on the 51st Street of Balmez was over.
Twelve people voluntarily left the building last afternoon, which they illegally occupied and where they organized mass parties that harassed neighbors, after the court's decision without police intervention.
When the operation was completed, the lock on the door was changed to prevent the recurrence of the situation.
"From this point on, there will be a checkout," said the manager.
Switters, which seized 11 of the 13 floors of the building, the rest of the inhabitants, allocated all the electricity and part of the water, broke down the walls and left traces of a variety, especially the banks under alcohol.
The first three floors were a place for a mass dinner that lasted up to two days and upset the owners.
Right behind the building is a night club, Balmez 51, which was also damaged.
The owner, Maria Pantinat, told Europe Press that since the building was occupied, its income had fallen by 80 per cent.
The club's owner says that the owners of the building took her into unfair competition, because they sold drinks for three euros, while at the club for ten.
In addition, the discotheque owner had to respond to the complaints of the neighbors to the noise, although, as she noted, the noise was caused by visitors not to the club but to residents of the forest, and, above all, those who had attended the parties that had organized there, whose frequency and intensity had increased, as the mature neighbors said.
The club owner said that the inconveniences were so great that she even reached an agreement with the owner of the property, and that's nine months ago, as he "forgives" her rent.
The City Police also confirmed that over the past few weeks, more complaints had been received from neighbours to the situation.
The President of the PP municipal group, Alberto Fernand Dias, asked last week to evacuate the building immediately in order to address the problems of coexistence and general spirit in the neighbourhood and degradation in this area.
The popular leader explained that only one floor of the building had been busy by summer, but in the last few months the squatters had invaded all the floors and virtually every room and that some of them had broken.
In this sense, he added that “there is a need to end impunity and to stand firm against the culture of the building.”
So yesterday, policemen evacuated a building in New Barris.
At 15:30 the police left on the street of Montral, 35 after receiving a call from the neighbor who noticed four people entering the building.
Four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountain?
Architects agree with the possibility of a contest after the contribution recommendations
The 16-door municipal competition resumed the debate on the role of Kolserola in Barcelona
In the mid-80s, at the lifting of the current Barcelona Capital Corporation (SKB), this administration printed a press release for Kolserola.
The booklet described the mountain as the great park of the capital of Barcelona.
Moreover, this was accompanied by a comparison of pictures with the New York Central Park.
With the death of the SKB, in 1987 the park again took place as the highest point in Barcelona as the capital of Catalonia, one of the small ones that is not north-south, but up (top) down (the sea).
The position of Kolserol as a natural park contradicts that idea.
The prototype was not the Central Park, but Yellowstone, with a wild cabin in the role of Yogi Bear.
That was so until, in September, the Council announced huge competitions consisting of 16 competitions for a number of other gates in Colsero.
There's no doubt about the idea of a park under the door.
Either way, or someone wants to put the door on the field.
The question is one: Kolserola, park or mountain?
The competitions, both their organizational sides and their impact on the city, are a topic for discussion by all the architects of Barcelona.
This is hardly the most repetitive topic discussed when two members of this group of elected people know each other in the elevator.
And that is one of the few coincidences between what three architects of Barcelona and the scientists who were present.
Miguel Rolldan, Daniel Modolo and Mara Bayon: the match is appropriate
For Roland, after reaching the shoreline, it becomes “necessary” to discuss the “first side of the mountain” when the Eldefon Serda proposal, a mountain with green apples, has not been implemented.
"It must be allowed that the largest park in Barcelona is the beach.
Besides, thanks to his excellent availability.
Kolserola is more complicated," says the architect, for whom the title "Cosserola Gate" contains a "word hunt": we should not think of them "as to entering the park, but as to limit some areas where we should act."
The model, like Roland and Bayon, with experience in urban construction, called the "intellectual task" with "some dangers".
The risks arising from the “uncertainty of public space projection” after the experience of the 80s, which ended at the Forum’s “song of song”.
The first fear is a limitation of borders where one can be built.
"Restriction of something is the preparation of the next step", there is a transition.
"We need to think about new urban planning tools, because the current [as regards the General Capital Plan (GSP)] can lead to real poverty."
Close to the case, Modola believes that the simplification of the Colserola Valley "can be understood as a park, Barcelona, rather than" as a purely topographic question.
The module recalls that there is already work done outside Kalserola, which is “not to be missed by the ear”, although he is grateful for the opportunity that Mary offers her profession to enter the project “from the beginning”.
Moreover, it understands that the proximity of the mountain to the city is a gap that allows the architects to enter the debate, but “he doubts” whether this technical profile is the one that should be led by the interdisciplinary teams (“success”, he claims) that the architects should have created: “The architects should only be a tool”.
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question, which is called this part, is complex, because the competition rules do not contain the general nature of Kolserola: "There have been 16 cross-competitions, he says, in the sense of the sea-mountain, but there is no long-term reading here to see and understand the area as a whole."
This requires, at least in his case, the participation of 16 competitions.
On the other hand, the project for one door can be crossed through the programme and defined with the project architect for the next door.
From your point of view, the Council is required to ensure that the field is directly above Ronda de Dalt to provide its full area equipped to create a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Casino pardons Jonas Larrastabal and will be released
After 72 days of settlement, the judge, Red Casino, forgave Mayor Monterrey's brother in the proceedings against him on charges of appeal.
After 72 days in prison, Manuel Jonas Larrasabal will be released after the legal representative of Red Casino granted him forgiveness before the Second District Criminal Court, which is conducting an appeal against Mary Monterrey.
After the bombing of Casino Royale, the owner of Red Casino, Sergio Gil Garcia, published a series of photographs and videos, where the alleged Manuel Jonas demanded an economic contribution to allow Monterey's authorities to release a secret operation in a cave house.
After public conviction, the Public Prosecutor-General opened a criminal case against the brother of the mayor and was arrested and sentenced to 30 days in prison on 2 September.
After four hours before the agent of the State Ministry of Offences, he was sent to a temporary prison in the old part of the capital of the State.
He remained in this place for 49 days, following the provisions of the second order on the prohibition of movement after the prosecutor had eliminated the crime of bribery and organized crime.
On 19 October, he was transferred to the Cadereitt for a claim of half a million peso to the owner of the Red Casino, but he spent only a few hours in prison with the average prison isolation because he was threatened with death.
The authorities allowed him to continue in the municipal prison in San Nicholas, Garza.
On 25 October, the arrest order was issued by the Secretary of the Second Criminal District Court, Jorge Janes, who said that, after almost two months of investigation, the evidence of Jonah ' s guilt was clearly enough, such as the taking of 1.5 million pesos from the lettermeckers ' representatives in exchange for the permission of the operation.
On Monday, the legitimate representative of Red Casino, Viktor Aldo Garcia Gomes, arrived with Judge José Luis Pesin to apologize for the brother of the mayor of the region, so that he could be released in the next few hours.
During the trial, the Public Prosecutor at the Court, Ramiro Arias, asked García Gomes whether he had compensated for the damage and which of the partners of the burning house was apologizing, although the lawyer tried not to make a name.
Based on records 197/2011, the legal pardon was granted to Jonas Larrastabal, and no claims can then be made concerning the process that was planned against him; no compensation or punishment will be required.
Following the hearing of the legitimate representative of the booksellers, at almost 15:50, it was suggested that Larrásabal Breton be released immediately.
The court official, Jorge Janes, went to San Nicholas City Prison in Garza to inform Jonah that he was legally forgiven and his case would be closed.
He will also inform him of the immediate release order signed by the judge.
Minister Dionysio Pérez Hakome tells about the details of the disaster, where the Minister of Interior, Francesco Blake, and seven more people died.
The Ministry of Communications and Transport (IST) reported that the results of an accident in which the Minister of the Interior of France Blake Mora and seven others were killed showed that the helicopter was directly hit on the ground in full integrity, without an attempt by the pilot to land an accident.
During the press conference, Dionysio Pérez Hakome, Minister of Communications and Transport, said that before the airship got up, the pilot found that the weather conditions were suitable for the flight.
"The elements that seem to show that the ship had several contact with the land, the wings came into contact with the trees at 25 metres, where the means were lost."
He also reported that the vessel was intended for 19 persons, respectively, to meet the necessary requirements for the carriage of persons.
He also said that the studies carried out in the impact area did not indicate the existence of parts on the ground.
“The study reported that there were no components of the ship elsewhere, and the impact was structurally complete.
"The helicopter was intended for 19 passengers, which met the relevant passenger transport requirements.
The land in this area has a distance from seven to 30 degrees.
At this point, the secretary said that the key was to get results as soon as possible; however, the study could take several months or even one year.
Meanwhile, Gilberto Lopez Meyer, Director General of Airports and Support Services, said that during the hit, the presidential helicopter was running at cruise speed and that this happened on a soft, rising ground.
"This information reinforces the hypothesis of the usual summer maneuver at the time of the strike," he said.
At the press conference, the owner of the SCT, Pérez Hakome, listed six important elements in the investigation:
Visual flight:
According to aviation rules, the voyage was conducted under visual flight rules, which means that the team must be visible during flight and landing.
Weather conditions:
The AICM reports identified appropriate conditions for flight when the aircraft was sent to the border area between Mexico City and the State of Mexico, where low altitude clouds were observed.
Selected routes:
Perhaps because of the cloudy conditions of the team, the area of less height and more visibility in the Quernawak valley was sought.
The site's hit.
The impact coordinates and the latest records from the aircraft radar are likely not lost control or flight direction change prior to the impact.
Small-scale bulkheads:
The information available so far indicates that the strike has come on the front and back line.
The dispersal of the cracks suggests that the helicopter hit the ground in structural integrity.
No apparent signs of fire or explosion were found:
The disaster zone remains undetected evidence in the wreckage of the ship, some kind of explosion or fire.
The results of recent studies show that there could be multiple contacts with the earth.
During field work, aircraft pieces were found at a height of 9,200 feet above sea level, and the land has a distance from seven degrees to 30 degrees.
The picture shows the sequence in which it was destroyed on its way.
The information contains facts that seem to indicate that the helicopter could have several collisions with the earth.
After a thorough study in more territory than in the area near the site where the disaster occurred, there were no scattered parts of the aircraft, which reinforces the assumption that the impact occurred in structural integrity.
MSS announces a gene search program
Social protection leads to a study on the search for a care gene for children and young people; it is supported by IPN specialists
The Mexican Institute of Social Protection (MSSI) has announced that a study is being conducted to identify the gene of obesity in children and young people, who have received the title “Genetics of Childhood Care and Adolescent Age”, which will provide an account of the signs of overweight.
In his statement, the head of the Medical Research Unit for Biochemistry of the Specialized Hospital of the National Medical Centre of the twenty-first century, Miguel Cruz Lopes explained that a multi-profile team of therapists, nurses, dietologists and social workers had been gathered.
The team is assisted by specialists and graduates of the National Institute of Health (NIPH) and the Centre for Research and Higher Education (CINVESTAV) of the National Institute of Politics (NPI).
The study invites the population (written or not) to participate by sending the MSSI sports centres participating in the study to the Gulf of Mexico, where every Saturday, from 8:00 a.m. to the children.
He stressed that the protocol had begun to operate at the sports centre in Kuoutemoke (west of Mexico), and since 8 October, activities have been taking place at the sports centre in Nesaualkootle (east of Mexico).
After reaching the goal of attracting 500 to 600 children, the study will continue at the Sports Centre of Independence (South Mexico) and finally at the Morelos Sports Centre (North Mexico).
He explained that the purpose of this study was to understand the importance and importance of genetics for the development of obesity and to establish a risk factor for children and young Mexicans to prevent chronic degenerative diseases
On 14 November, the World Day against Diabetes will be observed, and the main goal is to gather three thousand children and adolescents between 6 and 14 years of age with parents ' permission and under their supervision to complete individual food surveys.
They are also asked about physical activity and the history of family hereditary diseases in order to avoid risk factors that lead to diseases such as diabetes or an initial disability.
He explained that on Saturday, anthropometric measurements would be made for all participants (weight, growth and size of the plate), blood pressure and blood glucose, fats, cholesterol and insulin and genetic analysis (to identify the genes associated with child obesity).
Cruz Lopes said that this study reflected the concern of health professionals about the alarming increase in weight among children.
Medical studies conducted between 1999 and 2006 indicate that there has been an increase of only 6 years: in the case of boys, 77 per cent were breast-feeding, in the case of girls 47 per cent; in the case of overweight, there has also been a significant increase," said MSSI expert.
He said that the rationale for finding markers was based on the fact that the country's population differs from other peoples in its genetic history.
He claimed that the average Mexican was 65 per cent of the American Indians' descendants, 30 per cent of the Europeans' descendants, and five per cent of the Africans' descendants, and that this condition affected the genes associated with diabetes and overweight.
He explained that, mainly because of obesity, it is the body's inability to burn the excess energy we consume (calorie) and it is depleted as fat.
The researcher explained that a comprehensive assessment of children was a direct benefit to the participants, which could determine whether they had any excess weight or diet.
Even, he said, the presence of dark components on the neck (acants) and prefuses means that metabolism and even prediabetes are likely to be disrupted.
The information is addressed with full confidentiality, and the doctor will hand it over in writing to the parents, whom they explain all the measurements and changes in the form of life that must be taken to avoid disease.
Cruz Lopes explained that there were three main causes of excessive weight, obesity and other chronic diseases: a life-style, or a lack of daily physical activity, a greater part of the day before television, and the use of transport at small distances instead of walking.
This is also due to high calorie consumption, i.e. increased consumption of sweet drinks and carbohydrates (tamale, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with a high level of fat and protein content and geneticity analysed in the programme.
UNAM asphalt will be able to avoid friction
Rafael Errera, a study at the UNAM Chemical Faculty, developed a polymer-modified bitumen to produce a mix of the best environmental and temperature-sustaining quality.
If the signals sent by the road surface were to be taken into consideration, about 200 thousand of them would have to be repaired for each rainy season in the city area of the Valley of Mexico, said Rafael Errera Naher, a UNAM Chemical Faculty researcher, and added that if the construction and maintenance of an asphalt road surface is correct, the number of them could be reduced or all brought to zero.
His lecture The Technology View of the Jama in the International Year of Chemistry reported that the laboratory for which he was responsible was developing a polymer-modified bitumen for the production of a mixture with characteristics close to the bitumen, but with better resistance at both high and low temperatures.
Errera Nahera said that this type of modified bitumen can be used in places where the weather is extremely hot, as in some cities in the north, to improve road quality and therefore to counter their education.
He explained that bitumum, the hardest part of oil is the sequence of hydrocarbons, some high molecular masses called asphalts, and others low molecular masses called maltens, which together add to the road surface its characteristic binding behavior.
The high temperature of the bitumen is that at about 180 degrees it conducts itself as liquid at 120 degrees high and at 50 degrees Celsius, while at very low temperatures the bitumen becomes fragile, he said.
This means that the resistance to street asphalt is not permanent but changes during the day, depending on the natural conditions and temperature, said a specialist in chemical engineering.
The scholar Hymphak noted that the streets of Mexico are mainly covered by a flexible cover consisting of six layers of material, of which three are bitumen.
Among the top layers is a bitumen made of small stones lying in the bitumen and then pressed.
Every stone that makes up that cover, he said it's loaded in the bitumen.
In the movement of vehicles and in the implementation of efforts, it helps the forces to make a very good distribution on the road.
If it were a modified asphalt, they would be even better distributed, the chemical engineer said.
On the asphalt surface, he added, the last layer, which is called a layer of exports made from a small stone, in fact the sand also loaded into the asphalt.
Since it is a layer that will be in contact with transport wheels, it must have more resistance than asphalt cover and ensure road training.
As part of the road cover, which will receive and distribute these efforts, the volume of exports also requires proper thickness and consideration must be given to the material from which it is made.
The weather, especially humidity and temperature fluctuations, are also very important factors for consideration, especially water, he said, because it has a significant impact on the state of the asphalt.
When the earth is raw, water penetrates into the surface and it is difficult to get out of it, it causes all layers of the surface to be softened and, therefore, its education.
During their education, he said that the first layer of exports had an impact on the bitumen, but the damage had not occurred instantly, which should be taken into account in the first signs of the current repair programmes.
A member of the National Research System also explained that transport loads are another important factor in the formation of holes, and therefore the thickness of each layer must always be linked to transport loads and it is necessary to ensure that this requirement is met in order to prevent their frequent occurrence.
Rafael Errera said that about the bitumen, much remains to be studied and done, for example, by bitumen emulsions, which in other countries are already on the market and even helping to make caves with ease and without the use of high temperatures.
What's wrong with Vale's candidate to become a new Miss Columbia?
Analysis of the causes that prevented Serna Melina Ramirez from getting the crown of Miss Colombia.
The representative of Vale received the title of the princess at 14 times.
On another occasion, Vale del Cauque just wanted to find Miss Colombia's crown.
This time, Melina Ramirez Serna was to be pleased that she had fallen to the stage of the winners with a silver crown and a band proclaiming her new princess Colombia.
In view of the results achieved last night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlantica won the crown and shield, the department has 14 titled princesses, and Melina joins in the legion of women from Vale-del-Cauca who were close to the crown, but were announced by the princesses, among them Mirias Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Borrero Domingez (1949), Patricia Bellina Ajala (1979), Lauren Alvarez (1981), Rose Marie Alsate (1983), Olga Maria Arenas (1987), Layla Blance (1988), Monica Evers (1989), Maria Sonsola Pinedo (1990), Diana Ichabel Romero (1993), Haye Alhare Garcia (2000), Kathi Gira (2007)).
The question that many now ask:
Because the result is the defeat of the main favorite, which in each of the speeches has shown that she has everything to become a new Miss Colombia, not just that she was elected by the Royal Police and the most beautiful person in Vogue version - the titles that the Queens had, for example, Tatiana Vargas or Natalie Navarro, who received the crowns of Miss Colombia.
The first factor that played a role in the jury's decision to condemn her was that she was unable to give a convincing answer to the question, "What book characterizes you and why?, given by Martin Morris of the literary society Let's read it.
She answered the questioner:
"I read a lot, I believe in literature, I think it's a form of culture, and I certainly think that a book that characterizes my childhood -- "The Little Prince" -- is a pretty deep book.
Today I read "Presentation and Punishment" is the head of the world literature that we all should read; I am also reading the book of Irina Nemirovska, a Russian writer, a wonderful book called "The Blood of Blood."
The answer that the jury did not like because of the term "oculturation" and, secondly, because it did not explain specifically how each of the cited books characterizes it.
But after Melina's ceremony, she said she was calm and happy with her outcome: "The wisdom of the whole world is what must happen."
And all of you, please read a little, Little Prince is a great book.
Among the sounding hypotheses, Vale burned out of favoritism.
The Bogotá reporter suggested that, as she was preferred, she met with ovations, and she was a candidate who received all the preliminary awards (Ostera's culinary competition, a visual vote for the best national costume, and the Queen-Matt), “which aroused the zeal of other candidates, provoked stress in the queen, and as a result she did not shine on the stage”.
And this was noted during her first appearance in the bathroom on Hilton Beach and during her two performances on evening coronation.
Although she seemed certain, it was noted that she did not have the strength and energy that the Magdalena and the Atlantic represented.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist at the RCN channel, said that the fact that Milena was called a princess "means that a candidate who wins more prizes during the contest is not becoming a queen"
Furthermore, the representative of Vale has recently avoided the press and this was wrong.
Another hypothesis is that the representative of Vale failed to try to convince the jury of his interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Competition of Krasota.
That is why two days before the election of a member of the international jury, Lucy Dotti, said they were looking for a woman who was committed to the social needs of her country.
"One beauty is not enough for Miss Colombia, we need to look not only outwardly, but also focus on public awareness, before they participate in the competition, they must be involved in projects," she said.
There is also the assumption that the representative of Vale was wrong with the defects in the berries and fibrosis that had been seen in her life, but it was controversial, since the jury specifically noted her as a candidate with “natural beauty”, taking into account her healthier body, good food and responsible physical work.
Queens' consultant, Jorge Ernan Orosko, notes that Melina had no better body than they had, "but the problems of the fibrosis on my life, which were not very noticeable to me, have caused her to lose her eyes on the last day."
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Oyos of Crocos believes that the error of the representative of Vale de Cauca was that she was subjected to surgery.
"Operations are good, but representative Vale doesn't know how to do them.
Her body was never her advantage, and here she was punished for it.
With regard to the prize, which was first given by the organizers of the National Competition of Beauty, the harsh prediction took place last night, they said it was the uncle that Raymond gave Melin as compensation for her lack of pleasure in getting a crown.
This is not, however, the fact that Melina today has a year of government, not as a queen, but as a princess, a position that enables her to represent Colombia at one of the international competitions directly mentioned by the organizers of the National Competition.
However, it goes back to history as one of the kings who, despite his excellent speech at the Cartagena competition, faced difficulties in obtaining the crown.
That was the work of a man who met the body of Alfonso Kano.
A criminal from Cali went into history as a man who confirmed the death of Alfonso Kano.
The work of these servants is key.
On 4 November, CTI Kali, a criminal, entered history as a person who confirmed the identity of FARC Alfonso Kano in comparison to his fingerprints.
Of the seven criminals working at the CTI this week, Elizabeth González, a man from Puerto Tehada who spent 21 years in judicial proceedings, was called on to “delay” Elisa González.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in the cities of Choko, where he often had to spend more than five days in jungles to reach places where bodies were to be identified.
In 2000, he moved to Vale and became a specialist in criminalism, where he studied leather training, i.e. Ladons and Stones.
During the week of Elishara's human acquaintance, known as Alfonso Kano, he was told to wear no more than three days.
Something big was coming up.
On Friday night, he arrived at a helicopter from Cauque in Palmer.
He knew that he would have to identify two troops, and one of them was supposed to belong to the man who led the world's oldest partisan war, so they asked him to take ten pictures of the prints of Gilermo Leon Saens (his current name).
However, when he came from a research group where the body was located, he did not know him externally; he was very different from what they showed in the media.
He was without a beard, dressed like a local farmer, no points, and much worse.
But prints aren't right.
Using an increase in glass, blacksmiths, shovels, and bells, Eliser compared the fingerprints of the body to those on the picture.
His eyes didn't say it was Alfonso Kano.
On the same night, the representative of Puerto Tehada asked to confirm to the Minister of Defence Juan Carlos Pinson that he was head of the RWSC
Search for fingerprints
The recognition of President Juan Manuel Santos by Elisa González at the press conference on the operation against Cano was particularly important for the dactyloscope specialist of Sijin from Kali.
Many people don't know what we're doing.
Dachtyloscopy is a strict science, without mistake, that it can play a key role in the discovery of crimes.
In addition to the identification of the bodies, the dactyloscope experts participate in the investigation of crimes, such as theft and murder, and establish the identity of the detainees.
In detention, many criminals have false certificates or no documents.
We're taking their prints and looking for them in the base.
The researcher said that in the case of a robbery, he had to take a piece of the wall home, because in this place, the weather was hand-held to control the safe, the precious, and the money.
“It’s hard to work with walls because they’re not comfortable surfaces to remove prints, but in that case we can take pictures of the entire refrigerator and identify the identity of the criminal who took part in several strikes,” he says.
The prints also help to exclude or establish the involvement of suspects in murder cases.
Recently, a dead man was found with bottles under a liqueur around him.
The investigation found that the crime could have been a suspect relative and, in fact, the fingerprints on the bottle were matched.
Although it does not guarantee that he was a murderer, it proves that he was at the scene of the murder.
A specialist on dactyloscopes from CTI explained that there is a chemical or physical reagent in places where there are prints.
When they appear, a shovel or tape is used to remove them.
Thereafter, the prints are sent to Asif, which is the criminal database or entered in the register.
"The problem is that we still have a lot of undocumented Colombians," the CTI expert said.
He explained that not exactly as shown in the CSI TV program.
Just as not all the gold that shines, not all that you touch, it leaves a mark on itself.
However, if possible, the comparison is made.
"Dissolved People" pose a challenge to the New York authorities
Hundreds of protestors broke the camp in front of Zukotti Square.
Some of the protestors heard the court's decision to disarm the demonstration from the scene and went to the neighborhood park.
The members of the "Call Wall Street" movement called on the authorities of New York on Tuesday, when they tried to re-enter, under the protection of a court order, at Manhattan, where they were evacuated to the world in an attempt to capture another Greater Apple Park.
Hundreds of protestors dug in Zukotti's square, where they wanted to go through a court order that allowed "distorted people" to break camp in the square until the other part of the movement responded to the raid, captured the park in the north of the city, where further arrests were held.
"Our idea is that once the court doesn't let us break the camp in the field, we'll break up the camp somewhere else and continue to fight for the return to Zukotti and for peaceful shootings and demonstrations," said one of the representatives of the Wall Street movement, Mark Bree.
Brey explained that the response of the "distorted people" to the evacuation of the palace town, which was ordered by Mayor Michael Bloomberg personally, had been brought to court where Judge Lucy Billings issued a decree prohibiting forced evacuation from the grounds and allowing the demonstrators to remain in the camp.
In addition, the "distorted people" began to capture a new park located on the site of the merger of the central streets of Canal Street and Sixteen, near the entrance to the tunnel of the Netherlands, which unites New York and New Jersey and is owned by the Trinity Church.
At least at least they could take this place, but then the police arrived and started arresting some of the protestors, although Bree could not name the exact number, but spoke of seeing several journalists who were also in the handcuffs.
The Organization assures that several hundred people stood with the camps where the delegation of religious leaders had gone to demonstrate support for members of the movement, trying to act as mediator in negotiations with the police.
Meanwhile, the Zukotti area, which is a private property, remains closed pending the hearing on Tuesday, which will consider the legality of the protests this morning.
Some of the protestors there carried and distributed copies of that court order at the same time and even gave those copies to the police guarding the area, which led to “some small clashes”, said Bree, who said that some police were demonstrators.
The ruling prohibits the authorities from evacuated members of the Wall Street movement and from forcing them to enforce “laws issued after the arrest, or from preventing demonstrators from having access to the park with shops and other property used earlier”.
Mary Blomberg told reporters that because of this court decision, the city had stopped opening public space and demonstrators had been informed about it, but local laws did not allow them to re-launch tent stores and sleeping bags.
A member of the municipal council personally justified the removal of protestors from Zukotti Square, which was carried out in the light of an operation involving approximately 200 arrests, and that was decided on because the protestors “infringed the law”.
Blomberg said he gave orders to clean up the area because it became "a place where people were not going to protest, but to violate the law and, in some cases, to harm others", because "some businesses were threatened" and neighbors were afraid of "decreasing the quality of life".
The evacuation, which took place this morning, was repugnant and showed that in the depths of Blomberg's soul more interest in protecting the financial interests of American workers," added the representative of the movement, condemning the mayor for “infringement of freedom of speech”.
Those responsible for Calling Wall Street also indicated that they were planning to organize “grantial actions” on Thursday in collaboration with public organizations and trade unions to remember the last two months of protests that began on 17 September.
Pamela Anderson will become Devo Maria in a special Christmas TV show
Together with Michael Bubble and other Canadians, she will appear on the Rassella Peters's television program on 1 December.
Canada Pamela Anderson was an assistant to Tim Allen at the Big Repair, rescuer at the Malibu Rescuers, Banni at Playboy, the wife of the rock musician Tommy Li, and now the actress and model will become Devo Maria in a special birthday show on Canadian television.
The private TV CTV announced today that Anderson, together with a crown (executor) Michael Bubble and other Canadian publishers, will appear on the Rassela Peters television program on 1 December, in the role of Mary in particular.
CTV presented today a television show in which Anderson, also known as the Internet’s wide-ranging home porn video, is also depicted by her husband, the drummer of the "Mötley Crüe" team, Tommy Li, who is dressed as the Virgin Mary, who is holding a doll representing Jesus.
In this scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian comic of Indian origin, who recently spoke as the leader of the tour "My cruel torpedoes of truth" Charlie Shin, appears to be Joseph.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, a Canadian singer, Bubble, participates in a special Christmas show, who was married in Buenos Aires in late March at the Argentine model Louisiana Lopilato and who also knows how to deal with scandals.
Bubble recently called American "sucky" Kim Cardassian during one of his concerts in New York City
Japan, born after the earthquake
GDP increased by 1.5 per cent due to domestic consumption and put an end to the decline that began in March
Since March last year, Japan's economy has been paralyzed and is still being driven from the devastating earthquake that has brought about a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster that the rising sun has brought on the World War II.
According to the first estimates of the Tokyo Government, the material losses amounted to $300,000 — a blow that, despite the difficult world situation, seems to have passed.
After three losing quarters, data on the gross domestic product from July to September have certainly helped to convert the page: GDP increased by 1.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter and by 6 per cent in the annual calculation.
The second quarter - for Japanese, the financial year begins in March 2012 - also represents the fastest growth rate from January to March 2010.
Rebirth may be partly due to the repurchasing of machinery equipment for the restoration of areas devastated by earthquakes and subsequent tsunamis.
In fact, companies increased their investment by 1.1 per cent against a decrease of 0.9 per cent of capital costs, which occurred from January to March, the first decline after six months of continuous growth.
However, the real change in Japan's economy is not based solely on the Kenyan impulse, which calls for a crisis to be used to strengthen or restructure infrastructure, using lies to grow from scratch.
Japan was awake, mainly due to domestic consumption, which now accounts for 60 per cent of Japan's GDP.
This rate increased by 1 per cent by increasing the cost of cars, travel and recreation.
Sticky Keys
Tokyo has provided the internal market, when yen-Japanese currency has become one of the "future currency" selected by investors who want to escape the debt crisis in the euro area and negative forecasts about the US, a privilege that strikes as a stone on behalf of exporting companies.
With a stronger currency, the product is expensive abroad, which is a serious blow to the country, whose economic course is determined by the health of large technology companies.
Toyota or Sonny, for example, blame the yen in their low rates from July to September.
While markets continue to be planted by the EU's peripheral countries, the Essihiko Noda Government is not undermining its alertness.
We must be careful about the remaining risks, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of flooding in Thailand and the sharp increase in its value, Minister of Economic Policy Motohis Furukwa said yesterday.
In fact, the prospects are not exciting.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) reported that most participating countries had demonstrated clear signs of economic activity decline in September.
The indicator, which predicts a world economy break, has shown that the main forces are slowing down.
He then dropped four tenths to 100.4 points compared to 100.8 in August.
The eurozone even fell below the average of 100 points after it had fallen to eight tenths to 99.13 points.
Aphines Give Again the Land for Doubts
Papadamos said that the adjustment would be approved, but the conservators would not sign any written obligation.
With the periphery prizes for risk and uncertainty in the parks, Greece continues to wander around the maze that leads to the exit of the great European debt crisis.
The feeling that the "consent" of the new Transitional Government of Ellad is being put forward by Brussels rather than by the true conviction of political forces begins to be confirmed by facts.
While the new Prime Minister Lucas Papadamos warned yesterday that there were no alternatives to structural reforms and that the one-day period agreed upon when he was appointed might be insufficient for them, the leader of the Conservative Party of New Democracy, Antonis Samaras, assured that he would not support new measures of a strict economy in any case and would repeat his requirement for the new elections appointed on 19 February.
The main objective of the Government is to implement the decisions taken at the summit on 26 October, Papadamos said yesterday, opening parliamentary debates that will be held tomorrow with the confidence of the new executive.
The package of 24 programmes to increase employment, reform of the disciplinary code of public servants and new measures to combat tax evasion will be the first innovation.
However, the message of Samaras does not express any doubt about his position: "We are ready to help the Transitional Government, but we promise nothing."
The conservative leader did more than one step in his attitude towards the EU and IMF, organizations that had to freeze 8,000 million people urgently needed by Athens, and explained that he would not give his approval to any letter of agreement with the requirements of the treaty.
However, the European Commission, still experiencing a dissatisfaction with the effect of the Papandreou referendum's allegations in a whole or nothing, reiterated yesterday that its demands are unanimous: it will not renew aid if the new Government and leaders of the main parties of Greece do not sign "a written agreement without any doubt and as soon as possible".
The representative of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafay, said that the three inspectors could return to Athens “speedily” to discuss with the new Government “what should be done to pay for the sixth tranche” of 8,000 million, although the exact date has not yet been indicated.
In the Greek club, the strings will be enough for a while.
Ms. Sofia: "These are tools of progress and hope"
The Queen emphasized the "core" place of Spain for this type of finance
Spain "has taken a prominent position in the world in the area of microfinance".
Queen Sofia recalled yesterday that in the last two decades, the country has become a second-large donor in terms of the instruments of cooperation, whose “materiality”, she said, is that it is “a tool for social progress, justice and hope for the best future of all humanity based on faith in humans”.
Yesterday, the Queen opened the Fifth World Microcredit Summit in Valyadolid with the conviction that “there is no doubt” that such actions are “completely necessary” to achieve the United Nations Millennium Goals by 2015, and “especially with the aim of reducing the double number of people living less than one dollar a day, the level at which the poverty line is set”.
Spain "is still working" to expand the network of recipients around the world and to take on this task with all "responsibility", says Ms. Sofia and hopes that the efforts and achievements that will take place during the summit, which will continue until Thursday, will be "to create new capacities and opportunities for the poorest people and especially for women, "the main beneficiaries of these loans".
There are "a lot of achievements" and "a lot of difficulties we face."
The Microcredit Summit is not only an area for disputes, but also a platform that promotes “two main objectives”.
Her Majesty thus explained that she hoped that by the end of 2015, 175 million poor families would benefit from these financial services and hundreds of millions of households would be selected from the poverty they were in.
The impetus for the establishment of a microcredit system in Spain and throughout the rest of the world “walked on the road that began years ago” by Mohammed Yunus, stressed Ms. Sofia as “a act of justice and recognition”.
And she described the father of this instrument as a "problem idealist in the general fight against poverty", whose work has been known for 15 years since the Queen went to Bangladesh to study his credit policy.
This year, the first World Summit was held in Washington and other meetings, such as those held in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006, and "I have seen continuous development everywhere," Her Majesty said, whose link with the project brought her the title "family heads", collected in Valíadolide as "poor banker".
Finally, the Queen of Sofia concluded her statement by inviting those present to participate in the discussion and finding solutions to move forward in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical Empire"
The Minister of Foreign Affairs Trinidad Hymenez said solidarity was "ethical imperative" for each democratic State.
In this regard, she said that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries with the time of the economic paper, since it was a “permanent obligation”.
Hymenes concluded that microcredit entails a “serious and solid course aimed at eradicating poverty”, and now “greater than ever” developed countries' Governments must work on solidarity criteria and not allow it to be a victim of cost reduction.
For Spain, microcredit is “one of the main areas of development cooperation”.
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Sarajevo Rodriguez, commended the “success” to give “confidential” to the people “closed to whom all doors are closed”, and the mayor of Valyadolid Francisk Javier Leon de la Riva welcomed all present in the city, which “opens its doors covered by the spirit of solidarity”.
HDS proposes to elect the President of the European Commission by a general vote
The first day of the Congress of the Christian Democratic Union (HDS) in Leipzig on Monday, 14 November, passed without any major problems for Chancellor Angela Merkel, who was also chairman of the Christian Democratic Party.
The future of Europe was not originally planned in the programme, but it was only in the autumn, in particular to satisfy activists who felt that the government's policy was not as strict as it should be today with regard to Greece and perhaps with regard to Italy tomorrow....
The draft resolution on the Presidency of the European Commission, which was submitted for discussion by the governing body, was almost unanimously adopted.
Of the 1001 delegates, only nine voted against and ten abstained from the vote.
Ozones, standing for a few minutes, who earned their statements by Angela Merkel and several hours later Wolfgang Shoible, Eurofil and Finance Minister, left no room for doubt.
The main idea of the chancellor and the draft resolution is the slogan: the true response to the crisis is “not less Europe, but more Europe”.
Not just because Europe means peace, but because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro".
For the chancellor, the time has come for a break in Europe.
This may mean changes to the Lisbon Treaty, which make it possible to strengthen the European Union's control of the financial policies of the Eurozone countries, but it may also affect the election of the President of the European Commission by a general vote, “to give Europe a person”.
In any case, this is one of the proposals of the draft resolution adopted by the Congress, which obviously belongs to Wolfgang Shoyble.
Of course, twenty-seven countries are unlikely to agree quickly with this decision; Britain is opposed to it, and HDS leaders believe that Nikola Sarkozi is against it too.
But it's ready.
Similarly, the overwhelming majority of delegates rejected the proposal to weigh the vote of each member of the Euro Union in the European Central Bank in accordance with the size of each economy, which would significantly increase the weight of the German economy.
The chancellor has increased the number of references to Conrad Adenauer and Helmut Kolya, but it has not sought to influence the congress by the "small" European countries or countries in a difficult situation that like to criticize "high-level" Germany.
Although the whole paragraph was devoted to the importance of the German-French friendship in the draft resolution on Europe, Angela Merkel did not mention France.
Just by the way.
Remember, two centuries ago, Leipzig became the scene of a bloody battle.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonian army.
What's the lie with the hospital leaves?
As a result of the cash benefits, the UMP and the Government began to enter hospitals.
On 15 November, Nikola Sarkozi will arrive in Bordo to visit the family benefit fund and to address this issue, which has been periodically raised since 2007, on combating social fraud.
In order to help this phenomenon that arose as a result of the desire to save in a difficult situation, but also as part of the right to re-election campaign in the President, most would like to focus on hospital letters.
First of all, with regard to the budget economy, the Government intends to impose a fourth day of unpaid leave on employees of private companies before the payment of the benefit.
Obviously, without the employer's special consent, the sick worker loses four days' salary, at least 15 per cent of his/her monthly income.
A measure that threatens to produce a storm of anger, but which, according to Les Echos, will save 280 million euros.
And which will be accompanied by other measures with a more symbolic effect, namely to impose one day on public servants without payment of a sickness benefit (public servants have not yet had to wait for payment of benefits, unlike the three-day expectation of private sector workers).
Now that these issues are being discussed, most of them also raise the subject of fraud again, with regard to abuse in the issuance of hospital letters.
Control will become more expensive and additional, if you are caught, you will have to return all the illegal payments you received," Xavia Bertran warned on the RTL channel on Saturday 13 November.
As in other cases, the effect of the statement has been disproportionate to the actual abuse of hospital records.
They have indeed been under constant control and political attacks since 2002.
People in France suffer no more than anywhere else in Europe.
Let's first look at the country's numbers.
According to the National Health Insurance Fund (CNAM), more than 237 million euros per day were paid in 2006.
According to the Institute for Health Research and Documentation, daily compensation costs in 2008 amounted to 11.3 billion euros, 5% of total health costs.
Of this amount, 46 per cent were for the statutory leave and accidents of production and 54 per cent for sickness benefits, which amounted to 6.2 billion euros.
Accordingly, 2.5 per cent of health-related expenditures were incurred.
The French carried out an average of 14.5 days in 2010 compared to 17.8 days in 2009, according to the Alma Consulting Group study.
The average arithmetic that conceals some deviations; another study published in 2007 by Monster.com's career management site showed that 75 per cent of the 40,000 French workers surveyed said they had not taken a day of hospitalization.
Another health insurance study claims that 37 per cent of the patients had less than 8 days in 2010, 15 per cent of 15 days in one month, 15 per cent from one to three months, and 11 per cent of the patients had been longer.
Compared to the number of European neighbours, it is clear that French workers are not more likely to be hospitalized than workers in any other country.
A long study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers showed that between 1994 and 2001, the overall lack of work in France (for health reasons or not) varied between 10 and 11 per cent, compared with 20 to 28 per cent in Denmark, 15 per cent in the United Kingdom and 16-18 per cent in the Netherlands.
The level of illiteracy associated with hospital letters is very low compared to "serious" employment.
With regard to the level of fraud, he's very low.
The tightening of the law after 2002 has resulted in a systematic examination of the duration of the hospital for more than 45 days.
In 2008, out of the 1.5 million verified cases, CNAM found that 13 per cent of the 285,000 short-term findings were “unjust” or too long”, representing 37,050 cases.
In the case of systematic hospital letters over 45 days, 11 per cent of the 1.2 million cases were “inappropriate or unfounded” and 132 000 cases were reported.
Overall, 169,000 cases were “unfounded” for several million workers who received hospital letters.
Figures that show very few cases, for example, with the "serious" employment numbers.
According to UMP Dominika Tian, the author of the report on this issue in June, they account for between 9 and 15,000 million euros of unaccompanied budget revenue per year, which exceeds the total cost of daily compensation, and therefore is infinitely higher than the loss of fraud.
Papadimos: Greece must follow a new settlement plan
Greece needs a new settlement programme to save its economy.
On Monday, 14 November, Prime Minister Lucas Papadamos said in Parliament, adding that the 100 days allocated to his coalition Government were not enough to carry out this task.
"In order to achieve the objective of saving the economy, we need support from our European partners and a new budget adjustment programme," said the Head of Government, who made his first public statement, opening a debate on confidence in Parliament on the environment.
The implementation of the decisions adopted at the Eurozone Summit on 27 October should be the “core task” of the new Government, since the country ' s presence in the Eurozone is “imposed” - he added.
Accordingly, Papadimos forecast a reduction in the country ' s budget deficit of approximately 9 per cent from GDP by the end of the year, at 10.6 per cent in 2010 and 15.7 per cent in 2009.
The right to refuse action by the new Government
On Monday, Antonis Samaras, the leader of the right, expressed his support for the measures already taken to try to get out of the debt crisis, but warned that his party would not support additional measures of a strict economy.
"We will not vote for new measures," he said at a meeting with Members from his party, New Democracy.
He agreed with the challenges of reducing deficits and debt and combating riots, but also his denial of any course that impeded economic recovery.
Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner responsible for the economy and finance, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not block the necessary loan of €8,000 without written guarantees from all parties, that they would support the planned measures, Antonio Samaras replied that his words were sufficient and that he would not sign anything under external pressure.
Legalize euthanasia and suicide by means of foreign aid, the Committee of Experts states
Canadians refuse to die, approved in the report of the Royal Society of Canada
With regard to palliative medicine, the Committee claims that the Government, health institutions and the doctor are working together to ensure the best palliative care, and this is not considered cancer.
The Canadians are refusing to die.
Only 9% of Canadians agree to tell their doctor when they want to die and take steps in this direction.
This is one of the impressive findings of the Royal Society of Canada, which involved six experts from various areas, including ethics, law and medicine.
The Committee invites the Government to amend the criminal code in such a way as to permit suicide with foreign aid and euthanasia when the choice is subject to circumstances and the patient can be considered competent to take such a decision.
To begin with, the experts refer to a recent study of the Economic Expert Bureau, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world.
Although Canada has 10 seats, the study notes that “the medicalization of death in Canada has produced a culture in which people are afraid to argue about death.”
Because of medicalization or not, 77 per cent of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, experts appointed by the Royal Society of Canada report.
And 68.6% of them end up dying in the hospital.
The highest rate in Quebec, where 86 per cent of deaths occur in the hospital.
On the sensitive issue of euthanasia and suicide, the authors of the report concluded that it was contrary to the position of the federal government, which had already stated that it wanted nothing to change in the criminal code on euthanasia and suicide with foreign aid.
Now, according to experts who have also examined the position of all countries where such actions have been legalized or decriminalized, there is no evidence that this decriminalization has been abused, i.e., the execution of euthanasia or suicide with the help of people who cannot or do not wish to make such a decision.
On the contrary, he confirmed during the Jocelin Downi teleconference, which presented the report, most of these cases were in countries where euthanasia and suicide were not legalized by the side.
Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is obviously illegal.
A suicide with foreign aid is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal, explains Jocelyn Downi.
Unified Canadian Aboriginal Syllabics
It should be remembered that 85 per cent of Canadians advocate euthanasia because, according to Angus Reid's 2010 survey, they believe it will allow people to ease their suffering at the end of their lives.
And 66 per cent believe that the legalization of euthanasia will not signal that the life of the elderly or the disabled is of less value.
With regard to people who have assisted in suicide, 41 per cent of the respondents believe that they should not be prosecuted.
With regard to the extension or termination of medical care, the situation is less clear, the authors of the report say.
They also propose, in addition to their other recommendations, that the Penal Code should provide that the legal cessation of medical care is not a crime.
The Committee of Experts also requires that health professionals be trained in a spirit of respect for the refusal of medical care at the end of life without fear of criminal prosecution.
With regard to palliative assistance, the Committee calls on the Government, health care institutions and doctors to work together to develop the best possible palliative assistance, not only in cancer cases.
Finally, with regard to the palliative or terminal session already widely used in Canadian health institutions, the Committee requires that it be applied when it does not serve to alleviate physical pain, such as euthanasia, and is subject to the same restrictions.
Comments of other experts
Some health law experts have already commented on the conclusion of the report of the Royal Society of Canada.
Metr Pier Dashan, a health law specialist, described as "the extreme" the position of experts who signed the report, because, among other things, it does not restrict the use of euthanasia in fatal cases.
This opens the door to a situation in which anyone who is tired of life and who is over 18 years old can ask for help in committing suicide, says the meter Deshan, who discussed the summary of the report yesterday.
Metr Dasham also stressed that the authors of the report seem to be independent of the person above all other values that form the social fabric of society.
He said, "There are warning signs and prohibitions in society."
Health Law Specialist Margaret Somerville also said “a categoryal disagreement with the conclusions of the report, which she called “the manifesto for euthanasia”.
Margaret Somerville, who is herself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, disputes, inter alia, the report on abuses in some countries where euthanasia and suicide are legalized with foreign aid, such as in the Netherlands and Oregon.
King of Jordan calls on President Assad to resign
Damasc condemns "probate"
Syria is becoming increasingly isolated
The participants of Bashar Assad demonstrated yesterday before the Foreign Ministry building.
Yesterday, the diplomatic pressure on Syria, Bashar Assad, who, with the support of Russia, opposed him and condemned the “constitution” against his country, was intensified.
Two days after Syria's membership in the League of Arab States was suspended, the European Union increased its sanctions against Damascus and the neighbours of Syria and Turkey and Jordan resigned from President Assad.
The King of Jordan, Abdullah II, was the first Arab leader yesterday, who summoned President Bashar Assad to power in Syria, where about forty civilians and military personnel were killed.
"If Bashar had been the way of his country's interests, he would have to resign, but he would also have to create the necessary conditions for a new phase of political life," said the king of Jordan, next to Syria, in an interview with the BBC.
In turn, Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu expressed regret that Turkey's mediation efforts, which began earlier this year, had not been successful.
Those in the Middle East who do not live in peace with their people and cannot satisfy their aspirations lose power, he said, in spite of Syria, the neighbouring country in respect of which Turkey is taking a more stringent course.
For their part, the United States welcomes the “enhancing of consensus against Assad and the Syrian regime” following the decisions of the League of Arab States and the European Union.
The international community, the United States, the European Union, the League of Arab States and such countries as Turkey, are taking an increasingly tougher course on repression in Syria, Mark Toner, a representative of the State Department, noted.
At that time, 16 civilians and at least 19 armed forces were killed in the region of Derwa in southern Syria, reports the Syrian Observer for Human Rights (OSDH).
Two other residents were killed during the shooting and shooting of heavy bullets in Jobara, Homs County, according to the NGO.
During the press conference, the Syrian Foreign Minister, Valid Muallem, said that the country was approaching the end of the crisis."
In addition, he strongly responded to the decision of the League of Arab States to eliminate Damascus, which he said was a “dangerous step”.
Syria will not be broken, and he will add, believing that the conspiracy against Syria will fail."
Following his decision to remove Syria from the League of Arab States, he is currently studying “the civil protection mechanism and requires the recruitment of 500 members of the Arab Human Rights Organization, journalists and military observers in the country.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs of France, Alan Zuppe, also spoke of the sending of observers from the United Nations to help protect civilians from the repression of the regime, which he said fell into the paramilitary.
A new emergency meeting of the League was scheduled for tomorrow in Rabata to discuss the implementation of the exit plan, adopted on 2 November, which included, inter alia, the withdrawal of the armed forces from the cities where the fighting is taking place and the release of the arrested demonstrators.
Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov called yesterday an incorrect solution to the League of Arab States, while China urged Syria to implement a plan to escape the crisis, but abstained from supporting possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monty requires time in Italian markets and victims
The future head of the Italian Government, Mario Monty, asked the markets for a short time to form his command and to implement a programme that would require "victims" to restore the creditworthiness lost in the last few months of the Berlin government.
The former European Commissioner took part in discussions with political parties yesterday before today's meeting with trade unions and employers.
It will have to form a relatively moderate office made up of non-Parliamentary technocrats.
Monty spoke about the importance of the programme, which was a large number of victims, said Francesco Nucara, a representative of a number of small parliamentary groups that took part in the discussions following a meeting with the candidate for the Prime Minister.
Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies Janfranko Finini said he would expect to know whether Mario Monti would ask Parliament to vote on confidence until Friday to ensure that the new Government had sufficient support.
The meeting will end with Mr. Monty presenting a limited list of the dozen or around those ministers, the head of the country, Georgio Napolitano.
Mr. Monty commented yesterday on the nervousness of the stock exchanges and bond holders, requesting time.
In “democracy requires time for the preparation of the Government and the programme,” he stressed, adding that he was convinced that markets would be patient and understanding.
His appointment by the President was initially approved by the markets, but concern arose again, particularly after the unexpected fall of industrial production in the Eurozone in September.
The appointed Prime Minister had to form a team, including, most importantly, technocrats, although he stressed that he would also like to include “politics”.
The new Government will have to act by 2013, the dates of the next elections, he said.
According to the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Janfranko Finini, the new Government will receive Parliament's confidence on Friday.
Mr. Monty guaranteed that he would work hard to ensure that Italy would again become an important active person in Europe.
The representative of European Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that "in spite of the new Government, our assessment of the Italian economy has not changed".
The European Union, convinced that Rome would not implement the budget for 2013, despite the strict economic plan adopted in recent months, required, in particular, new strict measures.
The Italian boss Emma Marchegali, who met him on Tuesday, also insisted on the need to restart the economy, “because a country that is not growing cannot meet the deficit parameters”.
Mr. Monty, known for his competence and independence in the home of the European Commissioner (1994-2004), represented the “change of era” for Italy after 17 years of “berlusconism”, “professor”, symbolizing “serious challenges” and “other Italy”, according to the sponsors.
The longevity of his team is unknown.
The President of Naples would be pleased to avoid early elections, as by April 2012, Italy should pay public debt payments of EUR 200 billion.
Russian scientist assisted the Iranian nuclear programme
Russian scholar Vaceslav Danilenko helped Iran develop a detonator suitable for use in nuclear weapons, a US nuclear-hazard specialized agency confirmed on Monday.
The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) is based on the recent report of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents of the United Nations agency to identify the person of that scientist.
Last week, IAEA expressed concern about the " possible military dimension" of the Iranian nuclear programme
According to ISIS, based largely on IAEA documents, Mr. Danilenko was born in 1934, worked for 30 years, “from the 1960s, at the Soviet nuclear centre in Chelabinsk, Ural, and was involved in the production of synthetic diamonds of explosive methods”.
In 1989 or 1991 he left the centre to create a company producing nanoalmase in Kiev.
His company's financial difficulties led him to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
He then cooperated with the Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002, before returning to Russia
In its report, IAEA mentions “the clear evidence that Iran ' s nuclear detonator system has "assisted the work of a foreign expert who not only knew this technique well but also informed the Agency that he has worked most of his career in this technology within the framework of his country ' s military nuclear programme”.
The number of anti-Muslim crimes increased by 50 per cent
According to the FBI statistics published on Monday from 2009 to 2010, the number of anti-Muslim crimes has increased by almost 50%, while other forms of racial and religious violence have been reduced or not altered during the same period.
According to these figures, the total number of cases of violence against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, which is equal to 49 per cent, compared with an increase of 13 per cent in Catholic violence, a decrease of 4 per cent in Jewish attacks and a total increase of 14 per cent in religious crimes.
The total number of hate crimes, according to the FBI, has increased very little to 6,628 cases, 47.3 per cent of which were motivated by racial differences and 20 per cent by religious differences.
After a decrease in 2009, concerns that the number of these crimes is growing again, stresses the Human Rights First, “the increase in violence against Muslims” added the organization to the official communication.
"Human Rights First has long stressed that acts of violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, should be considered as serious violations of human rights," one of the leaders of Paul Legandr added.
“The American Government can and must do more to deal with these crimes, adding that this can be done by improving police reports on hate crimes.”
"Hate crimes" in federal law are the legacy of the period of civil rights struggle.
This law was passed after Martin Luther King's death to punish acts of violence related to race, colour, religion, nationality and in our days of sexual orientation.
Twitter changes its platform and becomes similar to Facebook
On Monday, the Twitter microblog site changed its platform to allow users, in particular, to see the activity of those they watch, which makes this service similar to Facebook.
The new "activities" and other "names" tab allow you to follow more easily and directly the activities of other "twitters", users whose messages you follow, and those who follow yours.
This provides an opportunity to know if they publish messages, if they are subscribed to new accounts, if they have selected messages, etc.
This new Twitter formula was protested "with a small percentage of users in August" before going out to use the whole network on Monday, AFP told Twitter news secretary Caroline Penner.
Twitter, which has been known for a long time as intuitively vague and as using rather vague terms (RT for the switch of someone else's message, #followfriday for the recommendation to track other users), is mainly gratifying to experienced users, thus opening up to a wider audience, presenting users something closer to popular social networks Facebook and Google+.
In the web, users discussed this innovation through tweets on the Internet.
"It's useless, forceful, and crossword puzzles on Facebook."
Functional activity will help me to better monitor certain elements of my Twitter stream, @dannykronstrom.
Austria
Introduction to the “gold rule” of the budget
The leadership of the large coalition of Social Democrats and Christian Democrats in power in Austria decided on Tuesday to write a budget "gold rule" in the Constitution to reduce the budget deficit and thus avoid possible reductions by the rating agencies of the Austrian State credit rating (Third A).
The Chancellor of Social Democrats, Werner Faymann, personally announced the decision at the end of the ministerial meeting, while the Austrian State debt was 74.6 per cent, much higher than the upper threshold of 60 per cent established by the Maastricht Treaty, but below the State debt of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
If Austria's ability to pay fell to just one point, from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay an interest of three thousand million euros per year, the Vice-Chairman's argument and the Minister of Foreign Affairs from Christian Democrats Michael Spindelegger.
Austria thus complies with the requirement of the Eurozone summit on 26 October in Brussels; Heads of State and Government required a reduction of budget deficits by the end of 2012 and a return to balanced public accounts through a constitution or equivalent law.
The order adopted by the Austrian Government refers to the "German model", since Germany was the first European country to adopt this "rule".
By 2017, the State budget deficit should be reduced annually by 0.75 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) and, since 2017, the federal State budget deficit should not exceed 0.35 per cent of GDP per year, and the land, as do the municipalities, should be balanced budgets.
The aim is to impose a State debt on the following 60 per cent notes, signed by the Maastricht Treaty, by 2020/2021.
Essihiko Noda
Threatened by a new intervention in the foreign exchange market
Japan's Prime Minister Essihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that the Japanese authorities would make new interventions in the foreign exchange market if its value continued to grow.
We are involved, as we have done last time, if we consider that the exchange rate is excessive, Mr. Noda Senat explained.
On Tuesday, Yina grew almost to the historic note that prompted the Japanese authorities to intervene on 31 October.
That day Tokyo sold the yen for a large amount of dollars to lower the value of the Japanese currency, which has established a new record of force since 1945.
Since then, however, there has been constant growth, driven by the purchases of investors who view it as “a refuge” in these sad times of falling economies all over the world and the debt crisis in Europe.
On Tuesday, the dollar fell below 77 yen, and the euro fell below the symbolic plan in 105 yen, close to the level that caused the last intervention.
At the beginning of the financial crisis, the dollar was about 120 yen, and the euro was over 160 yen.
The increase in Japanese currency is detrimental to Japanese exports because it makes Japanese products cheaper and reduces the income of Japanese firms due to foreign exchange conversions.
“Japan is struggling to recover” after the earthquake and tsunamis on 11 March, which devastated the region of Tohoku (North-East), stressed Mr. Noda, who feared that this growth would kill a fragile family of recovery.
The third world-wide economic power has resumed growth in the third quarter -1.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter - for the first time in a year, due to increased exports and consumption of disaster-affected households
But the Prime Minister feels that the high price does not reflect the basic economic indicators of Japan.
Minister of Finance June Adzumi called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its Monetary Policy Board on Tuesday, to take all the necessary steps to weaken the Monetary Policy.
But the Deputy Managing Director of Hirohide Yamaguti warned that the Bank of Japan had already taken “the appropriate steps”, suggesting that no additional mitigation should be expected in the environment.
At the last meeting, at the end of October, the broadcasting organization increased the purchase of cash bonds by 5,000 million yen (47,000 euros) by up to 55,000 thousand yen (519 thousand euros) in the amount it allocates to purchase various financial instruments to fill the market in securities.
Eurozone
rate increases, stock exchanges fluctuate
The risk of a debt crisis undermines European indexes.
Despite the appointment of new Heads of State in Greece and Italy and the improved growth rates in France and Germany, rates in unstable countries continue to grow
Still concerned with the stability of the eurozone, the European stock exchange went into the negative zone on Tuesday, 15 November.
In Paris, at 10 a.m., CAC 40 lost 1.4 per cent and ended the auction at 3,064 points.
DAX in Frankfurt fell to 0.4% and London to 0.1%.
In view of the new difficulties in paying credit to countries in difficulty, the global stock markets continue to lose some of their recent achievements.
"The concerned investors are simply too concerned about the risk of infection," explains Terry Pratt, the institutional broker IG Markets quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange closed with a drop of 0.7 per cent under the burden of new market participants' doubts about Europe's ability to hold back the debt crisis.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has sought its views on Europe, and the stock exchange will follow each other in the corridor of severe changes until investors have confirmed that the situation has stabilized," says Micucigue Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management
This return of concern about the future eurozone is one currency that continued to fall on Tuesday.
The euro has reached its lowest mark in half a month.
At 10 a.m., the European currency was $1.3570, down by 0.4 per cent.
According to the brokers, it fell after the establishment of the Chancellor Angela Merkel HDS party on Monday, which adopted a resolution that included, inter alia, the possibility for a country in difficulty to leave the euro area without leaving the European Union together.
Italian and Spanish rates were significantly higher than 6 per cent
Credit rates in Italy and Spain remain at a high level of high concern.
This morning, on Tuesday, the income of the Italian 10-year bonds reached 6.85 per cent and the income of the Spanish bonds reached 6.2 per cent with the same settlement period.
These problems with interest rates in the southern countries, but also in France, continue to undermine the concerns of participants.
The head of the future Italian Government, Mario Monty, asked the stock exchange to restore the situation in Italy under the paralysis of its debt.
The new Prime Minister of Greece, Lucas Papadamos, confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone summit on 27 October would be his Government ' s “basic task”.
Spain was under attack before the parliamentary elections on Sunday.
A new historical ceiling was reached between the interest rates on Germany and Spain ' s 10-year debt obligations.
Expecting growth in the Eurozone
France recorded economic growth of 0.4 per cent in the third quarter, slightly better than expected 0.3 per cent, due to increased consumption of households.
Insee, however, revised to reduce the number of the second quarter by 0.1 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
Economists are most concerned about the fourth quarter.
Germany, in turn, has recorded an increase of 0.5 per cent over the same period.
The first Eurozone assessment is expected at 11 a.m., and the European Commission warns of the danger of a new recession.
Energy policy:
Facts must prevail over dogmas
If there is a subject on which a decision cannot be taken after a continuous discussion or under the influence of emotions, it is an energy policy.
The availability and value of electricity directly affect the purchasing capacity and competitiveness of companies.
It is a healthy trend that electoral meetings become a reason for thinking about the decline and the location of nuclear energy.
The scheme will not produce fruit until all the economic, social and environmental implications of the proposed options are investigated.
France should build its opinion on objective facts and on sound data.
We now have 7,000 million people on the planet, and demographic development will result in a double demand for electricity by 2050, unless the vast majority of the world ' s population is deprived of vital elements.
During the same period, it will be necessary to meet the growing shortage of fossil fuels in order to continue the production of electricity at all times, without forgetting the essential need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate imbalances, the theme that has disappeared from environmental debates.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these factors.
That is why Germany remains one in its decision to renounce nuclear energy.
This is not a case of Belgium, which makes its decision depending on the need to find a source capable of replacing nuclear energy, or Switzerland, which intends to build only the most modern reactors.
On the other hand, the United Kingdom, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, are just a few of those who are determined to continue their projects.
The United States decided, after Fukushima, to add one plant to its set by re-establishing the station, which was interrupted after an accident in Tri-Mail Island.
Although the model of Germany, based on renewable energy, is sometimes used as an example, the reality contradicts that argument.
Berlin's choice would result in an increase in electricity cost, an increase in energy dependence, increased demand for imported gas, in particular from Russia, the drop in carbon dioxide emissions from gas and coal stations.
Within a few months, all these unpleasant effects will already be felt.
The example of Denmark should be considered.
Europe's Turbine Construction Championship, from which it receives 30% of its electricity, is also the largest consumer of coal and gas due to the overheated wind; hence carbon gas emissions and electricity prices are 65% and 50% higher, respectively, than on average in Europe.
On the other hand, because of the persistence of our energy policy, our neighbours pay 40% more for electricity than French households.
Since the globalised energy price is a key factor in the competitiveness and maintenance of industrial equipment in the national territory, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
As a result, any significant reduction in nuclear energy will lead to a significant increase in the value of electricity, which will make illustrative beautiful statements about the new industrialization of our country and the protection of purchasing power.
The price that most French people refuse to pay is because they do not object to this type of energy in principle.
It should be recalled that the country ' s energy policy has made it possible to create an industry in 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 indirects.
Strongly export-oriented, it attracts a whole bunch of small and medium-sized enterprises specialized in international trade and creates many jobs that cannot be moved to another sector.
If France decided to refuse nuclear energy, it would have to spend a large number of these enterprises and lose €6,000 per year from French exports of nuclear equipment and services.
What kind of electric engineer would order EPR to work for sixty years if the closure of its manufacturer was planned?
In order to settle the equation of energy, it should be recognized that there are no divine or devilish sources of energy production.
The development of low-carbon, nuclear and renewable solutions by Areva shows the complementarity of energy sources.
For nuclear energy to maintain the highest level of security is undoubtedly a vital issue
In France, we have a security body that carries out uncompromised and transparent control of existing energy centres, such as Flamanville.
Our teams, whose professionalism is generally recognized, are filled with the same security.
For 50 years, the nuclear industry survived three major incidents.
Only one, Tri-Mail Island, occurred under normal operating conditions, but without any human or environmental consequences
In Montenegro, the reactor device and the unforgivable human error led to tragedy.
In Fukushima, some people seem to forget that the accident occurred as a result of two natural disasters of unprecedented force that led to the death of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn lessons from this accident, as it learned from the previous two.
The result of this step and the cooperation between the security bodies, operators and French and German designers, EPR, is a project to resist such phenomena.
As it is considered by all energy professionals wishing to build a reactor, the construction of it in Flamanville will be a great gift to the competitors Areva and EDF, clearing them of the way to win the leadership in the inevitable development of atomic energy.
It is necessary and lawful to seek the best combination of energy sources for our country, but it would be irresponsible to allow emotions, dogmas and biases to be overcome in a dispute that is so important to our country's economic, social and financial situation.
Immigration - a burden or good for the economy?
Immigrant policy with Nikola Sarkozy has been criticised by various parties - the overload of police, judicial and administrative services subject to digital policy and the compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status of France as the “human rights” state.
Then there was an administrative harassment of foreign students, which was released when the Minister of the Interior (Liberason of 23 May) stated that France “does not need foreign talents, stones and officers”.
But it is very rarely analysed from an economic point of view.
The right and the left agree in a lot.
On the right hand side, Jacques Shirak, who said in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed people will not be a problem in the country with 2 million foreign workers", and on the left, Michelle Rocar, who explained in 1990, that France cannot "take the poor from all over the world".
Distinction at the Giving Level only
In 2005, fear of being invaded in the country was felt both by the left and by the right by the Polish watertight.
Both sides see the burden of immigration for the French economy and for French society.
The difference is only in the degree of generosity that they may show to immigrants.
In his program, François Holland was limited by the banals, he said that "co-operation will enable us to solve our immigration problem."
This idea of immigration as a burden and a problem can give an electrical advantage, but it is very expensive economically.
As economists Ian Goldin and Jeffrey Cameron remind us of the recent book, which summarises the latest data on immigration (Special People: How Migration formed our world and will determine our future, May 2011, the publication of the University of Princeton, 352 c.), there is a broad consensus among experts on the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth, wages and employment in countries receiving immigrants.
The restriction of immigration has led to a weakening of growth and reduced employment.
The fears of immigrants are based on the assumption that they are able to replace local workers, especially low-skilled, by causing a reduction in wages.
However, experience shows that immigrants actually complement much more than local labour by carrying out work for which local labour is not sufficient.
Unskilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract local labour, and the most skilled are in dynamic sectors where training is not related to job proposals.
Positive impact on salaries
Just as it would be difficult for a surgeon to work in a country where there is a shortage of anesthesiologists, the complementarity between local and immigrant people leads to a positive impact on the wages of local workers.
The Peruvians estimated that the growth of 1% of migration flows resulted in an increase of 0.6-0.9% of real long-term wages.
And this is without taking into account the fact that the diversity of immigrants contributes to the creation of new ideas and economic growth (including the Nobel Prize winners, a large proportion of naturalised immigrants, and Google, Intel, Paypal and Yahoo - all were based on immigrants).
Migrants also benefit from a net social security system, with an average of 1 per cent of the total budgets of European countries.
According to the World Labour Organization, for example, when immigrants arrive at the age of 30 in Germany, the public budget will yield net income (low-cost income) of an average of EUR 150,000.
In the beginning of his term of office, Nikola Sarkozy was gathered to join the missing growth points.
Those teeth that were used to scare immigrants had a balanced opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, is still thinking of European democracy
Democracy is a valuable acquisition; it is also fragile.
The European continent must remember that, when it was invented in Athens more than two thousand years ago, it survived the tragedy of World War I, totalitarian regimes, Holocaust, Gulag, and Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal and Colonels in Greece.
Some believed that democracy should finally prevail over its enemies, enough to establish a vote and make it as direct as possible.
From the time of Napoleon the Little, it is known that it is from the surface of the mind.
The general vote, although it is a mandatory condition for democracy, is not a sufficient condition and can even become a "pressive tool", as former philosopher-Republican Etienne Yourro said.
No, democracy also requires many other public space, public spirit, values, organization, division and control of authorities, education, education, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The European crisis that we are experiencing is an economic crisis, but above all it is a political crisis and a crisis of democracy.
In this regard, the Palinide of the true-false Greek referendum will have a double-explanatory effect, demonstrating both the need for serious policy change and the unpleasant feeling of its impossibility and inconsistency.
This duality needs to be understood to overcome it.
The truth is that the front line of the fight for democracy has now taken place and, in the opinion of many, the Republican soldiers are now not on that side.
We do not win anything, requiring a series of national referendums organized as necessary and in a chaotic manner.
"Cart-Blanch" for an absolute European monarch or a leg-linked lunatic in the defeat of nationalism - what a choice for a citizen!
No, we do not dream about the fate of the guillotine, but about the implementation - joint, clear and continuous - of elections and democracy, at this time at the European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal, and there is no knowledge of how many more to be listed, because there is only one crisis - the crisis of Europe.
All over Europe is subject to the dictatorship of markets and rating agencies, suffering from their weakness and the lack of solidarity.
The whole of Europe is totally humiliated on an international stage.
Many are concerned about the transfer of the sovereignty of Europe, but all of Europe is gradually losing its sovereignty, and with it each nation.
The European project under popular sovereignty needs to be restored urgently.
Because only by working together will Europeans be able to reduce the debt burden of everyone, free from the markets and prepare for the future by investing in it.
The outcome of the crisis will require decisions at the European level, and they cannot be taken without full democratic legitimacy, without bringing us to disaster.
After a long discussion of this proposal by the Socialists and Jacques Delor, the European Economic Government is still required.
Let's do it.
But to represent it without a stronger economic, political and democratic integration that has taken place in the civil life is a common folly and a new stupidity.
We must start a new phase of European construction.
In order to establish a republic in France, it was necessary to "make" republics.
The revolution of interest would not be sufficient.
This lesson remains in force.
We must build Europe, one at the economic level.
This can only be done by creating a more democratic Europe at the political level, the present people's European sovereignty.
To create Europe, let us create Europeans.
Non-contact chip cards are being distributed all over the world.
The World Chip Card exhibition opens on Tuesday in Wilpent under Paris in the atmosphere of optimism.
In fact, 2011 will end with 11 per cent of the world's microprocessor sales (bank cards, SIM cards), exceeding Eurosmart's data of 6,000 million units.
The most important sector of non-contact technology that allows public transport or purchases to be paid simply by carrying out a map of the counting device.
This year, 460 million non-contact chips will be sold worldwide against 320 million years ago!
Their share will increase in 2012 (approximately 580 million units) and will account for almost 10% of the world market for chips (6,925 million cards).
Europe, which has long been leaving the Asia-Pacific region, is now moving forward in the area of non-contact payments.
About 26 million Visa bank cards are already provided with this function, and they are accepted by 75,000 terminals.
France is starting with fewer positions: there are 400,000 visa-free cards.
But big stores are increasing speed.
This year Carrefour released 2.5 million uncontacted Pass MasterCard.
In order to move at a higher speed, banks need to provide their customers with equipment.
"Two large organizations in France have promised to systematically distribute to their clients bank cards that are suitable for wireless use in the future," said Gera Nebui, Director-General of Visa Europe France.
Banks are testing payments using a mobile phone.
But it's just the first stage of the development of the future payment facility, that's the mobile phone.
While only a few equipment is equipped with NFC technology (NFC communication near the field), it is necessary to carry out such transactions.
"They were delayed.
"But they must actually fly away next year."
"We are counting on world sales of 80 to 120 million units in 2012, explains Mark Berten, Head of Eurosmart.
But banks are moving forward.
Yesterday, Crédit Agricole announced that the experiment would be conducted from December to June next year in Cana.
The iPhone equipment will provide approximately 200 customers and staff with non-contact charges.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And Société Générale also said yesterday that he was preparing a market for a proposal to allow customers to pay for their mobile phones.
The terrorist front is spread from Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the links between the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The long-standing links between the Al-Qaida terrorist group in the Muslim Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Boco Haram sect were confirmed.
On Sunday, the Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs of Algeria, Abdelkader Messahel, even stated that Algerians are now convinced of this.
“The way these two organizations use and the reports of secret services show that they are actively cooperating,” he explained, not in detail.
Paris seems to have come to similar conclusions.
A survey of the kidnapping of two French people in Niger in January revealed two related links.
The persons kidnapped at the restaurant in Niamey, near Aqmi, Antuan de Leokur and Wensan Delori, were apparently killed next day along with several of the kidnappers during the operation by the French special units.
Among the gaps that arose after the operation, French and Nigerian investigators found several telephone maps belonging to terrorists.
Here's the terror.
A number of interviewees in Mali, Nigeria, and Nigeria pointed out that there were telephone calls.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), the investigators are particularly interested in two numbers; one refers to a Nigerian who lives long in Majdiguri, a city in northern Nigeria, the Boco Haram kiln, and the other to a man, as claimed, close to Aqmi and the sect.
"This step forward, but there is no doubt more reliable evidence to be expected before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram."
"But that's possible."
“For many years, it has been known that the sect has received financial and ideal support outside and that it is becoming increasingly active,” says Kunle Amuvo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, this support has become increasingly evident by the actions and statements of Boco Haram and its methods, which now include the use of mortals and the increasingly complex explosive devices of the same type as Aqmi.
The international community in Washington, D.C., is now putting pressure on Abuja to focus on the problems that Boko Haram has created.
The case is that the Nigerian authorities have traditionally viewed this group as a community of educated people of no interest.
Rapid Success
Founded in 2002 in Maidiguri, at the mosque, at school, and with the founding of Mohammede Yusuffe, Boko Haram, which means "western education is a sin" - preaching about the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, the organization has achieved rapid success.
It has been politicized and requires strict compliance with the Shariah, and its activists have begun to fight against the dishonest central government.
It is mainly aimed at churches, bars and authorities.
In 2009, Boko Haram activists showed special activity by committing numerous attacks on police offices.
Abuji's reaction, as usual, is uncompromised.
The army blocked the city and left 800 dead.
Mohammed Joseph, taken alive, was killed in prison.
Now the sect is radicalizing and going beyond its northern vowels.
Last Christmas, she took responsibility for the action that resulted in the killing of 80 people in Jose and then another in Abuja.
In June in Abuja Boko Haram organized the first attack by the mortal on a reinforced police headquarters.
In August, the local representation of the United Nations will be their first international goal.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which is coming from Mauritania through Nigeria in Somalia, now concerns all security experts.
Today, when Aqmi was strengthened in Mali and Niger and the Somalis from al-Shabaab are operating in Kenya, Boko Haram represents a new threat to the continent.
Last week, during a discussion with President Gudlak Jonathan Allen Zuppe, he warned about the danger of Boko Haram and expressed his willingness to share all the information available.
Peace, as the Republican candidates see in the presidents
With regard to China, Iran and Israel's assistance, Mitt Romney, Herman Kane and Rick Perry compete in simplification and incompetence.
Could the weakened America crisis lead to a complex world through simple, more precise, simplified ideas?
If candidates were to be heard in the presidents of the Republic, voters could believe that.
For a few days now, Mitt Romney, Herman Kane, Rick Perry and others have been multiplying the vast but remote details of foreign policy statements that are traditionally a strong side of the Republic.
China, Iran and Israel ' s assistance are often mixed with one another.
Mitt Romney, who had the best chance of moving from the Old Good Party, threatened to complain to the Chinese in the WTO and accuse them of “manipulation of their currency” -- a sensitive theme for America, which was driven by the migration of its entire industries in Asia.
It's worse if it leads to a trade war, he said.
John Huntsman, former Ambassador Obama to China, and the only candidate who understood the difficult foreign policy, was unable to overcome the position that affected the emotions.
He called for a strong but constructive dialogue with Beijing (now Obama's position).
But Huntsman, who's holding in the bottom of the ratings, remained unheard.
Reygan style
Romania also pledged military strikes on Iran if sanctions could not stop its nuclear programme.
"If I'm selected, I'll stop Iran," he said.
"If Obama is re-elected, they will have a bomb."
He also promised to strengthen military assistance to Israel, accusing Obama of not fulfilling his commitments to this partner.
Entrepreneur Herman Kane, the second candidate in the ranking, demonstrated a dismal ignorance of the case.
He has recently called for a Chinese military threat because Beijing is trying to achieve nuclear power, obviously not knowing that China has had it since 1964!
Governor Texas Rick Perry, who is supporting Israel and seeking military strikes on Iran, said he was ready to use the American army in Mexico against drug addicts.
To avoid the torture of suspected terrorists prohibited by Obama in 2009, also recommends Cain, Perry and the candidate Michel Bachman.
This is very far from the 2008 Republican candidate, John McKayin, the toughest foreign policy.
The opponents of the current President say that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won a cold war.
They recall that Obama himself was a lover and that he had to lower his tone in combating terror.
They rightly insist on the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, at the early conclusion of the "fishers" from Iraq, his captures in Libya, which gave him the reputation of a weak policy.
But it's not that simple.
The population considered the positive balance of national security in Obama, which had eliminated Ben Laden.
After Iraq, it does not believe in military intervention that is linked to sand.
And, claiming that America needs to be reformed economically to restore its leadership, Obama's rights.
The North Stream, a new gateway to the entry of Russian gas into Europe.
The North Stream pipeline, which connects Western Europe and Russia directly at the bottom of the Baltic Sea, is launched.
It is estimated to be a gas equivalent of 30 million households.
Gasprom, a Russian giant gas producer, wanted to clear this event with a pump.
More than 500 guests, including four heads of State and Government, participated in last Tuesday on the Baltic coast, between the speech of the orchestra and the search for snacks, in the opening of the North Stream, a new pipeline that connects Russia and Germany directly to the water.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister Francis Fion and his Dutch colleague, Mart Routte together returned a symbolic valve controlling the flow of Russian gas to the Western European network.
Under the new pipeline, 27.5 billion additional cubic metres of gas will be flown every year to Western Europe for the first pipeline of 1,224 km, which connects the Leningrad region with the countries of Mecklenburg-Pomerian.
The second pipeline must be ready at the end of 2012, providing a total of 55,000 cubic metres of gas equivalent to all France's consumption.
The possibility of building a third pipeline in the same direction is already being discussed.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this huge project is a victory.
The project has met with fierce opposition from Poland and the Baltic States.
The North Stream will indeed allow gas to be delivered directly to Germany, avoiding transit through a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
These two countries are losing part of their power: they will be more difficult to influence Russia, threatening to close access to Western European markets.
At the most tense moment of Warsaw's debate, the North Stream did not stop in comparison with the new German-Soviet Pact, which sought to establish an alliance between Hitler and Stalin with a view to occupying Poland in 1939.
This means that the issue is politically sensitive.
In support of this Russian project, Western Europe is seeking greater security of supply.
But the price of energy deprivation in Europe is because the project has created a gap between Eastern and Western Europe.
Russia has been able to achieve its understanding of the direct union between Russia and the rich Western countries that consume large amounts of gas and whose own stocks are already on the rise for less than five years.
"This gas pipeline is part of cooperation with Russia, it is a new artery that connects us organically," said François Fion, opening the gas pipeline, demonstrating to what extent large gas contracts are important and politically and economically.
All of this explains the broad smiles on the faces of Gazprom heads, who were present in large quantities in Lulmin, the gas arrival paragraph.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also a technical milestone.
The underwater pipeline is made of concrete-locked steel to protect it from the anchors of the ship.
It lies at the bottom of the sea, at the middle depth of 200 meters.
In order to build it, it had to be surrounded by mine fields remaining in World War II.
"A hundred had to be removed or destroyed as a precaution," said Jens Muller, the press secretary of the North Stream.
It was also necessary to take many steps to protect fauna and flora.
The pipeline is a long metal snake with a weight equal to the weight of 242 Eiffel Basins, without breaking all over its length, without valves and without service stations.
The control platform was planned in the region of Sweden, but the project managers refused it, because Sweden was not in the rush of the Russian public company to live on its shores forever.
"In the event of an accident, we'll cross the gas stream less than a minute," says Jens Mueller.
So in the event of a gas leak in the gas pipeline, it will go into the air.
But this seems to be unlikely designers who designed wires, which are estimated to be only 100 000 years old.
Control of the state of the gas pipeline will be carried out by a submarine carrying the ship for external observation, as well as by an apparatus circulating inside the gas pipeline.
A cigarette-shaped device is inserted within a 1 meter diameter tube and is pushed forward by a gas flow.
Upon arrival after 3 full days of travel at a speed of 3 metres per second, it provides accurate information on any deformation of the metal.
The gas pipeline was designed for work for 50 years without the need for minor repairs.
Gas circulation is carried out only by pressure.
It consists of 200 bars at departure and 100 bars at arrival.
Five companies have pooled efforts to implement the project.
The leader remains Gazprom, which owns 51 per cent of the capital.
The others are the German companies E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), the Netherlands Gasunie and the French Group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies created a joint venture called the North Flood, which was commissioned to build and operate the gas pipeline.
His headquarters is located in Zug, Switzerland, where taxes are particularly favourable.
Gazprom then leased this company for twenty years with the possibility of extending the total amount of gas transport.
"Gazprom will pay for the full amount, no matter what amount of gas will actually be transported," said Jens Mueller.
Funding for gas pipeline construction was provided by 30% of shareholders and by 70% of bank loans.
The total cost of work is €7.4 billion for two pipelines.
GDF Suez will invest about 240 million.
But mining shareholders are confident that they will buy their own costs, because Gazprom takes all the risks.
The gas pipeline comes from the Baltic Sea to Lübmine on a sandy shore surrounded by pine trees.
The valves are 4.5 meters high and form the exhaust terminal.
The sensors measure the pressure, temperature and specific characteristics of the gas before switching it to German gas pipelines.
Last Tuesday, the terminal receives one million cubic metres of gas every hour.
It will be 3 million hours in full power, and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine branding note
Moleskine, created by Italian company 15 years ago, will taste the letter again.
It has the aroma of adventures, the hours performed in the light of the light.
The Moleskine block is easy to find on the direct black cover, on the cut, on the yellow-white pages, as if they wanted with time.
However, the Moleskine book, as we know it today, was born in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, located in Milan, decided to start selling design blocks.
Maria Sebregondi, a company consultant at the time, took responsibility for launching a new product.
The block is inspired by an old production technique, a molecular-locked boy cotton fabric, used for example to cover makeup.
It is claimed that this type of blocknote is highly appreciated by writers and travelers.
"Moleskine has brought into line with today's taste the old and forgotten thing that was cultural for avant-garde artists until the 20th century," said Maria Sebregondi, who has since become the dominant brand in Mode Mode.
Good luck.
From 2006 to 2010, sales increased by 25 per cent and reached 12.7 million.
We were far from producing the first few years when all 3,000 blocknotes were produced.
Moleskine crossed the borders of Italy and was exported to 70 countries from France to the United States.
It is difficult to establish a typical buyer's profile because the blocknote is equally attractive to businessmen, students and people of a free profession.
The buyers of Moleskine are cosmopolitan, have wide views and are educated.
The small Italian company, which initially had only 12 staff, now has 100 and two offices: one in Milan and the other in New York.
It distributes its notes in Fnac bookstores, shops in small towns and has been able to acquire a wide range of knowledge.
"We followed the spirit of time and this new need in writing, despite the emergence of an e-mail," explains Maria Sebregondi.
This characteristic cultural pattern is accompanied by the development of Moleskine; the brand recently organized the “Environment Road” exhibition, where architects and artists demonstrated their own blocks.
In August, he also launched a Leopard drawing on the case of a film festival in Locarno.
With its success and cultural aura, Moleskine has varied its products, which now include bags, gloves, computer bags. Brand includes all types of support.
The success that has been born to depend on: In autumn 2006, Modo Modo was purchased by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, now Syntegra Capital, which has entered a new page in Moleskine's history.
Why is the unemployment rate among disabled workers so high?
About 19% of people with disabilities are looking for work.
The 15th week of employment of persons with disabilities begins today.
Despite the public welfare policy launched in 2005, the unemployment rate among persons with disabilities is still twice as high as the average, which is 19 per cent versus 9 per cent for the population as a whole.
It's refreshing?
“No,” stressed Eric Blanche, Director General Adapt, “an organization that organizes a week of employment for persons with disabilities”.
"In 15 years, significant progress has been made."
"At the time, the unemployment rate was not 2, but 3 times more."
"It's still a lot of work to do."
It must be said that many more obstacles to employment are still available for disabled people.
Among them are older: 37% older than 50 years (17% on average).
They have a lower level of qualifications: 80 per cent do not have a baccalaureate rate, and of the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 people with disabilities.
Finally, long-term unemployment is very widespread, which is 85 per cent for persons with disabilities, compared to 38 per cent on average.
In short, all of these are criteria that make it very difficult to return to work and which are the essence of the problem," says Kristian Grapen, Director-General Tremplin, an association established in 1992 to help companies hire disabled workers.
Here are some of the obstacles.
There is no need to talk about mentality that changes, but too slowly.
The study conducted in April by the IMS-Entreprenere on the order of Cité showed that the managers in question had a low level of knowledge of disability and “representing themselves to a poor person in a wheelchair or mentally or mentally inadequate”.
The result is that private companies with more than 20 employees are still far from the target of 6 per cent of persons with disabilities, as set out in the Act adopted in 1987.
The last known figures for 2008 amount to 2.6%.
"Today we are about 3%," says Pierre Blanc, Director General Agefiph, an organization responsible for collecting taxes from companies that do not comply with this law.
Evidence: The number of “discounted” organizations, as well as the amounts paid, has decreased from 59 000 to 46,000 organizations in 2007-2011 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 Law, which raised taxes, created a strong pressure on the company," explains Pierre Blanc.
"But this improvement also reflects increased awareness, in particular in large enterprises."
According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59 per cent of workers from 20 to 49 have workers with disabilities compared to 82 per cent of workers from 100 to 199.
Azar: "What happiness."
Before meeting with Sini on Tuesday (20.45) Eden Azar and George Leekens did not hide the pleasure they had received from this friendly match.
We won't come until we claim that there was a secret conversation between them, but the picture is symbolic.
Sitting near the stadium of Stade de France, George Leekens and Eden Azar were at peace.
Five months later, a Belgian coach can only commend his attacker in a match against Turkey.
"I am very pleased with Eden, his progress and the fact that he is Belgian."
"I want to go on," said Lilla.
The contrast between his achievements in the club and the assembly is one thing, he's justifying.
"I'm in Lille for a year, and there's no Belgium."
"I have to earn my eyes."
Left in the stock, in front of this match with France, in the game against Romania on Friday night, Azar came to St. Dani to finally "blizzard".
Not forgetting, however, the concept of pleasure.
He supported the Blues from the age of 7 and the winning campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
"I always supported them, he confirms.
That, of course, also enhances the particular character of the match.
Especially on the other side are Mother (Debhushi), Johan (Caba) and Adil (Rami)," he recalls.
"Our paths just crossed."
"To be able to play against them is pure happiness!"
Leekens kindly remembered the "gloriousness".
"Glorious" to play in a party match.
"Gloriousness" is also claimed as a "neighbor", that France "has again become a very high-level team" all year after the trauma in Nyzne.
"Loran Blanc was like a thunderstorm, he's admired.
Now that Belgium misses the next Euro, a technical sportsman will fly on a blue-headed plane... in Brazil in 2014.
"Our little Belgians are growing," he stressed.
"We're building something, games are ambitious, they're hungry."
"You will be convinced of this in future matches, including this against France."
Portugal is very confident of itself
Portugal begins its response match against Bosnia (22:00) on Tuesday in Lisbon with great optimism.
On the way to him, both teams seemed to have lost their sense of reality.
"At the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, most importantly, a happy country."
Paul Benthu is already seeing himself in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no doubt that the Assembly, in its role since September 2010, is qualified as Euro 2012.
Portuguese in 90 minutes of happiness.
But there is a match to be played, and Bosnia to be won.
In view of the 0-0 on Friday in the Hell of the Zenica, it is clear that the game is not over.
Although Portugal had dominated the match for more than an hour, it was unable to reach the goal that would have calmed her down.
"It's a good result, but it's a risk."
But at its brightly lit de la Lus stadium in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that they will pass, in the eyes of the audience that should be in the dawn, although the match will be very tense," said optimistically, but decisive Bent.
"We expect a very tense match, but we are convinced that we can win," said a 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have 50 per cent chance of Euro 2012," Deputy Carlos Cairo said.
Nothing on Friday in a match against Bosnia requires the Portuguese to win.
No one could set up Bosnians.
"It's a good result, but there's some risk, and Benta regrets it.
"We will play against a team with a lot of technical skills and a lot of individual skills," he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese are going to put maximum pressure on Bosnians from the very beginning, "don't give them time to think."
A good idea, only this time would be realistic.
