Welsh AM doesn't worry about 'seeing like mattes'
Some AMs are confident that they will change their title to MWP.
This has resulted in the change in the name of the Assembly and in the plans to make the Welsh Parliament.
The AM is concerned that this change will not come about by the various political parties.
A male AM said that their group is worried about the title "Twp and Pwp seem."
For external readers of Wales: In Wales, twp means foolish and pwp means fine.
A Play AM said that the whole group is "slow" and suggested options.
A Welsh Conservative said that his group had a "free mind" in its name, but MWP said that Mapet was a brief literal persecution.
In this regard, the expression “Jorkshire English u ” is similar to the original.
The Assembly Commission, which is now drafting legislation, said: "The final decision on what to name the Assembly members will depend on the members. "
Wells government has authorized the Welsh Assembly to change its name by law 2017.
In June, the Commission published the public advice on these proposals, which showed that the Assembly had extensive support for the designation of a Welsh Parliament.
With regard to the title of AM, the Commission has shown no suitability for the Welsh Parliament member or WMP, but the MWP option has received the most support in terms of public advice.
AMs, alternative options are suggested, but the struggle to achieve logic can be a challenge for the late officer, Elin Jones, who is required to present the bill of change in a few weeks.
This law will include other changes in the organization's working methods, including the rules on AMs' incompatibility and committee structure.
When AM discusss this law, they will take the final view of what name they should refer to.
Macedonians will stand up to change the name of the country
They will discuss whether the Republic of North Macedonia should be replaced by the name of their country.
It is widely used in the area of Macedonia, with the aim of freeing many decades of tantrums with neighboring Greece.
Athens has long demanded that its neighbour's name in the north is like representing their country and that members of the EU and NATO continue to try to give it to him.
They have said that we should ignore the idea of being president of Macedonia, George Ivanov, who is an opponent of the name of the government.
However, including President Zoran Zavev, public supporters claim that the name change is only a price to be included in the EU and NATO.
St. Martin’s watch at the church in Harlem calmed down
"In the historical view, the old people I spoke to were on each corner once and for all," said Mr. Adams.
"Today, none of this."
They said that it was as if they were invisible.
"People come together in different ways," they say today.
"Bars don't live next door in living rooms where people go regularly."
In the case of the church, they are concerned that the money from the sale of property is not expected to remain as long as it remains, "and soon or in time they will return to the beginning."
They also said that there could be an apartment building in the place of the church, where people who do not support neighboring refuges would be able to fill the commodiniums.
"The majority of those who buy condominiums in these buildings will be fat," they said, "and that's why it's too soon to stop this church because the majority who come to the cominium cannot be a member of this church."
In 1870, after a decade of St. Martin’s, both churches were built by groups of Gora people before the Great City - Harlem was established.
The group of the original Gora Methodists emerged in 1930.
This building was owned by a group of close - knit group of people who were praying.
The team of writers, Rav. John Howard, took over St. Martin’s leadership, who had headed the 125th Street secretion, was the main shopping mall in Harlem, and they had opposed the work of the worksmen or the pedon.
The building was damaged by a fire in 1939, but the parishioners of Fader Johnson planned to rebuild it, and Carolon began to study the Bible with Jehovah’s Witnesses.
Rave, David Johnson's son, Fader Johnson's son, and Saint Martin's heir, proudly named Carolon as "the hour of the poor."
In July, Carolon's theory of selling this Carolon also referred to him as "a cultural treasure" and "a wonderful historical treatise."
This scholar, Tiffany Ng, of the Michigan University, also pointed out that Dionysius A. Lind, was the first Carolon in the world to be sold into the larger Carolon church 18 years ago.
Mr. Mary Werner said that St. Martinny did not change them.
In the last few months, what happened in St. Martins was a story of the architects and the contrites, who brought some to the church’s attention, and others brought Episcopal Diocese.
The Westry – the Parish governing body, the general leaders – expressed concern when they wrote Diosis in July that this diosis would try to provide "Bad of Hurricane" to the West, although the architects and contractors sent by Diosis were not involved in the work of Westry.
In fact, many of those who have lost sight of the Bible’s moral standards have found that it is not always easy to follow the Bible’s advice.
In California, a 13 - year - old son was injured by a Lobster driver.
The officials said that on the first day of Lobster's strike, a 13-year-old boy was injured by a cancer attack on Lobster's body.
The attack took place at the Bikinsi border at 7 a.m.
Chad Hamel told the KSWB-TV in San Diego that on Saturday morning, they had heard a boy crying for help, and they came to him with a group and helped him get out of the water.
Hamlin said that first they thought she was in the lobby, but then they said, "He was shouting, he's taking my knife!
He's got me!'
“ I felt as if I had never seen a baby before, ” he says.
"I called everyone out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!' said Hamlini.
The boy was taken to the Red Children Hospital in San Diego, where he was told that his nature was serious.
The people who were responsible for the attack were not able to understand the reason for the attack.
Lifeguard Captain Larry Gilles reported in a newspaper that the shark had been in the area a few weeks ago, but it was determined not to be a dangerous species.
“ I’m sorry, ” he said, “that’s what I’m doing, but I’m not sure if I’m going to be able to do that. ”
The officers closed the entrance to the sea of Asinath, between the passages of Casablade and the border, between 48 hours in search and safety.
Galsini pointed out that there are more than 135 people in the area, but most of them are not dangerous.
The UK Beautiful Tools Marketplace is a sensory device designed to fit into the market
The Sansbury Department of Storage-style Boots provides support to boot, superdrive, and Debanhams by appointing assistants.
The UK's £2.8bn beauty tool market share is increasing continuously as the fashion and homeware sales declines, while the larger ticket will be tested in 11 stores across the country, and if it succeeds, more stores will be taken in the next year.
At the same time, the search for supermarkets leads to the discovery of the beauty of the silk space used by television, microwaves, and homeware.
Censorships, such as Ravelon, Esc, Twisrman, and Dr.
The current ranges of L'Oreal, Maybellline and Burt's Bees will also have more space in branded areas in shops like bootes.
This supermarket is also relaunching its boutique makeup range so that the majority of products are suitable for schoolchildren – a growing demand from young buyers.
Jakariz, Perfume Riteller Fragrances Shop Two Sensbury Stores, was opened in South London in the first week, and the second year after, Celie Oak, Birmingham, will be opening.
Online purchases and local supplies in stores require a lot of people to attract us to buy some food every day.
Censorship Chief Exhibitive, Mike Kup, said that these sales centers seem to be increasing at the same time as supermarkets China Alti and Lidl disarmers are trying to cope with more services and non-food.
In Sansbury’s hundreds of stores, Argos outlets have been building and they have also started many Habits since they bought these two years ago, which they believe have been more beneficial in raising Chinese sales.
It was not easy to change the size of its box and the size of its farm distributions.
In 2000, Sansbury examined a joint venture with bots, but this split into what it was promised to do from the Kimist store of its supermarkets.
This new security sensory system has existed after the owners of the Lloyds Farmsi Chen had sold £125m three years ago.
They said that in four stores there would be a role to play in the La Rosshe-Possium and a full-scale Lacery Skinker Brands project.
Paul Mills-Hex, Censorship, Business Manager, says: "We have changed the shape of our bets so that the environment for our customers will grow.
We've also been involved with highly trained employees who are quick to give advice.
Our brand range has been created in every way, and because of the attractive environment and the soybeans, we are attractive places that challenge the old purchasing method."
After Holly Willoby returned from the £11 million contract, Peter Jones 'crashed'
With Marks and Spencer and ITV, Willoby lost £11 million with his life-style brand business to focus on his new clients and to focus his life-style brand business with his dragons Dan Star Peter Jones.
Willoby doesn't have time for his homeware and X-ray brand True.
This is compared to the secret of the planetary board in Guyana.
This morning’s printery, 37, told us that we were leaving.
Holly Willoby has left his commercial lifestyle brand business for the last time and broke down the Dragons Den Star Peter Jones – and has focused on his new grand adventures with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
According to Sutra Jones, when Marlo, the popular girl on the TV, at his office in Buckinghamshire, admitted to a tense meeting that her new dials -- £1.5 million -- that is, she is no longer time enough to pay attention to her homeware and X-Xesseries brand True.
This business is compared to the secret bridge of the planet in Guyana, which is estimated to be £11 million twice.
Willobey, 37, announced that as soon as we got out of True from the Introgram, the Zet moved out of Jones Britain and went to his home.
One source said: “Truly was at the top of the list of favorites today.
It would be a long - term future that would have made it successful for the next two decades.
Her decision to go out was a surprise to everyone.
And no man putteth faith in the things which are done; so much the more do we know that they are done.
There's a newspaper full of stuff in Marlo's headquarters that's ready to sell."
According to scientists, one of Britain’s most trusted stars is that getting out of the meat morning, from coussions to blankets, and from clothing to homeware would damage the farm’s attention, and its start may be longer.
And this can be the end of a long - term friendship.
The mother of three children, Willobi, and Dan Baldwin, had been close to Jones and his wife, Starra Cap, for ten years.
With Willoby Cap and Jones in 2016, True was established and 52 - year - old Jones was appointed as president in March.
The dunes are combined to form 40 percent of the farm’s production of Baldwin’s TV.
Willoby M&S will become a brand ambassador and will be replaced by Ant McPartlin as the host of ITV's IHM A Celebrates.
A close source of Jones said in the evening, "We won't talk about these business events."
A lot of conversation took place, and then we fell in love.
According to some, he referred to the "uncertainty" of the president and to the fact that he was so positive about the media.
Why has the Governing Body abandoned so much?
Tramp told us in his design "New Anchor" style.
"I didn't give up anything."
He noted that in June, as a major step towards the disarmament of North Korea, the tramp was willing to take a second session after the initial meeting in Singapore.
However, unarmed divisions have been established.
After a meeting in Singapore three months after the summit in June, North Korea's highest president, Rie Yong, told the world leaders of the United Nations. In the general meeting, world leaders told Saturday that North Korea's quick-defence measures do not seem to come from the United States as a "response" in North Korea.
Instead, they pointed out that the U.S. government has imposed a ban on the use of blood transfusions.
Tramp expressed a more hopeful view in his meeting talk.
"Our relationship with North Korea has been very good," they said.
"We're going to fight North Korea.
In the first century C.E., the apostle Paul wrote: “Let us consider one another to incite to love and fine works, not forsaking the gathering of ourselves together, as some have the custom, but encouraging one another, and all the more so as you behold the day drawing near. ”
Now we've created this magnificent baby."
Our efforts to improve relationships with Kim have been successful — the rockets have stopped, the relief of the olies is being helped, and the rest of the U.S. workers are coming home.
And they supported their unusual approach to speaking with Kim.
"It's very easy to be president, but instead of trying to get 10,000 people in this ring, it's better to be 200 people here," said Trump to the ring that stood in front of us.
Indonesia’s tsunami and earthquake devastated one island, hundreds of people dying
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreigners were told not to need volunteers.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok’s population has been displaced, no national disaster has been reported, which is a precedent for international aid.
"In some cases, unfortunately, we don't ask for international help, so it's difficult," said Mrs. Sombong.
Sev is preparing an organization to go to the Children's Palace, but it's not clear if foreign workers can work in a clear place.
The National Disaster Organisation's speakers, Mr. Suttopo, said that foreign organizations could be allowed to contribute to the relief work so that Indonesian officials are studying the situation in Palu.
In Indonesia, the country has a very low capacity for natural disasters.
Although tsunamis have been built in Asa, they are not easily located on the other side of the border.
Although a warning has been given before, a tsunami in Palu is likely to have occurred because of a tsunami.
In good times it is difficult to travel through many of the islands of Indonesia.
Natural disasters make it more challenging to help people to cope with problems.
A patient who is on board to treat earthquakes in Lombok is on board the ship, but he will need at least three days to get to a new place of distress.
The president, Joko Widodo, had put the issue of improving the construction facilities in Indonesia, and they have spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
However, in the financial sector, the mismanagement of Mr. Joko’s administration has been disrupted, and the next year they face again a challenge.
In front of Mr. Joko, there is also a pressure on the vast ethnic tensions in Indonesia, which has led many Muslim members to choose a more difficult path.
The Christians and the Muslim tribes killed more than 1,000 people, using knives, arrows, and other civilian weapons, and moving thousands of people from their homes to their homes.
Consider: Daniel Strage of Liverpool faced Celsia in a similar way
Daniel Strich, who lives in Stamford Bridge, London, received a stroke of 89 minutes on Saturday and saved the Liverpool from the defeat of the Prime Minister of Chelsea.
While the strike team was on the back of a -1-0, it found him one next to the Chelsea ball 30 yards outside of Sheridan Shakiri.
He grabbed his left hand and then took a shot to the remote post office.
He tried to lift the box, and he went up to the top of the net on the right.
And the passage of the ship over unto Arizabalah was by the side of the ship: and it fell on the net.
"He was just trying to go to that position, go to the ball and always play for a piano, and I tried to take as much time as possible to myself," the strikers told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kent coming and touched him once and didn't think much about it and just shot him."
After receiving a quality in 25 minutes from the Belgian Star Eden Hasgard, Chelsea was on a 1-0 strike.
At that time, the blue striker returned to Matio Kuuchich, then took it to Midfield, and ran to the port of Liverpool.
Kwachichichi made a quick run-and-run on Midfield.
Then he shot a beautiful piece, and he went to the boxing room.
He had to wait until he was released from prison. He was sentenced to four years in prison. He was sentenced to six years in prison.
On Wednesday afternoon, at the Battle of Liverpool, a group of champions will be at the stadium San Paulo, in Naples, Italy.

On Sunday morning, the country’s disaster relief agency announced that Indonesia’s earthquakes and tsunamis have increased by 832.
According to a report by Sutopo Pavro Nugroho, the company's 20 - foot - high - foot - high - walled buildings have been under pressure.

After the death of a woman, the police have arrested a 32 - year - old man from the world
After a woman’s death in the morning, Barconheed, Mercesid, has been examined.
A 32 - year - old man has been arrested from the scene of the death of this 44 - year - old woman on John Street at 7.55 in the morning.
The police have urged that if they have seen or heard anything in the area, they should continue to do so.
Detective Inspector Brian O Hegan said, 'This check is in initial condition, but I'm calling on anyone in the John Street area to contact us if they've seen or suspected.
I'm going to call anyone, especially the taxi drivers, who've been pushing anything on the desk, to contact us because they can have the necessary information for our investigation.'
A police officer confirmed that the woman who was murdered was a Berkenhede resident and found her dead inside a building.
This woman’s friends, whom we know, came to the scene this afternoon and asked where she was found this morning.
In fact, the Bible says: “The eyes of Jehovah are roving about through all the earth to show his strength in behalf of those whose heart is complete toward him. ”
A taxi driver who lives in Graz was trying to get into his fleet, but the police told him that no one was allowed to go to or from this building.
When he realized what had happened, he was shocked.
The people were told that they would be allowed to return to the building for several hours.
Now a police officer was told that the whole area had been identified as a crime scene.
One woman came to the scene, weeping.
She used to say, "This is too bad."
At 2: 00 a.m., two police vans were inside the envelope and the other van was outside.
Many officials were standing inside and overseeing the fleet’s blocks.
If anyone has any information, they should contact the DM @MerPolCC or call 101 or contact the Crimestoppersna on behalf of 0800 555 111 on 30 September 247.
The novel of Cromwell in Constituent is the re-recorded memory of the dispute.
If he removes it, it will be as if he were a criminal justice, because his false religious followers have destroyed many of England’s cultural and religious arts.
But the Cromwell Society has said that Mr. Creek's report is "foolishness" and "an attempt to rewrite history."
The president of the Cromwell Society, John Goldsmith, said: "It was strange that the image of Oliver Cromwell on the outside of the Pales of Westminster would be killed by the current dispute about the removal of the mines.
This glorious Cromwell of the English - speaking war did not say that it was not done.
In the first century C.E., the apostle Paul wrote: “In the last days critical times hard to deal with will be here. ”
Sir William Hamo Thornicroft's great description of Cromwell is evidence of the opinion of the 19th century and is part of the historical article that many people still believe in.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sande Telegraph: "Some people believe that, perhaps in the north of the 19th century today, Cromwell, in comparison with the external pressure, was the author of the controversy, namely the kingdom.
This description has always been the subject of historical debate.
One thing is that in the middle of the 17th century, the conflict has shaped the development of its own country, and Cromwell is a personally recognizable person representing one side of the valley.
His work as a Lord projector is also refreshing and memorable."
The Chinese farmer was killed by a blacksmith.
In a market in the nineties in China, a doctor has reportedly attacked a farmer and killed him locally.
The man's arrest was known to be "Yuan," and he found himself in a state of death in broken blood, reports South China Morning Post on Sunday at the Leupansui market in the country of Guinea.
On May 30, 2005, in China’s Kingdom Hall, a farmer was preparing a meal in a hole in a hole in a hole in a hole in a hole.
It was said that he had come from Greece to sell 15 daughters in the market with his influence.
The next morning, his older brother found himself in a state of death, and he found that the door of the locker was open.
He told me that a large snake was bleeding from the mouth, and he told me that he was bleeding from the mouth.
The Forensic Test confirmed that the 550 - foot - high [550 - foot] diver had been killed by the farmer.
"My older brother's feet were bloody and confused," said the other brothers, whose ban was, "Yes," by Guyang Ivaning News.
According to Sikurita Camera Photo, Yuan went to the market at 4:40 p.m. to feed his pigs.
One hour later, he found his dead body.
He was not the owner of a cobra or of his uncle’s brother.
A market manager told Ivining News that he had been imprisoned for not attacking anyone, and the police are collecting evidence from the scene.
Greek family and market officials are arguing over how to pay for his death.
Though this may be the case, there have been cases of oppression before the time.
In 2016, a doctor in Massachusetts attacked a woman and her husband, and the man was seriously injured.
Ten years ago, a 650 - pound (650 - foot) dairy boy had put a Welsh farmer on his tractor, and his wife had finally taken him away.
In 2012, after eating a farmer in Oregon, a farmer in Menitoba told CBC News that the pigs are not usually attackers, but the blood can be "extended".
"They're just playing.
They're rare, they're very resourceful... they don't hurt you.
You only have to respect them to that extent," they said.

We are convinced that this is not the case by giving a very emotional witness to Kevin.
On Friday, 20.4 million people were able to see this testimony.
This company's total number of viewers is higher than CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News channel and MSNBC.
The other networks that showed this program, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Networks, could not easily be accessed.

After the hearing, the excitement reached Pigeon.
On Friday’s dance, Flock was the center of attraction.
On the side of Keveno, after the Central Republican Office issued an application that we would consider, they were urged by the CNN and CBS cameras in the Friday morning to respond to the panel.
And they lifted up their eyes for a few minutes, and stood up, and raised their eyes upon the CNN.
"I'm standing right here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do we think that this country is telling the truth?
They said to him, "You have power over all this woman, and you have authority over her."
Flick explained that his office had made an application and that before the elevator was closed, he said that he wanted to tell us more about the committee’s response.
When the chief committee was to be consulted to send the code of names to the whole synnetate, cable and broadcast networkers did all in the process many hours later.
But Flake said that we only do this on the basis of the FBI's understanding of the charges that the FBI has filed in the following week.
As a result of discussions with his Mike, the Democratic Senator Chris Küns, the flake was partially convinced.
After a long conversation with Kuns and several seniors, Flocki made his decision.
Flock’s choice was strong, for it was clear that the Republicans would not agree with the banning of Kevenol.
President Trump has launched an investigation by the FBI of allegations against Kevino.

Despite a brief victory in the presidential elections last December, the Catalan freedom supporters have struggled to keep their pace this year and many of their popular leaders have taken on board their own recognition or the public's organisation and then wait for their role in the declaration of freedom to be challenged.
John Pige, a 42 - year - old mechanic, told himself that political parties on both sides supported this conflict by calling for police support.
"This struggle is getting more tense," they said.
On Saturday, the end of last year, New Catalan leaders in the former prison, Oriol Jenkeras, announced that we would fight European secular elections next year.
"It's the best way for people to stand up as a candidate for European elections to prevent the harassment of the people and the Spanish government."
London: After driving home, men were arrested
Three men, 33, 34 and 39 years of age, were arrested for taking a car into a house in London.
This event took place in the Ballinagrad Criscent, about 19:30 BST.
The branch office of Jehovah’s Witnesses in New York and in New York, U.S.A., said: “I have been able to help people to learn the truth about God and his purposes. ”
At the same time, a crossbow may have been thrown into the car for a while.
In the fall, Livingstone won a 1-0 victory over Rangers.
The first round of Dolly Omega for Livingstone was won
Steven Gerard, who was the manager of the Ibrax Club, surprised Rangers to make his second victory in 18 games.
Dolly was devastated by the attack, and Gary Holt’s association with the rest of the world was in a similar situation.
Gerhard’s team won the prize, and the following Sunday, they will meet with the Hearts behind eight qualities.
Soon, the Guru will fight with Rangers Rapid Winna in the European League.
Meanwhile, Livingstone, in the six - meeting districts, their teacher, Holt, has not seen a victory since he left Kenya’s Mailer.
Livingstone took the opportunity to oppose the Bott Party
The Holt Association wanted to take a long time off because their true maria had completely destroyed the Rangers.
Scott Robinson went to the crossroads but ran in front of the ball, and then he was able to expand his efforts only after he moved Craig Holket's head into the ball.
The host found out that they could trouble the host, so they agreed to let Rangers play the game.
In time, he became a regular pioneer, a regular pioneer, and a regular pioneer.
Rangersani gave a free shot and found Livingstone free. Deklan Garager and Robinson's couple accompanied her, took her to the window and rolled her in the middle of the box.
By then, Rangers had maintained their position, but they had not suffered much from the influence of the opposition, and they had not been affected by the influence of the opposition.
The same pattern would remain in the second half, and Alfredo Morelas had to be protected.
Rangers’s golf course, along with the foot of Allon Magegagor, took up Scott Pittman and sent a further distance from Lithogon to Livingstone.
Crosses continued to appear in the Livingston box, and they were constantly removed, so to speak, two pellets — the challenge that had been put to Glen Middleton, and one was left for Hedbal.
'Last' by Livingstone - Analysis
BBC Scotland's alsdeir Lementor Toni Macronny Erina
A powerful game and a draw for Livingstone.
The men, they played very well, worked more than expected toward this progress.
Their style and play have never changed since they were released from high ground, but after their arrival, they needed to give him the greatest credit for the way he shaped the band.
He had many hives.
The captain of the guard, who was the leader of a well - designed defense force, was the captain of the army, who kept his watch on Ur Goldson, and who was the one who was the one who took the lead in the war.
However, Rangers ’ motivation was reduced.
They were under Gerard’s leadership, as much as they were under their position.
Their final game was inconceivable — only once they broke the local association — as a warning for the Rangers in the Central Bank.
A convention was held in Cologne, Ardogan
On Saturday (September 29th), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met together to celebrate the festival in Berlin, they were delighted.
This is the last day of the German War of President Ardogan, which is intended to improve the relationship between NATO and its friends.
They argued about human rights, the freedom of the media, and Turkey’s membership in the EU.
Then, in order to open a huge new building, Ardogan went to Cologne.
The city has the largest number of Turkish people outside Turkey.
The police told him that the 25,000 people were not allowed to be held in front of the mosque, but that many of the supporters had gathered near to see their officers.
Hundreds — many of them Kurds — also heard their voices, protesting the threats of Ardogan and the German government to welcome their country.
Some German Turks, Hiroshima, and those who were expelled as governors, were represented by a split picture of these two visions.
Depford Road accident: crashing with a car and killing a bicycle
In London, a car broke down and a bicycle was killed.
In this accident, a busy road from Deepford, along with the bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, in the city's fire department, was estimated at 10:15 BST.
The driver stopped, and the paramedics helped, but the bicycle died at the scene.
This is the second month after the death of a bicycle on the Children’s Street, a small distance from the accident on Saturday.
The Metropolis Police said that they are responsible for identifying the dead and for communicating with their relatives.
The roads have been closed, the bus routes have been changed, and the driver has been advised to avoid the part.
Lang Larten Prison: Six officers injured in a riot
After being thrown into a very safe prison, six prison officials were injured, reports the prison office.
On Sunday 09:30 BST sound started in HMP Lang Martin and it's beginning.
The experts have been called "Tornado" officials, eight prisoners are involved in the fight and it is limited to a riot.
And they were wounded on the face of the chief priests, and were healed.
One prison service director said: "The special trained prison personnel are being designed to deal with this incident in the HMP Lang Lartin.
Six workers were treated for injuries.
We won't be put in prison for violence, but we will send those who are in charge of the police, and they will have to be put in prison for a long time."
HMP Lang Lartin has more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous charges in the country.
In June, a prisoner was told that the governor of the prison had to be treated in a hospital.
And last October, there were violent authorities indicted to handle the heavy dunes, in which the workers were attacked by the police.
With the Rosa cycle, Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City is suddenly at an early risk (probably to the poor)
The tropical low pressure is not easy for Arizona to land, but the next week, the Russian cyclist will be able to travel to the desert with his remaining power, and that is precisely what it is possible to do.
The National Weather Service has just provided information on the south and east of Arizona, South and East Nevada, Fire California and Utah, Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Solt Lake City, in the past.
On Monday morning, Ross Phoenix is expected to head straight, and on Monday, it will be raining.
The Finnish National Weather Service said in a tweet that only "from the 200-mile radius of Phoenix since 1950 has only ten tropical cyclists held their status or reduced pressure!
Katrina (1967) was 40 miles from the Arizona border."
According to the National Cycling Center's fresh estimate, 2 to 4 in the rain will fall, and 6 in the Mogolon River of Arizona will fall in the instant.
Middle Rockies and Great Besins in other parts of the Dezert Southwest are likely to fall between 1 and 2 inches (4 inches) in the immediate vicinity.
The rain that comes out of the rain will be beneficial for those out of the wilderness, for the land has been filled with food.
Even if this is the case, some rain may be beneficial because Southwest has to cope with the current state of food shortages.
According to the U.S. Drot Monitor, more than 40 percent of Arizona suffers from low-fat hunger, which is the second highest category," says weather.com.
First, Rosa will be on the coast of California, Mexico, on the coast of the Pacific Ocean.
The Russian wind was about 85 miles per week, and it was 385 miles south of Punta, Mexico, and it was 12 miles north at the time.
In the past, we had to cope with the colder climate of the Pacific Ocean, and we had to be able to cope with the colder climate.
In this way, it is expected to reach Mexico as a tropical storm on Monday afternoons or at evenings.
In Mexico, heavy rain may fall in all parts of the world, so it is significant that rains come down.
"The Baja California is expected to fall 3 to 6 in the North-West Sonora, which can fall even 10 in the ocean," says weather.com.
Next, Rosa will drive a tropical rainstorm north of Mexico in the morning before reaching Arizona in the shape of a drop of droplets, which will then pass through Arizona to the south of Utah in the morning.
"Rosa's or its impact on the world's economy is the main problem of the Gulf of California, the North-West Sonora, and the U.S. Desert Southwest," said the National Cycling Center.
This rain may result in a flood of wildlife and deserts, and it may well be that the mountains are flooded with sand.
Midsomer Norton attack: four men were arrested under charges of murder
Three minors and a 20 - year - old man have been arrested for trying to rape a 16 - year - old boy in Somerset.
On Saturday, about 04:00 BST voiced in Zackmi, the Xelsier Teres of Midsomer Norton.
He was taken to a hospital where his nature was said to be "stabil".
A 17 - year - old man, two 18 - year - old and 20 - year - old, was arrested at night by the Somerset police.
The authorities have called on everyone to move on if anyone has a mobile phone.
Tramp told Kevino that the Democratic Party is surrounded by 'self-reliance, anger'.
"An opinion for the Vice-President of Keveno is that the democratic party is meant to reject the loyal and instigator behaviour," Tromp said at a meeting in Villeing, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kevino has covered the "self-satisfaction, anger" of the Democratic Party in their entire application process.
KVENO, who gave his responsibility to the Guru Congress, strongly refused the charge of sexual assault on Christian Blaise Ford while we were in high school.
Ford also confirmed his charge in the hearing.
The presidents said on Saturday that that day, "Americans saw the wisdom and the quality and the courage of Keveno."
"Don't acknowledge the most successful legislation in our time is that of a judge who has a public service duty," they told West Virginia supporters.
In the mid - 1970 ’ s, the president of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania, U.S.A., spoke about the importance of the Republic’s opinions.
The choice of one of the most important things in our life has been five weeks.
I am not standing, but I am standing," they said.
"So I'm fighting big candidates everywhere."
Trompani claimed that democrats are on the verge of "resistance and obstruction".
On the request of Kevino, CNN, a senior GOP leader, told CNN that it is expected to be the first major operational opinion on the Internet by Friday.
The earthquakes in Indonesia, hundreds of deaths in tsunamis, increase the number of deaths
After a major earthquake and tsunami on the island of Indonesia, at least 384 people were killed and many reported to have been killed on Saturday.
On Friday, when hundreds of people were gathered on the edge of Palu, six meters (18 feet) high, many died and everything on the road was destroyed.
7.5 After the earthquake, Tsunami arrived.
"When Tsunami was at risk, people were doing their own business on the coast and they did not leave immediately and they were killed," Indonesia's BNPB disaster relief agency spokesperson Sotopo Pavuro Nagroho told reporters here.
"The Tsunami didn't come alone, it was carried away by cars, trucks, houses, houses, and everything on the ground," Nagroho continued, saying that it was fast going from the open sea to the Tsunami border before it hit the coast.
Some people said that they had come up to the trees to read from Tsunami.
Some 16700 people were taken safely to the 24 centers of Palu.
Many buildings and shops were destroyed, bridges were opened, and bridges were slammed, and a mass of water was rolled up.
Later, on Saturday, the coastal city was struck by an earthquake.
The landowners felt that this part of the country had a population of 2.4 million.
In one application, the Institute of Technology and Assessment (BPPT) of Indonesia stated that the energy generated by the huge earthquake in Friday was more than 200 times the energy emitted by the bomb in World War II.
It says that the area of the city that is on the edge of the valley may have grown in size.
Ugroho described the damage as being "widen" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels were covered.
They said that 540 people were injured and 29 were homeless.
On the north side of Palu, Ugroho said that the area could be close to the center of the earthquake in the area called Dunggala, where the number and damage could be greater.
Dunggalal had no information at all, says Ugroho.
There were more than 300,000 people living here," Red Cross said in a petition, saying workers and volunteers are heading towards forced areas.
"It's already a disaster, but it can get worse than this," it says.
The authorities said that the warning had been issued during the period, but that Palu had not been informed that the tsunami had been hit.
In one of the polls on social media, a man on the roof of a building may hear the sound of Tsunami standing down on the street.
And it came to pass in a few minutes, that there was a wall over against the water, and there was a building, and there was a vehicle.
This was not immediately confirmed by Reuters.
The earthquake and tsunami have caused much damage to the supply of energy and has led to global warming, making it difficult for the authorities to balance their efforts to save.
The authorities said that the army had begun sending prisoners and other cities to Cargo, but the survivors needed food and other basic wells.
The city’s airport has only been reopened for assistance, and it will be closed until October.
On Sundays, the president, Joko Vidodo, will visit the rescue centers in Palu.
The number of tsunamis in Indonesia reached 800.
How can we avoid being deceived by the world’s spirit?
Mr. Dosséba said that the world's workers arrived safely in Palu, where the workers had set up hot papers in their office area, and saw the sights of riots on the road.
"They told me they saw many houses destroyed," they said.
How can we avoid being deceived by the world’s spirit?
When relief teams began to settle for disaster, some complained that the newly experienced foreign helpers were being ridiculed for going to the camp.
According to Indonesia’s rules, if the disaster was announced as a national disaster, only foreigners, suppliers, and workers could go there.
This has not yet happened.
"This disaster is now on the surface," said the Indonesian Red Cross spokesman, Allia Aryani.
"Once the government said, "It's okay, it's a national disaster," then we open for international aid, but it's still not the situation."
After Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of the homeless still hope to find their loved ones miraculously because of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a young boy was expelled from the camp.
On Sunday, the rescuers released a woman who had been trapped under the cover of the prison with her mother’s death.
Gandon Subondono, a professor of the Indonesian National Paragloiding Association, has two paragloiders without risk for Asian sports that started this month in Indonesia.
He said that he was one of the other students who had been arrested in Roa Roa Hotel.
As a young man in the Paragliding area, I have my own emotional burden," they said.
Mr. Roa Roa Hotel said that in a few hours after the Paragloiding community was spread, they had sent a call to Palu fighters who participated in the Bicfestival.
However, their messages, instead of two blue characters, remained only one small sign.
"I think they didn't get the message," they said.
The thieves took $26,750 when they put the money in ATM here in Leviver Newport.
The news reported by the Newport Police Department that the thieves had stolen $26,750 from a British worker on Friday morning while filling in an ATM.
The car driver was emptying an ATM package and preparing for more money, says Detective Dennis McCarthy.
When he was busy, another man came running after the manager and ran a load of money for the delivery.
The newspaper reported that the Witnesses had seen many suspected fugitives on the scene, but the police did not tell the exact number of people involved.
If they have any information about their identity, please contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kenyan West: Raper changed his name to this
Raper Kenny West has changed his name – this one.
As he announced this change on Saturday on Twitter, he wrote: "This was called the Kenyan West."
The 41th anniversary of the fall of the West was this year, and for the eighth album in June, he wrote the title Monique.
This change has occurred before his presentation on Satard Knight Live, where he is expected to start his new album.
He's in the show by the singer Aryana Grande, who said "for emotional reasons," the author of the show left.
A brief description of his current business name, West, earlier stated that this word was of religious importance to him.
"I think it's the most widely used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'," the West said in the beginning of this year when discussing his album title with Radio Host Big Boy.
So I am you, and I am you.
The change from Kenya to Kenya, the only one — our good, bad, our own, our whole way of life, and everything.
This album is more a reflection of who we are."
This is one of the ones who changed their name to popular apparitions.
Cyncombs was known for its variety of names, such as P.D., P.D., or D., but this year he announced that we enjoy these names soon and that we love Brotherly.
The Magistrate of the West, J.J., has also changed with or without a hyphen and capitols.
AMLO, in Mexico, vowed not to use soldiers against civilians
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, a Mexican president, has pledged never to use soldiers on the back of the 50th anniversary of the bloodbath against the students.
Lopez Obrador promised that on Saturday, Letloco Plaza would never use an army to hurt Mexicans.
On October 2, 1968, the soldiers marched against the peacekeepers, including about 300 people who died, and during this time the left - handed students had begun to hold the whole Latin - American movement.
López Obrador has sworn to support young Mexicans with a monthly subscription and to open up more free public schools.
They said that young children are turning to criminal groups because of the lack of employment and educational opportunities.
U.S.A. is supposed to double the supply below A.I.
As China is becoming more active in creative wisdom, the US has suggested that the funds spent on research in this area be doubled, and AI has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The U.S. has no official AI protection, and the response has come after the various sections of the U.S. government have announced about the AI.
Meanwhile, last year China launched its plan, in which the AI New Year's showcased on November 1, 2030.
"The dual AI research spreadsheet will be a good start, because all other countries are far behind the United States, and we are looking forward to the next story in the AI," she said.
This week, CNBC received a visit to the U.S.A. to report that the next major success in the United States would be double.
Lee's book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and The New World Order" was published by Huton Mifflin Harcourt, which is the CEO of Sionovsan Wenders, which has been incorporated into one of China's main AI companies Face++.
In the 1980 ’ s, they worked at the Carnegie Mailen University on an AI system that lost the highest rated American Othello player, and later they were president of an ecclesiastical and Chinese branch in Microsoft Research.
Defens ODVENED RESEARCH PROGRAMMES spoke of previous U.S. government technology disputes, such as the Robotics Challenges of the Agency, and asked when the next conflict would be, so that the following prophecies could be found.
She said that researchers in the United States had to work hard to obtain government grants.
"Students don't take China away, but corporates," said Lee.
Facebook, Google, and other technology companies have appointed students from colleges to work on AI in recent years.
Lee said that the changes in the security of the country would also help the United States to strengthen its efforts in AI.
"I think I should automatically be given green cards for the PhD in AI.
In July 2017, China’s government summit launched its next generation of creative wisdom plans.
In the United States, the National Science Foundation and other government agencies provide researchers with the same method that Chinese National Science Foundations provide to educational organizations, but the quality of education in China is low.
In the beginning of this year, the U.S. Department of Defence set up an integrated creative wisdom centre, where industry and education will be part of the area, and the White House announced setting up a selection committee on creative wisdom.
And this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an AI Next initiative.
In the case of NSF, it now makes more than $100 million a year in AI research.
In the meantime, a U.S. law designed to build a national security defense on human wisdom has not been granted for several months.
The people of Macedonia gave the public permission to change the name of their country.
Macedonia's people decided on whether to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia" for the Sunday government, which will lead to their dispute with Greece for decades because Greece has banned its membership in the European Union and NATO.
In Greece, there is a country called Macedonia, and they demand that this neighbor in the north right over his country and that he has used the natto of that country and the EU's access to it.
These two governments made a treaty in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claim that this name will make the universal recognition of the Slavic majority of the Macedonian population.
President George Enovav said that we would not believe in this government, and because of the eviction rate, the number of respondents will be at least 50 percent in order to be universally eligible.
The question of the public opinion is: "Are we in agreement with Greece and are we on the side of EU membership?"
Along with President Zoran Zav, the name of the change supporters is claimed to be a price to promote entry into organizations such as the EU and NATO, which is a country after the fall of Yugoslavia.
I have come to consider the future of my country, the young people of Macedonia today, so that they can be free under the same roof of the European Union because it means a safer life for all of us," said 79-year-old citizen of Olivera Georgivesca in Skopje.
Even though it is not legally binding, the members of the vast majority of the controversy have said that we will follow this view in order to be decisive.
A two-thirds majority will be needed to replace this name.
The National Election Committee stated that by the afternoon of 1st century, there had been no riots.
In 2016, however, only 16 percent of the respondents in the previous global election were 34 percent when 66 percent of registered voters gave their opinion.
I'm out to talk to my children, we're in Europe," said the president of the 62-year-old team in Skopje, Jos Tanevski.
On September 30, 2018, the country will open its doors to NATO and to the European Union.
In front of the polls in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardharkov, a 54 - year - old housewife, is preparing a small treat for those who are evicted from the community.
We are on the side of NATO and on the side of the EU, but we want to have a strong share, not by the back door," said Kavarkov.
Our land is poor, but we are honourable.
If they don't want us to be a Macedonian, we can go to other countries like China and Russia and become part of the Euro-Asia summit."
Prime Minister Zav said NATO membership would make Macedonia a major factor, because it has a unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I think a lot of people will support because more than 80 percent of our citizens are supporters of the EU and NATO," Zav said after he said.
They said that if it came out like "yes," it would be "confirm our future."
A survey published by the Macedonian Institute for Police Research said that 30 to 43 percent of the population would participate in the polling system – this is less than the required level.
On Sunday, 57 percent of the people were planning to make a decision on the other side of the world’s television network.
Of these, 70 percent said that they would.
In order for this society to succeed, a 50 - percent more opinion is needed.
If the public fails last year, the threat of the Western-Nordic government that came into power will be the first serious threat.
Consider: Sergio Agvéro, a city in Manchester, took the route from the safety of the entire British world to the globe

In the early midfields, this Argentinan striker and a neighbor found himself in the middle of a row.
He ran out of three different parts of Britain before hitting the open field.
After that, Agvaro was surrounded by four green shirts.
When he was in his late teens or early 20 ’ s, he found himself in the middle of a car accident.
Then he turned his left side one by one, where he was strling.
The English Foreword gave its first toe ball back into the box, and it hit the right to the right toe side of the net with the right toe of Britain’s head, Matthew Rayan.
Agvaro’s feet have some problems," City Manager Pep Guardio told reporters.
"He's playing 55, 60 minutes.
That is exactly what happened.
We can't believe he hit that moment."
In the battle of Sterling Prime Minister League, however, Sky Blazen was initially attacked.
The goal was 29 minutes later.
At that time, Agvaro found a ball in the Briton area.
On the left, he kindly sent a ball to Leroy.
He took a few shoes and then headed for Sterling’s remote post.
The skier’s blue foreword tapped into the ball net just before leaving the border.
In Germany, Sinheim is here in Rahine-Neker-Erina at 12:55 p.m., where the city will be fought with Hophniheim.
Sheerger wants to play the game against Rocky.
Since the Nationals left the chain, there was no reason for them to start yet another forceful start.
However, if the competition is always a challenge for the right Sharerna, it is expected that it will continue to be beneficial to play the game against Colorado Rocky, but in NL West, it will still be beneficial to play the game on Los Angeles Dozers.
The Rocky Friday night won the 5-2th Nationals and scored a Wild Card, but they still expect to fight for their first Division Book.
"Even if we don't play for anything, knowing that the environment in Denver will stay in the ring, we'll be able to follow the minimum radar and we'll be playing the second team on top of any time I haven't seen this year.
Why should I not have a quarreling among them?
Nationals have not yet announced the start of the holiday, but at such times they may be quite aware of the arrival of the Sherzejer.
Sherzejer, in his 34th or 34th birthday, had a Bulgarian session and would pay attention to his regular Sundays.

Meeting in West Virginia
In the mid - term elections, the presidents pointed out the significant importance of the presence of the Republicans in the case of the British Court of Justice.
What we have done will take place in November.
We are five weeks away from the most important choices in our life.
It's the biggest, the biggest, I don't fight, but because I'm really fighting, I'm going everywhere for the big bidders.
And the tramp went on and said, "Look at this terrible, terrible group of democrats, you see, it's all happening now.
And they have determined to have power over them in any way necessary, that they might see their own selves, and that they might gain the more.
They don't care who we hurt, they don't care who we hit to get control, because they want power and control, we won't give them."
They said that the democrats are on the verge of "resistance and resistance."
And you've seen it for four days," they said, "Democrats mean "sense and selfish and humble and false."
The Senate chief, who was appointed by the Democratic Senator Dean Finstein, was greatly praised by observers. He was also a member of the Governing Body of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
Do you remember the answer?
Have you opened the document?
Oh, oh, what.
No, no, I hope not. She has spoken the least of these things. She has spoken the least of these things."
Leber was no longer a Broad Church.
He does not tolerate what is in his heart
There was nothing surprising when the officers on my side of the Momentum thought I was guilty.
Finally, I am the latest in the Leber MP, which is said not to be our welcome – just about what our hearts are talking about.
The same behavior was experienced by my secular partner, John Rayan, because she had taken a firm stand against the hatred of young people.
In my case, I was criticized for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbin.
These are the very points that the poor have in common with the former leaders of Jeremy, a responsible for the economic protection of Europe.
At the meeting of Notingham East Leber, on Friday, he asked: "We want to be inclusive and productive in meetings."
For the most part of my eight years as a local lab MP, the GC meeting on Friday night was exactly the same.
Unfortunately today, there are no such conditions in many meetings and "more merciful, well," politics's word has ever been forgotten, if it really started.
This is evident to the increasing extent that the opposition does not seem to be tolerated on the part of the lab and that each opinion is acceptable to the leader.
After Jeremy became a leader, it started to happen some time ago, because I would turn around with the same political views that I had previously expressed, and I would assume that I would never accept anything else -- whether it's national security or the EU's single market.
When I speak in public – and what I say is not really important – I am told that I should not be at the Leber Party.
This is not just my experience.
Indeed, I am more honourable than some of my fellow workers, for my reactions are of a political nature.
I'm surprised at the practical and strong nature of friends who don't even worry about the daily flow of sexual or verbal abuses.
One of the most discouraging issues in the history of politics is the habit of saying no to words.
In the past week, Jeremy Corbin felt that the worker should be careful about the culture of long - suffering.
The fact is that we are no longer so gifted as to make the parties sad instead of any "infidelity" or election rules.
With the request that I keep my head down and not speak too much, I had received much advice over the past two years that my "all" would be okay.
But I didn’t come into politics.
As a result of the urgency of the Thacher government, I have been deprived of my school’s final class and have been a student 32 years ago since I joined the Mezur Party, as a local city servant, or as a government minister, I have been asked to provide better public service for those I need too much.
I never hid my politics as the last election.
No one in the Nottingham East can be confused about the state of my security and the current leadership of the inconsistency area.
I would like to say so to those who supported this proposal on Friday that I cannot understand the country in the direction of the Brigitte so that family, business and social services will be affected by the desire to rob me of my loyalty to the employer.
But the message which I have is not for the norm, but for the people of my own company, which is a member of the common people. I am proud of your service, and I promise you that I am not able to escape any threat or political status from my work, which I consider to be for you all.
Chris Leslie is an M.P.I. from the Nottingham East.
Irrigation 38 - 17 Melrogens: Overcrowded Irrigation Reaches the Top
Two trials have had a slightly negative impact on the final outcome, but there is no doubt that the Iron Curtains are worthy of victory throughout the day of the Prime Ministership.
They now have the top seats in the table, the only one in the ten organizations in which they live.
Finally, their survival was as beautiful as the fine ability to take the opportunity, which gave the local organization and the teacher Peter Marchi the full right to be happy.
"We've been so tested for our game, and we're still indicted, and I'm happy," he said.
Robin Christians of Melrose said, "It's not worth it, it's better than we have."
Frazier Klimodwara, the 14th-minute Grand Anderson Trio of the Frazier Climodura, captured the Air Force, but, thanks to a card released by Scotland Cap Rory Huzes, Melrose was awarded a medal and Jason Bagatt was awarded an infractional trio.
Klimo had a half-time attack on Air with a penultimate, and then on a break, he defeated Air 17-5 in a single stroke.
However, Melrose started a good second half of the program, and the Patrique Anderson’s drumming was reduced by five points.
After that, a serious accident in Rurid Nott stopped the game, which was taken from the track, and from the very beginning, the climate was further reduced to a train at Air Stafford McDowell.
Irre's haggamic corporal, Blair McFarson's next card, and again, Melrosene took advantage of the extra game with the triumph of Bruce Colvin at the end of a severe tension.
The local team later returned, but, and the Bolvina Klimo from Penulti line-out was given a card to Struan Hechinson, and McFarson hit the next air in the back.
After taking the box of David Armstrong to Kyle Rowe and sending Flander Henry away for the fifth trial of the local organization, Klimo changed him as he did at the time of his return.
In the Steel Game Star Hotel industry, our business has become increasingly popular.
After learning that the Steel Game Star Ford Kirnon has been appointed as the director of the authorized restaurant company, he took steps to return to the Adritháthia.
This 56 - year - old B.C.E. played a part in the popular B.C.E. by Jack Gervis, whose writings they have written and who have been associated with the long - term Winnodi, Greg Hemfil.
This couple has announced that the new owner of this upcoming show will be the last one, and Karen Craigang is planning his life after work.
According to the medical record list, they are the directors of adriftmoren limited.
Although a Scottish Sun source indicated that Kirnon Glasgo's "restoring business" would be involved in the business, he refused to comment on this issue.
"The sea is ours," the hope of a surpassing Bolivian to open the way to Neialya.
In the village of La Paz, Reging-Claude Nassene's headquarters is being held in the village.
Public buildings are made up of sky - colored trees.
Lek Tikaka is shown as the following proverbs to Amazon's camp: "We have our right to the sea.
It's our duty to get him."
The memories of a seafarer lost in a violent conflict with Chile in the 19th century in the entire transatlantic Bolivia are still alive today - as if there is still another time to work in the Pacific Ocean.
That hope may be the highest in this decade, for Bolivia is awaiting a decision by the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of thinking and thinking.
"Bolivia has speed, unity and courage, and, of course, expects a positive outcome from inefficiency," said journalist Roberto Czedi.
Many of the Bolivians will see the trial of ice cream on a large screen throughout the country, hoping that the trial in Hega will be held in the province of Bolivia – after several decades of speaking up – Chile has accepted the right to divide the laws to give Bolivia the sea its own way.
The attractiveness of Bolivia's local national president, Ivo Morales, who is facing a fight for elections again next year, also depends largely on Monday's verdict.
At the end of August, they promised, "We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean."
However, some analysts believe that it is very unlikely that the trial will be eliminated by Bolivia, and even if this happens, the situation will not change very much.
The Netherlands-State United Nations has no authority to land in Chile, and they have agreed that it will not determine the consequences of possible speech.
Only six months after ICJ was elected, the last dispute was that the trial was "not of any kind," according to experts from Chile in international law, Paz Azrata.
And for the cause of Bolivia, the past four years have been overrun.
"The administration of Bolivia has failed to obtain the sea route," the nuns said.
And the decree of Morelas was fulfilled, which was published in the ears of the chief priests and scribes.
At one point, Bolivia and Chile will start to talk, but it will be very difficult to discuss later.
Since 1962, the two countries have not changed.
In May, President Edward Rodríguez Wellze, a representative of Bolivia at Hege, has found the trial to be an unusually active trial.
"There's going to be a wonderful opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile for Saturday, and there's going to be an opportunity to complete the 139 years of incompetence with each other," they said.
Morales was still the most popular leaders in Latin America, and Calzodi said that they were using the seabed as a political hub.
"Bolivia will never abandon our right to the path of the Pacific Magsagara," they said.
"There's an opportunity to see what's to hit the back."
North Korea said it would not disarm without trusting U.S.
Foreign Minister Rie Yong of North Korea said that if their country did not trust Washington, it would never destroy his remains.
In the first century C.E., Jehovah’s Witnesses were organized to preach the good news of God’s Kingdom in all the inhabited earth.
They called for the fulfillment of the promises made by the nation during the meeting in Singapore, which was held inconsequentially.
Their opinion is that the U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeii, North Korea’s Kim Jong of Korea, was on the way to resume the nuclear policy that took place more than three months later.
Rei said it's a "view" that kept the U.S. government's demands for a press release, which will end the Korean war and the North Korean Gulf.
Washington, D.C., observed: “The most important thing is that we should be careful not to allow ourselves to be caught up in any form of violence. ”
Both Kim and the U.S. president of Donald Trump want a second meeting.
But Pyongyang is more likely to be serious about leaving his Scriptures, for he only considers the country to be a safe haven for his protection.
In the month following, Pompio Kim-Tramp is planning to make preparations for a second meeting.
In Paris’s fashion show, the audience presented a wide variety of new features to reach your audience on one of the main streets.
Do not look elsewhere if you want to grow in your hats or if you want complete protection from the sun.
Designers Valentino and Thom Brownie presented a series of large-scale hats for their SS19 collections, which made Paris Fashion a style that would guide the mind.
In this year, a very unprofessional team of such artists attended the Instagram and sent these designers to Katawak for their viewers.
A velvet pix of Valentine's Day was an over-d-top pingt hat that was decorated with a wide-banded pixa, which was decorated with the tops of the models.
Other materials of a larger size were carved with precious stones, a magic hat, and an anonymous -- but they were not designed to hold your head.
Thom Browny also presented a series of amazing figures -- and it was also in Halloween.
Many colorful faces were painted, and they looked more like a handyman than the most fascinating of them.
One design was like a skiba diving giraffe, which contained ivory and gogals, while the other looked like an abandoned ice cream cone.
And if you were able to use this huge fashion state, you might not be able to.
It is estimated that the eyelids can be found in the vast majority of the way you look.
The hats of a very large size were standing on the tops of the ‘la lanba’, two-foot-length hats, and Rihana was all over the head of Emily Ratazoski.
This very unprofessional hats, which have been named on social media, have been sent to another large boxing catatwak -- a bug in the middle of a strike, like a young-sucked model has taken a kid.
Rafia had been cut off and the best part of the collection was Jaquemaz, the Narangi Rafia Bag Paris Fashion, in the Riviera S.S.19 collection.
The famous stylisticist Luke Armitage told Fimel: 'I expect big hats and between Bugs to come on the main road for the next time,' the designers had a great effect that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for this extremely sized device.'
John Edward: Language skills are needed for the world’s citizens
Scotland's free school maintains a sense of educational excellence, and it is also taking place in 2018, which includes another set of extraordinary test results, which are driven only by games, art, music and other community activities.
With more than 30,000 students in the whole of Scotland, these schools are represented by the Scottish Church of Independent Schools (CSIS), which are designed to provide the best service for their students and parents.
The goal is to prepare students for their next and higher education, their chosen career, and their place as a global citizen.
As a field of education, which can design and implement the above - mentioned school curriculum, modern languages are a popular and popular subject in schools.
They said to him, "If you speak with a man who understands, it will be in his head.
"If you speak with a man who understands, it will be in his heart.
It is a very important thing to remember that we cannot rely only on English to establish relations and faith with people from other countries.
As a result of a recent test by Yang, we can see that the language has become a top position in the League of Nations during free schools, along with the highest rates of education.
The 68 percent of foreign - language students received a high grade A.
The data collected by SSCS 74 students showed that 72% of students in Madrid received high grades, and that there were 72% of German students, 69% of French students, and 63% of Spanish students.
This shows that free schools in Scotland are supporting foreign - language skills that will no doubt be needed for children and young people in the future.
As a matter of choice, the language is now understood as a subject of free schools and elsewhere, such as science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.
The 2014 survey of journalists and professionals found that 17 percent of the language skills were due to the lack of skills in the New Year for free space.
As a result, language skills are increasingly needed to prepare the youth for their future career.
These skills have become necessary in the wake of the most likely job opportunities of a language.
If they have learned another language, they can benefit in the future because they have the ability to do so throughout their life.
Because of the ability to communicate directly with foreign people, people who speak their own language will be the most likely to be in this race.
According to a survey of over 4,000 U.S. adults in 2013, 75 percent of the people were unable to speak a foreign language in order to communicate, and only 15 percent of the French - speaking population could be spoken in two languages.
As a result, the language taught for today’s children is an important factor.
If there are many languages, especially those in the developing economy, children will be given a good opportunity to obtain meaningful magazines.
In Scotland, each school teaches a variety of languages.
Many schools focus more on modern languages, but they teach other languages that are considered to be the most important for the EU by 2020, such as Madrid or Japan.
Whatever interests your child has, there are a lot of languages to choose in free schools, and there are also a class of teachers to teach in related areas.
The Scottish Free School is dedicated to providing an educational environment that will prepare students and, if anything else in the future, equip them with skills to be successful.
At that time, a global business cannot deny the importance of language for the future of the country, so it must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages need to be considered "international dialogue skills".
The free school will continue to provide this choice, variety, and excellence for young people in Scotland.
El Fot bene Le Faire.

In Lebanon, San Diego is to be offered by the friars.
In the early stages of Los Angeles Lakes, the goal of the audience’s audience is to look at Lebron James.
Lek Walton, a professor of Lekers, announced that James San Diego would play against the Denver Nugets at the early Christmas season on Sunday.
But it is still important to determine how much time he will play.
"It's going to be less than one and less than 48," Walton said on the professional website of Lekers.
The Lek’s report, Mike Trudwell, has tweeted that James is likely to play limited minutes.
This week’s beginning, James Lekers was asked about his plans regarding the six-game clock.
"In this stage of my career, I don't need to be played in advance," he said.

Today, national president Donald Tramp launched a campaign to preach the good news in Walling, West Virginia.
This was the first of five traffic tickets scheduled for the following week, with tennis and Egypt standing in their right places.
In order to fill his election position at the Supreme Court, the authorities have set out to support the mid-term elections, because when it comes to November, the Republicans are afraid to lose control of the Congress.
How does the train in West Virginia sound at night, and how will you view it online?
Tramp's travels in West Virginia are set at 7:00 a.m. on the night. It's today night, Saturday, September 29, 2018.

Rider Cup 2018: U.S.A. fought to keep such lives alive when they went to Singles.
After three single sessions, the square of Saturday afternoon" showed the driver's wishes for the cup.
The twins of a sense of humor that eats are the idea of the whole game, but the one that fully believes in the game, and is never more than that.
Then they will say, ‘ Where is this feeling now? ’
"They had six numbers, and now they're four, so I think we're getting a little faster now," Jordan Spith said at the end of the day.
Europe is in an acceptable position, four points ahead, and twelve others remain in the game.
The Americans think that Spyth says that they have little wind in their tracks, and they have a lot to encourage, not just because of the shape of Spyth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day, and each of them got three numbers out of four.
From Spyth T. to Green, and his leadership is exemplary.
When he and Thomas were two and a half hours later, they made the most of all four sketches.
On the 15th of them that were about him in war, whose battle was about to take place, ye knew that the Americans are still in conflict.
"You really want to do a lot of work and worry about your own face," Spith said.
Each of these games is now about the rest of the game.
There are 18 holes to make a mark.
In the last two days, the games that are more numerous than Spyth and Thomas — only Frenchco millinarians and Tommy Fleetwood — have been debated by the reader’s cup.
There were four of them, and there was no error in the number of them.
"Molovud" was the only couple who couldn't shoot a log on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided it on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and supported it on Friday morning.
He seemed to have lost the game on Sundays, and the excitement behind this crowd, and there would have been no more popular matches, as Le Golf National, and as the sun grew up, except for the possible European victory.
Both are at the same time on different halls, and more is needed.
Yet, the story of European pride has not yet come to light.
My wife and I, who are Jehovah’s Witnesses, have been able to help others to learn the truth about God and his purposes.
On the first day of the convention, the Witnesses were invited to attend a meeting of Jehovah’s Witnesses.
On Sundays, there was no one to help you out of your hotel.
Because the couple had good communication, advice, and advice that they could not give, and there was a policy that could change.
As a team, Europe has played a good role, so on the last day, a flagship attack took place, but at this forum, Team U.S.A. also showed a war attitude, especially the Stateside, where it was suspected.
Europe took 10-6 on the last day of the biker cup.
On Saturday, when the Förbols and the Försms are out, Europe will benefit from a great deal on the final day of the 10-6 agadis, with the United States.
Tommy Fleetwood and Francisco Molinari led the team against Tiger Woods, who fought with two winners, and led their journal Le Golf National.
Two years ago, in Hexeltian, Thomas Jørn’s European team won 3-1 in an attempt to keep the bull in the middle of the morning’s furballs in the U.S.A.
In the Forsams, Europe has more resistance and won, but they have not been able to harm.
In order to keep the Jim Frequent Association alive, eight issues were needed from Sunday’s 12 - day singles in front of the club.
Fleetwood is the first European player to win four points in the line, if he and Molinari, who were called "Molovud", were the only match between the four sides of their initial history of the biker cup.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reid in Forbols, they added 5 and 4 to the drums of the disillusioned Woods and Brian Desbwell of the United States.
On Saturday, two conventions were held by Woods, who had been drawn by two fronts, but he had now been defeated in 19 and seven in front of him in Forbals and Forsam.
A morning’s morning break, Justin D. Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who were part of the team, returned to Forsams with Henry Stanson, and won 2 and 1 of them, with one and three world ranks.
There was nothing that happened to be acceptable to Europe on the day of a storm and wind in South-West Paris.
Three hours later, the U.S. Secretary - General Jordan Spyth and Justin Thomas set up a measure for the Americans on Saturday.
In Forbols, they won 2ths in a race against John Ram and Ian Polter, Spain, and then returned to Forsams after losing two holes of the beginning and defeating Polter and Rory McCallory in 4ths3.

North Korea refused to be a sidearm without trust "any way"
The foreign ministers of North Korea told the United Nations on Saturday that the constant bans have led to confidence in United States states, and in such a situation the country will not leave the blind in any way alone.
In Rey Yong's annual general meeting of the World Organization, North Korea had recently made "a very remarkable solution" such as stopping angina and genotoxicity testing, destroying anorexia testing sites, and promising not to increase anorexia and anonium technology.
"However, we haven't found any related response from the U.S.," they said.
"Without any trust in the U.S., we will not remain confident in our national security and in such a situation we will not be able to unarm ourselves individually in any way."
Where the "step by step" of stopping the Rhine has reiterated the usual complaints of North Korea's resistance, in which North Korea was to be allowed to move slowly, their statement was remarkable, where Pyongyang had not refused to stop the one side-by-side propulsion, as stated earlier.
The first meeting between the U.S. National and North Korean leaders in Singapore on 12 June, Kim Jong and Donald Tramp continued to refer to the statement that Kim had promised to work in the area of "decommissioning the Korean island's nuclear power plant", but that has helped to protect North Korea.
North Korea, 1950-53, is calling for a formal end to the Korean war, but United States states that Pyongyang must first abandon his remains.
In addition, Washington has also opposed the demand for international bans imposed on North Korea.
"U.S.'s first emphasis is "to stop anatomy" and strongly increases the pressure on the door to achieve their goal, and is also reluctant to announce the end of the war," Rei said.
"The view that this will lead us to the caves will remain an idea for those who do not know about us.
But the problem is that we are losing our confidence because of the constant bans."
Rei didn't mention any of the plans between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leaders had mentioned earlier this week in the United Nations.
Instead, ministers highlighted three meetings between the leaders of Kim and South Korea last five months and said: "South Korea would have been one side for this problem to shut down, and if there was no U.S., it would not have been a code to shut down the Korean island's technology."
However, Rei's sound speech was quite different from last year when they referred to the U.N. as a "Rocket Man" of the North Korean Rockets and the U.S. General Assembly, when "Mi. Evil President" called Kim a "Rocket Man".
In this year's United Nations, which had threatened to "completely destroy" North Korea last year, they commended them for their courageous stand for the disarmament of Kim, but said that there was still a need to do much work and that the ban should continue until North Korea's mobilization is stopped.
On Wednesday, Trump said that they had no time window, saying, "If it took two years, three years, or five months – it doesn't matter."
The Chinese and Russians argued about this in the U.N.: they should acknowledge Peongyang for the steps of safety.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompey U.N. said in the security environment: "The security bans must continue to be strictly and definitively applied until a complete, final, and controlled suspension is stopped."
Since 2006, security forces have unanimously banned North Korea to stop supply of pyongyang’s nuclear and explosive radiation programmes.
Pompeii visited Rie outside and told the U.N. General Meeting that in the next month, they would return to Pyongyang to prepare for another meeting.
Pompeii had already visited North Korea three times, but her last visit was not a good one.
In July, they left Pyongyang so that it has progressed, only for North Korea, in a few hours they're "asking for things like dogs."
In June, North Korea promised that if the United States were to plan a plan, they would destroy the disaster site as well as annu packages."
They said Kim told them that the "related plan" they needed was to take the security that they promised in Singapore in order to improve their relationship with Amy and Washington.
Hardy’s students are taking a long time to get enough rest.
This year, the Harvard University brings a new study to take more sleep for all its students to cope with the culture of mardana, which is growing all over the night.
One scholar found that the basics about how to care for a number of students in the world show that they are usually ignorant.
Professors of Sleep Medicine at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and a woman in the hospital have developed a study that is considered to be the first in the U.S.
They were encouraged to start the study by explaining the results of their studies if they were not awake from sleep.
Then came one of his daughters unto me, saying, Why am I now told this, seeing I am in the last year?
She said that no one had told her about the importance of sleep -- which I was surprised to see -- they told The Telegraph.
This study presented this year’s first presentation explains how students need a good sleep habits for their work as well as for their regular health.
After a week’s study, the student decided to start the study after he found out that he had been severely deprived of sleep at the Harvard Medical School.
In this one - hour study, we have a set of emotional goals.
In one area, there is a picture of a bedroom where students take coffee, and there are charts, trainers, and books about the effects of caffeine and light, and the reduction of sleep.
The second part tells the participants how to avoid long sleep and how to increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, stroke, and cancer.
After the map of Campus and the emotional equinox, the participants are moved to reflect on their routine.
"We understand that this will not change the behavior of students immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know -- as you have the right to know the health consequences of smoking,' said Professor Khizler.
"All night long" culture of pride still exists, they said, it had a growing problem with the amount of modern technology and the constant pressure on students, meaning to stay out of sleep.
To make sure that a good degree of sleep is enough, students must have a secret weapon to overcome stress, fatigue, and anxiety — even to avoid weight gain, because if the brain fails to sleep, it remains hungry and hungry forever.
A 19 - year - old scholar of chemical and physical biology named Raymond Gold Schizler helped design this study, which he had received during his first year in Harvard.
He said that the study program opened his eyes and moved him to perform the study program throughout the campus.
He hopes that in the next step, all these students will be told that they should complete such studies before entering a competitive organization.
Professor Schizler recommended that students set alarms to go to sleep and also to wake up, and that the electronic screens and the LED lighthouse be alerted to the harmful effects of low light, which will break the clocks of your body, which will cause sleep problems.
Livingstone 1 - 0 Rangers: The ball of Manga showed disrespect for Gerard’s association
Rangers sat still, when Dolly Minga's strike at Steven Gerard's college won 1-0 in Livingstone.
They were seeking their first victory in February 4-1 in St. Johnston, but Garry Holt’s association led to a second victory in the 18 games of Gerard, which left them eight points away from the Ladbrox Prime Minister’s request for Hearts.
He studied for seven minutes in half-time, and he never saw the Rangers' association trying to match.
Rangers are now in the sixth place, and Livingstone is in the third place, and they are only behind the goal.
And there may be other problems for Rangers because of throwing one thing out of the other corner, Linsman Calm Spain's head had to be treated for the disease.
Gerard changed their association eight, which had replaced the changes in the seas in the Betfried Cup.
On the other hand, he played with the 11 Levies, who had received a score from Harts last week, and was very pleased with the way in which they beat their opponents in every turn with their good moves.
In the early 1950 ’ s, a group of Witnesses in the United States were assigned to serve as special pioneers in the United States, and they were assigned to serve in the United States.
They could only score in two minutes when Le-off sent Scott Pittman to the goal of Ain McGregor first-time, but Midfielder took away his big opportunity.
Keegan, who is on the Dup, sent the Free-Cyric Corridor to Craig Holket, but his defensive partner, Allen Lithgo, entered the post office.
Rangersini got control, but their last game in the heat showed a lack of confidence.
Alfredo Morlos and Steven Lólis were determined to obtain a panel on Mark’s headquarters, but the reporter Steven Thompson had to decompose the Columbian court.
Rangers was shot at only two fort-haf shots on the target, but Magi Brix Glokiper, the leader of Lasana Colibeli, and Ovi Izaria, did not find it very difficult to stop the strike.
The first round of the 34th minute of Levi's life was against the flow of the game, and no one would doubt that they had labored.
Failed again to fix Jacobs's set-ups on the Rangers DP.
When Declarant gave Sandu Scott Robinson, Scott Arfield did not respond, who quietly chose a needle for easy completion.
Gerharde called Colibaly at the scene of Ryan Kent in Break, and soon the effect of the change was evident.
However, Lithgo and Hulkette continued to play their favorite games by playing a long - distance ball.
In recent times, however, it may have been possible to increase the impact of the Holt’s sparks, but the MacGregor stood firm to stop James from coming from the far corner.
But he did not pay any attention to that fact.
Almanac: Seeker of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our Sande Morning in Almanac: 136 years ago today, 30 September 1882, and then... this day, the future physicist Jonas William "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
A search for and measurement of the kerosene was carried out by the gyghur counter. The gyghur counter was designed to detect and measure the gyghur.
Since then, in the main course of science, the Geiger counter has also become a pop artist on the main course, such as Roy Rogers and Del Evans in the 1950s, which is part of the "Bels Of Coronado" film:
Man: "What is it?"
Rogers: "This is the Geiger counter, which is used to find the refuges like Urenium.
When you wear this phone, you can hear the sound of the thunders coming out of the sky.
Evans: "They're popping up now!"
The death of Hans Geiger in 1945 was only a few days after his 63rd birthday.
However, the search for their name was not in vain.
The new L.A. in cancer will teach the system to 'go' to the bad zone
New L.A.D. in cancer will teach them to 'go' and kill them.
The disease - causing system as part of Los Angeles treatment teaches bad behaviors
In this way, the patient’s disease rate is removed and converted into a hospital
They can then have a protein called pohu in many cancers, and then they'll be cut back into the body.
This study has shown a positive effect on patients with various cancers.
When a woman was treated with a lice that taught her to know the disease, her dumbler’s cancer appeared to have been lost for over 18 months.
In this way, the patient's disease rate is removed and transformed into a medical school so that they can be called HER2, which is common in many cancers and is then re- reachable in the body.
In Bethesda, Maryland, U.S. National Casser Institute professor Burzowski said, "Our results suggest that we have a very hopeful lens."
HER2 "it is due to the growth of various kinds of cancers," in which Professor Burzofski argued that it includes strands, dumbles, fufuss, and colorectal cancers.
Similarly, it is useful to remove the pathogens from the patients and how to attack them against the pathogens of cancer in view of the "education" of the pathogen of the blood.
After their presence in the SNL, Kenya West wearing the MAGA hats, they scored a string-by-trap.
_Other Organiser
Following the presentation of the Kenyan West, in which they praised U.S. president Donald Tramp and told them to fight election in 2020, their satellite night live was broadcast in the studio.
At night, after singing the third song, they began to protest against the Democrats and once again announced support to the Tromp.
And it came to pass the second time, that I spake unto a certain man that said, How can ye love the uppermost rooms?
So, if I were worried about the district, I would have left America a long time ago," they said.
SNL began the show by Skyt, the role of Matt Damon, in which this Hollywood star had blown the tongue of the Witnesses in front of the Synette Judicial Committee for the sexual assaults of Christian Blaise.
Even though this was not the case, the artist Chris Rock, who was a member of the Western Buddhist movement, had an appeal to the social media.
It was not yet clear whether Rock was trying to fly the West Bank after posting.
He also complained to the audience that his hat on his head had caused him to suffer a stroke.
"They're after me, they're after me.
They said, "Don't wear that hat and go to bed."
They took me to the police station, and they took me to the police station.
And then they said, "I've had enough," said Washington Examminer.
And the West said, "Have you seen the old place?" So they said, "I'll put on my Superman cap, because you can't tell me what to do.
Look out for love."

Maxine Waters denied the employee permission to dump the GPS sensor data and said that it was 'dangerous fraud' and 'unsynthetic principles'.
On Saturday, the U.S. Republican Maxine Waters accused her of posting personal information to three republican U.S. Presidents on the Wikipedia pages of the Constitution.
Los Angeles Democrat firmly stated that he gave the voices to the leaders of the "good-bye group" and to the Web site.
"Trueness, falsehood, and more hateful lies," Waters said in a statement on his Twitter.
According to information published by the U.S. Senators of South Carolina, Linda Graham, and Michael Lee, and Orin Hach, who live in the United States, and phone numbers.
The unsub in the Capitol Hill saw the information posted by Guruuri Online on the charges of sexual misconduct against the Supreme Court, known as Bret Kwanu.
After examining the three centenarians, she began to study the Bible with Jehovah’s Witnesses.

The Waters ’ statement quickly began with an online comment, including the press release of the White House.
"This denial is free," the bottler writes.
"It shows that her personality is not worthy of being a Congressman.
For when they shall be reproached for the things which they have not done, it is not meet for them to be angry.
They were not to be distracted.

John English Strikes Forward Review - Low Effective Rovan Atkinson’s Secret Debate
It has now been translated into any new film to get the results of the British team, and it was also applied to Johnny English Action-Commedy Vidmbian Francheise, who started in 2003 as Johnny English and was relived as Johnny English Reborn in 2011.
Would you be happy to see how worthless we are as a new export opportunity in the country?
In any event, the inability to catch things from the radar face is the second time the permission to catch things -- his name indicates that he has a huge comic design for those who see the cinemas in the English fields.
He is certainly a stupid secret agent who, despite the magnitude of the glamorous glamorous glamorousness, seems to be a bit like Mr. Beine Clouseau (the foolish police) and makes a note of him at the 2012 London Olympics Festival, Charts of Fire Theme.
They are based on a well - known international man and add to his confusion the Barclaycard has once forgotten.
There are also a couple of scans in this latest Jee movie.
I was very fond of the occasion when John’s English medium - sized clothes went to the helicopter, and the wings of the birds were hanging on his head.
However, Winod seems to be very less effective and, in particular, 007 and as the mission imposable filmboards, it seems strangely necessary to include Winod as a component.
Winnod doesn't feel like a plan for adults, and I don't think it's a plan for children, and I don't think it's an invention and a focus in the art-picture of Atkinson.
It is now the common theme of the Great Britain problem.
A cyber hacker in Britain's Super-Secret Web Network opens up the identity of British agents on all jobs, which makes the job agent amazed -- a very small role for Kevin Elden.
There's the last hope for Ugaritics and Protestants and the political people who have already suffered a disaster: Emma Thompson has been wearing a lot of shoes like yours -- but she doesn't have much to do with anything else.
Her secret counselors indicate that each active secret should be brought to her for information.
And this means that the stupid Johnny English, now acting as a school teacher in the state of Alyshan, is teaching how to become a secret operativ: there are some scandals here because the English school makes the Rock-Type hierarchy an academie.
In a short time, English is again called for instant briefings at the Whitehall, and its long-term partner, Bell Miller, is again invited to be present with Bo.
Bo is now married, he married a submarine commander, Jolly-Hoki-Stix Roll, in which he has put on the ability of an artist like Vicki Paperdin.
In each of the Magistrates’ secret services, Batman and Robin come to meet with a beautiful woman named Olga Corlinco, who lives in the United States.
Meanwhile, Corsica, who claims to be able to solve the problem of the British computer, is under the most dangerous influence of a millionaire: the terrible Jason Volta that Jack Lacey has.
The English and Bo begin their exciting adventures: They set fire to a drumming French restaurant at the door of the wind; they interfere with their own travels from the Voltsan Jot; and the English is trying to get to know the contents of the Volts ’ home.
They've brought all sorts of opportunities to the end, but they're like children's TV shows because they're funny and violent.
Very much so.
And I also wondered, ‘ Can the British filmmaker Rowan Atkinson play a simple role in his opposition? ’
Leber Party planned to work four days a week and pay five days a week
Jeremy Corbins Leber Party says that the British spend four days a week thinking about a five - day basic plan.
The party believes that the owners of the company are to be classified as workers who have been saved by the Kremlin's (AI) wisdom.
For this cause shall the labourers be given in three weeks, but not in three weeks.
According to sources, the idea of moving to the country of the Party to the benefit of workers is 'steward' in the economic topic and in the safeguards.
Trade Union Congress approved a four-day weekend as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior lab party source told The Sande Times: 'This year is expected to be announced a change in the regime.
'It won't happen this night, but the four-day week of work is an expectation that coincides with the attitude of workers to return to the economy and the total industrial impact of the party.'
This was not the first party, but the Green Party, which approved this idea, promised the four - day work week in the public elections in 2017.
However, this is not fully recognized by the modern - day lab party.
Leber's party spokesman said, 'The work of the four-day week is not a party's threat, and the bird didn't think of it.'
In the last week’s program of socialism, each member of the Governing Body, John McDonald made a more comprehensive statement on socialism in the economic system.
Mr. McDonald said that the service system's 'faceless manager' and the appropriate companies are determined to take over power.
The plan for each of these means that current stakeholders in the water systems cannot get back their entire share of their density because, based on the abuses seen there, the wage government can 'replace'.
They also supported the plans to take workers into company executives, as well as to provide workers with an annual benefit of up to £500 to 10 per cent of the private sector's memberships.
Linds Graham, John Kennedy "60 minutes" tells us if the angle of the FBI has changed in his opinion.
At least a week has elapsed since the Court’s investigation of the charges against the FBY against Bret Kwanu, and the conclusions of the Bureau have raised a question as to whether any members of the Republican Party may be willing to withdraw their support for the Supreme Court.
In a interview on Sunday, author Scott Pelli asked Senator John Kennedy and Lindes Graham of the Republican side whether he had been able to find anything that might change their views.
Kennedy spoke more freely than his fellow worker in South Carolina.
"Yes, of course," said Kennedy.
"I have spoken to the judge, and to the judge, to the judge.
All this happened, he came to the charge after I called them and asked, 'Did you do it?'
And they were quiet and sound.
It seemed to him that he had been set up.
"It's my decision about the Brett Queen, and one big charge he can change," they said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know that Brett has refused the charge with full force," said Graham Christine Bless ford.
"And she could not discern every man that was called by her name.
He is 36 years old.
I don't think there's gonna be any new changes in this."
Have they done anything to eliminate poverty?
The World Citation Festival, held in New York on Saturday, will be part of the world’s most powerful stars, and the goal is so strong that the world’s poverty will be eradicated.
In the seventh year of the Global Citation Festival, thousands of millions of people will come together to enjoy the art of such artists as Janet Jackson, Cardie B, and Sean Mandis in Great Park London. It is evident that the world’s daily poverty will end by 2030.
The Global Citation Festival, launched in 2012, is a form of an extension of the Global Power Project (World Poverty Project) that is expected to expand the number of people struggling for poverty eradication.
In order to gain free access (if you don't want to buy a VIP access), the viewers of the sample had to complete some of the tasks or "actions" of the whole, such as volunteering to spread their world origins, e-mailing, dephoning, or relying on any other meaningful way.
But how successful has the Global Citation been in its 12th anniversary?
The idea of organizing free music for people is an honest way to inspire people to act, or do people just think that "clicktivism" is another kind of thing in which an online person is correcting or sending a Twitter message that really makes a difference?
According to Global City, since 2011, their supporters have a record of more than 19 decades of "action" for different exhibits.
They say that the world’s leaders have been helped to publish the promises and warnings of $3,700 million or more, which will affect more than 225 million by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group illustrated the 390 promises and announcements made by their actions, of which at least $1,000 has already been distributed or conflicted.
The group is expected to have a direct impact on the lives of some 649 million people worldwide.
Some important winds include power of neutralization. Power of neutralization is a partnership between generators and organizers in the U.K., who are "helping young children to progress with their full capacity" and who, after more than 4700 tweets from citizens around the world, have assured the country that 35 million dollars will be spent in Rwanda not to be overlooked.
With the help of the U.K. government, charitable, national governments, and people like you, we can make a record of the history of low-emission social injustices," Pover of Neutrishon told viewers in a music workshop in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 efforts were made to improve the nutrition of mothers and children in the U.K., the government announced a power off diet project that would reach 50 million women and children with food aid.
What makes you think of the questions that are repeatedly asked on their website, "What do you think we can do to create poverty in a very bad way?"
The Global Citation said, "This will be a great and difficult way - sometimes we will fall and fail.
However, we will succeed, as we did in the past, as we were in the first century, and as we have seen, our strength has increased.
Jeanette Jackson, The Viking, Sean Mandes, Cardie B, Jeanelle Mone is one of some artists who will be part of the New York Soloman Society.
U.S. River can be used to stop electricity exports from Russia - externally
The U.S. Secretary of International Human Rights Jink has indicated that Washington Examminer will "if desired" to prevent Russia's entry into other marketplaces in the Middle East.
Zink has accused Russia's participation in Syria - particularly where Russia is working at the invitation of its rightful government - that is to find new markets in fuel.
"Because they're in the middle of Europe, I think they're going to be fuelled, like the southern part of Europe," says Zink.
And these are the ways and powers of God, according to the tradition of the princes.
They said, "If you need to ensure that their energy is not in the market, the United States will have the power to detonate if it is necessary to ensure that the sea routes remain open.
Zink Konzimmer Energy Alliance spoke before a program organized by a group working on the principle. It calls itself "The Voice of Energy Customers" in the U.S.
They compared Washington’s role in Russia and Iran’s dealings with Russia and described it as being more effective.
"Innovation and alternative energy use are less and less expensive in the face of Iran and Russia," they said, referring to Russia as "Wan Truck Pony", and Russia's economy is dependent on energy.
This widow has been helped by the administration of Trump as a result of their efforts to replace Russia with a free choice for European customers to increase exports of natural wind to Europe.
According to the U.S. President Donald Tramp, the authorities of North Stream 2 Pipeline's administration, are trying to get Germany out of the "invalid" project. According to the Tromp, this project has led to Berlin's "cage".
Moscow again insists that the $11,000 - dollar North Stream 2 pipeline project is a fully operational project that will double the current pipeline capacity by 11,000 cubic meters.
Cremlin argues that the opposition made by Washington is only because of economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"Urgy can't be a pressure source, and I think it's a common idea that customers should be selected by suppliers," said Russian Minister Alexander Novak of the U.S. Energy after a meeting in Moscow in September.
The U.S. purpose has been seriously undermined by Germany, and Germany has expressed its commitment to the project.
The Federal of Germany Institute for Industry in Germany (BDI) told U.S.A. to refrain from the U.S. energy industry and from the Eastern Western covenant in Berlin and Moscow.
"It is a big question for me when our energy supply is removed from third country," said the Federation of German Industry (BDI) President Dr. Kampf after the last meeting of the German Chancellor Angel Markel and the President of Russia, Blademir Putin.
Elitabeth Warren, president of the 2020 elections, said the meeting in Massachusetts would "be very careful".
Elizabeth Warren, a fellow member of the Massachusetts community, said on Saturday that the presidential elections following those mid-term elections would be "timely attentive".
In the middle of the 19th century, in the capital city of Holyoque, Massachusetts, Warren said that they would consider fighting the election.
"Now women are going to Washington and their corrupt government has come to celebrate, and a woman is also in agreement with the highest-ranking action," said De Hill.
"After November 6, I will pay close attention to the presidential election."
President Donald Trump said that "this county was in the wrong direction," Warren argued with Town Hall during the Trump.
They said, "I'm so worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our people."
Tramp and they have come to speak out in a clear speech in commenting on the Kundus designated by the Supreme Court.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "We need to check FBI before we can talk."
However, a survey published by Guru found that the majority of Warren’s own community do not believe that they will win a presidential election in 2020.
According to Safok University Political Research Centre/Boston Globe Pole, eight percent of the "possible" Massachusetts opinion that Warren should not fight election.
In the first century C.E., a group of anointed Christians, or “other sheep, ” made up of“ the faithful and discreet slave. ”
The vision of the poets showed that Maj Governer Hell Patrick received 38 percent more support for the possible election and 48 percent more support for opposition.
Other key democratic names in the 2020 poll on possible elections include the vice president of Biden and Bernie Sanders in Vermont.
According to the news reported by the Associated Press, Budin said that he was going to make official decisions until January.
Sara Palin set an example for the Pittsburgh of the Danube Trump meeting.
The 26 - year - old Track Palin spent a year in Iraq after being listed in September.

Palin referred to this attack as "the arrest of the army" and said about their son and other warriors, "When they come back, they are a little different, and they come back, thinking that their military brothers and each member of the army are honored here."

The full name of the parade in Greece, in contrast to the American Civil Liberties Union, has not been disclosed in August.
She said her partner "and the children of her violent gang" had abused her, but the U.S. officials refused her request on July 20th.
She had been arrested in Texas.
The prosecutors who supported Greece described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala as a country where the number of asylum seekers is high.
A recent U.S. earthquake followed a decision taken by the Board of Immigration Appeals in 2014, which allowed non-registered displaced persons to apply for access to asylum.
In a letter of thanks to General Carl Rezin of Colombia, he said that in a new campaign, "the rule of many decades has been ignored by the United Nations and international law."
"Federal law requires that all of the gifts for asylum be judged according to the particular facts and circumstances of the case, and that such a ban violates the law," says Fred-of-D' Court Brief.
According to the press, there is a greater possibility of becoming a professional in the field and "suppliers" in the press, the press further argued that the U.S. economy had been damaged by the refusal of entry into the field.
Attorney General Zef Sessens ordered foreign judges in June to no longer allow access to the asylum for victims of domestic violence and torture.
"Because they are members of a particular social group or political group, religion, religion, nationality, or religion, there is hope for those who leave the country because of fear or persecution," Sessin said in a statement on the campaign on 11 June.
All the problems that divide people around the world -- all the serious problems -- were never expected to be eliminated.
Increased number of deaths in the search for animals is a major factor in the survival of the victims
The situation was much worse for the living.
The mother of Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old, said, "He's feeling a lot of stress in the city of Palu's waste.
"Every minute a patient comes with a knife.
It's a waste of clean water."

Hundreds of people were injured, and 7.5 were injured by earthquakes.
Some of the broken - down wounds, including two Harrises, were resting outside the Palu Army Hospital, where the patient was being treated out of the hospital because of persistent severe reactions.
When the earthquake struck his wife and daughter in the fifth room in the hotel room, his eyes filled with tears.
"There was no time to save yourself.
I think I was pushed under the roof of the wall," Harris told the Associated Press, saying that his family had been married in the city.
"I heard my wife cry for help, but then she calmed down.
I don’t know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they'll be safe."
The U.S. ambassador accused China of "daddy" with the help of "dadgery"
One week after the official Chinese newspaper reported on four pages of U.S. trade disputes in a U.S. daily, the U.S. government in China held a ban on the use of the U.S. press to spread the message of the U.S. government.
On Wednesday, 6 November, after the U.S. President Donald Tramp was charged with a ban on the election of the U.S. Congress, which China sent a report on China's social agenda in China at the top of the U.S. state of Petallah - Iowa.
China is accused of trying to interfere with the U.S. elections. According to U.S. officials, Washington is a new chapter in China's growing culture of pressure on China.
Although advertising by the foreign government is a common topic for trade, the current growing trade wars in Beijing and Washington appear to have resulted in the spread of imports of one another.
The Chinese and American experts say that the Chinese and U.S. states that China had to influence exporters in the countries that supported the Republican Trapp, such as Iowa, which was founded at the beginning of the war.
According to China’s long - term governor of agrarians, U.S.A., China’s ambassador, Teri Branstad, said that the seed had damaged American workers, farmers, and businesses.
In an article in the Dos Moines Register, Branstad writes, "China is now twice the custom of giving a press release in our own free journal."
"The Chinese government is promoting its own reasoning in Deis Moines, and is taking advantage of the free speech of the United States and the freedom of the press," says Branstad.
"On the contrary, there is a lack of opposition in the newspapers put on the streets of Beijing, and there is no real picture of China's different opinions on China's difficult economic development, because the media is under the strict control of China's Communist side," they write.
They added, "A Chinese newspaper's main newspaper has cleared the offer of publishing their articles," they did not mention the name of the paper.
Analysts have warned that women are being deceived by the defeat of the pre - Middle Ages of the Republic of Cavano
The Supreme Court, which is responsible for various cases of sexual harassment, has been warned by researchers on the basis of many top republics standing and protecting them, especially in future mid-term elections, which will lead to women being beaten.
This is so strong that most Republicans are officially showing that they are going to think about it.
These things can't be reversed," said Professor of the Royalology at the Maxwell University University, Grant Riher, quoted in the article released in The Hill on Saturday.
Rehir said that Senator Jeff Flick (R-Arizona) is confident that it will be enough to calm those who are angry to check for FBI.
According to the Washington D.C. Newspaper, "What has happened will not be forgotten by women -- they will not forget tomorrow, nor will they forget in November," said the senior consultants of the former group Muvian, as well as national speakers, Karen Gene-Pierre.
On Friday morning, following a witness from Dr. Christine Blasi Ford, the representatives of the Republican Cavano, who are in charge of the judicial committee, announced that November is coming.
"Democrat's enthusiasm and motivation are running out," said U.S. political analyst Stu Rodenburg.
"People say it's already on top; it's true.
But it can grow more, especially in the sub-city of the poor women, as well as in the 18-to-29-year-olds who don't like presidents when they don't like them."
The Forddoor also suggested public evidence describing the charges of sexual harassment against the designated High Court, that the analysts agree with the Republicans and that they be able to take a stand against the person designated by the Supreme Court.
"Now there's been such confusion for the GOP," said NBC News president Michael Steel of the Republican National Committee last week.
"It's only about the opinion of the committee or the final opinion or the selection of the cavan, but it's not limited, how the Republicans handled this process and how they dealt with it," said G. Cecil, manager of the Priority USA Group, who helped to select Democrats.
However, on the background of Ford and Cavana Witnesses in the United States, there seems to be a slight lack of confidence in who to trust.
If 41 percent of respondents believe in the new police force, or if they believe in Ford's testimony, 35 percent say they believe in Cavana.
In addition, 38 percent said that only 30 percent of those who were falsely accused of lying during the time of the witness were found to be true or possibly false.
After Flake’s request, The Guardian reported that F.I. Ford and at least another prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, were investigating the charges.
During the last week, Ford testified to the oath before the Sinait justice committee that at the age of 17, Cavano attacked them with alcohol.
Ramirez charged that in the 1980s, while he was studying in a party, the name of the Supreme Court revealed his ring to him.
There are plans to start a new Internet for the parents of the World Wide Web to deal with Google and Facebook
World Wide Web researcher Tim Burns is starting a start that will face the rivals Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of famous technology, 'Inrupt', is based on the free source platform of Burns-lie.
How to store solid data for solid users, and what information is available to allow them to access it.
In a special interview with the Fast Company, Burns-Lie stated that the purpose of the Inerpt is to "innovate the world".
"We have to do this now," they said about the startup.
"This is a historic moment."
People use this Ap solid technology to create their own "Real Online Data Storage" or POD.
It can contain contact lists, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and practical tools.
It is similar with Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slag, and SPOTIFY at the same time and at the same time.
This is the special case of a personal online data storage that will be completely accessible to the user.
The company is called "the personal capacity of the data media".
According to CIO, John Bruce, the company’s idea of inerption is to bring resources, processes, and skills to each one of them.
In the company, Burns-lie, Bruce, and IBM are part of a community of developers' working class and volunteer codes that have been agreed to work on the project.
Since this week, technology developers around the world will be able to use the tools available on our website to develop their own online apps.
Burns-li said that he and his team are not talking about making a complete change in their business models at night.
"We don't ask for their permission."
On Saturday's media post, Burns-lie writes that "the objectives of the inerption are to help sustain the integrity and quality of the new web that has been created on solids."
In 1994, Burns-line had transformed the Internet into a global wide Web Consortium in Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Burns-line voiced an effective voice in net neutrality disputes.
Even when inept is launched, Burns-ley will remain the founder and manager of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
"I am very hopeful for the future of Web," Burns-lie added.
Bernard Van: World War I was celebrated by Victoria Cross.
In the first world war, the church of England, which won the victory of Victoria Cross, was celebrated 100 years later.
On September 29, 1918, L.
However, four days later, they were killed by a group of secret soldiers and never knew that they had received the highest honor.
On Saturday, at a parade in Riskeden, Northamptonshire, their two relatives ignored the temple that they had built for their memory.
One of their grandsons, Michael Van, said that after the 100-year anniversary of his grandfather's award-winning power, Brober was "very negative.
According to London Gazette, September 29, 1918, Colonel Van passed the Canal de Saint-Quentin through the Canal of St.
They then went on to the firing line and, alone, went on to the "very powerful" line before they lost three fingers to the ground to face the tolls on the ground.
About a month before the end of the war, the German Sniper killed Colonel Van on October 4, 1918.
Michael Van, 72, said his dad's actions "I'm never going to be able to do it, but it's devastating."
He and his brother, Dr. James Van, also made many sacrifices under the leadership of Brandwood Imperial Uth Band.
Michael Wan said, "They were very proud to participate in the parade," and they said, "Because of the support given to the whole people, they showed the glory of the real man."
MMA wanted to watch a 206 ticket all night, but they had to get to Peppa Pig.
Imagine that you were awake all night to watch a flashlight of 206, but you refused to show the main program.
There were 13 battles in San Jose’s room, which included six battles on the main card and would be displayed directly over channel 5 at night.
In the morning, when Gerard Muci and Rory McDonald were ready to face each other, his cover was not a sign of Pepa Pig, but it was a shock to the viewers of the Yukon.
In particular, some who had been awake for that war had been discouraged until the morning.
One of the kids wanted to be filmed on Twitter as "a kind of cruel joke."
After asking about the program, "In the morning, 6 votes in the government's order, they had to program children because the content was not available," said senior head of the newsletter, Dave Schwartz.
"Peppa the Pig," yes.
The president, Scott Koker, of the Bulletin, said that they would review their journals in order to bring together the viewers in the future.
"I think we could do this when I thought of Repley," Koker said.
"But there were six o'clock in the morning, and we couldn't do it until the evening.
But we are working on it.
Believe me, that after they were changed, the message came to them in abundance, and they were not all friendly.
We were trying to eliminate him, and we felt that it was a technical problem.
But that was not the case, but it was a government procedure.
I can promise that this will no longer happen.
We always put five wars in place, and we tried to give more to those who wanted, but we failed in them.
It was a miserable situation."
Desert Island Disks: Tom Delhi felt "undeserved" by sexuality
As the Olympic divorcée, Tom Delly began to feel dejected because of his sexuality — but was motivated to succeed.
24-year-old Daily said, "Everyone's not like me," I didn't know until I went to high school.
The first radio 4 desserts presented by Lauren Lavern on the record told others about the rights of homosexuals to provide "hope".
They also said that they were less interested in winning the Olympics because of their parents ’ upbringing.
For example, during World War II, the number of Witnesses in the United States increased by about a quarter of the population.
Deli said when she was disfellowshipped at the first event in LaVern that she felt "lowly" when she was growing up, because "children and girls didn't like the community."
They said, "To this day is the desire of the flesh and the desire of the eyes, that I may have strength and might."
They said I was supposed to show them that I'm "one" so they wouldn't be disappointed when people actually know about their sex.
In the Olympics, the Daily High-Professional LGBT became a publisher of two-time Constables, and they used their presence in the national competition in Australia this year to ask more countries not to view homosexuality as a criminal offence.
And they said, Because they feared not to be deceived by their actions, but to live freely, and to show them hope.
The three-time World Cup winners said to fall in love with Dustin Lans Black, who met in 2013, in 2013 -- "they were adorable."
Delie married a 20 - year - old Austrian winner, but she said that it was no problem at all.
"When you were so young," they first took part in the Olympics when they were 14 and then their father's cancer died in three years -- they said it's hard to find a person of this age who's so advanced.
In ancient times, Robert Rea-Black-Deley became the father of this son, and Deli said that his "full view" had changed.
"If you'd asked me last year, 'I'd have told you to win the tournament," they said.
"You know, there are more important things than the Olympics.
Robbie is my Olympic poet."
His son, Robert, was named after his father, who died of brain cancer in 2011.
Deli said that her father did not accept that they were going to die, and one of the last things they had to say was that they had come to London for 2012 because they wanted to sit in the first race.
"You won't be able to sit in the first row, Dad," they said.
"When they finally took the breath, I was held in their hands and I wasn't sure that they weren't alive until their breath really stopped and died," they said.
The following year, Delie won the championship in the 2012 Olympics.
"I knew that what I had dreamed of in my whole life--to dive in the Olympic games before home viewers, couldn't be more of a high profile than that," they said.
She was also inspired by the choice of his first song - the beautiful wife of Hyder Smol - who eats together in the preparation of the Olympics and is still standing on her forehead.
Desert Island Disks on BBC Radio 4 is on Sunday 11:15 BST.
Michaelson, who is not in the form, took the extra to play for the driver’s cup.
The U.S. Phil Michaelson on Sundays will be playing his 47th or the rider’s cup, making a new turn, but he will have to get his form back so that it will not be damaged.
Michaelson, according to 12 times in this two-year-old event, is playing him as an extra player for the Forbols and for the Forsams of the Golden Jim Furik Saturday.
Instead of participating in a prominent game, as he always does for the United States, the five - hour major winner encouraged his day and divided the hope of removing the part that caused the game.
Although his career has never been the easiest driver, 48 - year - old Michaelson is not an example of a golf national course that never forgives the long - term consequences of a wrong course.
And if the course is not as challenging as it may be, Michaelson will face the British Open-ended Francisco Molinarian, who has formed a union with Tommy Fleetwood to win every four weeks.
In the absence of a good start, if the Americans have four qualities behind them, it can be very important to meet Michaelson.
But the nobleman believed not in his own games, but in his own words.
"Today he fully understands his role, he pauses on my back and puts his hand around my throat and says he'll be ready tomorrow," Furik said.
"There's a lot of self-confidence in it.
He is a Hall of Fame, and he has given them much in advance and this week.
I could not imagine that he would play in front of two people.
I thought I'd do more, but that's what I'm supposed to do, and I think we should go this way.
He wants to be there just as everyone else wants to be."
Michaelson will break the track of the most extreme matches of the biker cup played on Sunday.
Maybe it's the end of his bike, which can't be equal to the height of his personal wheel.
Michaelson won in the 18th, lost 20 and escaped in seven, Furic said that his presence earned the company an unimaginable value.
"That stranger, he's a rapist, he's a joke and he likes people's fun and he's the best person to be with," he explained.
"There will be fun for young players with him, as well as this week, who will like to meet.
It's not just a game, it's more than he's giving."
Europe’s continent, Thomas Borne, knows that a massive earthquake can soon be gone
Toms Borne, a European poet, knows from experience that the last day’s rider can easily be turned into an unscrupulous wheel in front of the single front of a single front.
In 1997, Dane dedicated his life to the Valderama campaign, when five men were attacked by the Civ Balestero leader, but when he finished in front of the U.S.A., only 14 1⁄2-131 1⁄2, were defeated by the smallest difference.
"We had a big attack in Valderama; we had a big attack in Brooklyn, where we lost, and we won Valderama, but only a little bit of a difference," said Born in February 2018 and two five-thirds of the time class, which led to a 10-6 attack at Le Golf National.
History will show me and everyone in that organization that this is not over.
You will have to pay the full amount in the morning.
Go therefore and make disciples of people of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the holy spirit, teaching them to observe all the things I have commanded you. ”
This does not end until you have seen the properties of the board.
Our goal is to win the race, and we will stay focused on it.
I said, "I will look at the twelve games on our side, but we know who is on the other side. Let's play the greatest games in the world."
His players rejoiced at the show on the hard golf course and said, "I can never go in front of me.
Today’s challenges are different.
And it shall come to pass in the morning, that every one shall do according to all that he hath done, and according to all that he hath done, so shall it be done unto them.
When you start playing with your mate, it’s better to play with your spouse, but when you get there alone, how can you become a golfer?
The same message you have to give to the players, or you can do the best you can tomorrow.
Now you're leaving your mate and going to show him the best."
On the contrary, Furik, in the opposition group, will pay more attention to improving his personal display than those shown by his players, except for Rodon Speith and Justin Thomas, who gained three of them.
Furik himself turned Europe against "the miracle of the moon" before the defeat, both sides of the great tournaments of the last-day day were part of the winning association.
In 1999, Krenson asked his players how they were going on the last day. He said, "I remember every word of it."
"We have 12 important faces today, but as you've seen in Brooklyn, as you've seen in Medina, you're going to have to start quickly.
When he is on his way, he puts great pressure on the faces of others.
Let's set our line-ups, and we'll keep our players in the wait to see what we're going to do tomorrow."
Thomas was sent to the office to work to try to fit in, and he had to face Rory McCallory at the top, as well as Paul Cassie, Justin Daily, John Raham, and Tommy Fleetwood, who were in the middle of the other Europeans.
"I put these players in order because I thought they'd cover all sides," said Born as he talked about his only choices.
Germany’s new warship was reappeared
The latest war on Germany's Nadlah was to be launched in 2014, but local media reported that they would not be loaded at least until the following year because of the bad system and high prices.
According to the report by Dia Citt, the operation of the "Royland-Fage" boat in the Battle of Baden-Vuttburg-category is now blocked until the first six months of 2019.
This ship was supposed to be loaded in 2014, but after a worrying distribution, problems followed the future of this important project.
Nadalla will come to take up the battle force of the four Baden-Vuttburg-type ships in the Bremen-category, which were requested in 2007.
It is understood that there will be a powerful sound, aerospace, aerospace, and aerospace, as well as some hidden technologies, such as radar, aerospace, and a radio signal.
Other key features include long - term maintenance - the latest battles must be able to keep away from the doors of the house for two years.
However, the long - term meaning of modern warships — Germany’s demonstration of power on the sea — when it is loaded into service, Di Zitt entered.
In the past year, poor F.125 war broke out when German Nadal officials refused to operate the ship and returned him to the Lom And Fos Shipyard in Hamburg.
For the first time that the ship was divided back to the ship, the ship was under the control of the ship.
There was not much information about the reasons for the return, but the German media reported that there were many important "software and hardware offences" and that the warships were not suitable for anti-Momism.
The lack of software was particularly important because the vessel of Baden-Wuttburg-Class will be run by 120 nomadics - half the human strength of the fighting waves of the old Brimen.
It also appeared that the ship was too heavy to carry out its task and that it would not be able to be classed in the future.
7.000-tona is considered to be twice as important as the same-class ships used in World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the entire project has been a problem with the training of the team’s price - driver.
It has reached €2.2 billion from the beginning - amazing to €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion).
In the wake of a warning that the power of the German fleet is diminishing, the problems that have arisen in the last battleships are of particular importance.
At the beginning of this year, the German Defence Committee, Hans-Peter Bartelsini, admitted that the Noodles are actually "exactly closed."
The ruler said that the time has come, because the ship was already in the power of the guard, but the new boat was not in their place.
They regretted that there was no ability to engage in any war in the Baden-Vuttburg-category.
Nationalists steal and steal about the secret life of thieves
And new research was made in the mountains, in the land of Scotch, in the search of the ground for food.
It is hoped that new research will shed light on the behavior of an immortal creature and will help guide the further expansion of the work.
The study of National Trust of Scotland researchers will take place in the Invirive Gardens in Western Rhodes, soprano Pipestrales, as well as in the long-cana and Dobington caverns.
A special sound seal will be placed at the free location of the property for the purpose of tracking the activity of the chariot during the entire Passover.
NHS workers and volunteers will also use head-deal detectors to search mobile.
Experts on all sound systems will determine the frequency of the call of the speakers and determine what people are doing.
The map and reports of natural habitats will then be prepared to expand the landscape-scale of their behaviour.
NTS nature conservation consultants, Rob Dever, hope that the results will reveal what areas of natural housing are important to residents and how each population uses it.
The benefits of the management of natural habitats will help to determine the best way to maintain the soil for the creation of grass and vegetation and for other associated populations.
In the last century, the number of caves in Scotland and in the United States has declined significantly.
Building and developing works have put them in danger of losing their natural habitat and habitat.
The wind turbines and lighting also pose dangers, as well as some chemical processes in flypers and construction materials, as well as attacks on morals.
In fact, the Bible says that “the eyes of the blind ones will be opened and the very ears of the deaf ones will be unstopped. ”
Yet, because of the habit of killing them in the night, their ears are more open than their eyes.
They use a modern eco-location system to track the holes and obstacles in their path.
NTS has taken very seriously the responsibility to care for 270 historic buildings throughout the country, 38 important gardens, and 76,000 hectares of land.
There are ten trained scientists who regularly search for, watch, and even perform shelters.
The organization set up the first and only - begotten Reservoir of Scotland, in the Three East in Dmfrez and Galves, which is home to eight of Scotland’s ten natives.
The director of the estate, David Thompson, said that the estate was an exemplary land for them.
"There's a good area for coaches here," they said.
"We have old buildings, plenty of old trees and all good natural housing.
However, there are a number of things that we do not yet know about the carriages, which will help us to understand more about what we are doing here and other things that are necessary for their well-being."
They stress the need to examine the environment before preserving the property, because it can destroy the single parenthood, which can cause the death of 400 women and children, and the risk of the destruction of the local population.
It is a crime to kill, torture, or harm them or to destroy them permanently.
The Scottish government of Trust’s Voyager Elizabeth Feralini encouraged people to help.
They said, "We want to learn a lot about our natives, because we don't know how many of our peoples are there."
Ronaldon also filed charges of rape, and the prosecutors prepared to charge the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo made it possible for the charges of rape against him to be "false news" and people called him "the one who wants to preach it."
The prosecutors, Der Spigel, who was accused, prepared to bring charges against the German press.
In 2009, a woman named Catherine Mayorga, in Portugal, and Juventus Foreward, was accused of rape at a hotel in Las Vegas.
Der Spigel reported on a thank - you note that she was reluctant to pay $375.000 to stop the incident.
Intagram from the video immediately after a few hours of Dawabe's report, 33-year-old Ronaldo made it possible to talk to his 142-year-old followers from the video.
"No, no, no, no, no.
That's the false news they said today," the five-time Ballan D'Oir was speaking in front of the camera.
"They want to preach themselves by using my name.
It is common.
They are seeking fame with my name, but this is part of the work.
I am a happy man, and all things are good." He said to me with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to bring charges against Der Spiegel, who they consider to be "an unfavourable account of the situation in the region".
Lawyer Christine Shertz said that playing "can require a degree of completeness of the violation of moral decay, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent times."
In June 2009, the issue of Awake! was brought to the fore in a suite at Pams Hotel and Casino, in Las Vegas.
According to the documents presented in Clark County District Court in Nevada, after meeting at Night Club, Ronaldo and Myorga returned to the playroom, where he attacked her ass.
Myorg claimed that after the incident, Ronaldo was standing on his lap and told her that he was "99 percent" a "good man" and "one percent" discouraged him.
The document claims that Ronaldo accepted sexual relations, but it stated that he was in agreement.
Major also claimed that she had gone to the police and had photos of her injuries taken to her hospital, but then she agreed to explain out of court because she felt "fear of justice" and worried about being "publicly humiliated."
34-year-old Majorga says she's now snooping because she's still scared because of the alleged incident.
When the attack was launched, Ronaldo Manchester was ready to join the Royal Madrid, and in this year, he went to the Italian giant Juvey.
Brigitt: Uke will beat Karmakrana if you'll're sorry'
In the wake of a breakout, the company said that if the world leader in car production had to be defeated, he would be "repentant."
They further said that "the father of the age" was Toyota Yukon told Bissie that if they left the U.S., they would stop the production of the factory in Bernston, near Durban.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese company said that if No-Dal is broken, the labor force can get worse because of the delay.
Burnston Platt - a production of rice and avensis - has been exported to the European Union in 90 per cent of the last year's production of nearly 150,000 cars.
"I think that if Britain left the end of March, we'll see that our factory's production has stopped," said executive director Marvin Cook of Toyto's Burnston.
Honda, BMW and other UK car manufacturers, including the World Land Rober, expressed concern about how border trade would go without the deal.
For example, B.M.W. says that a month after the breakout, they will keep their mining plant in Oxford.
If the No-Dal is broken, it is the main concern of the industry that the supplier will be in danger of a link.
The Toyota production line is based on a principle that is free from Uke and Jehu suppliers every 37 minutes for the task done on demand.
If the U.S.A. leaves no more than 29 March, the border may be reversed, and the industry may think that it can be delayed and reduced.
Toyota would not be able to keep more than a day’s worth in the drugstore, and the company believes that the production will be stopped.
Mr. Clark said that Thessa Mei's plans for future relations with the EU are "exactly fragmented so that they can be avoided on the border."
"We need a perfect one for ourselves. We need a perfect one, as I said, not only to make us happy for now, but we need to take advantage of this opportunity," they said in the BBC4 program today.
"This evidence is not only from Toota, but also from other producers, for whom we need to keep these things, which will make the supply chain very successful."
Toyota was unable to say how long the production would continue, but in the long run, it warned that increased costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant, and that the workers would be affected.
Peter Suvleris, who worked in Bernstone for 24 years and had a United Union Chancellor in that plant, said that his members were very concerned: "I've learned that their employees have gone to work once and for all, and they're never coming back.
A government spokesman said, "We have made a real and reliable plan for our future relations with Jehu."
The white house said that the meetings with Rosenstein could be extended again.
Donald Tramp's deputation of Attorney General Rod Rosenstein's high-level meeting with the Supreme Court called Bret Kwanu "can be clouded for another week," said White House on Sunday.
Roshenstein oversees the work of Special Rapporteur Robert Mueller, in which there is a review of the possible resistance of Russia’s election to arms, troops, and Russian forces.
In Washington, D.C., Washington, D.C., the U.S.
At the beginning of this month, New York Times reported that Rosenstein had set up a virus to record the discussion with Trump, which enabled the national authorities to eliminate the 25th revision.
“ I felt that I could not accept the truth, ” she says.
On Monday, however, they went to the White House, and at the time, they had a discussion of their political name.
At that time, a Sunday meeting was announced with Tromp, U.S.A., in New York.
Tramp said that they would "not like to take Roshenstein out," but the meeting was held to prevent him from being heard by the Senate jury, in which Kundu and one of the women charged with sexual abuse, Dr. Christian Blossom's Ford was to be witnessed.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week’s FBI examination to investigate the charges against Kundu, which led to a further extension of the whole synnetic opinion.
The tramp press was released, and Sara Sanders Fox was present on the news.
When asked about Roshenstein's meeting, they said, "It's not a date, it may be this week, I think it might be a week after looking at the other cases that have been brought before the Supreme Court.
But we see, and I always like to keep the press informed."
Some reporters argued that Sanders did not describe the White House press since September 10th.
“ I’m not sure, ” he said, “that’s why I’m here, ” he said.
They also said that there was no "survival" of TV reporters for less than what Sanders said: "I'm not denying this reality."
They later suggested that direct contact between the tramp and the press will increase."
"These presidents are hosting more questionnaire sessions than any of their predecessors," they said, and they failed to provide the evidence later: "We have seen them now."
The details will continue to be given, Sanders said, but "If the papers were able to ask U.S. state officials directly, they would be much better than talking to me.
We're doing a lot of work, and in the last few weeks, you're going to be doing it, and when you talk to the presidents of the United States, they're going to be able to give the press details."
When you leave the white house or when you are in open session or when you are in the office of high officials, you regularly listen to the drums.
The only magazines that are available are the brochures.
During this week’s program, the presidents may have shown the reason for presenting immortality and miracles in front of the assembled newspapers.
Health - care professionals wrote to euworkers in NHS Scotland about the anxiety of the British.
Healthcare professionals wrote to thank the EU workers working in Scotland's NHS and to express their desire to live after Brexit.
Gene Freeman M.S.P. sent a letter for less than six months to get out of the U.S.
The Scottish government has been reluctant to grant permanent requests for EU citizens working in public services that are responsible for us.
In his letter, Ms. Freeman writes: "The whole age, the Uke and the EU, was divided, which are expected to be decided in the future.
However, the U.S. government is also preparing for the situation without a possible cure.
I know that it is time for you all to be very anxious.
For that reason, I would like to reiterate that no matter what nationality they have, I consider the contribution of each member of the working class to be very valuable.
In Jehu’s day, Jehovah’s Witnesses are active in the preaching work.
We really want Scotland to be your home, and we want you to stay here.
After the head was injured, the Christian Abercromb was executed with immediate surgery.

Many of the country's current areas – especially in capital – have been the result of foreign buyers who have become "goldish cities" because they spend most of their time out of the country.
The printery was announced just a few weeks after the coffee shop was announced to help most of the young people in Boris Johnson to buy their first home.

But playing can be difficult.
You have to go through many things each week.
Today, I also face pressures and pressures, but I still feel that the rules are appropriate.
I always wanted to manage, and now I'm doing it, and I feel the most satisfied I've been working my whole adult life in my own way."

According to the report, the exact time for drinking is on Saturday evening at 5.30 p.m.
The heat in those years has increased the pressure on the restaurant’s connections.
According to the report, the majority of the population in the United States have been affected by the decline in the number of people living in the United States, and the increase in the number of people living in the United States is a major factor in the number of people living in the United States.
In July, Peter Martin, who has compiled a series of essays, said: "The longer part of the sun's light and the long part of the world's English perspective, the more the month before June, the greater the risk of the restaurant was 2.8 percent.

Online opinions fell on the paper of the Brest pump, which compared the mothers to cows.
A breast pump company broke out in an online newspaper that compares the milking of women to milking cows.
While launching the "first silent breast pump in the world", Konjumer Tek Company launched a video showing the mothers who had the freedom to re-supply Elvini, a provocative musical campaign.
In a room full of cows, four real mothers dance on the locks of the song, saying, "Yes, I give milk, but you can't look at my neck," and, "If you don't notice, they don't look, they're mine."
And the damsel said unto him, Smite, I pray thee, with my little ones, and cast them out, and I will take the young women's milk.
However, this newspaper, published on the Facebook page of this company, has raised an online dispute.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of voices, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, who thought that many people's dairy industry had taken the "thress" very seriously.
"It is a very bad decision to use cows for the advertising of this product."
In just a few days of birth, the exception is being avoided, they become pregnant like us, and they give birth to the baby for milk," she wrote.

Another wrote, saying, "Truly the mother and the child are miserable.
But why do they not use breast-feed for the sake of the mother, who have laid children for themselves?
Another writes, "It's an unsubstantiated newspaper."
Where others supported the campaign, a woman accepted the song as a "museum."
"I think it's a great idea.
If I were yet to drink, I would have taken one.
I felt like a cow when I was growing up.
I feel that this is a little fast, but I feel that I am good for what I have done.
It's an extraordinary product," one wrote.
And another wrote, "It's in the funny newspaper for mothers who are pumping (particularly at their place of work or in the processing room) and who think they're singing."
There is no advertising in this publication that commends or predicts the dairy industry."
The group of women in the final video shows that they regularly danced in their weddings.
The idea behind this campaign is based on the views of many women who use breast-pump.
However, the Elvi pump is completely quiet, it has no star or nostril, and it sits right in the nursing brah, which gives women the freedom of movement, the ability to catch children, and even go out during the camping.
Participants in Madrid and ICD Anna Ballerin commented: Elvi pump is a transversal product that needs to be launched in an open and exciting way.
By showing sympathy between the women and the dogs in the doppelgangers, we had to be able to see the wonderful freedom we're giving the new pump, a entertaining and connected way, to bring the breast pumping and all its challenges to light.
This is not the first time that Elvi’s bomb hits.

Hundreds of displaced children quietly moved to the tent camp on the Texas border.
The number of displaced children who have been taken into custody has increased in part, even though the monthly border crossings have not been altered in a comparable way, since it has been difficult to keep children with the teachers by means of hard language and warnings provided by the Trump administration.
In the meantime, most managers themselves have moved on without papers and are afraid to endanger their own ability to keep a child in that country.
In June, when the Federal Office announced that potential managers and other adult members of their home would have to push their boots, and that it would be available to the local authorities, it grew.
In the past week, the chief of immigration and customs personnel witnessed to the convention of Matthew Albenz, who said that the Agency had arrested some people who had asked them to plan for noncombatants.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of the detainees had no prior criminal records.
"There are about 80 percent of people who are teachers or family members who are teachers, and a large part of them are involved in criminal acts.
Therefore we have begun to follow after such a people," said Mr. Albens.
In order to speed up the process of children, the authorities have introduced new rules, according to Selter Works, since some of them have been arrested, instead of having to be in court within 60 days.
Many will attend the video conference instead of being personally present for legal status before the transfer judge.
For those who will be saved, there will be an immediate withdrawal from the land.
According to reports from Selter Works and the machines in recent months, children may be more anxious or discouraged, which can cause violence or run away.
The lawyer says that the problem is growing in large ways, such as tornillo, where children with large numbers of children find themselves in extreme conflict.
They added that the children who are taken to the tent city are being hit by the children who are already fighting.
Syria ordered the US, French and Turkish "completed soldiers" to leave the country immediately.
Speaking at the UN General Meeting, Foreign Minister Walid Al-Mulem, even though the country's war has now reached its eighth year, said that Syria's refugees should return to the country.
Mulem, who are also vice presidents, said that the foreign forces on Syria's territory have been lawless in the wake of the war of terror, and "will be treated properly."
"They should fall out of the country quickly and not get caught," they said at the meeting.

On the question of refugees, Valem said that the situation was good for them to return, but they blamed "any foreign country" for spreading fear without interference, which moved them to stay away from refugees.
We have asked the international community and humanity to guide them back," they said.

The U.S. diplomats say that Russia and Turkey have had a chance to establish a buffer zone in the final major rebel Baaliclah of the last part of the Idlib between Russia and Turkey.
The Russian-Turkish treaty has prevented a large-scale attack on Russian forces, supported by Russia's military forces, where 30 million people live.
However, Molem stressed that this was a "precisely fixed time" for the treaty, and they hoped that the army's actions in the battle against Al-Qaeda would serve as a target for the war in Nazareth, and that it would be the first to be launched.
The Union's ambassador, Stefan De Mistura, hopes that the first meeting of a new committee of government and opposition members will soon be held to create a post-war event for Syria and to open the way for elections.
At the meeting of the Syrian government in Mulemani, he stated that the panel’s work should be limited to the time of the current event and warned against any of its actions.

However, El Salvador was only considered punishing, which in 2017 had received US$ 14 million, including the control, development, and economic assistance of chemicals.
The proposed punishment, which included the provision of copper and targeted visas, would make the country in Central America very painful because the country has a large number of unemployed people and workers.
As the meeting was held in front of the meeting, officials from North America and Central America, in order to follow up the same year's conference, which was considered a step forward for the United States-led change in efforts to stop, concluded a high-level review of security and economic prosperity.

On Saturday, more qualities than Louis Hamilton, when the Voltaire’s Bots came to power, it became clear that the command of the Mercedes band would now be important in this race.
Bots had already made a good start in Poland, taking up the first two torso of Hamilton, and had brought up Hamilton, so it was time for the Bethel to give up the game in his own company.
Hamilton left the last package in traffic and went to the hotel earlier in Pitts. In fact, this action had to be decisive.

Christine Blase Ford has accused the Naomi Brett Cavango of the Supreme Court of sexual harassment. However, according to President Donald Tramp of the meeting held on Saturday, Fenstein said that this claim was false at the meeting.
At a meeting in West Virginia, the presidents of Direct Ford did not mention the testimony given by the Sinet Jewish Committee to Ford, saying that what started in the Sinet shows how many people have become 'personal, angry, and liars'."
"What's going on there since the last few days in the synnet, what can happen... when you see anger there, you see these people angry, angry, selfish, and lying."
"When you look at the famous letters, she leaves and then says... oh... I'm not done."
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Dana Fenstein, have you done this?
Remember the answer... did you leave these papers... "What did you say?"
Oh, no.
I didn't leave her."
Come on, wait a minute.
We didn't do it, we didn't do it," the presidents declared it in the style of the cinter.
Ford was sent to Fenstein, in the anti-Kavango anti-subsidiary in July and left at the beginning of September... but Fenstein denied that this letter had been sent from his office.
I did not hide the charges of Dr. Ford, but the report by the De Heil Reporter, says that I did not leave their letter.
They told me to keep it secret, and so I kept it.
But their unbelief was not in the council, but for a Sabbath, saying, "I tell you, it is an evil thing to do."
They may not have done it, but it is all evil that I have seen to this day."
Three women accused of sexual misconduct were told by the president of the Supreme Court that these democracies were using these charges for their benefit.
They are to be restored to power in any way they can.

In New York, a Nanny in New York, who reduced his work by "Difference" was brought to court by a couple.
The mother, who complains that she is a "one of the most talented people", is taking a Nanny couple in New York to court after she mismanages us from the work that she has done.
They're claiming to be the type of "censorship" they've been charged with by a married couple.
The new woman who came to care for the children in 2016 found it to be ingenious to see that her first job was to support the two children’s mother, Lance Plasco-Flexman.
"NASSSSSSSSSSSSSS too is another song" wrote by São Plasco-Flexman to send to the groom.
However, instead of sending the message to the bride, she failed to send the message to Miss Morris twice.
After this confusion came to light, Pasco-Flexman removed Mrs. Morris from work.
In time, however, she was able to return to the United States, where she was assigned to serve as a traveling overseer.
Now Mr. Morris is in court to reduce the cost of work. For six months, they are asking for more than $350 per day. They were employed with full-time fans, but no deal has been made for this.
"I have to show them that you can't do that," they said to the Friday Post newspaper, "I know it's a difference."
The couple's claim that there's a written relationship between the couple and Miss Morris is no longer able to trust them, and that they're just trying to get them out of work.
"My wife misdirected what she didn't want to say to them."
That is not the case.
We don't have people to write," said Joel Plascone.
"Can a man give children in his own hand after you have treated them? Or wouldn't he be foolish?"
Will you give the child to him in your youth?
It's impossible."
Plasco said his wife was born two months ago and is now in a very difficult situation.
"Who's following someone like that?"
"That's not a very good thing," said the businessman Plasco with an investment bank.
Even though the Court’s case is still pending, the Court of Justice of the European Communities has left the case on the basis of social media, and its conduct and arguments have been strongly criticized.
The publishers of Paddington were so concerned that they could not accept the idea of a reader. It has been opened from a new letter.
After the book was accepted, Karen, the daughter of the soon-born Bond, said about the letter: "It's hard to understand what the first person to read is before the book is recognized."
It's very fun to know what we know about the great success of Paddington."
After working as a cameraman in BBC, the book was rejected by the father, who wrote books for children, even though the book was rejected. He also said that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book was 'commissioned' because of their humiliation last year.
She describes Padington as "the most important member of our family" and says that the father of the final success was very proud.
"They were very quiet. They never had to sound their own words," she said.
"But Padington was really in a position for them, so that if our son succeeds, he's actually proud of us without our duty.
I believe that they have seen the success of Paddington in this way.
It was their creation and their imagination, but they always gave the credit to Padington."
My daughter was counting the last part, and I had to call her on the phone
After Lading, her daughter was taken to a hospital in Nice’s Luo Beach, where doctors tried to save her, but they were worthless.
"Nad was calling me regularly and saying that the situation is very bad. She doesn't think she's coming out of it," said Dr. Ednan-Lappreuz.
"Mag came to me on the nad's phone and he said that she was going to die in the next two minutes and I wanted to call her good.
I told her that I wanted to help her.
I said, "Well, I love you, baby.
I will be with you soon.
I will be with you.
The doctors gradually reduced the effect of the medications that her heart was pumping, and the whole procedure was stopped.
She had died a short time earlier, and everything was going on.
I just wanted to sit down and wait, and I knew that everything was going on.
I was not able to cry, nor to cry, neither could I cry; for I had many families and people around me.
I have had enough of myself."
At the end of the day, Ednan-Lapperos sat on the plane with the other passengers in sorrow for their daughter's sake, not knowing what they were going through.
"No one knew," she said.
"I had put the honor down and kept turning my tears away from my eyes.
This is a little difficult to explain, but when I was on the plane, I was moved to feel sorry for the nade.
He had to understand my love for him.
I knew how much she loved her."

"They knew him only for his smile.
His smile always said that any place to go would go."
But he left his work before he died, because he was afraid to live in darkness.
In 2014, Tyler committed suicide, and his 11 - year - old brother saw him in a state of death.
Mrs. David said, "I'm worried about him with something inconvenient."
Mrs. David drew up the cards, "To let these people know that you can go to people you can talk to. They can be just your friends.

There was no money in his hand in the days of Christmas: when the children were opened, he didn't allow their eyes to be opened,
She said that her death was a very big shock to their family, but we got out of it.
We were so happy that we were able to get to know each other.
But we have only to keep going and to fight."

The future of Brett Kwanog is a small step forward because FBII has begun to examine
"I thought that if we got something like what he asked us to do -- a check that would be done in a certain time, a limited opportunity -- maybe we could bring some unity," said Mr. Flake Saturday, they also said that they were afraid that the Committee party would fall into the habit of "scraping."
Why should Mr. Kwanoga and their Republican supporters check for FBI?
Their light is but for a time.
There are only 6 weeks for the mid-term elections, which are November 6 - if the Republicans are expected to do so, they will be very weak in their efforts to send the people elected to the Supreme Court in their country.
Mr. Kavanoghana took the phone to make the fruit of the supporters of Mr. Kavanogana. The Bashni Senator took the phone. Mr. Kwanogha was working for the House and only through them was Mr. Kavanoga was known to his wife Ashley, when Ashale was the owner of Mr. Bush.
What will be the result of Efbiæl’s reporting?
The 51 Republican and 49 Democrats will be held in the seat of the Senate.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kwanogana will receive at least 50 opinions in the Senate, which will allow Mike Pens, the vice president, to break the same down and keep them in the Supreme Court.
Under the chairmanship of Kim, the number of immigrants in North Korea was "reduced"
According to the law of South Korea, the number of pilgrims who came from North Korea was reduced seven years ago.
Referring to the data from the South Ulfification Ministry, Park Buong-Sung said that in the last year, 1127, compared to the 2706 insurgents in 2011.
Mr. Park said that the strict control of North Korea and China and that more money was being taken from human tanks were important factors.
Pyongyang did not make any public comments.
Many in the north have been granted citizenship in South Korea.
Sewal says that by the end of the Korean war in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans had illegally crossed the border.
Most people, living in China with a large border with North Korea, and crossing the border is easier than crossing the unresolved zone (DMZ) of the two Koreans.
The Chinese consider refugees to be more illegal than refugees, and they are sent back by force.
Although the relationship between the North and the South has still been markedly improved in some months, the number of nuclear wars has increased.
At the beginning of this month, the two presidents of Pyongyang came to discuss the divisions that had no nuclear power.
This was followed by extensive discussions on the Korean dual project at the historical meeting in Singapore, held in June, between the president of the United States, Donald Trump and Kim Jong-an.
But on Saturdays, Foreign Minister Rei Yong-Ho of North Korea broke down the U.S. Secretary of State for Progress.
"Without any belief in America, we will not have confidence in our national security and in such circumstances we will not be able to unarm ourselves alone," Rei said in a speech given by the United Nations High Council in New York.
Nancy Pelosse Brett Kwanog says that he is "abundant" and that he is unable to serve in the Supreme Court.
Home Secretary Nancy Pelosy referred to the Supreme Court's designated candidate Bret Kwanoga as "individual" and said that they were unable to serve in the Supreme Court for a while.
On Saturday, Pelosi spoke at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin.
"I can't do anything about it, but it seems that if a woman did that, they'd call her 'the 'no'," said Professor Sinet Judge Pelossy about the witness before the Cavanog Committee.
While both of them were in a position of employment, Kwanogha was emotionally charged with sexual assault by Dr. Christine Blace Ford.
When they started to talk, Kwanogha had become very friendly, their family and their high - school associates would cry if they ever had to cry when they were in their late teens.
The charge against them, Hillary Clinton, gathered to express anger at the election of President Pada in 2016, which is "compared to the murder of cartoons and cartoons" on Democrats.
Pelosy says that the Witnesses in Kwanogha have proved that they cannot serve in the Supreme Court because they prove that they are in favour of democracy.
"I think they've made themselves independent by their speeches and by following Clinton and Democrat."
When they asked if Pelosi would be present on their own merits, they found that if they were invited to a meeting of representatives of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, they were reluctant to ask questions about their legality.
"I would say so--that they wouldn't tell Congress or FBI the truth, but they're not in the Supreme Court, but they're not even entitled to the courts they have now," said Pelosy.
Kwanoga is now a judge in the Appellate Circuit Court of D.C.
Pelosini said that the Democratic People's Republic of the Congo is concerned about the possible claims against them, since the Congolese is considered a civilist judge.
During the confirmation hearing, Kwanoga left some questions as to whether you would reject the Supreme Court’s ruling.
"It's not time to expect a person to go to court and say, "That's a shadow," said Pelosse.
And women need to use their weapons.
The sound has been heard, and months and years have passed, and there has been no choice but to cry to it.
"When we get angry, we cry," Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think this is common, what do you think?"
She said, "I was very supportive of the woman who worked as a local worker, and she said that she was very angry that she was crying, but she developed a system that she had to tell the man who was crying when she cried and she was saying, "I'm sorry, you think I'm crying.
I'm angry."
Then we continued to preach. We were able to continue in the preaching work.
And I thought it was awesome."
The Assyrians are allowed to suffer as a result of their basic misunderstandings.
One of the hard memories of my early work is in a man-to-man office, where I had seen myself cry anxiously, with an old woman -- I was always scared by such a cold blood manager -- caught my head and carried it to the wall.
"Don't let them see you crying." She said to me.
"They didn't know you were angry.
They think that you are sad, and will rejoice for that reason."
Peter Schroeder, a woman of the Democratic Congress in Colorado, worked with Gary Hart for the election of the presiding officer.
When Mr. Schroeder was arrested on a boat named Mummy Business in 1987 in the event of a marriage relationship with Mr. Hart, and we wondered why we should not stand up for the election of the president.
"It wasn't a decision to consider this plan," she laughed at me 30 years later.

"Because Mohima was forced to build them, they decided that they would not go down to the war for up to $2 million."
It was a constant war.
She found out that her men who gave her $1,000 were giving her $250.
"Do they think I get used to it?" she thought to herself.
They were so disappointed when they announced that they were not going to start a career -- thank you for the people who supported them, for the encouragement of the system that made it difficult for them to raise money, and because of the anger of the representatives and of the sexists.
"You must have thought that I would have lost my mind," said Mrs. Schroeder about the theory they gave them.
"You must have thought that Kleinex was my corporate manager.
I remember thinking about what they would write on the stone of my tomb.
"Why did she cry?"
How the U.S. and China’s commercial warfare can benefit
Scientists say that the trade between the U.S. and China, and since there is no sign of the end of the war, the river between these countries can be beneficial for sowing for a long time.
The president of the United States, Donald Tramp, first warned against Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel, and aluminium.
In this week, the results have increased to a large extent with new levels of $2000 billion (£150 billion) and are being effectively measured from China to the United States.
In the United States, the most recent 60 billion dollars (U.S.) is the five - to - ten - percent increase in imports from the United States.
China has sworn to join the U.S. footholds, and soon the world’s largest economy will never be ignored.
It would be a great challenge for China’s president to make a public greeting to Washington, D.C., to meet the demands.
However, scientists say that if seeds can play their game properly, the pressure on trade in the United States can reduce the interdependence of both economies and provide positive support for a long time.
In fact, when a rapid political decision has been taken in Washington or Beijing, both of the two countries that will start economic flight are more dangerous than what was previously accepted,” said Abigail Grace, a research associate who is focusing on Asia in a thinking group, Central For New American Security.
Foreign ministers say Syria 'tair' to return refugees.
The Syrian refugees are willing to return willingly, and they have requested help to rebuild the country that has been destroyed by a war of more than seven years.
Speaking at the United Nations General Meeting, Foreign Minister Valid Al-Molem said that the country's situation is improving.
"Because of the progress made to fight terror today, the situation in our part is more stable and secure," they said.
To improve the situation in general, the government has continued to return to the region that has been destroyed by terrorists.
Their day-to-day life and their livelihood are now in a good position to return to refugees who have to leave their country by means of terrorism and one-off economic plans.
The United Nations estimates that from the beginning of the war in 2011 the Syrian people have left the country for 5.5 million.
There is still a need for more than six million people to live in the country.
Al-Mulem said the Syrian government would help rebuild the country that was destroyed.
But they insisted that they would not accept help or help from countries that helped the armed forces.
