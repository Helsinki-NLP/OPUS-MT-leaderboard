Members of the National Assembly of Wales were concerned that they would be ‘compared to Muppets’.
A proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament - Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The proposal is a consequence of the plans to change the current name ‘Welsh Assembly’ in ‘Welsh Parliament’.
Members of the National Assembly of various political parties are worried that the new name will come to be ridiculous.
A member of the National Assembly of Wales of the Labour Party said that MWP is ‘a member of Twp and Pwp’.
For readers outside Wales: Twp is Welsh for crazy and pwp is Welsh for pop.
A member of the National Assembly of Wales of the Plaid Party said that the group as a whole was 'discontent' and proposed alternatives.
A member of the Wellshe Conservative Party said his party 'open' for the change of name, but note that the words MWP and Muppet are very similar.
In this context, the Welsh letter W is spoken as a short you.
The National Assembly of Wales, which is currently in the process of drafting legislation to carry out the change of name, said: 'Of course, the members of the National Assembly of Wales themselves who take the final decision on their new title'.
With the Government of Wales Act 2017, the members of the National Assembly of Wales were given the right to change the name of the Assembly.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which showed that most people felt that the National Assembly should be converted to Parliament.
With regard to the title of the members of the National Assembly, the Commission proposed ‘Welsh Parliament Members’ or WMPs, but the option MWP received most support in public consultation.
At the moment, the members of the National Assembly would propose alternatives, but President Elin Jones will have difficulty reaching a consensus, and in a few weeks she will have to submit a draft legislation on the changes.
The legislation on reforms also includes other amendments to the way in which the National Assembly works, including rules on the suspension of members of the National Assembly and the structure of the committee system.
Members of the National Assembly will finally be able to vote on their new title when discussing legislation.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on the amendment of their country's name
Sunday voters vote whether they want to change the name of their country in 'Republic of North Macedonia'.
The popular referendum was organised in an effort to settle an intrusive dispute with neighbouring Greece, which itself has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that the name of its northern neighbour means that the country would claim its territory and has repeatedly objected to Macedonia's requests to become a member of the EU and NATO.
The Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposed the referendum's public consultation on the change of name, said that he would not take account of the outcome of the referendum.
However, speakers of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, point out that the name change is simply the price to be paid to become a member of the EU and NATO.
The hours of Saint Martin's silence, which Harlem's having it hard
“The older people I spoke to said that there was a café and a church on every corner,” said Mr. Adams.
Today there is neither a café nor a church.'
He said it's understandable that the cafes are gone.
‘People now have another way of social contact,’ he said.
‘Cafés are no longer the living room of the district, where people go along regularly.’
However, he is concerned that the proceeds of the sale of the assets of the churches will be less long if the leaders expect, ‘and early or late they will be back at the beginning.’
Churches, he adds, could be replaced by flat apartment buildings where the kind of people would live that would not help in the rest of the nearby resorts.
‘The vast majority of people who will buy flats in such buildings will be white,’ he says, ‘which will lead to these churches being closed even faster, because it is unlikely that the people who move to such flats will become members of the church community.’
Both churches were once built by a white church community, before Harlem became a black metropolis: the metropolis community in 1870, Saint Martin's 10 years later.
The original church community of white Methodists was left in the 1930s.
A black church in the neighborhood took over the building.
Saint Martin's was taken over by a black church community led by Eervalde John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott from the merchants in 125th Street, an important shopping street in Harlem, where blacks could rarely get a job or be promoted.
In 1939 the building was seriously damaged by fire, but when the parishioners of Eervalde Johnson planned to rebuild the church, they also bought a beaver.
Honored David Johnson, the son of Honorary Johnson and his successor in Saint Martin's, called the beaver proud of 'the watches of the poor'.
The expert who played the beaard in July referred in another way to the instrument: ‘a cultural treasure’ and ‘an irreplaceable historical instrument’.
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that this was the first beaver in the world ever played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved 18 years ago to the larger beaver of the Riverside Church.
Dr. Merriweather said Saint Martin's had not replaced him.
The events of the last few months in Saint Martin's are a complicated story of architects and receivers, some hired by the church's body leaders, others by the diocese.
The Consistency (the governing body of the parish, consisting of body leaders) wrote to the Bishop in July to express her concern that the Bishop would ‘recount the costs’ to the Consistency, although the Consistency was not involved in the rental of the architects and receivers who had sent the Bishops.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency of the church.
Haai destroys 13-year-olds who go to bed shower in California
Saturday, on the first day of the summer season, a shark hit a 13-year-old boy who died in California. The boy suffered injuries, as it is said.
The attack took place just 7 hours ‘in the morning near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB TV in San Diego that on Saturday he had docked around half an hour with friends when he heard the boy screaming for help. Together with some others, he pecked at the boy to draw him out of the water.
Hammel said that he first thought that the boy cried because he had caught a pen, but then he realized ‘that the boy cried, ‘I prayed!
I've been praying!'
His key bone was completely open,' Hammel saw when he approached the boy.
‘I shouted that everyone had to leave the water: ‘There is a shark in the water!’.
The boy was taken with a helicopter to the San Diego Children's Hospital, where he is in danger of being killed.
It is not known what kind of shark is responsible for the attack.
Coast Guard Captain Larry Giles told a press conference that a few weeks earlier a shark was thrown in the vicinity, but that it had then been concluded that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim was seriously injured in the upper body.
The authorities closed access to the beach of Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours with a view to research and safety.
Giles noted that more than 135 shark species live in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury wants to cross the British beauty market
Sainsbury's competes with Boots, SuperDrug and Debenhams and direct beauty departments where specialized assistants work, such as in large storehouses.
The initiative is part of a strategy to conquer the British beauty market, which is worth £2.8 billion and continues to grow, while the sale of fashion and household items continues to decline. The larger beauty departments are tested in 11 shops across the country. If they prove successful, they will be introduced into more shops next year.
Investment in the beauty market is also a result of the fact that supermarkets want to fill the networks where TVs, microwaves and interior items were ever present.
Sainsbury's wants to double his beauty offer and offer 3,000 products, including for the first time brand like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing range of L'Oreal, Maybellline and Burt's Bees also takes place more, with exhibition space per brand, as in stores like Boots.
The supermarket also brings its Boutique-make-up again on the market, now most products are suitable for veganists, something younger shoppers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, perfumery will test the Fragrance Shop concessions in two shops of Sainsbury's. The first is opened in Croydon, in the south of London, the second is opened later this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Because more and more people buy online and more often on a daily basis buy small amounts of food in local supermarkets, supermarkets need to make more effort to convince people to shop with them.
Mike Coupe, Chief Executive of Sainsbury's, says the stores will increasingly look like big store houses, now the supermarket chain is recording it against discounters Aldi and Lidl, with more services and non-food.
Sainsbury's has integrated Argos sales points into hundreds of shops and has also opened some Habitats since both chains were taken over two years ago. According to the company, the sales of food has increased and the acquisitions have delivered more performance.
The last time the supermarket tried to give its departments Beauty and Apothek a make-over, it became a flop.
Sainsbury's tested in early 2000 a partnership with Boots, but the cooperation ended when a conflict arose about the distribution of the pharmacies' incomes in the supermarkets.
This is a new strategy since Sainsbury's are 281 apothecary departments in the shops three years ago for an amount of 125 million British pounds sold to Celesio, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy chain.
Lloyds would also play a role in the plan, by adding an extensive range of luxury skin care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, in four shops.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director of Sainsbury's, said: "We have completely changed the setting up of our beauty department, so that it is more pleasant for our customers.
We have also invested in the specialized training of our employees, who will be ready to give advice.
With our offer of brands, we offer everything we want, and thanks to the attractive environment and the convenient locations, we make sure that our customers like to buy their beauty products with us, and no longer buy in the old way."
Peter Jones' anger after Holly Willoughby withdraws from 11 million pounds
Peter Jones, one of the stars of Dragons Den, is 'suffering' because TV-presenter Holly Willoughby has withdrawn from a deal of 11 million pounds with his lifestyle company. She wants to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for True, their brand for homewear and accessories.
The company of Jones and Willoughby is compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old presenter of this Morning announced on Instagram that she was leaving.
Peter Jones van Dragons Den is looking forward to Holly Willoughby, because she has recently withdrawn from her profitable lifestyle business to focus on her contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones was angry when Willoughby said that during a difficult meeting in Marlow's headquarters, Buckinghamshire did not keep enough time for True, their brand for homewear and accessories by her new contracts (with a value of about half a million pounds).
The company is compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow and is expected to double Willoughby's fortune from an estimated 11 million pounds.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she would leave True, Jones left one of his holiday homes abroad.
One source said, ‘Truly was one of Holly’s top priorities.
It would ensure its long-term future, and provide enough for the next decade.
Everyone was faint when she decided to withdraw.
No one could believe his ears last Tuesday, because the launch was soon planned.
The warehouse of the main establishment in Marlow is full of products ready for sale.'
Experts believe that the departure of the presenter, one of the most profitable stars in Britain, could cost the company millions, due to the large investments in products from cushions and candles to clothing and household weather, and because the launch could now take place further delays.
And that could mean the end of a year-long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin, who have three children, have been good friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby started True in 2016 with Capp, and Jones, 52, became president of the company in March.
The two sets often go together on vacation and Jones has a 40% share in Baldwin's television production.
Willoughby will soon become M&S brand ambassador and Ant McPartlin will be replaced as the presenter of the I'm A Celebrity program on the British broadcaster ITV.
A source from Jones' entourage said last night: 'We have no comment on his business matters.'
Hard Language “And Then Was Love Between Us”
He joked about the criticism he would get in the media about a comment he made that some people would find 'unappropriate for a president' and about his positive view of the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump imitated a new singer when he said:
‘I did not give up.’
He added that Kim was interested in a second meeting. Trump described their first meeting in June in Singapore a major step towards the disarmament of nuclear weapons in North Korea.
However, negotiations on the elimination of nuclear weapons have taken place.
More than three months after the summit in Singapore in June, top diplomat Ri Yong Ho of North Korea told leaders of the United Nations General Assembly that North Korea does not see a ‘corresponding response’ by the United States following the first disarmament initiatives of North Korea.
In the meantime, the United States goes through its sanctions to keep pressure on the chain, he says.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech during the election rally.
"We do very well in North Korea," he said.
‘We were close to a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a fantastic relationship."
He said his efforts to improve the relationship with Kim led to positive results, the missile tests were completed, the hostages were released, and the material surpluses of American soldiers were returned to their own country.
He also defended his unusual approach to his relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to behave like a president, but instead of 10,000 people trying to access this press arena, about 200 people would be standing here," Trump said, while he was in front of the audience.
Tsunami and earthquakes in Indonesia destroyed an island with hundreds of deaths
In the wake of the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign NGOs were told that they did not need help.
Although more than 10% of the population of Lombok had no more housing, there was no national disaster, which is a requirement for international aid.
‘In many cases it is clear that they do not apply for international aid, which is difficult for us,’ said Mrs Sumbung.
Save the Children is working with a team to travel to Palu, but it is not sure if the assistants from abroad can work in places.
Mr Sutopo, spokesman for the National Disaster Relief Agency, said that Indonesian officials were still in the process of evaluating the situation in Palu to see if international organisations would be allowed to help.
Although Indonesia is constantly being subjected to earthquakes, the country is still particularly poorly prepared for the wrath of nature.
In Aceh shelters were built to hide at tsunamis, but along other coasts you can see them rarely.
The fact that there was no warning sirens for tsunamis in Palu, even though there was a warning of force, has probably contributed to the number of deaths.
Even in ideal circumstances it may be difficult to travel from one Indonesian island to another.
National disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that was established in Lombok to deal with victims of earthquakes is now on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days before the ship reaches the site of the disaster.
The improvement of Indonesia's portless infrastructure was one of the core points of the election campaign by President Joko Widodo, and he has already spent plenty of money on roads and railways.
But the government of President Joko has a lack of funding, and that is what he hopes to be re-elected next year.
President Joko is also being pressured by persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Islamic majority are now following a rather conservative form of their faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands had to leave their homes because Christian and Islamic bands fought on the street, with machetes, arrows and bows and other primitive weapons.
Look at: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool provides impressive equalizer against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge managed Liverpool last Saturday to lose against Chelsea in the Premier League, with a goal in the 89th minute, during a game in Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge got a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri when he stood at a distance of about 30 metres from Chelsea's goal, at the time his team with 1-0 behind.
He pointed left against the ball and then pushed towards the first pole.
The ball flew high above the penalty zone, towards the top right corner of the net.
He developed the spring of Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
‘It was very difficult to reach that position, to reach the ball, and players like Shaq always play forward as much as possible,’ Sturridge said to LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante approaching and waiting for an attempt. I didn't really think about it, I just jumped on the ball. "
Chelsea stood at the quiet with 1-0, after a goal of the Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The peaks of The Blues sped the ball with its whole to Mateo Kovacic, after which he hurried through the midfield to the play centre of Liverpool.
Kovacic did a fast one-tweet in the middle of the village.
After that, he gave a beautiful stick pass, which enabled Hazard to reach the penalty zone.
Hazard was faster than the defense and kicked the ball with his left foot past Alison Becker of Liverpool in the net, next to the rear pole.
Liverpool plays Wednesday at 3 p.m. in the group phase of the Champions League against Naples, at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea takes place on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London against videoton in the UEFA Europe League.
The fatal number of tsunamis in Indonesia runs up to 832
The number of earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia rose to 832, the Agency said on Sunday morning for assistance in the event of national disasters.
Many people were trapped in the ruins of buildings that had collapsed as a result of the earthquake with a force of 7.5 last Friday, with also waves rising from 6 m high, spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said during a news conference.
The city of Palu, where more than 380,000 people live, is full of ruined buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was killed
This morning, the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead in Merseyside, which opened a murder investigation.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7.55 in Grayson Mews in John Street. The body showed stab wounds. A 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police are asking the locals to report if they have seen or heard anything.
Police Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: ‘The investigation has just begun, but I want everyone who is in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead who has seen something suspicious or asked to contact us.
I would also like to ask everyone, in particular taxi drivers, to contact them if they may have filmed something through a dashcam. They can have information that is essential for our research.'
A spokesman for the police confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a local resident of Birkenhead and that she was found in a building.
This afternoon, friends came to think they knew the woman in place to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is under way and the police have confirmed that they are bringing the victim's family up to date.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has tried to enter his apartment, but was told by the police that no one can in or out of the building.
He was rude when he found out what happened.
The residents are now told that it will take hours before they can return home.
A policeman would have told someone that the area is being treated as a crime scene.
A woman was crying on the spot.
She just keeps repeating, ‘What a lot!’.
At 2:00 a.m., two police cars were inside the station and a third was just outside.
In the setting, a number of agents kept the apartment building in check.
Anyone who has information is asked to send a message to @MerPolCC, to call 101 or to make anonymous contact with Crimestoppers on the number 0800 555 111, with the entry log 247 of 30 September.
View of Cromwell to the British Parliament is the latest victim of the 'rewriting history'-recording-recording-recording-recording-recording-recording-recording-recording-recording-recording-recording-recording-recording-recording-recording-recording-recording
The banning of the statue would be a poetic justice for the Taliban destruction of the many cultural and religious art objects carried out by its fanatic puritanic followers.
However, the Cromwell Society described Dr. Crick's suggestion as 'empty' and 'an attempt to rewrite history'.
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: ‘It was inevitable that the current debate on the removal of statues would lead to the display of the figure of Oliver Cromwell just outside the Houses or Parliament.
The iconoclassism of the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his forefather Thomas in the past century.
The beautiful image of Cromwell, made by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, testifies to the opinion that the ruler of the 19th century and is part of the history of a figure that many still have to get recognition.
Dr. Goldsmith said to The Sunday Telegraph: ‘Cromwell becomes by many, perhaps more by the end of the 19th century than today, considered to be a defender of Parliament against external pressure, in his case, of course the monarchy.
Or that is a completely correct presentation, it is still being debated.
What is certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century has shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individual recognizable figure representing one side of that globe.
His achievements as Lord Protector must also be recognized and revised.'
Killing Don't Kill Chinese Farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig on a market in southwestern China, according to local media reports.
The man, only known as 'Yuan', was found dead at a stable in the market in Liupanshui in the province of Guizhou. He had been beaten and was under the blood, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to enter pigs in a pig herd on 30 May 2005, in Xining in the province of Qinghai, China.
He and his nephew would have been away from the neighboring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning his nephew found him dead and found a door to a nearby pig’s stable to be open.
According to the nephew, there was a large male pig with blood on his neck in the pig’s shock.
A forensic study showed that the pig of 250 kg had killed the farmer, so the report.
‘The legs of my nephew were bleeding and mutilated,’ said the nephew with the back name ‘Wu’, according to the newspaper Guiyang Eventing News.
On images of surveillance cameras, Yuan arrived on the market at 4.40 p.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal the man killed was not from Yuan or his nephew.
One market operator told the Evening News that the pigs were closed to prevent the other from attacking, while the police evidence was collected at the scene.
The Yuan family and the market authorities are talking about compensation for their death.
It happens only rarely, but there have been cases of pigs attacking people before.
In 2016 a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts, causing the man to be seriously injured.
Ten years earlier, a pig of 300 kg pushed a farmer from Wales against his tractor until his wife drove away the animal.
When a farmer from Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba at CBC News said that pigs are not normally aggressive, but that the taste of blood aggression can trigger.
‘They're just toys.
They're just kids, very curious... they're not about to hurt people.
You just have to show them the right amount of respect, he said.
The tail of Orkan Rosa brings heavy rains to the southwest of the U.S.
As predicted weak hurricane Rosa from now on, she has reached the cooler waters of the north coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will bring heavy rains to the north of Mexico and the southwest.
With a wind speed of 135 km per hour, Rosa was a category 1 hurricane on Sunday morning at 5 hours and was located 620 km from Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to climb north on Sunday.
In the meantime, a fortress begins to form above the Pacific, which moves east towards the west coast of the United States. When Rosa approaches the peninsula of Baja California on Monday as a tropical storm, tropical humidity is pushed north, to the south-west of the United States.
Rosa will bring rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, tropical fluid that reacts with the approaching force will cause widespread heavy rainfall in the south-west in the coming days.
Locally, 2 to 10 cm of rain will cause dangerous floods, torrents and possible earthquakes in the desert.
Tropical fluid will lead to precipitation from 5 to 8 cm per hour, especially in parts of the south of Nevada and Arizona.
However, 5 to 10 cm of rain is expected in parts of the southwest, especially above the majority of Arizona.
There are sudden floods possible with rapidly deteriorating circumstances, because the tropical rains can fall very widely.
It is most strongly recommended to walk into the desert when the tropical rains are threatened.
The heavy rainfall can turn rain into desert rivers, and will cause local winds and dust.
The approaching train leads local heavy rains to parts of the southern California coastline.
There are rains of 1.5 cm possible, which could lead to small torrents and smooth roads.
This would be the first rain of the region during the rainy season.
Dispersed tropical rains will approach Arizona on Sunday evening to Monday morning, after which rain will be spread more at the end of Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rainfall will spread over the Four Corners on Tuesday and continue to fall on Wednesday.
In October, the temperature in the U.S. can fluctuate strongly because the North Pole becomes cooler, but the troops remain quite warm.
This sometimes leads to major differences in temperature over short distances.
There is a fine example of impressive temperature differences in the middle of the U.S. on Sunday.
The temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, is almost 20 degrees.
In the coming days, the constant summer heat will try to build up and expand again.
In a large part of the central and eastern United States, it is expected that October will start hot, with temperatures ranging around 30°C, from the southern plains to parts of the north-east.
In New York, it can become 27 degrees Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees warmer than the average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows that the chance to mid-October is high at above average temperatures in the eastern United States.
More than 20 million people look at the audience of Brett Kavanaugh
On Thursday, more than 20 million people look at one of the six television networks at Brett Kavanaugh's thrilling testimony, candidate for the U.S. Supreme Court, and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of an assault that took place in the 1980s.
In the meantime, the political impasse continued, while calls for regular programming interrupted for Friday's surprise: an agreement arranged by Jeff Flake, Senator of Arizona, to investigate the charge for a week.
Ford told the Senate Committee for Justice that she was 100% sure that a drunk Kavanaugh had bitten her and tried to extract her clothes during a high school party.
Kavanaugh stated in a silent testimony that he was 100% certain that this had not happened.
Probably more than 20.4 million people reported by Nielsen on Friday have seen it.
The company counted the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
There were no figures immediately available for the other networks that broadcast the hearing, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble with the number of people looking in an office.
For comparison: that is about as for a playoff of a football match or for the Oscar release.
Fox News Channel, which provides all support for the appointment of Kavanaugh, had most viewers during the day of the hearing: on average 5.69 million viewers, according to Nielsen.
ABC followed with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC had 2.94 million viewers, MSNBC had 2.89 million viewers and CNN had 2.52 million viewers, according to Nielsen.
Even after the hearing, the public remained very interested.
Flake was the central figure of the events on Friday.
After the office of the moderate Republican issued a statement that he would support Kavanaugh with his voice, the CNN and CBS cameras registered on Friday morning that the riders shouted to him when he tried to take the elevator to a hearing from the Commission for Justice.
He stayed with his eyes down for a few minutes while he was cheated, live on CNN.
'I'm right here for you,' said one woman.
‘Do you think he tells the people the truth?
Someone cried, "You have power, while so many women are powerless."
Flake said that his office had made a statement, and just before the elevator closed, he added that he would say more during the hearing.
The various envoys sent everything out alive when the judicial committee had to vote hours later on the appointment of Kavanaugh in the Senate.
But Flake said that he would vote only in advance with the understanding that the FBI would investigate the charges against the nominee against the next week, something that the minority Democrats are calling for.
Flake was convinced, among other things, by his friend Chris Coons, Senator and Democracy.
Flake made his decision after a conversation with Coons and several senators.
Flakes' choice was important because it was clear that the Republicans would not have the necessary votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump opened an FBI investigation into Kavanaugh's allegations.
British Prime Minister May accused critics of 'a political game' around Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused politicians who were critical of her plans to leave the European Union 'a political game' with the future of Great Britain and the undermining of national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May will attend the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Great Britain, on 29 September 2018.
In addition, on the same front page of the paper, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson stressed his attack on her so-called Chequers plan for Brexit.
Shooting Party Wayde Sims: police arrests Dyteon Simpson as suspect of the death of the LSU player
The police arrested a suspect for the shooting party where Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU, was shot to death.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and is in prison on suspicion of murder, Baton Rouge's police said.
The authorities produced a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson and the police said that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
The police found the glasses on the scene and found Simpson's DNA on the glasses, WAFB reports, a CBS television station.
The police interrogated Simpson and later declared that he had known that he had shot Wayde with death.
His deposit is set at $350,000, the lawyer reports.
The bodyguard of the congregation in East Baton Rouge published on Friday a preliminary report stating that the cause of death is a wound in the neck.
The report states that the Fugitive Task Force of the Louisiana State Police, the crime lab of the state police, the South University police and local residents all contributed to the investigation leading to a arrest.
Sport Director Joe Alleva of LSU thanked the local police for his ‘instituting and striving for justice’.
Sims was 20 years old.
He was 198 cm tall and grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
He won on average 5,6 points and 2,6 rebounds last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said that the team 'kapot' and 'in shock' were killed by Waydes.
‘This is an event that you always hope will never happen,’ says Wade.
Volcanic as Mexico City
The ashes that are emitted by the Popocatepetl volcano have reached the southern regions of Mexico’s capital.
The National Ramping Prevention Centre warned the Mexicans last Saturday to stay away from the volcano, after activity in the crater was recorded and 183 emissions of gas and ashes were recorded within 24 hours.
The center detected several times the volume and vibrations.
On social media, photos of a thin layer appear as on highways in areas of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysics have seen an increase in activity in the volcano, which is 72 kilometers south-east of the capital. This is the first time since September 2017, when an earthquake of 7.1 on the scale of Richter Central Mexico hit.
The volcano, called Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police hear with Catalan separatists on the evening of the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence activists successfully met the opposition police, while thousands of participants were involved in rival demonstrations on the occasion of the first anniversary of the vote on independence in Catalonia that affected the region in two groups.
A group of masked pro-separatists who were detained by the police seized the agents with eggs and powder paint, resulting in dark dust clouds in the streets that are usually filled with tourists.
Later on the day, screens broke out with the police, and the agents pulled up their knot to stop the fights.
For more than an hour, pro-independence groups sing: ‘Do not forget, do not forgive’, while their opponents shout ‘Long live Spain’.
Forty people were treated for minor injuries they suffered during the protests, the local press reported.
The tensions remain high in the independent region, one year after the referendum of 1 October, which is considered illegal by Madrid, but is celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The voters expressed themselves overwhelmingly in order to become independent, although the rise was low and the people who opposed separation were the boycotts.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop the vote in the voterhouse in the region, where it came to violent protests.
Pro-independence groups had camped on Saturday night on site to prevent a demonstration to support the national police.
The demonstration went on, but one was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who accompanied the separatist protest with his wife, said that he was no longer hopeful about the prospects of Catalonia to become independent.
"Last year we had one of our most beautiful moments.
I saw my parents cry with joy because they could vote, but now we're stuck, he said.
Although the Catalan pro-independence parties won an essential victory in the regional elections in December, even though that was not the case, it was difficult for them this year to build on their success. Many of their most well-known leaders were absent, either in exile or in prison themselves, awaiting a legal case on their role in organizing the referendum and calling for independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old monteur who supported the police filming on his phone, said that the conflict by politicians was on both sides.
‘The tensions are getting higher,’ he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who has been in pre-trial detention since last year, declared that he will take part in the European Parliament elections next year.
"A candidate for the European elections is the best way to complain about the decline in democratic values and repression that we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: men arrested after the house was demolished with a car
Three men from 33, 34 and 39 years of age were arrested after a car was repatriated in a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place on Thursday at around 19.30 a.m. local time in Ballynagard Crescent.
Police Inspector Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building itself had been damaged.
At a given moment, a crossbow was also fired on the car.
Livingston wins 1-0 against Rangers thanks to Menga's goal
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston cared for them the victory
The promoted Livingston surprised the Rangers and worried Steven Gerrard his second defeat in a series of 18 matches since he was manager of the Ibrox Club.
Dolly Menga's goal made the difference and Gary Holt's team came to the same height as Hibernian.
Gerards team failed this season to win a competition during the Premiership. They have to record Sunday against leader Hearts, who has eight points on them.
But first, the Rangers Rapid Vienna will receive the European League on Thursday.
In the meantime, Livingstone remains unsuccessful. The team has now won six competitions after each other in his department, and Coach Holt has not had any defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston misses opportunities against strong visitors
The team of Holt had been able to achieve a breakthrough for the first time. Their direct way of playing provided for all kinds of problems in the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but failed to finish it with a goal point. Then Alan Lithgow, who picked up Craig Halket's head ball, jumped the ball over the target.
The home team allowed the Rangers to play with great pleasure, and waited for his chances calmly and self-secured.
And that eventually led to the crucial goal.
The Rangers allowed a free staircase and Livingstone provided an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson worked together to create a chance for Menga, who scored from the penalty zone.
At that time, the Rangers had been in a state of shock for a long time, but the defense of the household staff was unforgivable and targetman Liam Kelly had not had much to do.
That pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos made sure that Kelly had a goal to avoid.
Scott Pittman pushed the ball against the feet of Rangers targetman Allan McGregor and Lithgow missed the goal after a speech by his colleagues from Livingstone.
Continuously reaching the target area of Livingston, but they were turned over every time. Twice a penalty was refused, one after Halkets attacked the attacker Glenn Middleton and one for handball.
Livingston's Phenomenal - Analysis
Alastair Lamont of BBC Scotland in the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingstone.
They played excellent without exception and continued to exceed expectations in their race to the top.
Their style of play and the composition of their team have been almost changed since their return to the highest regions, but Holt in particular deserves much recognition for the way he has made up the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Commander Halkett was fantastic, with an excellent organized defense, while Menga Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall went on the tops of their ten.
However, the Rangers did not know how to break through.
Even though they have played very well under Gerrard, this time they did not reach their usual level.
Their final phase wasn't good enough (they only managed to smear the home team once) and the Rangers will now realize that they have to play better. They are somewhere in the middle of the ranking.
Erdogan is given with mixed feelings in Keulen
Under a bright blue sky and with a wide smile, the leaders of Turkey and Germany went together Saturday (29 September) breakfasts in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which is aimed at restoring relations between NATO allies.
They do not agree on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan returned to Keulen to open a giant new mosque.
Keulen is the home base of the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police robbed themselves for security reasons when they asked the crowd of 25,000 people to gather for the mosque, but many sympathetics came nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of demonstrators, many of them Kurden, also heard their voice, condemning Erdogan's policy as well as the German government's decision to welcome him in the country.
The rival protests reflect the disunity of a visitor who is praised by some German Turks as a hero and accused by others as an autocrat.
Traffic accident in Deptford: biker dies after car collision
In London a biker was hit by a collision involving a car.
The accident took place near the intersection of Beswod Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, southeast of the city, about 10.15 a.m. local time.
The driver stopped the car and the ambulance staff were present, but the man died in place.
A few months ago, another biker died in an accident with a flight accident on Childers Street, about half a mile from the accident on Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police said that agents were about to identify the man and his neighbor's family.
The road is closed in different places, buses are being run around and car drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Ciphers Violent in Order Distortion
Six Cypriots were injured in an order disorder in a heavy-security prison for men, according to the prison office.
The riots broke out on Sunday at around 9.30 a.m. local time in HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire and are still in progress.
Specialized ‘Tornado’ recipients have been set up to resolve a situation involving eight prisoners in one section.
The cigars were treated in places for slight injuries in the face.
A spokesman for the Prison Service said: ‘It is specially trained in prison personnel for an actual incident in HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and in any case the responsible are being referred to the police and may need to remain behind the trails any longer.'
In HMP Long Lartin, more than 500 prisoners live, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June it was reported that the prison director was treated in the hospital after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, the army police were summoned to prison for a serious order disorder in which staff were attacked with billiards.
Orkaan Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with sudden floods (with possible positive effects for drought areas)
It is rare that a tropical depression reaches Arizona, but that is exactly what is likely to happen next week, because the remaining energy of Orkan Rosa moves across the south-west of the desert area, which carries the risks of flooding.
The National Weather Service has already warned of sudden floods for Monday and Tuesday for the west of Arizona to the south and east of Nevada, and the southeast of California and Utah, including the cities Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to hang on Tuesday just above Phoenix.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix noted in a tweet that “since 1950 only ten tropical cyclones have maintained the status of tropical storm or depression in the area of 200 miles from Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of Arizona border.'
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 centimeters down, with isolated quantities up to 15 centimeters in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
Other parts of the south-west of the desert area, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Beak, will probably get 3 to 5 cm rain, and here and there is 10 cm possible.
For areas not at risk of flooding, the rains of Rosa can be a blessing because the region is affected by drought.
Although overflows are very worrying, a part of this rainfall will probably be favorable, because the south-west is currently going through a drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, the map on which current drought areas are indicated makes more than 40 per cent of Arizona at least extreme drought, the weather.com reported in one of the highest categories.
The route of Orkan Rosa reaches the mainland through the Shire Island of Baja California in Mexico.
On Sunday morning, Rosa is still at an orca level with a maximum wind speed of 140 km per hour, located 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moves north at a speed of 20 km per hour.
The storm hits cooler waters in the Pacific, causing them to weaken.
Therefore, it is expected to arrive in Mexico on Monday afternoon or evening with the power of a tropical storm.
There may be heavy rains in parts of Mexico, resulting in a significant flood risk.
‘Average of a total of 8 to 15 cm is expected from Baja California to the northwest of Sonora, with up to 25 cm possible,’ weather.com reported.
Rosa moves north over Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the border with Arizona in the early morning as a tropical depression, which will then pass through Arizona and south of Utah on Tuesday evening.
"The greatest danger that Rosa or her tail is expected is a very severe rainfall in Baja California, the north-west of Sonora, and the south-west of the desert area," said the National Hurricane Center.
These rains are expected to result in life-threatening sudden floods and storms in the deserts and earthquakes on a mountainous land.
Attack in Midsomer Norton: four arrests on suspicion of attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old with stab wounds was found in Somerset.
The teenager was injured at approximately 4 hours local time in the Excelsior Terrace district in Midsomer Norton.
He was taken to the hospital and his condition is 'stable'.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old were arrested at night in the Radstock area, which is the police of Avon and Somerset.
The police are asking anyone who may have filmed something about what happened to report.
Trump says that Kavanaugh 'has been amongst the community, the anger' of the Democratic Party
'A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the cohesive and scandalous tactics of the Democratic Party', Trump said during a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that during his appointment procedure Kavanaugh has constantly 'beyond the community, the anger' of the Democratic Party
Kavanaugh testified on Thursday for Congress and denied the strong and emotional feeling of Christine Blasey Ford that he had sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified during the hearing on her statement.
On Saturday, the President said that the 'American people saw the 'beautiful and incredible character, quality and courage' of Kavanaugh that day.
‘A voice to recognise Judge Kavanaugh is a voice with which one of the most complete legal opinions of our time is recognised, a lawyer with an excellent state of service,’ he told the many advocates in West Virginia.
The President referred directly to the appointment of Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of the Republican event in the interim elections.
‘Over five weeks, one of the most important elections is held in our lives.
I'm not taking part, but I'm actually taking part,' he said.
‘That's why I come up everywhere for great candidates.’
Trump stated that the Democrats are on a mission to 'stand still and hinder us'.
The first important procedural vote in the Senate on the appointment of Kavanaugh will take place on Friday, as expected, as a senior member of the GOP management told CNN.
Hundreds killed by Indonesian earthquake, tsunami, and the toll is getting higher
At a large earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, at least 384 people were killed, with many of the land being swept away when giant waves fell on the beach, the authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people were gathered on Friday for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu, when waves of six meters high hit the ground at the time it began to tremble. Many people were thrown and the waves destroyed everything on their way.
The tsunami was the result of an earthquake of 7.5 on the scale of Richter.
‘When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, there were still people on the beach. They did not run away immediately and became the victim of the tsunami,’ said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman of the Indonesian Bureau for help in natural disasters BNPB during a letter in Jakarta.
'The tsunami also led to other dangers: he dragged cars, tree tribes, houses, he hit everything on the ground,' said Nugroho, who added that the tsunami was traveling at a speed of 800 km/h over the open sea before reaching the coast.
Some people crawl into a tree to escape the tsunami and survive, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
On photos released by the Natural Disaster Relief Office, many buildings and shops have been destroyed, bridges destroyed and destroyed and a mosque is surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coastal city was swept away by searches.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released at the huge Friday earthquake was about 200 times the power of the atom bomb that fell on Hiroshima in the Second World War.
It is possible that the geography of the city, which lies at the end of a long, narrow bay, has even increased the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as ‘significant’ and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels were damaged.
Some fatal victims were trapped under the rubble of damaged buildings, he said. Such 540 people were injured and 29 were lost.
Nugroho said that the number of victims and damage could be even greater along the coast line 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Dongala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communication with Dongala 'is completely flat, we have no information at all', Nugroho said.
More than 300,000 people live there,” said the Red Cross in a statement. The Red Cross staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
‘It’s already a tragedy, but it can get much worse,’ said the Red Cross.
The organisation received much criticism on Saturday because it had not said that a tsunami had hit Palu, although employees said that the waves had reached the country within the time of the warning.
In amateur images shared on social media, a man at the top of a building screams panicking at people down the street to warn them that a tsunami is coming.
A few minutes later, a wall of water falls on the coast and is built and cars flown together.
Reuters could not verify the images immediately.
The earthquake and tsunamis caused a major flow disturbance that cut the communication around Palu, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army is currently sending cargo planes with supplies from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but the Evacués still have an urgent need for food and other basic needs.
The airport of the city is only open for assistance and remains closed to the public until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
Tsunami dodentol is rising above 800.
It's very bad.
Although World Vision employees from Dongala have arrived safely in the city of Palu, where workers in the interior of their office search for shelter in tents of decreil, but pass through the road of destruction taverns, Dosebah said.
"They told me they saw many houses destroyed," he said.
It's very bad.
Even when relief groups began with the difficult task of launching emergency aid, some complained that certain foreign aid providers could not travel to Palu with great expertise.
According to the Indonesian legislation, funding, goods and personnel from abroad may only be allowed if the location of a disaster is declared as a national natural disaster.
It hasn't happened yet.
‘It is still a disaster at the provincial level,’ said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
‘As soon as the government says, ‘OK, this is a national disaster’, we can provide international assistance, but that status has not yet been proclaimed.’
When the second night after the earthquake and tsunami of Friday fell on Palu, friends and family of the missing people hoped they would find their loved ones back, as in the miracles that people like to hear in terrible natural disasters like this.
Saturday a boy was picked up from a sewer.
On Sunday, relief workers released a woman who had been trapped for two days with her mother’s body next to her.
Gendon Subandano, the coach of the Indonesian National Paragliding Team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which had taken place earlier this month in Indonesia.
His students also stayed at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr Mandadi.
‘As a veteran in the paragliding world, I carry my own emotional tax,’ he said.
Dr. Gendon told us that the news that the Roa Roa Hotel had crashed had spread into the paragliding community and that in the hours thereafter he had sent desperate WhatsApp messages to the athletes in Palu, who took part in the beach festival.
However, with his messages, only one grey angle appeared instead of two blue angles.
"I think that means that the messages have not been delivered," he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 while supplying cash machine in Newport on the Live
On Friday morning, 26.750 dollars of a Brink employee who was filling a cash machine in Newport on the Levee, according to a press report from the Newport police.
The driver had just put a cash machine in the entertainment complex and wanted to fill it with money, as Inspector Dennis McCarthy wrote in the report.
When he was busy, another man walked behind Brink's employee and stole a bag of money that was ready to deliver.
The witnesses saw several suspects fleeing, so the press report, but the police did not say how many people were involved in the incident.
Anyone who has information about the identity of the perpetrators is asked to contact the Newport police on number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name in Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name in Ye.
Last Saturday, he announced the change on Twitter with the words: ‘It was formally known as Kanye West’.
The 41-year-old West has been short termed Ye and used this nickname as a title for his eighth album, which came out in June.
The name change was announced in the course of his events on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album Yandhi.
He replaces the singer Ariana Grande, who has cancelled her action during the show for ‘emotional reasons’, says the director of the show.
You are not only abbreviation of his current artist name. Instead, West told that the word has a religious meaning for him.
In my opinion, 'yes' is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you',' said West earlier this year, when he told about the title of his album by Radiopresenter Big Boy.
"You're me, I'm us, we're us.
I've been transferred from Kanye, which means 'the only', to just Ye, a reflection of the good in us, the bad, the confused, everything.
The album is a reflection of who we are.'
He's not the only famous rapper who changes his name.
Sean Combs was previously known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but announced his preference this year for the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who previously collaborated with the West, has worked with and without the code and the letters.
Mexican President does not promise to use force against citizens
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the elected president of Mexico, promised never to use military power against citizens. The country is on the eve of the 50th anniversary of a bloody repressive against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would "never use military violence to suppress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, military troops set fire to a peaceful attack on the square, killing 300 people. During that period, left student movements came on all over Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised to help young Mexicans by granting monthly grants to students and opening more free public universities.
He said that young people often become members of criminal gangs as a result of unemployment and a lack of opportunities to study.
The United States must double the financing of A.I.
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the United States must double the amount spent on A.I. research, says investor and A.I. specialist Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for all Google, Microsoft and Apple.
He said this because of the announcements about A.I. coming from various sections of the US government, despite the fact that the US does not have a formal strategy for A.I..
In the meantime, China announced its plan last year: by 2030 the country wants the number 1 to be at the level of A.I. innovations.
"To double the research budget to A.I. would be a good start, given that all other countries are so far behind the US, and we are looking for the next breakthrough in A.I.," Lee said.
A duplication of funding can lead to a duplication of the chance of the next major achievement for A.I. in the US, Lee said this week in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book ‘AI SuperPowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order’ was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Synovation Ventures, who invested in Face++, one of China's most important A.I. companies.
In the 1980s he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an A.I. system that beat American Othello's best player, and later he was manager of Microsoft Research and President of the Chinese Google Department.
Lee expressed his appreciation for technology competitions organised by the US government, such as the Robotics Challenge of the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency, and early when the next competition would take place, because it would help discover the next visionaries.
In the US, researchers often have to work hard to get government subsidies, Lee said.
‘China does not include our best academics, the companies do that,’ Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have spent the last few years recruiting universities to work on A.I..
Lee said that American efforts at A.I. would also benefit from a change in immigration policy.
“The doctorate at A.I. level should automatically receive a green card,” he said.
The Chinese National Council issued its development plan for artificial intelligence of the next generation in July 2017.
The Chinese Foundation for Natural Sciences provides financial support to employees of academic institutions, just as the National Science Foundation and other public organizations give money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Ministry of Defence launched a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to involve partners from industry and the academic world at the initiative, and the White House announced the formation of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence (Limited Committee for Artificial Intelligence).
And this month DARPA announced that $2 billion would be invested in the AI Next initiative.
The NSF is currently investing more than $100 million in research into A.I.
However, the US legislation which should lead to the establishment of a national safety commission for artificial intelligence has been in place for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on possible change of name of their country
Last Sunday, the Macedonian people voted in a referendum on the possible change of the name of their country in 'North Macedonia', thus a dispute with Greece that has been resolved for decades and that Greece would no longer hinder Macedonia's application for membership of the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province also called Macedonia, and says the name of its northern neighbour contains the country's claim to Greek territory, and consequently Greece has its veto against Macedonia's inclusion in the European Union and NATO.
The two governments concluded an agreement in June on the basis of the new name proposed, but nationalists believe that the change of name would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he is not going to vote in the referendum and by means of a boycott campaign it is not certain that the required rise will be achieved at least 50 per cent, so that the referendum may not be valid.
The issue on the ballot note is as follows: ‘Are you a proponent of NATO membership and the EU with acceptance of the agreement with Greece?’
“Providers of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that the price to be paid is worth trying to be a member of bodies such as the EU and NATO. Macedonia is one of the countries that arose when the former Yugoslavia was different.
"I come today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because that will lead to a safer life for all of us," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgievska in Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, enough Members have indicated that they will respect the outcome, which will determine it.
For the name change, it would be necessary to have a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The National Election Committee said that there had been no reports of irregularities at 1 p.m.
At that time, however, it was only 16 per cent, compared with 34 per cent during previous parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of the registered voters voted.
"I come to vote because it is important for my children. Our place is in Europe," said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, a voters in the capital of Skopje.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev of Macedonia, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted on 30 September 2018 in Strumica, Macedonia, during the referendum on the name change of the country that would open the way for NATO membership and the European Union.
For the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov set up a small stage and placed chairs for tents that were placed by people who had the referendum boycotten.
"We are the proponent of NATO and the EU, but we want to participate as a full member, not through a back door," Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries, such as China and Russia, and become part of European-Asian integration.'
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will make necessary investments for Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20 per cent.
'I am convinced that the overwhelming majority is more favourable, because more than 80% of our citizens are EU and NATO advocates,' Zaev said after delivering his vote.
He said that a 'yes' as a result would be 'a confirmation of our future'.
An opinion published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research showed that between 30 and 43 per cent of voters would participate in the referendum, less than the required event.
Another strike, performed by the hot Macedonian TV station Telma TV, concluded that 57 per cent of the respondents were planning to vote on Sunday.
70 percent of them would vote.
In order for the referendum to be successful, the rise should be 50 per cent plus one vote.
A failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the pro-western government's policy since it came into power in May last year.
Look at: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City passes full defense of Brighton and score
Last Saturday Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling made short matches with Brighton's defense at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester. Manchester City won the match with 2-0.
It looked like a flutter of a cent, how Aguero scored in the 65th minute.
The Argentine peak first got the ball played in the midfield.
He raced between three Brighton defenders, set in the open field.
There Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He knew how to pass a defender and was too fast for some others on the edge of Brighton's crime scene.
Then he gave a pass to the left, where Sterling was waiting.
The English attacker used his first action in the penalty zone to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right shoe to defeat targetman Mathew Ryan with a shot on the right side of the network.
‘Aguero has trouble with his feet,’ coach Pep Guardiola from Manchester City told the press.
‘We decided to let him play 55 to 60 minutes.
And that's what happened.
We were lucky he scored a goal at the time."
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the first advantage in the Premier League.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball when he was deep in Brighton's playground.
He sent a beautiful stick pass along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane kept the ball at his place and then sent Sterling to the second floor.
The Sky Blues player just tapped the ball, right before he was too far away.
City takes place on Tuesday at 12.55 p.m. against Hoppenheim in the group phase of the Champions League. The match takes place in the Rhein-Neckar Arena in the German Sinsheim.
Scherzer wants to play and it doesn't make it easy for the Rockies to reach the play-off
Now that the Washington Nationals are eliminated for the play-off, there was not much reason to force a new start.
However, the always competitive Scherzer hopes to play against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are yet consequences for the participation of the Rockies on the play-off. They are currently one match for the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies have at least endorsed a game-off wild card due to their 5-2-winning against the Nationals last Friday, but now they want to put everything in place to ensure their first section title.
“Although there is nothing more for us, we can at least point with the knowledge that the atmosphere here in Denver will be optimal with this audience and the other team is probably playing at the highest level that I would meet this year.
Why wouldn't I be involved in it?'
The Nationals still have to announce who will be on Sunday, but have been reluctant to set up Scherzer as a painter in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th start, was in the injection field on Thursday and would still pitch next Sunday, although it is normally his rest day.
Washington's right-hand helicopter is on 18-7 with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strike-outs in 220 2/3 inches this season.
Trump organizes a meeting in West Virginia
The President referred directly to the situation around Brett Kavanaugh, his candidate for the Supreme Court, while discussing the importance of Republican appearance in the interim elections.
“All that we have already accomplished is at stake in November.
In five weeks, one of the most important elections will take place in our lives.
This is one of the really big elections, I don't take part, but actually I take part, so I come up everywhere for great candidates," he said.
Trump went on to say: "We see a terrible radical group of Democrats, we see it happening now.
And they're determined to take the power back, no matter what they have to do for it.
It doesn't make them who they hurt, who they have to push away to get power and control. That's what they want: power and control, but we won't give them that."
The Democrats, he said, are on a mission to "stand still and prevent us".
‘And we have seen that in the last four days,’ he said, calling the Democrats ‘evil and common and false and false’.
He named the name of the Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein, who sits in the Senate Committee on Justice, leading to a loud call from the public.
‘Do you know what she said?
Have you read the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, no, I'm waiting for one... that was really a bad body language, the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer a broad church.
The party is intolerant to people who say what they think
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, that was no surprise.
Finally, I'm the latest in a whole series of Labour Members who get that we're not welcome, just because we say what we think.
My parliamentary colleague, Joan Ryan, received a similar treatment because she resolved against anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was punished with the motive for censorship because I didn't agree with Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of a responsible economic policy, of national security, of Europe, of ironically similar issues as this one, in which Jeremy did not agree with previous leaders.
The announcement of the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday stated: 'we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.'
And so it was during most GC meetings on Friday night during the eight years that I was already a local Labour Parliament member.
Unfortunately, today it is not the show of many meetings and the promise of a 'older, weaker' policy has long been forgotten, if it has ever begun.
It is becoming increasingly clear that a different opinion is not tolerated in the Labour Party and that any opinion is assessed whether or not it is acceptable for party management.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, and colleagues who, as far as I was aware, had a similar political view as I was, suddenly expected me to turn around and take a position where I would never otherwise have agreed on issues such as national security to the European single market.
When I speak to a public, as I say, there are social media stakeholders calling for the rejection of my candidacy as a member of parliament for the following elections, which exposes the policy of the centre and tells me that I should not be a member of Labour.
And that's just what I'm going through.
Indeed, I know that I am happier than some of my colleagues because the comments to my address on the general policy are.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who have every day a flood of sexual or racist reactions, but do not be intimidated.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this period of politics is that heavy cuts appear to be considered normal.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that broad church and with every ‘motion of disbelief’ or change of selection rules, the party is getting smaller.
I have often received the opinion in the last two years to keep me informed, not simply to express my opinion, and then I would ‘not be in trouble’.
But that's not why I went into politics.
Since 32 years ago, as a student member of Labour, provoked by the neglect of thatcher's government, which literally disrupted my classroom, I have always prayed for better public services for those who need it most, both in my role as a council member and in my role as a minister.
I've never kept my policy hidden, not in the last election.
Everyone in Nottingham East was clear about my political positions and my disputes with the current leadership.
To those who have promoted the motion on Friday, I can only say one thing: when the country moves towards a Brexit that will harm families, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact, I have only one message, which is not addressed to Nottingham Momentum, but to my electors, whether they are now a member of Labour or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that threats to reject my candidacy as a member of parliament for the following elections or political opportunities will not stop me from acting in accordance with what I think is in your interest.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unsuccessful Ayr on the way to the top
Two late attempts may have dropped the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr triumphs right in this great competition of the day in the Tennent's Premiership.
They are now at the top of the classification, the only unfavourable team of the ten.
Finally, it was both their superior defense and their better chances that the housekeeper would provide the victory, and coach Peter Murchie could be satisfied.
“We’ve had a hard time in our games, and we’re still unlucky, so I’m a happy man”, he said.
Robyn Christie van Melrose: ‘All honor to Ayr, they have made better use of their opportunities than we do.’
Grant Anderson's trial in the 14th minute, completed by Frazier Climo, led to an advance for Ayr, but by a yellow map of Rory Hughes of the Scottish National team (which he received during the Warriors' match) Melrose was able to let the figures speak and Jason Baggot break a trial.
Climo took care of an extra charge for Ayr and scored a conversion after a solotry just for the rest. So it became 17-5 for Ayr after the first half.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's try, followed by a conversion from Baggot, reduced the lead to five points.
The match was long silent for a serious wound by Ruarid Knott, which was performed on a branch card, and once the match was restarted, Ayr could continue through a trial by Stafford McDowall followed by a conversion of Climo.
Then the leader, Blair Macpherson of Ayr, received a yellow card, and recalculated Melrose with the extra man when no conversion followed a try from Bruce Colvine at the end of a match with the pressure very high.
However, the housekeeper came back, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card because he picked Climo without the ball, MacPherson took care of the emerging Ayr-maul for a touch-down on the penalty line-out.
Climo took care of the conversion, and did that almost immediately after the restart, after Kyle Rowe picked up the box kick of David Armstrong and halfback Gregor Henry sent away for the fifth attempt of the household.
Ster van Still Game is ready for a new career in the restaurant world
It seems that actor Ford Kieran is going from Still Game to the horeca. Apparently he is appointed director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old Jack Jarvis plays in the popular BBC series, which he writes and in which he himself acts together with his comedy partner Greg Hemhill.
The duo announced that the upcoming ninth series will be the last in the series, and it seems that Kiernan's life after Craiglang is already planning.
According to official data, he is the director of Aeringmorn Limited.
The actor did not want to comment on the story, but a source from the Scottish Sun made it clear that Kiernan was looking for a way to participate in the ‘bloody restaurant business’ in Glasgow.
'The sea is of us': the country-locked Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen the road to the Pacific
Zeelui patrols in a witnessing marine office in La Paz.
At public buildings, a flag is waved by an ocean blue flag.
On all titicacameer marine bases to the Amazon, the motto is: ‘The sea is ours.
It's a duty to win them back."
Throughout the country, Bolivia is still alive, as is the wish to preserve the Pacific after a bloody Nineteenth-century conflict with Chile.
This hope may have reached its peak in the last decade, as Bolivia is awaiting a decision by the International Court of Justice, which should be held on 1 October after five years of consultation.
‘Bolivia has the moment, a spirit of unity and serenity, and of course looks forward to the outcome,’ said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians across the country will look at the judgment of the Court of Justice on large screens, hoping that the Court of Justice in The Hague, in favour of Bolivia, will plead that Chile, after decades of good conversation, is obliged to give Bolivia a sovereign access to the sea.
Also for Evo Morales, the charismatic native president of Bolivia, who next year stands for a controversial re-election struggle, is much at stake with the statement of Monday.
‘We are very close to the return to the Pacific,’ he vowed at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the Court will probably not decide in favour of Bolivia, and even if that were so, there would be little change.
The United Nations agency established in the Netherlands does not have the power to recognise the territory of Chile and has indicated that it will not determine the outcome of possible discussions.
That the decision of the International Court of Justice is only six months after the conclusion states that the case was ‘not complicated’, says Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And the prospects for a positive result from Bolivia have certainly not improved, on the contrary, over the last four years the situation may have become even worse.
‘The matter around the access to the sea is captured by the current Bolivian government,’ Zárate said.
The warlike rhetoric of Morales has all the good wishes that Chile may still have been totally undermining, she claimed.
Bolivia and Chile will continue at a certain time with their talks, but it will be extremely difficult to talk later.
Since 1962, the two countries have had no ambassadorship in each other's countries.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, who represents Bolivia in The Hague, denies that the court's decision has been taken extremely quickly.
On Monday, Bolivia will have “an extraordinary opportunity to start a new period of international relations with Chile” and a chance to “end one of 139 years of differences of opinion, with mutual benefits”, he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America, used the maritime issue as a political crucifix.
‘Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific,’ he added.
‘The decision is an opportunity to see that we must leave the past behind.’
North Korea says nuclear disarmament is only possible if it can trust the US
The North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his country will never remove his nuclear weapons if Washington cannot trust it.
On Saturday, Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to comply with the promises made during a summit between the leaders of the rivals in Singapore.
He said this at the moment that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems to be about to restart the ongoing nuclear diplomacy, more than three months after the summit in Singapore with Kim Jong Un from North Korea.
Ri says it's a 'autopie' that the continued sanctions and the American opposition against a declaration ending the Korean war will ever get on the knees.
Washington is not inclined to agree with the statement without Pyongyang putting important steps first in the field of disarmament.
Both Kim and American President Donald Trump want a second summit meeting.
But there is skepticism and there is doubt that Pyongyang is serious if he says he would reject an arsenal that the country probably sees as his only way to guarantee his safety.
Pompeo is planning to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris reveal the latest collection of huge head covers, soon to buy at you nearby
If you want to expand your band collection or keep the sun completely out of your sight, search instead.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne discovered a series of crazy oversized head covers for their SS19 collection on the catwalk, a striking set during the Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractical guards were not to think away from Instagram and these designers sent their blinding creatures to the catwalk.
The striking piece of Valentino was a giant beige hat decorated with a quadrilateral wide edge that hangs over the eyes of the models.
Other overlapping accessories were watermelons possessed with precious stones, a magic hat and even ananas, but they were not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre masks, just in time for Halloween.
With many of the colorful masks, the lips were closed. They resembled Hannibal Lecter more than on high couture.
The one creature looked like a dike, complete with snorkel and shine, while the other looked like a molten ice.
And if you want to follow this bold fashion, you're lucky.
Stylwatchers predict that the huge guards will find their way to the clothing shops near you.
The giant hats may be inspired by 'La Bombay', the narrow hat with a two-metre wide edge that everyone wears, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the very impractical hat that appeared on social media everywhere also provided another great creation on the catwalk: a narrow beach bag that was almost as big as the model in the bath pack that the bag brought together.
The reddoranje raffia bag, set off with raffia frenzies and finished with a white leather hanger, was the most outstanding piece in the La Riviera SS19 collection of Jacquemus during Paris Fashion Week.
The famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: 'I expect to see large guards and beach bags in the shops in the summer. Since the designer has made such a huge impact, it would be difficult to ignore the question of extra large accessories.'
John Edward: Languages essential for world citizens
The independent schools in Scotland have an excellent state of service in the field of academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with a number of excellent exam results, as well as individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other community initiatives.
With more than 30,000 students in Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), aim to provide the best service to their students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for continued and higher education, the career they have chosen and their place as world citizens.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a tailor-made school curriculum, we see that modern languages remain popular and desirable sectors in excellent schools.
Nelson Mandela said: ‘If you talk to someone in a language he understands, you reach his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, you reach his heart."
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot trust only in English when we want to build relationships and a bond of trust with people from other countries.
From the recent results of this year's exam, we can derive that languages are on top of the ranking list, with the highest success rates in independent schools.
In total, 68 percent of the students who studied foreign languages achieved a high score.
According to data collected from 74 schools attached to SCIS, 72 per cent of students received a high score (‘A’) in Mandarin, while 72 per cent of German students, 69 per cent of French students, and 63 per cent of Spanish students also received an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are now highly valued as STEM subjects (scientific, technology, technology and mathematics) in independent school programs and elsewhere.
In 2014, a study by the British Commission on Employment and Skills revealed that 17 per cent of the obstacles to filling vacancies were attributed to a lack of language skills, according to employers.
Language skills thus become increasingly important to prepare young people for their future career.
Now more and more vacancies require language knowledge, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Despite the career that a person chooses, when he has learned a second language, he has a real advantage in the future with such skills for life.
Direct communication with people from abroad automatically gives a multilingual person an advantage over competition.
According to a YouGov score of more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75 per cent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to conduct a conversation. France was the only language that exceeded 10 per cent, with a total of 15 per cent.
This is why investing in language education is now important for children today.
Several languages, especially those from emerging economies, will offer children a better chance of finding a meaningful job.
In Scotland, schools themselves choose which languages they teach.
A number of schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while other schools will teach which are most important for the United Kingdom when they look forward to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japan.
Whatever the interests of your child, there will always be different languages to choose in independent schools, with teachers specialized in this field.
Scottish independent schools set up to provide a learning environment that prepares children and gives them the skills needed to succeed, no matter what the future may be.
At the moment it cannot be denied that languages remain vital in a global business environment for the future of the country, so this should be reflected in education.
Modern languages should in fact be regarded as 'international communication skills'.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
It's a good thing to do.
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron makes his debut at the Lakers in San Diego on Sunday
Fans waiting at LeBron James' first match at the Los Angeles Lakers, waiting is almost over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James would play in the opening match before the season against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
It has to be determined how many minutes he will play.
‘There will be more than one, and less than 48,’ said Walton on the official website of the Lakers.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell said in a tweet that James would probably play a limited number of minutes.
After the training earlier this week, James was asked for his plans for the Lakers scheme for the six games before the season.
‘At this stage of my career, I don’t need a race before the season to prepare for me,’ he said.
Periods of election rallys from Trump in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump starts tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia, on a long series of election rallys
It's the first of five planned rallys from Trump in the next week, including stops in places that are related to him, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now the vote on the appointment of the candidate he chooses for the vacancy in the Supreme Court has been put in custody, Tromp wants to build support for the forthcoming interim elections, because the Republicans risk losing control of Congress when it is voted in November.
How late does Trump's rally start in West Virginia tonight and how do you look online?
The rally of Trump in Wheeling, West Virginia, starts tonight, Saturday 29 September 2018, at 19 o'clock.
You can view Trumps rally in West Virginia online via live stream on YouTube.
Trump will probably have about the hearings for candidate-opposal Brett Kavanaugh this week. These were now additionally charged with sexual misconduct, and the Senate may be waiting a week to vote on his appointment, while the FBI investigates the case.
But the main objective of this series of rallys is to help the Republicans who are candidates for the elections in November to get more of them.
President Trump's campaign guide said that the following week these five rallys are intended to ‘stimulate volunteers and supporters, while the republics are trying to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Deputies’, so Reuters.
‘Congress control is so important for its programme that the President travels to as many states as possible to start the printed campaign season,’ said a spokesman of the Trump campaign who did not want to be mentioned against Reuters.
The rally of tonight at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could attract fans from Ohio and Pennsylvania and be discussed in the media of Pittsburgh, West Virginia Metro News said.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump visited West Virginia, the state he won in 2016 with more than 40 percentage points.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for the Senate of West Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who remains in the stakes.
"It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president must come to give him a boost in the stakes," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA is ready to fight to keep the hope alive in the run to the singles of Sunday
After three one-sided sessions, the foursomes of Saturday afternoon may have been just what this Ryder Cup needed.
The dazzling slender of opportunities is a fully invented sport concept, but a where players really believe, and especially in competitions like this.
So who gets the best chances right now?
"They had a origin of six points first, and now that's four more, so we find so little that happiness is on our side right now," Jordan Spieth said before he left at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe has the advantage that they stand for four points, while 12 are still at stake.
The Americans find, as Spieth said, that they have a little wind in their sails, and there are many things that give courage, not least the shape of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have played together all day and each three points of the four.
Speeth has been a fearsome opponent from tea to green and he sets a good example.
The typical keel sounds he makes when he plays well were louder as his rounds progressed and he achieved a crucial well with which four matches became a success when he and Thomas were behind two points after two matches.
His post with which she won the match on 15 was followed by a similar cry, the kind from which you can draw that he believes that the American team has not yet been reported.
"You have to dig deep and just worry about your own game," Spieth said.
That's all these players can do now.
18 holes to print your stamp.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the unmistakable story of the Ryder Cup.
This remarkable but glorious European duo has four to four and can do nothing wrong.
‘Moliwood’ was the only duo that on Saturday afternoon did not play bogey, but also on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the back nine on Friday morning they avoided bogeys.
As a result of this series, and the way in which they seem to share energy with their nervous audience, they are the players who have to be reported on Sunday. If Fleetwood or Molinari wins, he will ever be the most popular player who will win a European victory when the sun goes over Le Golf National.
Both prefer different holes at the same time.
It is, however, a warning to speak of a European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made short measurements with Sergio Garcia, the fourball hero that morning, when he was a duo with Alex Noren.
A bowey and two doubles on the front of the nine led to a backbone for the Spaniard and the Swedish who did not come over them anymore.
But on Sunday, there's no one who can help get your back.
The four-balls and foursomes are so fascinating to see through the interactions between the duo's, the opinion they give, the opinion they do not give and the way in which a strategy can be modified.
So far, the European team has played the best part and has a great lead in the course of the last day, but this foursome session has also shown that the US team is ready to fight, something that some, especially in the US, have doubted.
Europe takes the lead with 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe begins with a great lead on the last day of the Ryder Cup. After the four-balls and foursomes of Saturday they stand in front of the United States with 10-6.
The seasoned duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led their team with two victories more than Tiger Woods, which had a hard time, which now has four points in Le Golf National.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, that the trophy they wanted to lose in Hazeltine two years ago, was stronger than the bluffing Americans in the four-balls in the morning, with a score of 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the foursomes, where it won two matches, but couldn't get his back any more.
Jim Fury's team has to score eight points during the 12 singles matches of Sunday to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European newcomer to win four points on row, while he and Molinari, who received the nickname 'Mollwood' after a sensational weekend, are the second duo in Ryder Cup's history that wins four points in their four opening competitions.
After they had joined Woods and Patrick Reed in the four-balls, they were beautifully played on each other and beat down a disappointing Woods and American novelist Bryson Dechambeau with a powerful 5&4.
Woods, who went through two games on Saturday, showed off and then a beautiful set, but now he lost 19 of his 29 matches in four-balls and four-songs and seven on row.
Justin Rose, equipped for the four-balls of ‘ mornings, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes and together they defeated Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koopka, the number one and three of the world, with 2&1.
However, it was not a snowy roof for Europe on this pleasant day with a breeze south-west of Paris.
Jordan Spieth, who won the Major three times, and Justin Thomas set the standard for the Americans on Saturday with three points.
They won a hard match with 2&1 of the Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-balls and later defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy with 4&3 in the foursomes, after losing the first four holes.
It has only happened twice before in the history of Ryder Cup that a team has been able to pick up a set of four points at the beginning of the singles, although the Furik team has enough to play the same game, as they currently have the trophy in their hands.
But now they've been standing in second place for two days, it seems like an attack on Sunday too high.
North Korea says it will unarm itself without trust
On Saturday, the Minister for Foreign Affairs of North Korea told the United Nations that the continued sanctions would lead to increasing mistrust in the United States and that the country could not, under such circumstances, give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally.
Ri Yong Ho told the UN Annual General Meeting that North Korea had taken ‘significant goodwill measures’ in recent years, such as stopping nuclear and missile testing, dismantling the location for nuclear tests and the promise not to distribute nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
‘But we do not see a consistent response from the US,’ he said.
"Without any confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances we will not be disarmed on our own."
Although Ri reiterated the well-known North Korean complaints about the fight against a 'fascinated' approach to denuclarisation, which would reward North Korea as the next step, it was noted that he did not reject unilateral denuclarisation a priori, as Pyongyang did earlier.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump during the first summit between an active American president and a North Korean leader on 12 June in Singapore, when Kim promised to work on the 'denoclaration of the Korean peninsula' while Trump promised guarantees for the security of North Korea.
North Korea is seeking a formal end to the Korean war of 1950-53, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first surrender his nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls for strong international sanctions against North Korea.
"The U.S. urges 'denuclearization first' and increases the pressure by means of sanctions to achieve their goal in a forceful way and even by objecting to the 'declaration of the end of war', Ri said.
‘The perception that sanctions can put us on our knees is an air castle of people who are unaware of us.
But the problem is that the continuing sanctions only strengthen us.'
Ri made no mention of plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, something that the U.S. leader would have missed earlier this week at the United Nations.
Instead, the Minister stressed three meetings between Kim and the South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added: 'If the other party on this issue of denuclearization was South Korea and not the US, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have come to such an impasse.'
However, Ri's speech was much different than last year, when he told the United Nations General Assembly that it was inevitable that North Korean rockets on the American continent were being directed after 'Mr. Evil President' Trump Kim called a 'racetman' on a suicide mission.
Trump, who threatened to destroy North Korea completely last year, praised Kim this year with the United Nations for his courage to take steps to disarm, but said that there should still be much to do and that the sanctions should continue to denuclearize North Korea.
Wednesday Trump said he had no timetable for this: ‘If it takes two years, three years, or five months, it doesn’t matter.’
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council must reward the steps taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Thursday to the UN Security Council: ‘The maintenance of the sanctions of the Security Council must be continued strongly and firmly until we have achieved the complete, final, verified denuclearization.’
Since 2006, the Security Council has imposed enormous sanctions against North Korea to significantly reduce funding for Pyongyang nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo had a meeting with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and said he would go back to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not go well.
Almost a few hours after he left Pyongyang in July and said that progress had been made, North Korea told him about the setting of 'walking demands'.
North Korea promised this month at a meeting with Moon to dismantle a rocket site and also a nuclear complex if the United States would take appropriate measures.
He said that Kim had told him that the 'consistent measures' he wanted were security guarantees that Trump had promised in Singapore, and that steps were taken towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students follow course on the importance of adequate rest
A new course at Harvard University this year ensures that all students get more sleep, in an effort to fight the growing macho culture in which it seems cool to study all night and drink a lot of caffeine.
A professor found that the students of the world's largest university often have no idea of the basic principles of self-care.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School, a specialist associated with the Brigham and Women's Hospital, presented the course. For as long as he knows this is unique in the US.
He got the idea to start with the course after giving a talk about the impact of sleeplessness on learning.
'At the end of my speech, a girl came to me saying, 'Why am I getting to hear this now, in my last year?'
She said no one had ever told her how important sleep was, which surprised me, he said to The Telegraph.
The course, organised this year for the first time, explains to the students the basic principles of how good sleep habits improve academic and athletic performance and how they also promote their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the health services of the university, said the university decided to organize the course when it was found that students had a serious sleep deficit during the week.
The course takes one hour and includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one of the sections, the students see a picture of a bedroom, where they click on coffee cups, curtains, exercise devices and books to learn more about the effects of caffeine and light and how sports performances are influenced by sleep deprivation, and the importance of a routine in sleeping.
In another part, participants learn how long-term sleep deprivation increases the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
By means of a flat ground of the campus, with interactive icons, participants are encouraged to reflect on their daily routine.
“We know that this will not immediately change the behaviour of the students.
But we believe that they have the right to know all of this, just as people have the right to know the consequences of the choice of cigarettes on their health, Czeisler added.
The culture of flexicurity on one night still exists, he says, and by modern technology and increasing pressure on students, the problem of sleeplessness is growing.
Concerns for adequate sleep, of good quality, must be the ‘secret weapon’ of the student to fight stress, fatigue and fear, he said, and even to avoid weight gain, because sleep deprivation ensures that the brain gives them a constant hunger.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old from California who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to set up the course. He had, last year, followed a lesson with the professor when he studied at Harvard in his first year.
He said that his course had opened his eyes and inspired him to make the course available to everyone on campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all students to follow a similar study programme before they come to the competition institution.
Professor Czeisler advises students to set up an alarm for their bedtime, and not only an alarm to stand up. They must also be aware of the harmful effects of the 'blue light' of electronic displays and LED lighting, which can disrupt your circadian rhythm, making it difficult to fall asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Target of Menga makes the men of Gerrard go down
The Rangers saw their race again disappointingly going on when Dolly Menga scored and Steven Gerrard's weak team defeated 1-0 in Livingstone.
The team of Ibrox hoped for a first victory during a match since they defeated St Johnstone with 4-1 in February, but Gary Holt's team took care of the defeat, almost the second of Gerrard as manager in 18 matches. His team now stands behind eight points on Hearts, which went on to the top of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga scored seven minutes for rest, and the Rangers failed to score the equalizer.
The Rangers now fall to the sixth place, Livingston rises to the third, with only a difference in the number of goals compared to Hibernian.
And the Rangers could have even more problems, as border attorney Calum Spence had to be treated for a major injury after apparently an object was thrown to him by the visitors' supporters.
Gerrard made eight changes in his team. They crossed Ayr and went to the half finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt remained at the same eleventh for Livingston, which the Hearts knew a point last week to cut off. He would have been excited about the way his well-trained team had to block the opponents at every set.
The Rangers may have had most of the Balbes, but Livingstone did more.
They had to score after two minutes, when Menga dropped the ball for the first time and Scott Pittman had the goal of Allan McGregor in the vision, but the midfield couldn't finish it.
A deep free step of Keaghan Jacobs's commander, Craig Halkett, but his colleague-defender Alan Lithgow jumped against the rear pole.
The Rangers did manage to take over the control, but they seemed to hope for a good outcome rather than believe in it if they could approach the goal.
Alfredo Morelos found in any case that he had the right to a fine when he and Steven Lawless were fighting after a quarter, but Judge Steven Thomson denied the Colombian request.
The Rangers could only shoot twice to the goal in the first half, but Liam Kelly, a former targetman at the Ibrox, was able to withstand Lassana Coulibally's headball and Ovie Ejaria's thumb shot with ease.
The opening of Livingston in the 34th minute may or may not be in the extension of the general game run, no one can deny that they deserved it, although it was only for their hard work.
Again, the Rangers were not raised against Jacobs' deep game pattern.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher passed the ball on to Scott Robinson, who remained cold-blooded and chose Menga, who took the ball with ease to the goal.
Gerrard took care of a break with the change Coulibally/Ryan Kent. This set had almost immediate effects when the bird player passed Morelos, but an impressive Kelly race from his line to stop the ball.
But Livingston kept the visitors forced to play a kind of game that Livingstone prefers to play, with Lithgov and Halket standing long balls.
Holt's team had been able to increase its lead in the final stage of the match, but McGregor held a good stand and blocked Jacobs, after which Lithgov came out of the corner.
Invaller Glenn Middleton of the Rangers asked at the end of the match for a sentence after an invasion with Jacobs, but Thomson looked on the other side again.
Almanak: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from the Almanac of our 'Sunday Morning': September 30, 1882, today just 136 years ago, for whom can good COUNT... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm 'Hans' Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device called Geiger counter.
Since then, the speaker has not been thinking about science, and has also become an icon in pop culture, for example in 'Bells or Coronado', a 1950 film with the unimaginable cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: ‘What in God’s name is that?’
Rogers: ‘It is a geiger counter. It is used to trace radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
If you set up this headphone, you will hear the effect of the atoms emitted by the radioactivity in the minerals.'
Evans: ‘It’s a real joke now!’
'Hans' Geiger died in 1945, almost a few days before his 63st birthday.
But the invention bearing his name remains relevant.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to ‘see’ harmful cells
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to ‘see’ and kill malicious cells
Vaccine teaches the immune system to identify harmful cells in the course of treatment
The method includes the extraction of immune cells in a patient to change them into a laboratory
They can then ‘see’ a protein that often occurs in many types of cancer and are then reinjected
A test vaccine provides promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman who was treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to detect harmful cells saw her egg pancreas disappear for more than 18 months.
The method removes immune cells in a patient, after which the cells in the lab are adjusted so that they can “see” the protein HER2, which often occurs in all types of cancer. Then the cells are reinjected.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the American National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said, "Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine."
HER2 ‘stimulates the growth of different types of cancer’, including breast cancer, ovary cancer, lung cancer and intestinal cancer, released Professor Berzofsky.
A similar way to remove immune cells from patients and ‘learn’ these cells to tackle cancer cells has been shown to work in the treatment of a particular type of leukaemia.
Kanye West sets off pro-Trump-thirade and wears MAGA-pet after its appearance in Saturday Night Live.
That didn't go like he hoped.
Kanye West was celebrated during a Saturday Night Live broadcast after an uncompromising event in which he awarded US President Donald Trump and said he would become a presidential candidate in 2020.
After he had brought his third song of the evening, Ghost Town, with a pet on his head with the text Make America Great Again, he cut off a triad against the Democrats and repeated that he supported Trump.
‘When I talk to a white man, he asks, ‘How can you have sympathy for Trump now? He is a racist!’
If I was worried about racism, I'd been away from America for a long time," he said.
The broadcast of Saturday Night Live began with a parody in which Hollywood star Matt Damon slammed the dragon with the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh in the Senate Committee for Justice in connection with the alleged assault of Christine Blasey Ford.
West's triad was not sent out, but comical Chris Rock uploaded it to social media.
It's not clear if Rock with his post wants to stick the dragon with West.
West also complained to the public that he had been taken under fire for his pet.
‘They have driven me backstage.
They said, ‘Don’t stop at the stage with that pet.’
They fucked me up!
And then they say I'm apathetic, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: ‘Do you want to see what apathetic looks like?’ He said he would attract her superman-cape, ‘for that means you can’t order me. Do you want the world to get better?
Give me some love.'
From the audience, at least twice a book group came and the castes of SNL were brought into disrepute, according to Variety. The magazine was told by an audience: ‘The whole studio was silent.’
West was too guest as last-minute replacement of singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-friend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West surprised many with the performance of the number I Love it while he was dressed as Perrier-flies.
West received support from the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: ‘To one of our bravest spirits: Thank you for the MASSA TROTSEERT.’
But talk show-presenter Karen Hunter tweeted that West was just ‘just himself, and that's wonderful.'
‘But I choose to reward someone who damages, supports and expels my community (by buying his music or clothing or by supporting his ‘art’).
He's free to do whatever he wants.
We, too, added them.
Before the show began, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name. From now on he is, he says, ‘the being that is formally known as Kanye West’.
He's not the first artist to change his name, he was preceded by Diddy Puff, also known as Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Collegiate rapper Snoop Dogg also carried the name Snoop Lion and the deceased musical Prince ever changed his name into a symbol and then in The Artist formally known as Prince.
Accused of attempted murder at a party in a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man was accused of attempted murder after a man was put in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, the police said.
The complainant is expected to appear before the police judge in Belfast on Monday.
The prosecution will be investigated by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington leads to toxic manhood
Kit Harington is known for his role as knight Jon Snow in the violent medieval fantasy Game of Thrones of HBO.
But the 31-year-old actor draws up the stereotype of the macho hero and says that young boys often think they have to be smart enough to get respect when seeing such roles on the screen.
In a conversation with The Sunday Times Culture Kit said that he felt that ‘there was something wrong’ and wondered how the problem of toxic manhood should be addressed in the time of #MeToo.
Kit, recently married to his co-star of Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, who is also 31, admitted that he is strongly convinced that the problem has to be addressed.
'This is a very important question for me personally: where has it gone wrong with our humanity?' he said.
"What did we learn when men grew up, so that we are now faced with this problem?"
Kit thinks that television could be even partially responsible for the increase in toxic humanity by its very male characters.
He continued, ‘What was born and what was taught?’
What is told on TV and on the street that young boys think they should be a certain kind of man?
I think that is one of the big questions today: how do we change that?
For there is obviously something wrong with young men."
In the interview he also admitted that he will not act in prequels or sequels of Games of Thrones when the series has passed the following summer, because he is ‘clear with battlefields and horses’.
From November Kit is playing with a Revival of True West of Sam Shepard, the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a assailant.
The actor recently revealed that he finds his encounter with his wife Rose the most beautiful result of Game of Thrones.
'I've met my wife during the series, so that's how I've kept my future family and my life from now on,' he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the great love of Kits character Jon Snow, in the fantasy that was crowned with an Emmy.
The couple were married in June 2018 on the property of Leslies family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports an increase of 14% of new cases
China reports that the number of Chinese with HIV and AIDS increased by 14%.
Health authorities say that more than 820,000 people have been affected in the country.
Only 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
In the vast majority of new cases, the diseases were transmitted through sex, which was not so in the past.
In the past, HIV has rapidly spread in some parts of China through transfusions of contaminated blood.
But the number of people who are living in this way is now almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, compared to the same period last year, the number of people with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 100,000.
The transmission of HIV through sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality has been no longer punishable in China since 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people has become widespread.
According to estimates, between 70 and 90% of men who have sex with men would eventually marry a woman.
The disease is often transmitted by insufficient protection in sexual relations in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV treatment in the context of its efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that staff member has leaked data from Republican senators and leads to 'dangerous lies' and 'comploit theories'
The U.S. Congressman Maxine Waters argues against the allegations that one of its staff members has placed the personal data of three American Republican senators on the Wikipedia page of the legislators.
The Los Angeles Democrat claims that the charges are distributed by ‘extreme rights’ advocates and websites.
‘Little lies, lies and more common lies’, Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published data would include the private address and telephone number of US Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The data appeared on Thursdays online. They were posted by an unknown person in Capitol Hill during a hearing of the Senate committee on charges of sexual misconduct at the address of Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate for the Supreme Court.
The leak came after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
According to conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, the IP address indicated that the source of the posts is connected to the Waters office and contained the information of a Waters employee, said the Hill.
"This baseless charge is completely false and a false lie," said Waters.
‘My staff, whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised as a result of these false accusations, were in no way responsible for leaking this information.
This unsubstantiated charge is completely false and a false lie.'
Waters' statement was already a critical flight online, including by former press officer of the White House Ari Fleischer.
‘This denial sounds evil’, Fleischer wrote.
"From here you can open that she does not have the temper to be Congress member.
If someone is accused of something he hasn't done, he shouldn't be angry.
He doesn't have to be rebellious.
He must not question the prosecutor's motives.
He must remain calm and calm."
Fleischer appeared to compare the response of Waters to the criticism of the Democrats on Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of excessive evil during the Thursday hearing.
Also Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who wants to take over Waters' place in the interim elections, gave his opinion on Twitter.
'Fifty, if it's true,' he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said that her office had informed the relevant services and law enforcement authorities of these false charges.
‘We will make the perpetrators known,’ she said, ‘and that they are legally liable for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to my staff.’
Review: Johnny English Strikes Again - weak spy parade with Rowan Atkinson
In every new film with a British impact, we are now traditionally looking for references to the Brexit, and that is true of this revival of the Johnny English-French, the comic action films with a sleeping spy in the head, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and was called back into life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Is this airy self-satisfaction about how bad we are doing the latest export product for our country?
The incompetent Johnny English, with its eye-browsing eyes and flexible faces, manages to send everything in the hundreds, including its second comeback. You can already derive from his name that he is a general comic character that was considered for bioscopists in countries where one speaks a language other than English.
He is, of course, the stupid secret agent who, despite his bizarre claim to smooth glamorous, a little Clouseau, a fly Mr. Bean and a branch of that guy who contributed one need to the theme number of Chariots or Fire during the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games in London in 2012.
It is originally based on the traveler and the international mysterious man who Atkinson ever played in Barclaycard's TV booths (which everyone has forgotten in the meantime) who always leaves a certain mess.
His latest portrait of Johnny English contains one or two beautiful moments.
I found it wonderful how Johnny English approaches a helicopter in his medieval arms suit and the rotor blades just against his helmet tips.
Atkinson can show how many talents he has for physical comedy in this film, but the humor is not enough about and crazy enough, especially now the "stupid" film series such as 007 and Mission Impossible itself include comedy as an ingredient, and do that well.
The humor seems to be intended for children rather than for adults, and Johnny English's doll disaster is less original and focused on me than the jokes without the text of the character Bean that Atkinson plays.
The constant theme is now that Britain is experiencing great difficulties.
A cyberhacker has infiltrated the super-secret spy network on the web, making the identity of all active secret agents known in Britain, to great dissipation of the agent in function, a unfortunately small role of Kevin Eldon.
That's the drop that's always going through the prime minister, a pretentious woman with problems at her head and terribly unpopular as a politician. Emma Thompson is doing her very best with this character that makes Teresa May think, but the script does not offer much material to work with.
According to her information advisors, she has to put in place a retired spy, as each active spy is compromised.
And that means the sprinting Johnny English himself, who now works as a schoolmaster in a chic institution, but unofficially teaches about undercover work. Here are nice jokes in the story, because the spy students of English think of School or Rock.
English is quickly released on Whitehall for emergency lettering and reunited with his former pathetic help Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man. His wife is the captain of a submarine, an insatiable and jovial role under Vicki Pepperdine's level.
The Batman and Robin of Her Majesty's Secret Service are thus back in action and meet Olga Kurylenko's bloody woman fatal Ophelia Bulletova.
In the meantime, the prime minister unfortunately falls for the charms of the charismatic technology mill that claims he can solve the British computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of cool doll fun: dressed as officers they burn a cautious French restaurant, they kick the lady on board the luxury of Volta and English reject pure anarchy when he tries to use a Virtual Reality headset to make himself familiar with the interior of Volta's house.
To this end, all registers are opened, but as well as the scene is indisputable, she does what she thinks of child television.
It's not all very original.
And just like the other Johnny English films, I ask myself: can the British film sector really not think of any role that affects Rowan Atkinson's talent?
Labour denies that the party is a plan to consider where Britain works for four days a week, but is paid for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party would consider a radical plan for Britain to work four days a week, but for five days.
The party would like to hear from companies base the savings they make as a result of the revolution of artificial intelligence (A.I.) by giving their employees an extra day's vacation.
In this way, workers can enjoy a three-day weekend, but still earn much.
According to sources, the idea in the economic agenda of the party and the plans to bring the balance of the country to the attention of the workers is ‘past’.
The transition to a working week of four days has already been approved by the Trade Unions Agreement, which finds it a good way to ensure that workers can benefit from the changing economy.
A high-ranking source from the Labour Party said to The Sunday Times: ‘A policy revision will be announced before the end of the year.
"It will not take place from one moment to the other, but a four-day work week is an objective that fits within the party's effort to make the economy more balanced for the benefit of workers and also within the party's overall industrial strategy."
Labour is not the first party to support such an idea, given that the Green Party has already promised a four-day work week in the 2017 national election campaign.
However, the effort is not yet supported by the full Labour Party.
A spokesman for the Labour Party said: "A four-day work week is not the party's policy plan, nor is it considered by the party."
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour Conference last week to clarify his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back the power of the 'respectless drivers' and the 'profesors' in utility companies.
The plans of Shadow Chancellor also mean that the current shareholders of water companies may not recover the full value of their share, as a Labour government could apply 'shorts' on the basis of observed failure.
He also confirmed that there are plans to include employees in the management boards of companies and to establish inclusive ownership funds (Inclusive Ownership Funds) with which 10% of the shares of companies from the private sector are given to employees who can earn up to £500 per year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell '60 minutes' or the FBI investigation to Kavanaugh can change their mind
The FBI's investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his nomination for the Supreme Court by at least one week and raises the question whether the FBI's findings could ensure that Republican senators withdraw their support for the candidate.
In an interview sent on Sunday at '60 Minutes', early Scott Pelley corresponded to the Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham or the FBI could discover something that could lead them to change their mind.
Kennedy looked more open to this than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I told the hearing that I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, after the charge came out, and I asked him, 'Have you done it?'
He was resolute, determined, undoubled."
However, Graham's voice seems to be wall-resistant.
"My opinion on Brett Kavanaugh stands firm and the charge should contain dynamism," he said.
"As for Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett strongly denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And no one who was named by her could verify.
It's 36 years ago.
I don't see any new developments."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has contributed to reducing poverty?
This Saturday in New York is organized the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event where a very impressive line-up will take place on stars and a equally impressive mission is known: the end of poverty in the world.
For the seventh time again, tens of thousands of people for the Global Citizen Festival will come to the Great Lawn in Central Park. Not only to enjoy acts like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes but also to generate awareness for the real purpose: ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, organised for the first time in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, a group of international stakeholders who hope to end poverty by increasing the number of people who are actively fighting here.
Concerts who want to take advantage of a free card for the event (unless they were willing to pay for a VIP card), had to complete a series of tasks, or 'actions', such as volunteering, a world leader e-mailing, telephone calling or generate awareness in another significant way for the purpose: an end to poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizen Festival been, with a further 12 years to achieve this goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert an appropriate way to convince people to call for action or is this just another form of 'clitivism', people feel they are making a real contribution by signing an online petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizens have registered more than 19 million 'actions' of supporters, aimed at a wide range of different goals.
According to Global Citizens, these actions have contributed to the commitment of world leaders and policy proposals worth more than $37 billion that need to change the lives of 2.25 billion people before 2030.
Early in 2018, the Group quoted 390 initiatives and statements based on the actions, of which at least $10 billion was paid out or brought together by sponsorship actions.
The group estimates that the funds received so far have had an impact on almost 649 million people worldwide.
This group has promised Rwanda $35 million to help end undernutrition in the country after they received more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the help of the British government, donors, other national governments and Global Citizens as you can from the social injustice that is undernourished, make a footnote in history," said Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, the public at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also announced that, after more than 5,000 actions were sent in which the British government was asked to improve the nutritional situation for mothers and children, the government announced a project, the Power of Nutrition, to support that 5 million women and children will reach with food interventions.
In response to one of the multiple questions on the Global Citizen's website, "Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?"
The group replied, "It will be a long and difficult journey. Sometimes we will fall and fall.
But, like civil rights and anti-apartity movements before us, we will eventually succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are some of the artists who will perform this year during the New York event presented by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States can put the Navy in place a 'blocked' to prevent Russian exports of energy - Minister for Home Affairs
Washington can 'if necessary' take his refuge to the Navy to prevent Russian energy from coming into the market, including in the Middle East, said Ryan Zinke, the U.S. Minister of Home Affairs, as mentioned by the Washington Examiner.
Sinke claimed that Russia's involvement in Syria, where the country acts at the invitation of the legitimate government, is an obstacle to exploring new energy markets.
"I believe that they are only in the Middle East to be able to act in energy, just as in Eastern Europe and the southern flag of Europe," he said, according to the report.
And according to the official, there are ways and means of combating this.
"The United States has this possibility, with the Navy, to ensure that the waterways remain open and, if necessary, to block them to ensure that their energy is not on the market," he said.
Zincke spoke for the guests during an event organised by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a group without a profit target that presents itself as the 'vote of the energy consumer' in the US.
He went on and compared Washington's approach to Iran's approach to Russia and noted that they did not differ substantially.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is to use and replace fuels," he said and referred to Russia as a country that knows only a 'art', with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
These statements come at a time when the Trump government is trying to stimulate and replace the export of liquid natural gas to Europe, a country that offers the most affordable option for European consumers.
For these reasons, officials of the Trump government, including President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw its view from the 'unsuitable' pipeline project Nord Stream 2, which, according to Trum van Berlin, has made Moscow's 'prison'.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the North Stream 2 pipeline, worth $11 billion, will double the current pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's strong opposition to the project is solely for economic reasons and that it is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we agree with the view that energy cannot be used to exert pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers themselves," said Aleksandr Novak, the Russian Minister of Energy, after a meeting with Rick Perry, the US Minister of Energy, in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position has triggered a reaction from Germany, which has reaffirmed its involvement in the project.
The Federal Association of German Industry (BDI), the leading industrial organisation in Germany, has called on the US not to interfere with EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third power is dealing with our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industrial Federation (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren 'considers seriously after' to participate in the presidential elections in 2020, says Senator for Massachusetts
Elizabeth Warren, the Senator from Massachusetts, said on Saturday that she 'considered' it to take part in the presidential elections after the interim elections.
At a local meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was thinking about participating in the elections.
"It is time for women to go to Washington to restore the corrupt government, and this also includes that a woman in the top position," she said according to The Hill's political news page.
"After 6 November, I will think seriously about it to make me the president."
Warren ran out against President Donald Trump at the meeting in the town hall and said that he "sent this country in the wrong direction".
"I'm so upset about what Donald Trump brings into our democracy," she said.
Warren was openly critical of Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, his candidate for the Supreme Court.
On Friday, Warren said, "Of course, we have to wait for an FBI investigation before we vote on this."
However, an opinion study published on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's own attachments do not have to make themselves available in 2020.
Eighty percent of the 'probably' voters in Massachusetts said that the senator was not to be elected, according to an opinion poll by the Political Research Center of the Suffolk University and the Boston Globe.
Twenty-two percent was for her to be elected.
The investigation showed that there was more support for former Governor Deval Patrick, 38 per cent before a possible candidacy and 48 per cent against.
Other names of prominent Democrats associated with possible participation in the presidential elections in 2020 are former Vice-President Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, Senator of Vermont.
He said that he would officially take a decision in January, according to an Associated Press report.
Sarah Palin talks about PTSS of Track Palin during a election meeting of Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26 years old, spent a year in Iraq after serving in September.
He was arrested and accused after a report of domestic violence on Monday night.
"Because of what my own son has to do, what he's doing now he's back, I understand for other families that are experiencing the effects of PTSS and the injuries that some of our soldiers are returning," she told the audience that was present at a meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said about her son and other veterans "they're coming back a little differently, they're coming back and they're getting harder, they're coming back and wondering if there's any respect for what their fellow soldiers and the pilots and all the other soldiers have given to the father country."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and was charged with domestic violence and assault on a woman, involved in a report on domestic violence and possession of a weapon under influence, according to Dan Bennett, police spokesman in Wasilla.
Washington D.C. and 18 states support the protest against a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal protest against a new policy in the U.S. that rejects asylum against victims who are on the run for gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives of the 18 states and Washington D.C. last Friday, as 'friend-van-het-hof', submitted a statement to the Washington Court to support an asylum seeker who advocates this policy, NBC News reports.
The full name of the complainant in the Grace versus Sessions case, which the American Civil Liberties Union attached in August, has not been announced against federal policy.
She says that her partner "and his violent sons who are members of a gang" abused her, but that American officials rejected her asylum application on 20 July.
She was arrested in Texas.
The lawyers of the states supporting Grace, described by El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of people are from those asylum seekers in the United States, as countries with major problems in the field of gangs and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy has withdrawn a decision from the Board of Immigrant Appeals from 2014, which made it possible for immigrants without documents on the run for domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Karl Racine, the Attorney General of Washington D.C., said on Friday in a statement that the new policy "for decades ignores state, federal and international legislation".
"Federal legislation requires that all asylum applications be assessed on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application and that such an obstacle is contrary to that principle" is set out in a statement by the 'friend-of-the-art court'.
The lawyers further argue that the policy of denying immigrants access to the U.S. is damaging the US economy, as these immigrants are likely to become new entrepreneurs and the country 'provides the necessary labour'.
In June, Jeff Sessions, the Minister of Justice, ordered judges to no longer grant asylum to victims of domestic and gang violence.
"Asiel is available to those who flee their country because of persecution or fear on the basis of race, religion, nationality or membership of a specific social group or political opinion" in its announcement on 11 June of the policy.
Asylum was never meant to alleviate all the problems, even if these problems are serious, with which people get to make every day, everywhere in the world.
Hopeful rescue efforts in Palu while the number of deaths doubled in the race to find survivors
The situation has worsened for survivors too.
"It feels very tense," said the 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, while she tried to comfort her short baby in an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute new bodies arrive in ambulances.
A clean water is scarce."
The inhabitants returned to their ruined homes and searched for valuable things they could still use in their overnight possessions.
Hundreds of people have been injured and the hospitals are overcrowded, unless they are damaged by the earthquake of 7.5 on the scale of Richter.
Some wounded, including Dwi Haris, who had a broken back and shoulder, rest outside the military hospital in Palu, where patients were treated outside due to the chance of serious eye injury.
The tears filled his eyes when he told about his feelings when the devastating earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save ourselves.
I was printed against the rest of a wall," Harris told an associate press correspondent and added to it when he and his family were in the city for a wedding.
"I heard my wife call for help, and then I didn't hear anything else.
I don't know what happened to her and our child.
I hope they're safe."
US Ambassador accused China of 'intimacy' with 'propaganda warnings'
One week after an official Chinese news page posted an advertisement of four pages’s in an American newspaper, in which the mutual benefits of trade between the US and China were highlighted, the US ambassador in China accused the US ambassador of the use of the US press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump last referred to China Daily's paid annex in the Des Moines Register, the most sold newspaper in Iowa, after he had accused China of interference with the American congressional elections of 6 November, a charge denied by China.
Trump's accusation that Beijing was trying to cope with the U.S. elections, marked, according to American officials quoted by Reuters, a new phase in an escalating campaign by Washington to pressure China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently in an escalating trade war, in which they have imposed higher import tariffs.
China's payrolls early in the trade war were specifically aimed at meeting exporters in states such as Iowa, who supported the Republican Tromp Party, as Chinese and American experts said.
Terry Branstad, US ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, an important exporter of agricultural products to China, said that China had hit US workers, farmers and businesses.
"China", as Branstad wrote in an opinion poll in Des Moines Register of Sunday, "now doubles the intimidation by publishing propaganda ads in our free press".
"By spreading this propaganda, the government of China uses freedom of expression and a free press, a long-acquired tradition in America by placing a paid ad in Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, at a kiosk in the centre of Beijing you will find different voices in vain and you will not see a true reflection of the different opinions that the Chinese population has made possible on the difficult economic path, because the media is firmly under the dum of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent news pages refused to publish his article," when he said no about which news page this was.
By the Kavanaugh debacle, the Republicans just removed female voters from their ranks for the interim elections, warned analysts
Now many important republics break around Brett Kavanaugh, the candidate for the Supreme Court, and defend him from various charges of sexual violence, warns analysts that this will lead to a return, especially among women, during the upcoming interim elections.
The emotions around this subject have been tremendous, and most Republicans have already been told that they want to go ahead with the vote.
"These things cannot be reversed," said Grant Reeher, professor of politics at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University, to The Hill for an article that appeared on Saturday.
Reeher said he wondered if the attempt of Senator Jeff Flake (Republic, Arizona) to plead at the last moment for an FBI investigation would be sufficient to satisfy the evil voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, they will not forget it tomorrow and they will not forget it in November," said Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior advisor and country spokesman for the progressive MoveOn group on Friday according to the Washington news page, D.C.
On Friday morning demonstrators shouted "November comes out!" during their demonstration at the Senate Hall, while the Republicans who have the Justice Committee under their control are taking steps to approve Kavanaugh's candidacy, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"The enthusiasm and motivation for the Democrats will reach a record height," said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst, to the news site.
"People say it's already high, and that's true.
But it can go further, especially among women's vowels in the suburbs and among young voters, from 18 to 29 years of age, who often do not vote even though they do not agree with the president."
Even for Ford's public testimony, in which she further explained her charge of sexual harassment against the candidate for the Supreme Court, analysts suggested that there could be a return if the Republicans were to suppress the appointment.
"This has become a confused mess for the Republican Party," said Michael Steele, former party president of the Republican Party, last week according to NBC News.
"It is not only the vote in committee, or the final vote or that Kavanaugh takes place in court, but it is also the way in which the Republicans have dealt with it and how they have treated it," says Guy Cecil, director of the United States Priorities, a group that helps Democrats to be elected, clearly at the new channel.
However, the Americans seem to be divided on the question of who they believe after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a small majority on the side of the latter.
A new opinion study by YouGov shows that 41 per cent of respondents believe in the testimony of Ford and that 35 per cent believe in Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said that they thought that Kavanaugh had probably lied during his testimony, while 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After Flake's speech, the FBI is currently investigating Ford's accusations and at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, as reported by The Guardian.
Ford said last week to the Senate Justice Committee under oath that Kavanaugh had hired her under the influence of alcohol when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court showed her his genitals during a festival at the time they both studied at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is planning a new internet to access Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, starts a startup that wants to interact with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt, the latest project of the technology environment, is a company based on the open source platform Solid van Berners-Lee.
Solid offers users the possibility to choose where their data is stored and which persons have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that 'world domination' is the leading idea behind Inrupt.
"We should do this now," he said about the startup.
"This is a historic moment."
The app uses Solid technology to enable people to create their own 'personal online data storage' or POD.
Lists of contacts, activities lists, an agenda, a music library and other personal and professional tools can be saved.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available together through one browser and all at the same time.
What makes POD unique is that it depends entirely on the user who has access to what information.
The company calls this 'personal power through data'.
The idea behind Inrupt is according to CEO John Bruce that the company provides the resources, processes and required skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some developers who are contracted to work on the project, and a community of voluntary programmers.
From this week on, technology developers around the world can make their own decentralised apps with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not going to have a conversation with "Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a complete transformation which will put all their business models on their heads at once".
"We don't ask for their permission."
In a post on Medium published Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that the "mission (of Inrupt) is to provide the commercial energy and an ecosystem that protects the integrity and quality of the new web, which is built on Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he established the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has had an influential vote in the debate on net neutrality.
After the start of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will also be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic about this new era for the web," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Spiritual and Carrier of the Victoria Cross from WO I
The only clergy of the Church of England who acquired a Victoria Cross during the First World War as a military is honored in his place of birth 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel, the honorary Bernard Vann obtained the distinction due to the attack at Bellenglie and Lehaucourt on 29 September 1918.
However, he was killed four days later by a sharpsman and never knew that he had been part of the highest British military honor.
A memorial stone was discovered by its two small zones during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of the small zones, Michael Vann, said that it was 'briliant symbolic' that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after the fact that his grandfather was distinguished.
According to the London Gazette, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion on September 29, 1918 on the Canal de Saint-Quentin "in a very dense mist and under heavy fire of field shields and machine guns".
He then stormed through the line and led the line forward before he only went to a field-dwelling run and turned three members out of the detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German turtle on 4 October 1918, something more than one month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something I know I can never touch, but also something that makes me feel humble".
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also placed a crown after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he "was very honored to be able to play a role in the parade" and added that "the strength of a true hero is evident from the support he receives from a large number of people".
Fans of MMA stayed up all night to see Bellator 206 and get Peppa Pig in place
Imagine, you've been awake all night to watch a trained Bellator 206 and you won't get the most important moment.
On the ticket from San Jose, 13 matches were mentioned, including six in the main section, and this was sent all night in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., just at the time that Gegard Mouusasi and Rory MacDonald prepared for their fight, viewers in the United Kingdom were surprised when the broadcaster switched to Peppa Pig.
Some were upset because they had been awake all night especially for this fight.
One person described the transition to the children's program on Twitter as "a bad joke".
"In accordance with the government's rules, after 6:00 a.m., no content that is not suitable for children should be displayed any more, and that is why we had to switch to the children's programme," said Dave Schwartz, senior vice-president for marketing and communication at Bellator, when he was asked for the broadcast.
"Pep the pig," yesss.
Scott Coker, business president of Bellator, said that they are going to adjust their programming to ensure that visitors in the United Kingdom will also get a chance in the future.
"I think, with a view to the return struggle, that we can solve this problem," Coker said.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning here on a Sunday and we can't discuss anything until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
We're working on it.
When I made the switch, a lot of text messages went over and over and believed me, they weren't all just friendly.
We tried to solve it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't like that, it was a government problem.
I can promise this won't happen the second time.
We limit the broadcasts to five nights instead of six, as we normally did, we tried to make it even better for the fans, but we just went too far.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt 'inferior' because of his sexual character
The Olympic janitor Tom Daley says that during his youth, he felt for his sexual character, but that this gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 40-year-old said he did not realize that 'not everyone is like me' until he went on to continue his education.
In a conversation at Desert Island Discs on Radio 4 with Lauren Laverne, he said he had spoken about homo rights to give other 'hop'.
He also said that parenthood had contributed to his less value in winning during the Olympic Games.
Kirsty Young, the regular presentation of the long-term show, has been released for a few months because of illness.
Apparently as a shift to Laverne's first program, Daley told him that during his youth he felt less than others because it was 'socially not accepted to like girls and boys'.
He said: "To this day are those feelings, the feeling of being less and the feeling of being different, really existing facts that have given me the strength to be successful."
He wanted to prove that he was "one" so that he wouldn't disappoint people if they finally followed his nature.
The winner of two sources of Olympic medals has become a prominent campaign leader for the LGBT community and used his presence at the Community Best Games in Australia this year to call on more countries to discriminate against homosexuality.
He said that he spoke because he felt happy that he could live openly without further consequences and that he wanted to give others hope.
The three-time World Championship said that the fact that he was in love with a man, the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Back, whom he met in 2013, "has completely surprised me".
Daley was married to the Oscarwinnar last year, who is 20 years older than he was, but said that the age difference was never a problem.
"When you're so young, he took part in his first 14-year-old Olympics and his father died of cancer three years later, it's hard to find someone in your own age group who's got the same height and low points.
In June, the couple became parents of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said that his "whole perspective" was changed.
"If you had asked me this question last year, I would have answered that it was all about winning a gold medal," he said.
"But you know what, there are more important things on earth than winning gold Olympic medals.
My golden Olympic medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father who died in 2011 at the age of 40, after receiving the diagnosis of brain cancer.
Daley said his father had not accepted that he would die and one of the last things he had asked if they had already received the cards for London in 2012, because he wanted to be on the first row.
"I couldn't get it about my heart to say, you won't be there to sit on the first row," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and not until his breathing actually stopped and he died, I could finally admit that he was not inconvenient," he said.
The following year, Daley joined the 2012 Olympic Games and won the bronze.
"I knew I had dreamed of this all my life. To dive for a home audience during the Olympic Games, there's no better feeling," he said.
It was also the inspiration for his first musician, Proud by Heather Small, who had strongly attacked him on the way to the games and where he still got chicken.
Desert Island Disks is listening to BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, not in shape, on the bank during the Ryder Cup on Saturday
The American Phil Mickelson will record a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th game in the Ryder Cup, but he needs to see his form back in order not to make a sad milestone.
Mickelson, who attended the two-year event for the 12th time, was put on the bank by the team captain Jim Furyk for the fourballs and foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of being at the centre of the action, as he has often done for the United States, the winner of five majors divides the day between supporting his teammates and practicing the driving range, in an attempt to delay it.
Because even at the peak of his career he was never known for his right drive, the 48-year-old is not the ideal choice for the close fairways of Le Golf National, where the long grass of the roughs dwindling balls is routinely punished.
And if the job on its own isn't scary enough, Mikkelson, in the ninth match on Sunday, always comes the accurate Francesco Molinari, winner of the British Open, against which is linked to new Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans who are behind four points at the start of the 12 single games are well-started, the match of Mickelson can be absolutely crucial.
Fury has shown that he has confidence in this man, even though he could honestly say otherwise.
"He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a kick on my back, beat his arm around me and said that he was ready for it tomorrow," said Furyk.
"He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He was included in the Hall of Fame and he has contributed so much to these teams, in the past, but also this week.
I probably didn't expect him to play two games.
I would have expected more of it, but it is what it is and it is the way in which we have to act.
He wants to be there, just like everyone else."
Mickelson can improve Nick Faldo's record for the highest number of played Ryder Cup matches on Sunday.
It can also mean the end of a Ryder Cup career in which he has never completely replaced the highlights of his personal career.
Mickelson has 18 won matches, 20 lost matches and 7 equal games standing on his name, but Fury said his presence had a certain inexhaustible influence on the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's caught, he likes to take out jokes with people and he's a great guy to be in the team," he explained.
"I think the younger players found it fun to keep him down and down for the crazy last week, which was funny to see.
He has so much more to offer than just his game."
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows that great advance can quickly disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the European team, knows from experience that the comfortable lead ahead of the single matches on the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily be turned into a less comfortable situation.
Deen made his debut in the 1997 Valderrama game, where the team with Captain Seven Ballesteros had a lead of five points on the Americans, but eventually the finish line passed with the smallest possible margin: 141 1⁄2-131.2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a great advantage in Valderrama; we had a great advantage in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we lived, but just," said Bjorn, here, after seeing the lighting of 2018 win with 5-3 on Friday and yesterday, good for a 10-6 advantage on Le Golf National.
So history shows me and all the others in the team that this is not yet a game played.
Everyone will have to take full action tomorrow.
Go to the beat and run the plan on the right one.
It's not over until the points are on the board.
We have a goal, and that's this trophy win, and that's where we need to keep our focus.
I keep saying, I focus on the 12 players we can have, but we are also aware of the people on the other side, some of the best players in the world."
Rejoiced over the performance of his players on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I would never go ahead in this area.
A new challenge awaits tomorrow.
In the morning, the individual performances are coming to an end, and that is a whole new discipline.
It's great to be out there with a partner if it's okay, but when you're there alone, your abilities as a golfer are just being tested.
That's the message you need to tell the players, try to get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
So now let your partner go and he has to get the best out of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent, Jim Furyk, expects his players to perform better individually than partners. The exceptions are Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who overcome three of the four points.
Fury himself has experience with both sides of this kind on the last day, as a member of the winning team in Brooklyn and as a loser when Europe realized the 'Miral of Medina'.
"I remember every damn word of that speech," he said in answer to the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had picked up his players for the last day.
"We have 12 important matches for the bow tomorrow, but let's try to start well, like in Brookline, or like in Medina.
When we have the moment, there's a lot of pressure on the matches in the middle.
We have agreed our line-up to this and send the men on their way in the order we think is the best and, you know, we're going to try something out of the high hat tomorrow."
Thomas has the task of trying to guide the opposition and puts Rory McIlroy in front of the first match, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are the other Europeans in the first half of the battle.
"I have chosen this group in this order, because I think we are so constantly covered," Bjorn said of his selection of single players.
The new warship of Germany is being postponed again
The newest cargo of the German Navy should have been in service in 2014, replacing the old warships from the Cold War, but it will take at least one year before it is ready, due to defective systems and running costs, local media reported.
The establishment of the Rhineland-Pfalz, the leading ship in the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg class, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, quoted by a military spokesman.
The vessel should be part of the marine in 2014, but the disturbing problems after delivery have affected the fate of the ambitious project.
The four vessels of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ordered by the Marine in 2007 are to replace the old frgates of the Bremen class.
As far as we know, they have a powerful cannon, a series of air and anti-shipcraft rockets and a form of stealth technology, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic features.
Other important features are longer maintenance cycles, it should be possible to put the latest frgates together up to two years later, far away from home ports.
However, the continuing delays mean that the advanced warships, designed to allow Germany to project its power over sea, have been aged by the time they are engaged, notes that time.
The fatal frigate F125 had all the newspaper headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to place the vessel and sent it back to the shipyard Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
This was the first time that the Navy sent a ship back to a shipbuilder after delivery.
There is little known about the reasons behind this return, but German media quoted a number of crucial 'software and hardware defects' that would make the warship useless if it were put into a combat mission.
Software defects were particularly important because the vessels of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class are operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, half the force on the frigates of the older Bremen class.
It was also clear that the ship was heavily overweighted, thus reducing the performance and limiting the capacity of the marine to carry out further upgrades.
The 'Rheinland-Pfalz' weighs 7,000 tons, which is twice as many as ships of a similar class as the Germans in the Second World War.
In addition to the defective hardware, the price card for the entire project, including crew training, becomes a problem.
It is said that this has reached a thousand-folding €3.1 billion, compared with the original €2.2 billion.
The problems that the newest frogs have in their grip are also important because of the recent warnings that the power of the German Navy is decreasing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the Parliamentary Defence Commission in Germany, acknowledged that the marine has in fact "a lack of usable ships".
The official said that the problem of time as a snowball had grown, because old ships had been taken from the company but no replacement vessels were delivered.
He complained that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg’s frgates were yet available to be included in the navy.
National Trust Listens to the Secret Life of Bird Museums
New research carried out on a farm in the Scottish Highlands is trying to reveal how to use petals in their search for food.
The hope is that the findings will shed light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and will contribute to future conservation activities.
The study carried out by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland is followed by the usual and small drug washbasin, the brown wholesale washbasin and the water washbasin at Inverewe Gardens in Western Ross.
Special recording equipment shall be placed at key locations around the property to monitor the activities of the poultry flies through the season.
NTS and volunteers will also carry out mobile investigations using hand detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of the mouse's critiques and what kind of action they are doing.
Then a map of the habitat is produced and a report is produced to make such a detailed picture on the landscape scale of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, NTS Nature Protection Advisor, hopes that the results will show which areas of the habitat are the most important for birds and how they are used by the species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management, such as the making of fields and how we can best maintain the forests for bats and similar species.
Flemish populations in Scotland and the rest of the UK have been significantly reduced in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development activities that have an impact on sleep and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lightning currents can also pose a risk, like aircraft and certain chemical treatments of building materials and attacks by domestic cats.
In fact, fireworks aren't blind.
Their night hunting habits, however, make their ears more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching a prey.
They use an advanced echo location technique to determine the position of insects and obstacles in their flight size.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, are taken very seriously.
The NTS has ten trained experts who regularly investigate, carry out sleep inspections and sometimes rescue operations.
The organisation has even set up the first and only reserve for poultry in Scotland at the Threeeve estate in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight of the ten species of poultry in Scotland live.
Landscape manager David Thompson says that the property is the ideal territory for the birds.
"Here in Thrave we have a great setting for petals," he said.
"We have the old buildings, very old trees and the right habitat.
But there is so much about bats not yet known and therefore the work that we do here and elsewhere will help us to better understand what they need in order to serve."
It emphasises the importance of monitoring meat mills before maintenance work is carried out, as the possible unconscious destruction of a sleeping facility can lead to the death of 400 female meat mills and their children, which may eliminate a complete local population.
Flying flies are a protected animal species and it is illegal to kill them, to fall, to destroy them, or to destroy their sleeping quarters.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish Minister for the Bat Conservation Trust, asked the public to provide a contribution to help.
She said, "We still need to learn a lot about our pets and many of our species we just don't know how to deal with their populations."
Ronaldo rejects charges of assault while his lawyers prepare to prosecute a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo accused of assault qualified as 'fake news' and said that people 'want to promote themselves' by using his name.
His lawyers are about to appeal to the German weekly Der Spiegel, in which the charges have been published.
The peaks of Portugal and Juventus are accused of assaulting an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is also accused of having paid her $375.000 to be silent about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Through a video for his 142 million followers on Instagram Live called Ronaldo, 33, a few hours after the charges were reported, the reports 'fake news'.
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they say today, fake news," says the winner of five Golden Balls on camera.
"They want to promote themselves by calling themselves my name.
That's normal.
They want to be named by my name, but that's part of the class.
I'm a happy man, and by and by," the footballer added to this, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing a case for which they want to prosecute Der Spiegel for the accusations they call 'an ineligible reporting of suspicions in the field of privacy', according to Reuters.
Christian Schertz, lawyer, said the footballer wants compensation for the 'moral damage to an amount corresponding to the seriousness of the breach, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years'.
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 at a suite of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting her at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga, according to the report, returned to the chamber of the footballer, where he raped her according to the charge, as to be read in the charge filed at the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and that he told her that for '99 percent' he was a 'good guy', but that he was sometimes left in the loop that 'one percent'.
The documents state that Ronaldo confirms that the couple had sex, but that this was mutually acceptable.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that there were photos of her injuries in a hospital, but that she later agreed with an extrajudicial regime because she was 'fearing the consequences' and because she was worried about the 'public humiliation'.
The 34-year-old now says she wants to declare the scheme invalid because she is constantly traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to go to Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged attack and this summer went to the Italian giant Juventus in a deal worth €100 million.
Brexit: the United Kingdom 'will regret it forever' as autoproducers
The United Kingdom 'will regret it forever' if it loses its status as world leader in the field of autoproduction after the Brexit, said Greg Clark, Minister of Economic Affairs.
He added that Toyota UK had said to the BBC that, as Britain, the EU would leave without a deal, the company would temporarily stop production at the factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Clark.
The Japanese autoproducer said that the impact of delays at the border in the case of a 'no-deal Brexit' job would be costly.
The factory in Burnaston, where the Auris and Avensis of Toyota are made, produced almost 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other countries in the European Union.
"My vision is that as Britain crashed out of the EU at the end of March, we will see production in our factory still," said Marvin Cooke, managing director of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other car products in the UK, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also revealed their fears about the consequences of a departure from the EU without an agreement to operate cross-border trade.
For example, BMW has already announced that it will close the Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
Most of the concerns are about the risks of the supply chains in the case of a 'no-deal Brexit'.
The production line of Toyota is based on the 'just-in-time' principle, with 37-minute parts coming from suppliers in the UK and in the EU for cars on order.
If, on 29 March, the UK leaves the EU without a deal, there can be an unrest to the boundaries that can lead to delays and cuts in parts according to industry.
Toyota cannot save more than one day in the factory in Derbyshire, so the company did not know, and therefore the production would be stopped.
Clark said that Theresa May's Chequers plan for the future relationship with the EU is 'exactly agreed to avoid those border controls'.
"We should have a deal. We want the best deal, which will not only enable us to continue the current success, but also take this opportunity," he told the listeners of the BBC Radio 4's Today program.
"The proof, not only from Toyota but also from other producers, is that we must be able to go through this very successful set of delivery chains."
Toyota could not say how long the production would be stopped, but in the longer term it warned that the additional costs would affect the company's competitive position and that this would ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvalaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years, and who is a representative of the U.S. trade union at the factory, said that his members are becoming increasingly concerned: "In my experience, when these jobs have been lost, they never come back again.
One government spokesman said, "We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Meeting with Trump and Rosenstein can be delayed again, says the White House
The crucial meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Prosecutor-General Rod Rosenstein can be postponed 'after a week' while the fight about the candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller, who investigates the Russian influence of the elections, binding between Tromp and Russia's assistants and possible interference with the President's legal process.
The question of whether Trump is going to release the Deputy Prosecutor-General and therefore endangers Mueller's independence, the Washington wheel machine has been running for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of bringing a microphone to establish talks with Trump and to dismiss the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied this report.
But when he went to the White House last Monday, the round he was about to give in to his resignation.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then with the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said that he wanted to leave Rosenstein 'not rather', but then the meeting was moved to avoid a conflict with a hearing by the Senate Justice Committee, in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both would testify.
On Friday, Trump gave the FBI orders to conduct a week's investigation of the charges against Kavanaugh, which delayed the vote in the whole Senate.
On Sunday, Sarah Sanders, the chief of Trump, appeared at Fox News.
Asked for the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "There is no date yet for this week, it could be this week, but it could also be postponed for a week, given all the other things that are going on with the Supreme Court.
But we will see and I always want to keep the press in mind."
Some reporters have been struggling with this claim: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since 10 September.
The host Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said that the scariest of press conferences was not caused by a rejection of the 'attractive' TV journalists, however, she added: "I will not deny that they are trying to draw attention."
Then she suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press increase.
"The president does more questions and answers than any president for him," she said, without giving evidence of this: "We have seen the figures."
Press conferences will still take place, Sanders said, but "if the press has the chance to ask the President of the United States directly, that is infinitely better than talking to me.
We're trying to do that a lot and you've seen us do that often in the last few weeks, and that'll take the place of a press conference when you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in public sessions or during press conferences with dignitaries visiting.
Press conferences with only the president are rare.
In New York this week, the president demonstrated possible why, he made an open-minded and at times bizarre appearance for the collected reporters.
Minister for Health writes a letter about Brexit to employees of NHS Scotland from other EU countries
The Minister of Health has written a letter to the EU staff working in NHS Scotland to express the country's gratitude and the wish that they continue to work with the NHS after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent a letter with less than six months before the UK withdraws from the EU.
The Scottish Government has been determined to bear the costs of applying for a permanent status for EU citizens working for decentralised public services.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: "The negotiations between the UK and the EU continued during the summer, and this autumn the expected decisions will be taken.
At the same time, however, the UK government has also outlined the preparations for a possible scenario in which no deal is reached.
I know this must be an uncertain time for all of you.
That is why I would like to stress once again how much I appreciate the contribution of all staff members, regardless of their nationality.
Members from all over the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve NHS activities and offer benefits to the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is safe and secure, and we want you to stay here."
Christian Abercrombie undergoes an emergency operation after head injury
The linebaccer of the Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie, went into surgery yesterday after he had suffered a head injury in the 31-27 lost match against the Vanderbilt Commodores, reported Mike Organ of the Tennessee.
Rod Reed, head coach of Tennessee State, told reporters that the accident occurred shortly for rest.
"He came to the sideline and sat down there a little bit or more," said Reed.
The coaches and the medical staff gave Abercrombie direct oxygen on the sideline before putting him on a stretcher and taking him for further research.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had come from the operating room at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that 'no more details on the type/range of the injury' and Tennessee State are trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a redshirt sophomore, is in its first season at Tennessee State after a transfer from Illinois.
He was arrested on Saturday in total five times before leaving the field, so he was arrested 18 times this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher fees when they buy a house in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher rents when they buy a home in the UK and the proceeds are used to help the daclozens according to new conservation plans
This action will have to neutralise the success of Corbyn to attract young voters
The increase in the fees shall be levied on persons who do not pay tax in the UK.
The Ministry of Finance expects this to amount to £ 120 million per year to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher rents when they buy a home in the UK and the extra income is used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
This action is seen as an effort to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn, who attracts young voters with promises to provide more affordable houses and to tell them to multiples.
The increase in the legislators is raised on persons and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK, with the additional revenue being stifled in an effort by the government to fight unemployment.
The allowance, which comes above the current leases, including the higher levels introduced two years ago for second houses and houses purchased for rent, may be up to three per cent.
The Ministry of Finance expects to raise to £ 120 million per year.
According to estimates, 13 per cent of the new building in London is purchased by people who do not live in the UK. This is why prices are being priced and it is difficult for starters to get a foot on the landlord.
Many prosperous areas in the country, especially in the capital, have become practically 'spook cities' because of the high number of foreign buyers spending most of the time outside the country.
This new policy will only come a few weeks after Boris Johnson had pleaded for a reduction in the legions to help young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping their prices high by buying land and not using it, and he called on May to remove quotas on affordable houses to restore the 'home tax' in Great Britain.
Corbyn announced a remarkable series of housing reforms, including rental funds and an end to the exhibition 'without negligence'.
He also wants to give local authorities more opportunities to build new homes.
May said, "Last year I said that I wanted to spend my time as prime minister on restoring the British Dream, that life would be better for every new generation.
And that means that our defective housing market needs to be restored.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it cannot be that it is as simple for people who do not live in the UK and for foreign companies to buy houses here as it is for hard-working British residents.
For too many people the dream of ever having a house has become too vague a dream and the humiliation of life without a roof above the head has become too real."
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate ambition is managing Scotland'
Jack Ross, Sunderland's boss, says it's his 'ultimate ambition' to ever become Scotland's manager.
The Schot, 42, enjoys the challenge of bringing the club out of the north-east of England, which is currently in the third place in League One, on three points of the first place.
He went to the stadium or Light last summer after he had returned to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"As a footballer, I wanted to play for my father's country.
But I was selected for the B team and thus the coup was off," Ross told Sportsound on BBC Scotland.
"When I was a child, I saw my father Scotland often play in Hampden Park and it's something that keeps drawing me.
However, that possibility would only come if I were successful in managing a club."
The predecessors of Ross as Sunderland's managers include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Alloa Athletic says he was not intimidated to be the successor of these established names at a large club, earlier he had refused advances from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Success for me is being measured at this moment by 'can I let this club return to the Premier League?'
Because of the structure and facilities at this club, it must certainly be in the Premier League," he says.
"It is not a simple task to achieve this, but I can only see myself as successful when I bring the club back there."
Ross is only three years in his career as manager, after a period as assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months in the coaching group of Hearts.
Then he helped Alloa recover from degradation to the third division and transformed St Mirren from the edge of degradation to winning the Championship next season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did during his career as a footballer at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"It was probably really a cross-point," he recalled the moment when he took the lead at Alloa.
"I really believed that management was the right choice for me, much more than playing.
It sounds weird, because I was doing the best I could, I deserved quite well, and I knew a few reasonable highlights.
But football can be hard.
There's a lot of things you're dealing with each week.
I still have that, given the stress and pressure of the trade, but management just feels good.
I've always wanted to be a manager and now I'm real, I'm as good in my skin as I've never felt in my adult life."

The perfect time for a pint is 17:30 on a Saturday, revealed research
The heat wave in summer has increased revenue from British pubs that have difficulty surviving, but has also put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Groups with pubs and bars saw turnover increases by 2.7 per cent in July, but revenues in restaurants were 4.8 per cent less, showing the figures.
Peter Martin, of the CGA's advisory office, who collected the figures, said: "Sustainable sunlight and the fact that England is taking part in the world championships longer than expected, meant that July showed a similar pattern as June, when the pubs had a higher turnover of 2.8 per cent, with the difference that the restaurants were now getting worse.
The fall of 1.8 per cent in the turnover of restaurants in June was only worse in July.
Pubs and bars aimed at selling drinks made the best of them, with a better LFL growth (like-for-like) than that of restaurants.
Pubs that are also directed to the sale of food also members of the sun, but not as dramatic as the restaurants.
It seems that people only go out to drink.
In pubs and bars under management, the drinking rate was 6.6 per cent higher for the month, while the food market was 3 per cent lower."
Paul Newman of RSM, an analyst for the leisure and hospitality industry, said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of important social or sporting events remain the main factors for the trade in the output market.
It is therefore no surprise that restaurant groups continue to fight, although a turnover of 4.8 per cent per year is particularly painful in view of the continuing cost pressure.
The long, hot summer could not have come at a bad time for the food operators, and it would only be time to learn whether the more moderate temperatures of August could provide the necessary shelter."
Total turnover growth in the public and restaurant sector, including new openings, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the decline in the introduction of new brands.
In the Coffer Peach Tracker, the turnover monitor for the pub, bar and restaurant sector in the UK, performance data are collected and analysed by 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of £9 billion. This is the established benchmark of the industry.
One of the five children has a secret account for social media, which they keep hidden for their parents
One of the five children, some not over 11 years of age, has a secret social media account, which they keep hidden for parents and teachers, reveals an investigation
Survey among 20,000 secondary school students revealed growth in 'false Insta pages'
This news has strengthened the fear that sexual content will be posted
Twenty percent of students say to have a 'main account' that they also show their parents
One of the five children, some not over 11 years of age, makes social media accounts that keep them hidden for adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students revealed a rapid growth in the 'false Insta accounts', a reference to Instagram, the photo sharing site.
This news has strengthened the fear that sexual content will be posted.
Twenty percent of the students say they use a clean 'main account' that they show their parents, while they also have personal accounts.
A mother who happened to be right on the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter discovered a teenager who asked others to ' rape her'.
The research carried out by Digital Awareness UK and HMC (Headmasters" and Headmistresses" Conference) of independent schools revealed that 40% of the 11- to 18-year-olds had two profiles and that half of them had personal accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of HCM, said, "It is disturbing that so many teenagers are being lured into creating online spaces where they are not found by their parents and teachers."
Elid Doyle becomes the 'vote of the athlete' in the Scottish Council for Athletics
Elid Doyle is elected to the board of the Scottish athletic world, as a non-executive director at the general annual meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is the most decorated athlete in Scotland on the job and in the field and President Ian Beattie described her election as a great opportunity for sports managers to learn from her extensive experience at an international level over the past ten years.
"Eilid enjoys great respect in the athletic community of Scotland, the UK and the world, and we are sure that athletics in Scotland will greatly benefit from her election in the Council," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I am happy to be able to serve as a voice for the athletes and I hope that I can make a contribution and help drive the sport in Scotland."
The American who won 200 meters and 400 meters during the 1996 games in Atlanta, two of his four gold Olympic medals, and who now regularly comments on the BBC, could no longer walk after a TIA.
He wrote on Twitter: "This month I had a TIA.
I couldn't walk anymore.
The doctors told me that only time will teach me whether I will recover and to what extent.
It has been awfully hard work, but I am now completely restored, I have been learning again and do my flexibility exercises today again!
Thank you for all your support!"
Ad for breast pump where mothers are compared to cows, distributes online opinion
A company that makes breast pumps has distributed the online opinion with an advertisement comparing seeking mothers with cows that are milled.
In order to mark the introduction of what is called 'the most silent portable breast pump in the world', Elvie, a producer of consumer technology, issued an ironic, inspired advertisement on music videos to illustrate the freedom that this new pump has to offer to collapsing mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a hood full of a song that contains texts like: 'Yes, I milk myself, but you can't see anything' and 'In case you didn't watch it, these aren't eggs, these are my breasts'.
The reef then follows with: 'Fows, pumps, pumps, I feed the babies, pumps, pumps, pumps, I milk the lady's'.
However, the advertisement, which was published on the company's Facebook page, has directly provided for an online controversy.
The video has been viewed 77,000 times and has released hundreds of comments, especially mixed reactions from viewers, in which many people say that this makes sense the 'horror' of the dairy industry.
"A bad choice to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they should be expected and ordered to produce milk, but in their case the babies are removed within a few days after the order" is written in a response.
The breast pump of Elvie fits discreetly in a diet (Elvie/Mother).
Someone else noticed: "Of course, this is traumatic for mother and baby.
But yes, why don't we use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who can keep their babies?"
Another added: "This ad is so far from reality."
Others defended the ad and a woman admitted that she found the song 'hilaric'.
"I find this a great idea.
I'd buy it if I was still breast-feeding.
That pump gave me the feeling of being a cow.
The ad is a little weird, but I haven't been looking too much for it.
This is a brilliant product" wrote someone.
Someone else had the following comment: "This is a funny ad, directed at moms that snakes (frequently at the workplace or in a toilet) and then feel like they're just 'kows'.
This ad does not appear at all positive or negative about the dairy industry."
At the end of the video you see the group of women who are all dancing with the pump discreetly hidden in their beha's.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the understanding that many women who are collapsing, sometimes just cougar.
However, the Elvie Pump is completely silent, has no wires or snakes and fits discreetly in a feeding bag, so that women have the freedom to move, hold their babies and even go out while they are on hooks.
Ana Balarin, partner and ECD at Mother says: "The Elvie Pump is a dermate revolutionary product that it deserves a strong and provocative introduction.
By comparing collapsing mothers and milk cows, we wanted to place the colve and the related challenges in the lighthouses and at the same time show in a supportive and understandable way how the new pump will provide an incredible sense of freedom.
This is not the first time Elvie's pump gets the front page.
During the London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on Martha Jakubowski's catwalk while she used the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly move to a tent camp on the border with Texas
The number of migrant children detained has reached a peak, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, partly because the hard-core rhetoric and the hard-core policy introduced by the Trump government makes it harder to bring children into sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors are self-documented immigrants and are afraid of their own chance to stay in the country by registering for a child.
This risk was increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households should issue fingerprints and that these data will be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior officer of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified to the fact that his organization has arrested dozens of people who have registered as a sponsor for unaccompanied minors.
The organization later confirmed that 70 per cent of the detainees had no prior criminal record.
"Almost 80% of the sponsors or family members of the sponsors are illegal in this country and much of it is criminal foreigners.
We're about to persecute these people," said Mr. Albence.
In an attempt to speed up the processing of children, officials introduced new rules, forcing some of them to appear before the court within 60 days, according to the employees at the station.
Many of them will be through a video conference for the court, instead of in person, to plead their application for a legal status for an immigration right.
Those deemed not to be eligible for aid will be deported quickly.
The longer the children stay in custody, the greater the chance of being anxious or depressed, which may lead to violent explosions or attempts to flee, according to the workers at the shipyard and according to reports that have come out of the system in recent months.
Lawyers said that these concerns are stronger at a larger facility, such as Tornillo, where the signs that a child struggles are more often ignored because of the size of the camp.
They added that moving the children to the tent camp without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally for it or to say anything against friends can contribute to the trauma that many of them still struggle with.
Syria orders the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
In a speech for the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid Al-Mumblem also called for Syrian refugees to return, even now the war in the country is in the eighth year.
Moualem, who is also a vice-premier, said that foreign troops are illegally on Syrian soil, in the preamble to combat terrorism and that 'it will be dealt with accordingly'.
"They must withdraw immediately and without any conditions," he told the House.
According to Moualem, the "was on terror almost past" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more have been evicted and driven from their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue with "this holy battle until we have freed all Syrian territories" from terrorist groups and from a "possible illegal foreign presence".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, which are mainly involved in training and advising the Kurdish troops and the Syrian Arabs fighting President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the war-damaged country.
With regard to the refugees, Moualem said that the conditions were favourable for their return and he intended to 'distribute some Western countries irrational fears' which kept most refugees away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate this return," he said.
"They are policing a matter that should only be a humanitarian problem."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid for Syria until a political agreement is concluded between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.S. diplomats say that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in Idlib, the last major bubble of the rebels, has created the opportunity to start political talks.
The deal between Russia and Turkey has a large-scale attack away from the Syrian troops supported by Russia in the province, where three million people live.
Moualem stressed, however, that this agreement knew 'clear deadlines' and said that he hoped that the military action would focus on jihadists, including fighters from the Nusra Front connected to Al-Qaeda, who would be 'cut off'.
Staffan de Mistura, the UN representative, is soon hoping to convene the first meeting of a new committee consisting of members of the government and the opposition to draft a constitution for post-war Syria and to open the way for elections.
Moualem made it clear what the conditions of the Syrian Government to participate in the committee and said that the work of the panel should be limited 'to reviewing the articles of the present Constitution' and he warned against interference from outside.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to that logic, Mr. Trump would win the elections in 2020 unless, as many 'liberal' viewers are likely to hope, his presidency is temporarily terminated by a settlement procedure and scandals.
In what, of course, would be 'the most dramatic final of a presidency ever'.
At the moment, however, there are no signs of obscurity.
Since 2014, CNN's 'prime-time' viewers have doubled to 1.05 million and almost tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers during 'prime-time', compared to 1.7 million viewers four years ago, and The Rachel Maddow Show of MSNBC is at the top of the evaluations for cable programs with 3.5 million viewers at evenings with important news.
"It's a fire that attracts people, because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, who was responsible for the ABC drama "Designed Survivor" a series about a minister who becomes president after an attack has destroyed the Capitool.
Nell Scovell, an experienced writer of comedy and author of 'Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club' has another theory.
She recalls a taxi ride in Boston for the 2016 elections.
The driver told her he was going to vote on Trump.
Why?
"He said, 'Because he makes me laugh'," Scovell told me.
There's entertainment value in chaos.
Of course, unlike everything else on TV, the stories coming from Washington can influence the future of Roe v. Wade or determine whether immigrant families can reunite or influence the status of the world economy.
Disabling is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, it's going to be more than a well-informed citizen, when you're looking at a six-hour panel of experts discussing the use of sources from the 'deep background' by Bob Woodward in his book 'Fear', which is about the jacket of Paul Manafort's father-in-law who has cost $15,000 ('one piece full of overload' according to The Washington Post) and who discuss the implications of the colorful description by Stormy Daniels of the, uh, anatomy of Trump.
I'll never be able to look at Super Mario in the same way again.
"What he's doing to give you the idea that it's a reality show is part of that he's letting you get some news every night," said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of 'Pawn Stars', about the rotating distribution of the Trump show and the daily shifts (a fight with the N.F.L., Kim Jong-un praise).
You can't afford to miss a delivery or you have the idea that you're running behind.
When I reached Fleiss earlier this week, it was sunny and 26 degrees out of his house on the north coast of Kaui, but he was looking into MSNBC while he recorded CNN.
He couldn't get rid of the screen, with Brett Kavanaugh, who had to appear before the Senate's Justice Committee and the future of the High Court that was at stake.
"I remember that we all did those weird shows, not so long ago, and that people said 'this is the beginning of the end of Western civilization'," Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but now it turns out they were right."

Money from outside flows in the most exciting interim elections for the House of Deputies
It is not surprising that the 17th district of Pennsylvania sees a flood of money, thanks to a re-establishment of a electoral district which requires two representatives of the people to fight for the same seat.
The recently re-organized district of Pittsburgh meets the Democratic People's Representative Conor Lamb, who has acquired his seat in another district in a special spring election.
Lamb must record it against another representative of the people, Republican Keith Rothfus, currently representing the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, who is familiar with the new 17th district.
The cards were reclassified after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania held in January that the old districts were not legally classified ('gerrymanding') in favour of the Republics.
The race in the new 17th district has led to a knock-on in the field of campaign funding between the financial poor of the two major parties, the DCCC (Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee) and the NRCC (National Republican Campaign Committee).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a grand victory in a well-known special election for the 18th election district of Pennsylvania.
This seat has been occupied for more than ten years by a Republican and President Donald Trump had overcome this district by 20 percentage points.
According to political experts, the Democrats have a small advantage.
The US considered punishing El Salvador for aid to China and rejected it
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama Beijing had already recognized and had received little negative response from Washington.
Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and he owns a hotel in Panama until his partners put out the Trump Organization management team.
Officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the United States have decided to withdraw the US heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the 'recent decision not to recognise Taiwan' said Heather Nauert, the spokesman of the ministry, in a statement earlier this month.
However, only penalties were considered in the case of El Salvador, as the country received $140 million in 2017 for control of drugs, development and economic support.
The proposed penalties, including reductions in financial support and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country with high unemployment and high mortality rates.
While the internal meetings were held, North American and Central American officials held a high-level conference, which would focus on security and economic prosperity as a follow-up to a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step forward in the efforts to prevent migrants from leaving the United States.
However, in mid-September, some top officials from the government knew that they wanted the conference to go on, and thus made it impossible to take all possible measures against El Salvador in advance.
The plan is now that Vice-President Mike Pence is giving a speech at the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of the importance that the government attaches to the meeting, diplomats say.
And the three American envoys returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any further resignation, without any strong messages about Washington criminal measures.
A spokesman for the White House on behalf of Mr Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal debate subject to anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an external analyst who was also close to the government and spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Study history
The next step can be the report of Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller on the possible counter-operation of the court by Trump, for which serious evidence has now become publicly known.
Mueller's research is likely to focus on coexistence between the Trump and Russia campaign in an attack by Russia on our elections.
If the Congress changed color, Trump must be responsible for that institute, just as he is preparing to address the electors again, and perhaps he should be responsible for a jury in a courtroom.
That is a hope for me, and I do not want to suggest that Trump's fall is inevitable or that of his equivalents in Europe.
We will all have to make choices on both sides of the Atlantic, which will determine how long the battle will take.
In 1938 German officers were ready to perform a 'coup d'état' against Hitler, but only if the West had resisted and Czech-Slovakia had supported in Munich.
We failed and therefore missed an opportunity to avoid the years of blood loss that followed.
The course of history revolves around such bending points and the uncompromising demands of democracy is thereby accelerated or delayed.
Americans are currently facing various of this kind of bending points.
What will we do if Trump Deputy Prosecutor General Rod Rosenstein, the man who holds the fate of the Mueller investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult position since this page reported that he, over the past year, had proposed to hold talks with the President in secret and that he had speculated on the appropriateness of the President for his office.
Rosenstein says the Times report is wrong.
"How will we react if the new investigation by the FBI into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or not fair, or if he is appointed in the Supreme Court in spite of credible charges of assault and an unfair witness?
And above all, are we going to vote in the interim elections for a Congress that will call Trump to be responsible?
If we fail in these tests, democracy is waiting for a very long winter.
But I don't think we're going to miss the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czech Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had ever owned my embassy home.
She survived, immigrated to America, and sent me, 60 years later, away to raise candles for the Sabbath on that table on which a washing was done.
With that as my heritage, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans van Glasgow Rangers is optimistic about the race against Rapid Wien
Rangers receive Rapid Vienna on Thursday and know that a victory on the Austrians, after the impressive match in Spain against Villareal earlier this month, places them in a strong position to qualify in Group G of the European League.
Through a kneeblessure, the midfielder Graham Dorrans could not play his first game from the season until the 2-2 match at Villareal, but he believes that the Rangers can use that outcome as a jumpboard for better results.
"It was a good point for us because Villareal really has a good eleventh," said the 31st.
"We went into the competition with the idea that there was something to win and the competition came out with a point.
Maybe we could even win at the end, but over the entire game, a similar game is probably an honest result.
They were probably better in the first half, but when we came out in the second half, we were the best team.
The next Thursday is a new great European evening.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it's going to be a tough game because they also had a good result in their last match, but if the public is behind us, I'm sure we can print through and we can get a positive result.
Last year, it must have been hard, of all that happened to my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now there's a fault factor on the club.
The team is good and the boys really enjoy it.
Hopefully, we can now press through, let the last season behind us and succeed again."
Women cannot sleep because of fear of their pension
Despite the fact that the participants in the survey had a clear idea of the way in which they want to receive care, few people discuss this with their family members.
About half of the participants in the Nationalwide survey said they were talking to their spouses about the costs of long-term care.
And only 10% said that they had talked to their children about it.
"People like to have a family member take care of them, but they don't need to take the steps to have this conversation," said Holly Snyder, vice-president for life insurance at Nationwide.
Here we go.
Talk to your spouse(s) and the children: You cannot prepare your family to care if you do not want to make your wishes known in time.
Work with your advisor and your family to discuss where and how you will receive care, because these choices can be a significant factor in determining the costs.
Take a financial advisor in the arm: Your advisor can also give you an opinion on how you can pay these expenses.
Your long-term financing choices may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with cash value to help cover these expenditures, or invest your own assets as insurance, as long as you have money.
Place your legal documents: Avoid legal battle when insurance is to be put in place.
Take care of the health care system, so that you can identify a trusted person who can review your medical care and ensure that professionals comply with your wishes in case you can no longer communicate.
Consider, too, a power for your financial affairs.
In that case, you select a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and make sure that the invoices are paid if you can't do this yourself anymore.
Do not forget the little details: Imagine that your elderly father or mother is in a medical emergency and is on her way to the hospital.
In that case, can you answer questions about medication and allergies?
Put these details into a written plan, so you have the information at hand.
"It is not only the financial matters that matter, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What medicines are used?
Who's taking care of the dog?
Make sure that plan comes in."
Multiple times shot with air pressure in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with a gun when he walked home after an evening.
The victim, forty plus, was in the Oxford Grove neighborhood of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was hit in his chest, belly and hand.
Agents describe the charge, which took place around 02:30 BST, as a 'willow act'.
The victim didn't see who attacked him.
His injuries are not life-threatening and the police have called witnesses to report.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, and the expectation is that the killing will continue.
Since the means of communication have been disabled, the official authorities have not yet received information from the Dongala Regent, an area north of Palu, which is closer to the epicenter of the crew with a force of 7.5 on the scale of Richter.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster occurred.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Dongala, on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of the province of Midden-Celebes and is at the end of a small bay on the western coast of the island of Celebes, with a estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was the fourth 40th anniversary of the tsunami.
Dongåla is a regent that extends more than 300 km along the coast of the north-west of Celebes.
The regency, an administrative region just under a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main activities in the economy of the province of Midden-Celebes, particularly in the coastal area of Dongala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but they are for the majority in Morowoli, on the opposite coast of Celebes.
Palu and Dongala have regularly been hit by tsunamis in the past hundred years, according to the Agency for the Fighting of Disasters of Indonesia.
In 1938 a tsunami claimed more than 200 lives and destroyed hundreds of houses in Dongala.
A tsunami also struck west of Dongala in 1996, killing nine.
Indonesia is on the Pacific Ring of Fire and is often hit by earthquakes.
Here is a list of some of the most severe earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A large earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Atjeh in northern Sumatra on 26 December provided a tsunami that hit 14 countries and claimed a total of 226,000 lives along the coasts of the Indian Ocean, more than half of which in Atjeh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes took place on the west coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds of people were killed on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of 6,8 on the scale of Richter took place south of Java, the most densely populated island of Indonesia, and caused a tsunami that struck the south coast and claimed nearly 700 lives.
2009: An earthquake of 7.6 on the scale of Richter met the city of Padang, capital of the province of West-Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: An earthquake of 7.5 on the scale of Richter met one of the Mentawai islands, off the coast of Sumatra, and caused a tsunami of more than 10 metres that destroyed tens of villages and claimed about 300 lives.
2016: An undeep earthquake hit the Regency Pidie in Atjeh and caused destruction and panic, as the people were reminded of the destruction of the deadly earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
This time, no tsunami followed but more than 100 people found death by devastating buildings.
2018: More earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island Lombok, where more than 500 people were killed, mostly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and ensured that thousands of tourists were temporarily beached.

Track Palin, the oldest son of Sarah Palin, former governor of Alaska and candidate for the vice-president, is arrested for charges of domestic violence.
Palin, 29 from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interference with a report of domestic violence and opposition during the arrest, according to a report released Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a woman-in-law tried to call the police to report the alleged arrests, he withdrew the phone from her.
Palin is held in custody at the Mat-Su conservation house with a guarantee of $500, reported by KTUU.
He appeared before the court on Saturday and declared himself 'innocent, certainly knowing' when he was asked for this, the network reported.
Palin is charged with three violations of Class A, which means he can be sentenced to one year in prison and a fine of up to $250,000.
He is also accused of a class B violation, which is punishable with a day in prison and a fine of $2,000.
It is not for the first time that Palin is charged with criminal offences.
In December 2017 he was charged with the abuse of his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged abuse.
This case now serves for Alaska's vet court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic abuse, interference with a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon of influence in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend claimed he had hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized in 2016 by a veteran group, after she had linked her son's violent behavior to PTSS, that he would have abandoned his service time in Iraq.
Indonesia, earthquake, tsunami: hundreds of deaths
At least 384 died after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday.
The earthquake of 7.5 on the scale of Richter has led to a tsunami and destroyed thousands of houses.
Electricity and communications networks are off, while the expectation is that the death will rise in the coming days.
The earthquake took place just next to the centre of Celebes, which lies to the north-east of Jakarta, the Indonesian capital.
There are videos on social media that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami reached the coast.
Federal prosecutors demand a rare death penalty for suspects of a terrorist attack in New York City
Federal prosecutors in New York require the death penalty for Sajfoello Sajpov, the suspect of the terrorist attack in New York City, where eight people were killed, a rare penalty that has not been implemented in this state since 1953.
Sajpov, 30, reportedly used a rented truck from Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bicycle road along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, where he was riding pedestrians and bicycles who came on his way around in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, the prosecutors will have to prove that Sajpov 'willfully' killed the eight victims and 'willfully' caused serious physical injuries, according to the declaration of intent in which the death penalty is required, which has been filed in the Southern District of New York.
For both charges, the death penalty is possible, according to the document before the court.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury approved the prosecution with 22 charges, including eight charges of murder for a rocket, typically a charge used by federal prosecutors against organised crime, and a charge of violence and the destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required 'substantial planning and preparation' according to the prosecutors and described the way in which Sajpov carried out the attack as 'critical, cruel and degrading'.
"Sajfoello Habiboellajevitsj Sajpov has caused injury, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hermann Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco" is in the statement of intent.
Five victims were tourists from Argentina.
It is more than ten years ago that a case was brought before the death penalty in the Southern District of New York.
The suspect, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers but was finally sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was executed in a federal case in New York in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who were executed after they were sentenced to two years earlier for spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
The Rosenbergs were executed by the electric chair on 19 June 1953.
Sajpov, from Uzbekistan, did not give evidence of harassment within the days and months of the attack, according to the legal documents.
He let the investigator know he felt good about his action, she's the police.
Sajpov told the authorities that he was inspired to execute the attack after viewing videos of ISIS on his phone, according to the prosecution.
He also asked to hang the flag of ISIS in his room in the hospital, the police told him.
He did not claim to be guilty of the charge of 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Sajpov, said that he was "naturally disappointed" with the decision of the prosecutors.
"We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty instead of accepting a debt confession in exchange for a life sentence without the possibility of release, will only prolong the trauma of these events for all concerned," Patton said.
Sajpov's defense had already asked the prosecutors not to demand the death penalty.
Conservative Member of Parliament says that NIGEL FARAGE should guide the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage today promised to mobilize a "popularist" during a protest at the Conservative Party conference.
The former leader of Ukip said that politicians must feel the 'hot' of the Eurosceptic, while one of Theresa May's own parliamentarians proposed to guide him in the negotiations with the EU.
The conservative backbencher Peter Bone told the participants in the March in Birmingham that the UK 'would already be out' if Mr. Farage Brexit had been Minister.
However, the challenge faced by May in reconciling the strongly divided individuals is underlined by two conservations that are pro-Remain and participate in a separate protest meeting against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister strives to keep her Chequers compromise on the road while this is being attacked by Brexitiers, Remainers and the EU.
Fellows felt that they would continue and try to close a deal with Brussels despite the obstacles, forcing Eurosceptici and Labour to choose between its package and 'chaos'.
Bone said at a meeting of Leave Means Leave in Solihull that he wants to throw 'Chequers in the wolfman'.
He suggested that Farage should be addressed and that it should be held responsible for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he'd done the job, we'd be out of it now," said Bone.
The Members of Parliament for Wellingborough added: "I will support Brexit, but we must throw Cheques into the lunatic."
In explaining his opposition to the EU, he said: "We have not fought in two world wars to be subordinated.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Bone suggested that the public opinion has been changed since the 2016 referendum: "The idea that the British people have changed their mind and want to stay in the EU is completely false."
The conservative Brexitier Andrea Jenkyns also took part in the march and told reporters: "I just say: prime minister, listen to the people.
Chequers is unpopular with the large public, the opposition does not vote, it is unpopular within our party and with our activists who go from door to door and make sure we are elected.
Let the Chequers fall and listen."
In a message addressed to May, she added: "Premiers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Farage told the meeting that politicians should feel the 'hot' if they wish to betray the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class," he said.
"They're trying to betray Brexit and we're here today to tell them 'we won't let you get out of here."
In a message to the most enthusiastic mass, he added: "I want you to put the fire on our political class, which is about to betray Brexit.
We mobilize the nationalist of this country who has taken care of us in the Brexit referendum and we will never rest until we have become an independent, sovereign, proud United Kingdom."
In the meantime, Remainers marched through Birmingham and concluded this March with a meeting of two hours in the city centre.
A small group of activists swam with flags on which Tories Against Brexit stood, after setting up this group in the weekend.
Lord Adonis, a member of the Labour Chamber, made jokes about the security problems of a Conservative party at the beginning of their conference.
"These are the people who tell us that they can provide for IT systems and all technology for Canada plus, for the unlimited limit, for free trade without borders in Ireland," he added.
It's a complete farce.
There is nothing like a good Brexit," he added.
Warren's planning to "think good" about presidential candidacy
Senator Elizabeth Warren says that she 'will think well of her candidacy for the presidency' after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat told about her future at a meeting in a town hall in West Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, wants to be re-elected in November against Geoff Diehl, a member of the Republic's co-chair of the Trum campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
It has been the midpoint of speculation that it would be possible to fight Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters in a town hall since Trump came into power.
A person present asked her if she would be eligible for the presidency.
Warren answers that it's time for women to go to Washington to restore our defective government and that includes a woman at the top."
Arrest after killing by Wayde Sims of LSU
The police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced Saturday that a suspect was arrested after the murder of Wayde Sims, a basketball player from LSU on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at an ET conference at 11:00.
They gave a video free of the shooting incident on Friday and asked for help in identifying the man who is seen in the movie.
Sims, 20, was shot down and killed near the Southern University campus on Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims got a gunshot wound in his head and died of it," police commander Murphy J. Paul told the press on Saturday, according to 247 sports.
Wayde stepped forward to defend a friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson has been questioned and has known to have been present in the crime scene, in possession of a gun and have shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson has been arrested without further incidents and is detained in the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims was a junior player of 1.98 meters who was raised in Baton Rouge. He played in 32 matches and started last season in 10 matches. He had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per match.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title after Sebastian Vettel left him the victory after team orders
When Valteri Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the team of orders from Mercedes would play a role in the race.
Bottas knew a good start from pole position and almost completely left Hamilton in the cold when he defended his position and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went into the chest and left Hamilton in the dusty rides in the tail of the group, something that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes went in a round later on and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton came back on his head after a wheel-on-wheel action, which forced the Ferrari driver to release on the inside after a double movement in the third arc.
Max Disappearen started from the last place and was seventh after the first round on his 21st birthday.
Then he was a long leader of the race, because he stayed at his band selection and had a quick finish so that he could bring Kimi Raikkonen to the fourth place.
Finally, in the 44th round, he went to the pit, until he could not increase his speed in the remaining eight rounds, so Raikkonen became the fourth.
It's a difficult day because Valteri was doing his best all weekend. He was a real gentleman and left me alone.
The team did its best for the seats one and two," said Hamilton.
That wasn't a good body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein at a Saturday election meeting on the fact that she was not fully the source of Christine Blasey Ford's letter, in which the candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, was accused of assault.
Speaking at a election meeting in West Virginia, the President did not have it directly on the testimony given by Ford to the Senate's Justice Committee. Instead, he showed that what happened in the Senate showed that people could be 'common, dishonest and unworthy'."
"The only thing that can happen is the beautiful display that takes place in the Senate in the last days, when you see the anger, when you are the people who are angry and common and dishonest and unworthy," he said.
"When you look at the press reports and the leaks and they say 'oh, I didn't.
I didn't do it."
You still know that?
Diane Feinstein, did you hurt?
You still know her answer... you leaked the document - 'oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't look.'
Well, wait a minute.
If we've licked... no, we haven't licked" he added, in an imitation of the senator.
In July, the letter in which the charges to Kavanaugh's address were referred to was sent to Feinstein by Ford and was filed in September, but Feinstein denied that her office was the leak.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't hear her story," Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
"She asked me to go in confidence, and I treated it in confidence, as she had asked."
But the president failed to believe her denial, and he commented on it at the meeting on Saturday night: "I'll tell you something, that was not a good body language.
Maybe she didn't, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
Following his defense of the candidate for the Supreme Court, accused by three women of sexual misconduct, the president suggested that the Democrats used the charges for their own purposes.
"They are determined to take back the power, with all the necessary means.
You see the community, the indifference, they don't give anything to who they hurt, who they have to drive to seize power and get control back" the president would have said according to a Mediaite report.
Elite League: Dundee Stars vs Belfast Giants: 5-3
Patrick Dwyer made two bullets for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars have approved the loss of Friday in the Elite League against Belfast Giants by winning the return match with 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants had taken the lead with two goals by scores by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought home the long way before Dwyer de Giants took the lead again.
Francois Bouchard made the equalizer for Dundee, before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen with two goals secured the victory.
It was the third loss in the Elite League this season for the men of Adam Keefe, who had to make a stand on Friday night to beat Dundee with 2-1 later in Belfast.
It was the fourth time this season that the two teams met, where the Giants won the previous three matches.
The opening ball of Dwyer came in the fourth minute at 3:35 a.m. on an assistant of Kendall McFaul. David Rutherford gave the assistant with whom Beauvillier doubled the lead, four minutes later.
In a pressurized opening period Sullivan returned the home team to the game at 13:10, before Matt Marquardt gave the foreword to the cownie equalizer at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure that the Giants had the first rest in advance, when he made his second round of night at the end of the first period.
The home team repacked and Bouchard brought them back to a similar stand with a power-play-goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran then combined well to help Nielsen to lead Dundee for the first time in the race, late in the second period. He took care of the victory with the fifth goal for his team, half way in the last period.
The Giants, who have now lost four of the last five games, play at home against Milton Keynes in their next match on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies while ensuring that hundreds of people can escape the earthquake in an aircraft
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is honored as a hero after he died because he made sure that a plane with hundreds of people could board safely.
More than 800 people have been killed and many are still missing after a severe earthquake hit the island of Celebes on Friday; an earthquake that then caused a tsunami.
Strong searches still test the area and many are buried under the point in the city of Palu.
Despite the fact that his colleagues were fleeing for their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunavan Agung refused to leave his post in the wild road-and-wind traffic routes of the airport Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu.
He continued to ensure that the flight 6321 of Batik Air, which was then ready on the runway, could rise safely.
Then he jumped out of the traffic towers, when he thought they were crashing.
He died in the hospital later.
Yohannes Sirat, a spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said that his decision saved hundreds of lives, reported ABC News from Australia.
We had a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to bring him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter had reached Palu.
"It breaks your heart, when you hear it," he added.
In the meantime, the authorities are afraid that the number of deaths may rise to the thousands and that the Agency for the Fighting of Disasters in the country knows that access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"But it assumes that the fatality is still increasing because many bodies are under the clean layers and have not yet been reached," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Golfes reaching a height of six meters have destroyed Palu, where on Sunday we will keep a massive funeral feast.
Military and commercial aircraft provide assistance and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute bodies are introduced by ambulances.
Clean water is scarce.
The mini-markets are being looted all over the world."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is developed in a race to help survivors, but we do not know what they will find.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse."
President Joko Widodo from Indonesia arrived in Palu on Sunday and said to the present military: "I appeal to all of you to work day and night so that all the tasks necessary for the evacuation will be completed.
Are you ready?" reported CNN.
Indonesia was already hit this year by earthquakes in Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
Aeroplane crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says that one man is missing after a crash in the lagoon
The airline that ran the flight that was crashing into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now says that another man is being missed after they had reported that all 47 passengers and crew members had safely left the hummingbird.
Air Niugini said in a press release that one male passenger will be missing on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said they worked with the local authorities, hospitals and researchers to find the man.
The air carrier did not respond immediately to the questions for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew, after the plane was hit by water during landing at the Chukeland airport.
On Friday, the authorities announced that seven people had been brought to the hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were still in the hospital Saturday and that everyone's condition was stable.
What has caused the crash and what is the exact order of the events remains unexplained for the time being.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both say that the plane is landed in the lagoon and the runway has missed.
Some witnesses believe that the plane has been shot over the runway.
Bill Jaynes, a U.S. passenger, said that the plane approached the airport very low.
"That's good news," said Jaynes.
Jaynes told me that he himself and some others were able to walk through the water, which came to their midst, to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He also said that the stewardesses were panicked and screamed and that he had no serious headache.
The U.S. Navy announced that seabirds who were in the vicinity of a ship also helped rescue operations by bringing people to the shore with a blowable boat before the plane went on to sing in the approximately 30 meters deep water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network show that in the last 20 years 111 people have found death in crashes of aircraft companies registered with the PNG, but that does not apply to Air Niugini.
Analyst sets the timeline of the night a woman is burned alive
The prosecutor concluded his claim on Friday in the reopening process of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the U.S. Ministry of Justice, gave a testimony for hours as a witness expert in the field of information analysis.
He made it clear to the jury how he had used the cell phone data to determine the movements of the 29-year-old suspect, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, in the night she left life.
Rowlett told that he had received the location data from different mobile phones that showed that Tellis was at Chambers on the night of her death, which was contrary to his previous claims, reported The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was at Chambers during the time he claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went back to talk to Sanford.
Sanford was in the witness bank on Saturday and told me he wasn't in town that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he told him that he was at Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said that he was "lying because my truck was in Nashville at the time."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis had told me that he knew Chambers about two weeks after she died.
The cell phone data indicated that they only knew each other for one week.
Rowlett said that Tellis once after the death of Chambers knew the texts, calls and contact details of his phone.
"He knew her out of his life," said Hale.
The defense begins Sunday with the final arguments.
The judge said he expected the jury to begin the day after the consultations.
The High Breed: What is 'conscious hipop'?
A hipoptrio wants to discuss the negative image of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol suggest that hipop is alien from the origin of political opinions and the approach to social problems.
They want to return to the roots and make 'conscious hipop' popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently had a re-resurrection in Great Britain by artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black?
A young woman from New York takes a couple for the judge because of a 'racist' text
A New York student married a couple for divorce for discriminatory reasons, after receiving a wrong-sent text in which the mother complained about 'the weather'.
The real couple refuses to be racist and calls the case 'impression'.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, mother of two children, showed her dismay when she discovered that the new girl, Giselle Maurice, appeared to be a negroid woman when she met her first working day in 2016.
'NOEEEEE WERE ZO'N ZWARTE', Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a message to her husband.
Instead of sending it to her husband, however, she sent it to Mrs. Maurice twice.
According to the New York Post, Ms. Plasco-Flaxman, who felt 'uneasy' when she realized that she was blind, said that her ex-wife, who was African-American, had done a bad job, and that she had therefore expected a Filipino woman.
Mrs Maurice was paid for a working day and was then sent by a taxi home.
Now Maurice holds the couple before the court to get a compensation of $350,-- per day for the 6 months she was hired to buoy in the family, or without contract.
'I want them to feel like you just don't do something like that,' said Maurice last Friday in the New York Post, adding, 'I know it's discrimination.'
The couple abstained from claiming that she was racist by saying that it was reasonable to dismiss Maurice after they were afraid that they could no longer trust her.
My wife sent her a message that she didn't want to send her.
She's not a racist.
We're not racists' husband Joel Plasco told the New York Post.
'But would you leave your children to someone who insulted you, even if it was by accident?
Your newborn baby?
Take it off.'
Regarding the case compared with 'impression', Plasco said that his wife expected a baby in two months and was 'in a very difficult situation'.
Would you be able to prosecute someone like that?
That's not so nice, the investment bankier added it.
While the case is still under trial, the public opinion is quick to capitalize on social media, where it is linked to their behaviour and reasoning.
The editors of Paddington feared that the public would have little interest in a talking bear, revealing a newly discovered letter
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was approved, said about the letter: 'It's hard to get into the shoes of someone who reads it for the first time, even for the first publication.
With what we now know about the enormous success of Paddington, it is very comfortable.'
She told her father that, before he was inspired to write the children's book on a small toy, when cameraman worked with the British broadcaster BBC, he was optimistic about whether his book would be rejected. She added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book "bitter sweet" felt after his death last year.
About Paddington, who describes her as 'a very prominent member of the family', she said that her father was homely proud of the ultimate success.
She said, "He was a quiet, modest man."
'But because Paddington was so vital to him, it seemed almost like a child's performance; you're proud while you did nothing for it yourself.
I think he's about to experience the success of Paddington.
Although Paddington was the creation of his own performance, he himself made the beer for success.'
My daughter was dying and I had to tell her by phone
Immediately after the landing, her daughter was brought to the hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where the doctors tried to save her life in vain.
'Nad had called several times to say that it was very bad and that it was expected that she would not get it,' said Mrs. Ednan-Laperous.
"Then came Nad's phone to say that she would die in two minutes and that I had to get rid of her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much.
We'll be together soon.
Then I'll be back with you.
The medications that the doctors had given her to keep her heart pumping, slowly worked out and left her body.
She had died some time before, and this process was turning things off.
I could only stay there, knowing what was going on.
I couldn't regret, scream or cry, because I was in the middle of all kinds of people and families.
I really had to keep me big."
Finally, Mrs Ednan-Laperous, who was now grieving over the death of her daughter, went on the plane with the other passengers, who had no idea what kind of trial she had to undergo.
"No one knew," she said.
"I sat with my head down and the tears remained coming.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight, I got an overwhelming feeling of compassion for Nad.
I felt he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Ruining women post messages on the bridge to prevent suicide
Two women who have lost loved ones by suicide are strong enough to keep others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are picking up inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for help on a bridge in Wales
Ms. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he first became depressed and committed suicide at 18 years of age.
'I don't want any parent to feel like I feel like every day,' she said.
Ms. Davis, 45 years old and residing in Lydney, in the English graffiti Gloucestershire, tells us that her son was a promising chef cook with an affordable grin.
'He was known for his smile.
They always said that his smile would light up every room."
Yet he stopped working for his death because he was deep in the well."
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 years old, found him after he had robbed himself of his life.
Mrs Davis said, 'I constantly worry that there will be a chain reaction.'
Mrs Davis has made the cards; 'to let people know that there are others where you can go and where you can talk, even if it's just a friend.
Don't be quiet - talk about it."
Mrs Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs Davies for years, lost Mark, who was her 15-year-old partner, not long after his mother died.
'He didn't say that he felt sombre or depressed or something,' she said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
He was on the ground all the time on Christmas Day - when the children took out their presents he didn't look at them at all or at all."
She said that his death was a great trauma to her, but that she had to process it: 'It broke the whole family apart.
It's telling us.
But we all have to go on and keep fighting.'

Brett Kavanaugh's future is uncertain while FBI research starts
'I thought that if we could indeed get what he asks; a research limited in time and scope, we might be able to create a little more unity again,' said Mr. Flake last Saturday, to whom he added, that he was afraid that the committee was falling 'from one another', in the middle of a firmly anchored position within the party.
Why did Mr Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to conduct a study?
Their restraint has everything to do with timing.
The interim elections have been held in five weeks, on 6 November, and if, as the Republicans are expected to do, their efforts to obtain their husband's election in the highest court in the country are seriously difficult.
George W. Bush has already called with members of the U.S. Senate to lobby for Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush, and then his wife Ashley, who was the Bush's personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI has the report finished?
There will then be a vote in the Senate, which currently has 51 republics and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr Kavanaugh can count at least 50 votes in the Senate, and that would give Mike Pence, Vice-President, the opportunity to deliver the ruling vote to confirm the appointment of Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.
Number of passersby in North Korea 'replace' under Kim
According to a South Korean legislator, the number of North Korean runners has fallen to South Korea since Kim Jong-and seven years ago came into power.
Park Byeong-sug, quoted from data from the South Korean Ministry of Singlewarding, states that there were 1,127 passersby last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park points out that more stringent border controls between North Korea and China, and higher penalties for human smugglers are the main factors for the decline.
Pyongyang has not responded in public.
The vast majority of North Korean survivors are finally offered the South Korean nationality.
According to sources in Seoul, more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most escaped through China, which has the longest external border with North Korea and where you can make the crossing easier than in the heavily-secured demilitarized zone (DMZ; Demilitarized Zone) between the two Koreas.
China considers the offenders to be illegal migrants rather than refugees and often puts them out with violence.
The relations between the North and the South, which are still formally in the hands of war, have improved considerably over the past few months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang, which discussed, in particular, the accelerated negotiations on denuclarisation.
This meeting took place after the historic meeting between the President of the United States, Donald Trump, and Kim Jong-un, in Singapore in June, which agreed in broad lines to work towards the nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, however, the North Korean Minister for Foreign Affairs, Ri Yong-ho, accused the US of the lack of progress in lifting US sanctions since then.
'Without faith in the conduct of the US, there is also a lack of confidence in our national security, and under these circumstances there is no first step of unilateral disarmament', said Mr Ri during a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh 'hysterical', and finds him unfit to serve in the Supreme Court
President of the House of Deputies, Nancy Pelosi, candidate for the U.S. Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh 'hysterical' and finds him incapable of serving in the Supreme Court
Pelosi made the comments in an interview, Saturday at the 'Texas Tribune Festival' in Austin, Texas.
'I could not help but think that if a woman acted like this, she would be called 'histories'', Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh denied the charges that he would have abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford sexually when they were both teenagers.
During his opening remarks, Kavanaugh was very excited; he sometimes screamed almost and was especially from the area when he told about his family and his high school.
He also strongly condemned the Democrats in the committee, in which he called charges against him 'great and coordinated murder', organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the presidential election in 2016.
Pelosi stated that she felt that Kavanaugh's testimony showed that he was not fit to serve the Supreme Court because he was full of prejudices against the Democrats.
'I think he's disqualificating himself with his statements and the way he talks about the Clintons and the Democrats,' said Pelosi.
Pelosi protested when she was asked whether she would try to introduce an impeachment procedure against Kavanaugh if he were to be appointed, and the Democrats would get the majority in the House of Deputies.
'I can say this about it; if he does not tell the truth at Congress, or against the FBI, then he is not only unfit for the Supreme Court, but also for the court where he is now serving,' said Pelosi.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the court of the District of Columbia (usually reduced by D.C.) District Court of Appeal.
Pelosi added that she was concerned as a democrat that Kavanaugh would speak against the 'Affordable Care Act or Roe v Wade' (the law on affordable health).
Kavanaugh raised questions about the revision of certain decisions of the Supreme Court during the confirmatory hearings.
'Do not expect us to be happy if a hysterical, prejudiced person is now appointed in the Supreme Court,' said Pelosi.
Women just have to admit to this.
It is a just triad of months and years of intense anger that passes, and it can only cry out to get it out.
'We're going to cry when we get angry,' Mrs Steinem said 45 years later to me.
'I don't think that's funny, do you?'
She went on to say, 'I've been very helpful to a woman who was in charge of something, and she told me that she was crying when she was angry. She developed a method in which when she was angry, she was crying. She said to the one she spoke to, 'You may think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And then she just cried.
I just thought it was brilliant."
Tears are partly allowed as an expression of anger, because tears are essentially misunderstood.
One of my best memories left from a previous job, in a man-dominated office, was when I had to cry terribly because I was extremely angry. An older woman, a guy who was a bit afraid of everyone, grabbed me in my neck and dragged me into a stairwell.
'Never let them see you cry,' she said to me.
They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they're glad they got you on the box.
Patricia Schroeder, then a member of Congress in Colorado for the Democrats, had worked for Gary Hart at his presidential candidacy.
In 1987, when Mr Hart was involved in an extraordinary case on board a boat called 'Monkey Business' (informally means 'catenkwaad' or 'apenstreken') and withdrew from the race, Mrs Schroeder, who was deeply disappointed, said that there was no reason why she would not apply herself.
'It wasn't a good-thinking decision,' she told me 30 years later laughing.
'There were already 7 other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone was talking about Snow White and the Seven Dwarves.
Because the campaign was already advanced, she was behind with fund-raising, and so she promised she would not join if she couldn't raise $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She discovered that some of her supporters, who would give $1,000 to men, wanted to give her only $250.
'Maybe they think I'm getting a discount?' she asked herself.
When she gave her speech in which she announced that she would not start a formal campaign, she became so overwhelmed by feelings - of gratitude for the people who had supported her, of frustration because the system made it so difficult to raise money, and to reach voters instead of Members, and of anger about sexism - that she was in trouble.
'I would have thought that I had a nervous sensation,' Mrs Schroeder recalled how the media responded to her.
'They'll think Kleinex was my business sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are they gonna put on my gravestone?
"They cry?"
How to extract trade war between the US and China for Beijing
The opening-up of the US-China trade war was overwhelming, and although the fight has not been fought for a long time, a gap between the two countries could be made in favour of Beijing, according to experts in the long term.
Earlier this year, Donald Trump, the President of the United States, gave the first warning by raising taxes on important Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant escalation this week was known when new effective, increased tax rates were revealed for $200 billion (150 billion) in goods; half of all goods coming from the US from China.
Peking has taken resurgences in nature every time, most recently by raising prices from 5 to 10% for $60 billion in American goods.
China has promised to equalize the US every time, and the worlds will probably not quickly cut their eyes on a after-largest economy.
In order to let Washington bows, requests must be granted, but public bows for the US are too painful for the Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts claim that if Beijing is playing the smart, trade war with the US, China could be positive in the longer term by reducing the mutual dependence of the two economies.
'The fact that a rapid political decision could create conditions in Washington or Beijing, which could bring one of the two countries into a free economic fall, is indeed much more dangerous than viewers have already recognized,' said Abigail Grace, a research associate of the Center for a New American Security, a thought specialized in national security issues addressing Asia.
Syria 'prepared' to allow refugees to return, so Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria says to be ready for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for help to rebuild the country that has been destroyed by a war of more than seven years.
During his speech to the UN General Assembly, Minister for Foreign Affairs, Walid al-Moualem, said that the situation in his country would improve.
"Today, the situation is more stable and safer on the ground, thanks to the progress made in combating terrorism," he says.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists and to normalise the situation on the ground.
All circumstances are now present for the voluntary return of refugees to the country which they have to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that threatened their daily lives and existence.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled their country since the war began in 2011.
According to estimates, there are still about six million people in the country who need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian regime would welcome help in restoring the devastated country.
However, he stressed that Syria would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from countries that had subsidized the rebellion.
Europe wins the 'Ryder Cup' in Paris
The European team won the '2018 Ryder Cup' by defeating the American team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 on the golf course 'Le Golf National' southwestern Paris in France.
The US has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the title when the Danish leader Thomas Bjorn's team won the required 14.5 points to defeat the US.
The star of the American team, Phil Mickelson, who was almost all of the tournament fighting, left his long battle in the water at par 3, holes 16, and admitted his loss of Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer, Molinari, took his rounds and became one of the four players who ever got 5-0-0 since the tournament started in its current form in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was thrown out by the lowest scorer of the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark, with 5 holes down and 4 holes.
The highest-class player on the world ranking, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 holes down and 1 hole to play from Ian Poulter from Great Britain, which could be the last match in the Ryder Cup.
The Spanjaard Segrio Garcia, a veteran with eight Ryder Cups, became the best European player of all tournaments ever with 25.5 points in his career.
'I don't cry so fast, but today I can't do anything about it.
It's been a difficult year.
I'm so grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I'm so glad we got the cup back.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I could help," said an excited Garcia after the European victory.
He gives the trick to his countrymate, John Ram, who goes to defeat the American legendary Tiger Woods with 2 holes down and 1 hole in the game for singles on Sunday.
'The huge pride I feel because I've reported Tiger Woods. I've always followed that guy when I grew up,' the 23-year-old Rahm said.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 in Ryder Cup.
A strange statistics of one of the biggest players ever; winner of 14 major championships, second only after Jack Nicklaus.
The American team fought the weekend to find the fairways, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau, who played high-level at the whole tournament.
The American commander, Jim Fury, said after the disappointing performance of his team: 'I'm proud of these boys, they've fought.
Soon this morning, we have made Europe a bit more difficult.
We're facing opposition.
All respect for Thomas.
He's a great leader.
All 12 players in his team played very well.
We're going to regroup, I'm going to work with the American PGA (Professional Golfers' Association) and our Ryder Cup Committee and we're looking forward.
I love these 12 boys and I'm proud to be their leader.
You have to take your hat off for the opponent.
We're overplayed."
Red glass update: Concentrations take off in de provincees Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The most recent report by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (Florida Committee for the Conservation of Fish and Fauna) shows a general decline in red-glazed concentrations in parts of Tampa Bay Area ( located on the west coast of Florida in the US).
According to the Committee, fragmentary increases in red light in the provinces of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier are reported, which could indicate a decrease in concentrations.
The red light extends over an average of 200 km of coastline, from northern Pinellas to the southern Lee Countys.
There are about 16 km for the coast of Hillsborough County, but in less places than last week.
Red glass was also seen in Pasco County.
Average concentrations have been reported for the coast of Pinellas County in the last week, low to high concentrations for the coast of Hillsborough County, background to high concentrations in Manatee County, background to high concentrations on or off the coast of Sarasota County, background to high concentrations in Charlotte County, background to high concentrations on or off the coast of Lee County, and low concentrations in Collier County.
There are reports of irritation of the routes in the provinces of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee, and Collier.
In the north-west of Florida there was no mention of irritation of the airways in the last week.
