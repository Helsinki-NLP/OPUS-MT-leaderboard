Members of the Wales Assembly worry they're acting like a fool.
In the midst of some members of the Assembly, there has been widespread concern over the proposal for changing their title in the MWP (members of the Wales Parliament).
This has resulted in plans to change the name of the assembly at the Wells Parliament.
Members of the Assembly of the whole political spectrum are concerned that this could provoke ridicule.
A member of the Labourist Party's assembly said his group was concerned "that it resumes with Tp and Pup."
For readers outside Wales: In the cool, twp means "budall" and pwp means "kas".
A Wales Party MP said the whole group was "uncognizable" and proposed alternatives.
A conservative bridgesian said his group was "invulnerable" in terms of changing the name, but said there was little difference between the words "MWP" and "Budalla".
In this context, the pronunciation of the spell "w" in English is similar to that of the verb "u" in the English of York.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation on declaring the name change, said: "Of course, the final decision for the appointment of members of the Assembly will depend on the members itself."
The Law of the Government of Wales in 2017 gave the Uellsian assembly the Tetragrammaton to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a consultation with the public, and its recent proposal for the appointment of the assembly as the "Prime Parliament" found broad support.
Regarding the assembly's title issue, the Commission favoured the appointment "members of the Wales Parliament" or "WMP", but the alternative "MWWP" found more support in a consultation with the public.
It seems that members of the Assembly are suggesting alternative elections, but the struggle for reaching consensus can be turned into disarray for Chairman Elaine Jones, who is expected to submit legislation on changes within a few weeks.
The legislation on reforms will include other changes regarding the way the assembly functioning, including regulations for exemption of members of the Assembly and the structure of the committee's system.
During the discussion of legislation, the final vote regarding the issue of their appointment will remain to members of the Assembly.
Macedonians vote in the referendum on changing the country's name.
On Sunday, voters will vote for their country's change of name in "Republic of Northern Macedonia".
The vote by the people was decided in an effort to resolve a multiyear dispute with neighbouring Greece, which also has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that its northern neighbour's name constitute claims on its territory and has repeatedly rejected its requirements for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the name change referendum, has indicated that he will not recognise the polls.
However, referendum supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price to pay for EU and NATO membership.
St. Martin's trucks quietly fall as churches in Harlem face difficulties
"Heistorically, the old people I talked to say there was a bar and a church in every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"Today there are both missing."
He said that the removal of the bars is understandable.
"Today, people socialise in other ways," he says.
"Basts are no longer places in the neighborhood meeting, where people regularly go."
As for the churches, he expresses concern that money from selling property will not last long enough for leaders "and sooner or later they will return to the initial point."
He added that churches could be replaced by housing palaces full of people such as would not support the sacred sites that remain in the neighbourhood.
"The vast majority of people buying housing facilities in these palaces are white," he said, "so soon the day will come when these churches will close once and for all, as it is innocent that most people who dwell in these houses will become members of these churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem turned into a monopolies of color - people, the Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martini a decade later.
The original white metodishes congregation was transferred in the 1930 ’ s.
The building was taken into possession of a congregation of colorful people who had been given their place of worship nearby.
St. Martini passed a congregation of color under the direction of Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of minority merchants on "125th", a major shopping route in Harlem, who refused to hire or promote coloured people.
In 1939, the building was badly damaged by a fire, but after Father Johnson's fans made plans for reconstruction, they ordered the career.
David Johnson, father Johnson's son and heir to St. Martin, proudly called the career "the possession of poor people."
The experiment that has played in the career in July called it something quite different: "A cultural treasure" and an "incompatible historical assessment."
Experith, Tiffany Ng from Michigan University, also said that this was the world's first cartoon of a color music player, Dioniio A. East, who moved to a largest region in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merryweather said St. Martin hadn't replaced him.
The events of recent months at St. Martin have been a complex tale of architects and contractors, some sent by secular church leaders and others from the episcopic disa.
The FBI's leading body, composed of secular leaders -- has written diolosis in July, with concern that she "would try to transfer costs" to the Famulli council, regardless of whether the latter was not involved in employing architects and contractors sent from the dioco.
Some theologians complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the dinosaur.
The shark injured 13-year-old during a dive to catch gas in California
A shark has attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday as he was diving to catch gas in California on the day of opening the gas station, officials say.
The attack occurred just before 7:00 a.m., near Beacon's beach in Encinias.
Chad Hammel has been expressing for KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with some friends for about half an hour in the morning, when he had heard the boy screaming for help, and then rowed towards him along with a group to pull him out of the water.
Hammel said he had originally thought that the boy was just executed by catching any race, but then he said, "I understood he was screaming "kid me!
He bit me!"
Hammel says that when he reached his son, he saw that his entire Revelation was torn apart.
"I shouted to everybody to get out of the water: "There's a shark in the water!" Hammel added.
The boy was transported by helicopter to the "Rady's" child hospital in San Diego, where he was declared critical.
The shark's species responsible for the attack was unknown.
The captain of the coastal guard Larry Giles said at a media conference that a shark was seen in the area a few weeks ago, but was defined as a non-regional shark species.
Giles added that the victim had suffered traumatic injuries to the upper body.
Officials banned access to the beach by Ponto Beach in Kasabed until Swami's in Vienna for 48 hours, for investigative and security purposes.
Giles said there are over 135 shark species in the area, but most are considered harmless.
Sansbury's planning access to MB's cosmetics market
Sainsbury's are competing Boots, Superdugs and Debenhams with the cosmetic equipment of large shops, with a specialised staff.
Under a considerable effort to enter the UK's social market of 2.8 billion pounds, which is continuing to grow while sales of fashion and household furniture decline, larger cosmetics will be tested in 11 shops around the country and will spread more of the next year if successful offspring are noticed.
Investment in cosmetics comes at a time when supermarkets are looking for ways to fill the shelves used for television, microwaves, and household furniture.
Sainsbury's has said he would double his offer of cosmetics to up to 3,000 products, including even brands such as Revlon, Esssie, Tweerzerman and Dr. PowPow.
Even existing lines from the L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bes will be given more space, with sites dedicated to respective brands, similar to those found in stores like Botots.
The supermarket will also market its cosmetic line again, so that most products are related to vegan compounds — something that is increasingly being sought by customers of the younger age.
In addition, the retail perfume trader "Fragrance Shop" will test concessions in two Sansburry's shops, the first of which was opened last week in Croydon, south of London, while a second is expected to open later this year in Sakikak, Birmingham.
Online purchases and a tendency to buy daily foods in small amounts in neighborhood stores imply that supermarkets now have to do more to attract people.
Mike Coupe, the executive director of Sainsbury's, has said that the outlets will begin to resemble more and more with large shops, while the supermarket network tries to fight the decline of Aldi and Lidl prices with more services and non-rebursive products.
Sainsbury's set up the "Argos" operas in hundreds of shops and introduced a series of "Habattas" that after buying both networks two years ago, which according to him has encouraged food sales and made shopping more profitable.
The previous effort of the supermarket to restructuring his cosmetics and pharmaceutical departments resulted in failure.
Sansbury's tested a union union union with Boots in the early 2000s, but the union was dissolved after a debate on the way to sharing income from farmers in its supermarkets.
The new strategy comes three years after Sainsbury's sold his pharmaceutical business of 281 Celesio shops, owners of the Lloyds pharmaceutical network, for 125 million pounds.
He said that "Lloyds" would play a role in the plan, adding an extensive coating range for skin, including La Roche-Posey and Vicy in four shops.
Paul Mills-Hicks, the commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: "We have transformed the view of our cosmetics to improve the environment in favour of our clients.
We have also invested in a specialised staff, who will be ready for giving advice.
The plasma of our brands has been conceived in such a way that it adjusts every need, and the attractive and convenient environment and locations indicate that we are now a cosmetic destination, which distinguishes from the old way of shopping."
Peter Jones's "caught" after Holly Wilughby retires from the 11 million pounds deal.
The star of "Dragons Den", Peter Jones, has left "caught" after TV host Holly Wilughby was drawn by an agreement of 11 million pounds with his business dedicated to a certain style of life, to focus on its new contracts with "Mart and Sper" and "Vl" and "IV"
Wilughby has no time for their household furniture brands and "Rooly".
The business of these two was compared to the Gwynth Patrow brand.
The 37-year-old representative of the "This Morening" turned to the Institute to declare its departure.
Holly Wilughby has pissed off the star of "Dragons Dan", Peter Jones, after the last moment withdrawing from their profitable business dedicated to a certain lifestyle - to focus on her promising new contracts with "Mart & Hospital" and "ITV".
Sources say Jones was "caught" when television's golden daughter agreed during a tense Tuesday meeting at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlowow, Buckinghamshire, that her new agreements -- worth up to 1,5 million pounds - meaning that she did not have enough time to devote their appetites and hobbies to "Turves".
The business was compared to the Gwynth Patrow brand and was expected to double its wealth estimated at 11 million pounds.
As Wilughby, 37, he addressed the Institute to declare its departure from "Truly", Jones flew out of Britain towards one of his vacation houses.
A source has said: "Truly was undoubtedly at the top of Holly's priorities.
It would be its long-term future that would accompany her in the decades to come.
Her decision to withdraw left all persons involved absolutely stunned.
No one could believe what was happening Thursday, she was so close to opening.
There is a warehouse full of goods ready to be sold in the offices in Marlowu."
Experts believe that the departure of the "This Morening" host, which is among the most successful British stars, could cost the firm millions, due to substantial investment in products starting from pillows and candles to household dress and furniture, and cause further delays in opening it.
And that could be the end of a long friendship.
Wilughby, mother of three, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been close to Jones and his wife, Tara Capp for ten years.
Wilughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined as her director in March.
Couples spend their holidays together, and Jones has 40 per cent stake in Baldwin's TV production firm.
Wilughby is expected to become a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of "I'm A Celebrity" or ITV.
Last night, a source near Jones has said "We do not want to comment on his business issues."
Hot conversations "and then we fell in love"
He made a joke about the criticism he would get from the news media because of a comment his comment, which some would label as "not worthy of a president" and because of the optimism concerning the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump surrendered so much?
He said, imitating the voice of news representatives with ridicule.
"I didn't give up at all."
He said Kim is interested in a second meeting, as their first meeting in Singapore in June was welcomed by Trump as a major step towards North Korea's unregistering.
But negotiations on non-recognition have been interrupted.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, the head diplomat of North Korea, Ri Young Ho, has been directed to world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday, saying Veriu sees no "constructive reaction" on the US side to the first steps taken by North Korea for non-relification.
Rather, he says, the US is continuing sanctions aimed at holding pressure.
Trump kept a much more optimistic view of his rallying speech.
"The women are going best with North Korea," he said.
"We were going into war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have an excellent relationship."
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have brought positive results -- a break in missile testing, aid in releasing hostages and returning home to the rest of the US military.
In his speech about the relationship with Kim, he defended his unusual approach.
"It is very easy to act as president, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this packed arena, we would have about 200 people staying there," Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
The tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia destroy an island, killing hundreds
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, foreign non - profitable organizations were told that their presence was not necessary.
Despite the shifting of more than 10 per cent of the population of Lombok, no national catastrophe was declared, which constitutes a preliminary condition for the construction of international aid.
"Unfortunately, they have made it on many clear cases that they do not seek international support, so the issue is a bit challenging," Mrs. Summung said.
While "Sve the Child" is setting up a team to travel to Palu, it is still not known whether foreign staff can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman for the national disaster agency, said that Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to relief efforts.
In view of the earth’s frequent movement of Indonesia, the land remains extremely unprepared in the face of natural anger.
While shelters against tsunamis have been built in Aceh, they hardly meet in other coastal areas.
The apparent absence of a scandal for the warning in Palu, despite a warning, has likely contributed to the loss of lives.
Even in the best conditions, travel between the many islands of Indonesia is difficult.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complex.
A hospital ship that was located in Lombok for treatment of earthquake victims is traveling to Palu, but it will need at least three days to reach the new disaster zone.
President Joko Wido used to improve the shallow infrastructure of Indonesia as the central point of his election campaign, and has invested generous amounts of money on roads and railways.
But financing shortages have upset Mr. Joko's administration, while he is facing new elections that will take place next year.
Mr. Joko is also facing pressures from continuing sector tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim community have embraced a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people have been killed, and tens of thousands of thousands have moved from their homes following the clash of Christian and Muslim groups on the street, which have been used by hackers, bows and arrows, and other cold weapons.
See: Daniel Stormridge of Liverpool marks in the last few minutes an equal goal against Chelsea.
Daniel Stormdge has escaped Liverpool from a defeat in Premier League versus Chelse, with a goal in his 89th minute Saturday at Stamford Bridget, London.
Stormget took a pass by Jerdan Shaqiri at the gate of Chelsea, while his team was losing 1-0.
He gently pushed the ball to his left before hitting a blow towards the far gate.
The ball flew over the area until it slipped toward the upper right and lower edge of the net.
The ball saved the air dance of Kerpa Arzabalga and ended up on the net.
"The aim was to settle in the right position properly to take the ball and players like Shaq always play with the balls before, so I tried to create myself as long as possible," Storm told LiverFCcom.
"I saw Kante coming, checked the ball with a touch and didn't think too long, but I just hit it."
Chelsea was leading the 1-0 score in the first part, after a goal in the 25th minute by Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The blue striker made a rerun at Mateo Kovacic during that game before turning near the field and heading toward the semicircle of Liverpool.
Kovacic made a quick combination in the middle.
Then he gave a beautiful vertical pass that brought Howard into the area.
Hazard passed the course at the speed, and with a left-hand kick, he marked on the second column, passing the ball behind the wings of Liverpool porter, Allison Becker.
Liverpool will face Napoleon at the stage of the champion League groups on Wednesday at the San Palo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the European UEFA League on Thursday at 3:00 in London.
The number of deaths from tsunamis in Indonesia amounts to 832
The number of deaths from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has increased to 832, national disaster agency has indicated in Sunday's early hours.
According to reports, many have remained trapped under the ruins of buildings that collapsed from the 7.5-face earthquake that hit Friday and caused waves up to 20 feet, agency spokesman Sutopo Puro said at a press conference.
The town of Pullu, with a population of more than 380,000, has been boasted under the ruins of destroyed buildings.

Cromwell's statue in Parliament, the latest monument affected by the debate on "rescription of history"
Its removal would be a deserved punishment for the destruction of many of England’s cultural and religious arsenals on the part of its fanatic Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Association described Mr. Crick's proposal as "critic" and "testing to re-unify history".
John Goldsmith, head of the Cromwell Association, said: "In the middle of the current debate concerning the removal of statues, it was inevitable the mark of Oliver Cromwell's image outside Westster's Palace.
The Iconoclaza of English civil wars was neither ordered nor was it ordered by Cromwell.
Perhaps this would be a sacrifice of the wrong Cromwell for the actions of his predecessor Thomas in the past century.
Cromwell's excellent performance by Sir William Hamo Thornecroft is evidence of the 19th century opinion and part of the history of a figure that many think is still worth glorifying.
Mr. Goldsmith said about "The Sunday Telegraph": "Many people, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, viewed Cromwell as a defence of parliament from external pressure, which, of course, was the machine.
The fact that this is an entirely accurate portrait is the subject of continued historical debate.
What is certain is that the 17th century conflict shaped further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a known individual figure representing one side of that medal.
His arrivals as Lord protector also deserve to be celebrated and remembered."
Murderers wounded the Chinese farmer to death
A farmer has been attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only with his last name "Yuan", has been found innocent with a broken artery and covered in blood next to a pig stable in the Liupanishi market in Guzhou province, reported "Suth China Morning Post" on Sunday.
A pig farmer is ready to inject pigs vaccines into a stable on May 30, 2005, in Xinning province of Qinghai, China.
He was reportedly traveling with his cousin from neighbouring Yunan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs in the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and found out the door of a pig stable nearby.
He said there was a big male pig in the stable with blood.
A medical examination has confirmed that the 550-und pig has injured the farmer to death, according to the report.
"My cousin's wounds were slaughtered, his cousin, identified by the name "Wu", as quoted in the evening news in Guijang, has said.
At the footage captured by security cameras, Yuan is seen entering the market at 4:40 a.m. Thursday morning to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not belonging to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager reported on the evening news that the pig was kept in isolation to prevent any other attacks, while police collected evidence in the scene.
According to reports, Yewan's family and market authorities are negotiating a compensation for his death.
Even though rare, cases of people attacked by pigs have been observed before.
In 2016 a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their farm in Massachusetts, causing the husband to be severely wounded.
Ten years ago, a 650-foot pig grabbed a bridge behind his tractor until his wife expelled the animal.
After a farmer from Ogionon was bitten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba News said that normally, pigs are not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as "floating".
"They just want to play.
They're like incredibly curious little kids... their purpose is not to hurt you.
You just have to show them due respect," he said.
Hurricane Rosa's aftermath is expected to bring big-scale flooding to US Southwest
As foretold, Hurricane Rosa’s power is being softened as she moves toward the coldest waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
During the following days, however, Rosa will cause floods resulting in floods in northern Mexico and the United States in the southwest.
On Sunday morning, at 5: 00 a.m. in the east hour, Rosa was accompanied by winds 85 miles an hour, identifying herself as a hurricane of Categoria 1, and stood 385 miles [385 km] south of Putta Engenia, Mexico.
The duck is expected to move north Sunday.
Meanwhile, over the Pacific Ocean is beginning to form a low-pressed climate that is moving towards the East, towards the West Coast of the United States. As Rosa is expected to approach the Baja California peninsula on Monday in the treatment of a tropical storm, it will continue to slow down the great tropical humidity towards her north, in the southwestern United States.
On Monday, Rosa will cause scores of up to 10 inches in some parts of Mexico.
Then, the interaction of tropical humidity with low - pressure atmospheres will cause severe rainfalls in the following days in southwest.
At the local level, rainfalls from 1 to 4 inches will cause rapid floods, waste leaks, and possible landfalls in the desert.
The high tropical sound will cause the rate of rainfall in certain areas to reach approximately 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in parts of the southern Netherlands and Arizona.
2 to 4 inches of sand is projected in some areas of southwewest, mainly over a large part of Arizona.
There is also the possibility of rapid flooding with rapid deterioration of conditions because of the widespread nature of tropical rainfall.
Because of the dangers of tropical rainfall, you are not advised to walk through the desert on foot.
The great clouds can turn the canoes into strong rivers, and the storm will cause strong winds and dust storms in the area.
The approach of low-pressed atmosphere zone will bring major rainfalls in some parts of the southern California coast.
The total level of rainfall can reach over half an inch, causing small waste leaks and slippery roads.
For the region, these will be the first rainfall of the rainy season.
Several droughts scattered tropical rain will start approaching Arizona on Sunday evening and Monday morning, before rain clouds expand more widely on Monday and Tuesday evening.
Strong clouds will be distributed on all four sides on Tuesday and will continue until Wednesday.
The U.S. October may be characterized by huge temperatures, with temperatures drop in the Arctic, while sidewalks remain warm.
At times, this leads to drastic changes in temperatures in short distances.
A good example is the drastic difference in temperatures across the central US on Sunday.
Between the city of Kansas, Missouri and Omahas in Nebraska, as well as between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iwowa, the temperature gap is about 20 degrees.
During the following days, the remaining summer heat will try to accumulate and expand again.
A good part of the Central and East US is expected to start October with warm temperatures, with an average of 80, from the southern areas to certain parts of the Verris.
New York City could reach 80 degrees Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate projection shows high prospects for temperatures above average in the eastern US during the first half of October.
Over 20 million people have attended the Festival oft Kawanugh
More than 20 million people have followed through six interesting television networks the testimony of High Court candidate Bret Kavanugh and the woman who accused him of a sexual assault allegedly committed in the 1980s, Christian Blasey Ford.
Meanwhile, the political blockade continued, and broadcasters interrupted regular programmes to broadcast the turn in the last minute of Friday's events -- an agreement reached by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for conducting a weekly investigation by the FBI on charges.
Ford said in front of the Senate Justice Committee that it is 100 per cent confident that Kavanugh had touched him as he was drunk and tried to get him to a high school party.
Kavanugh, in a vivid witness, said it was 100 per cent confident that this had not happened.
The number of followers was probably bigger than that of 20,4 million people reported by Nielsen on Friday.
The company was making the average size of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News channel and MSNBC.
The figures for other transmission networks, including GDP, C-SPAN and Fox Business network, were not immediately available.
And Nielsen usually has problems counting viewers from offices.
To put that figure in perspective, the size of this audience is similar to that of a football hermine or that of Academy Awards.
Canal Fox News, whose opinion strongly supports Kawanugh's appointment, led other networks with an average of 5,69 million viewers during the 24-hour session, Nielsen said.
ABC came in second place with 3.26 million viewers.
The CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2,94 million, MSNBC 2,89m, and CNN 2,52 million, Nielsen said.
Interest continued to remain high even after the trial was over.
Flake was the main character in Friday's drama.
After the office of the moderate Republican issued a statement that he would vote in favour of Kawanugh, he was filmed by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning as he faced the protesters ’ screams while trying to jump into the elevator to attend the court hearing of the Justice Committee.
At CNN's broadcast, he appeared looking down for a few minutes as he was scolding.
"I'm standing here right in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
He was told, "You have the power, while there are so many weak women."
Flake said his office had issued a statement, and before the elevator door was closed, he said there would be more to say during the committee session.
A few hours later, all cable and satellite networks were directly covering the moment when the Justice Committee would vote for the passage of Kawanauugh's candidacy for voting in front of all members of the Senate.
But Flake said she would do so only with the conviction that the FBI would investigate charges against the candidate over the next week, as the Democrat minority had demanded.
Flake had been convinced in part of conversation with his friend, Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several other senators after him, Flake made the decision.
Flake's choice was smart, since it was clear that the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanugh without conducting the investigation.
President Trump has sought the opening of an FBI investigation into charges against Kawanauugh.
British Prime Minister Mayy accuses critics of "playing political games" with Brex
Prime Minister Terresa May has accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union that "the political games are playing" with Britain's future and are compromising national interest, in an interview for the newspaper "Sude Times".
Britain's Prime Minister Theresa May May arrives at the Conference of the Conservare Party in Birmingham, Britain, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview next to her front page of the newspaper, former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson continued the attack on its so-called "Chequers", saying the proposal that Britain and the EU supply taxes for each other's account is "exposedly abusive".
Wyde Simes's gun: Police arrest suspect Dayton Simpson for the death of LSU player
Police have arrested a suspect in the assassination of Wyde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player of the LSU team.
The 20-year-old Dayton Simpson has been arrested and questioned in prison facilities under the charge of unpredicted murder, Baton Rogue Police Director has said.
Official sources have released video confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police say Sims had lost his glasses during the conflict.
Police have found their glasses on the scene and it says it has found traces of Simpson DNA in them, reports CBS's philbiology.
After being questioned by Simpson, police said he has admitted that he has fired his gun on Wade, causing him to die.
The amount for his release is set to $35,000, the lawyer reported.
The Office of the East County Law Doctor of Baton Rogue has issued a preliminary report Friday, suggesting that the cause of death has been a wound caused by firearms from the head to the neck.
The department thanks to the arrest of fugitives near the Luxembourg State Police, the state police lab, the Soutten University police and the area's citizens, for helping with the investigation that led to the arrest of the author.
LSU's athletic director Joe Alleva has thanked the area's legitimate authorities for "their smile and for bringing justice to the country."
Sims was 20 years old.
The six-foot-high boy grew up in Baton Rogue, where his father, Wayne, had played basketball for LSU.
In the last season, he had an average of 5,6 points and 2.6 hits for every game.
On Friday morning, the coach of the LSU basketball team, Will Wade, said the team was "silent" and "friended" by Wyade's death.
"That's what we worry all the time," Wade said.
Voulkan Puts Glory on Mexico City
Hiro from the Popkatpel volcano has reached southern parts of the capital city of Mexico.
On Saturday, the National Centre for Disaster Prevention warned the Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after the crater was restored and recorded 183 gas and ash emissions within 24 hours.
The center had monitored a series of thunders and swings.
The images in social media showed thin layer of ashes that had covered car glass in some parts of Mexico City, such as Xichimico.
Geologists have confirmed an increase in the activity of the volcano, which is 45 miles (45 km) southeast of the capital, since a 7.1 - magnitude earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The seal known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catholic separatists before the anniversary of voting for independence
Six people have been arrested in Barcelona on Saturday following the protest of pro-war protesters with peacekeeping police forces, while thousands have joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the Catallana's polarisation vote.
A group of masked pro-separents, surrounded by peacekeeping police forces, struck with eggs and paint by dark dust clouds on the streets that are usually buzzing with tourists.
Later in the day, there was no exposure, while the police had to use rubber sticks to end the clashes.
For several hours, reiterating the slogan "We don't forget, we don't forgive", pro-corruption groups faced the Unionists shouting "Round Spain".
Fourteen people were treated for minor wounds taken during protests, according to local press reports.
In the region where it dominates pro independence emotions, tensions continue to remain high a year after the October 1st referendum, which is considered illegal by Madrid, but is celebrated by separatist catalists.
The vast majority of voters chose independence, regardless of whether the turnout was low, as citizens against secession boycotted the polls.
According to the Georgian authorities, about 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting at polling stations in the region through violent clashes.
On Friday evening, pro-corruption groups set up camps outside to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration continued, but was forced to take another course.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who participated in the separatist protest along with his wife, said there was no hope that Catalana would gain independence in the future.
"Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents weeping for joy that they would have the opportunity to vote, but now we are stuck," he said.
Despite the recent December local elections, however, a vital victory, even though with a narrow result, the pro-Pallitist parties have found it difficult to guard the hovin this year, as many of their most popular leaders have either voluntarily fled the country or are in a detention awaiting trial for their role in organising the referendum and declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who was recording the protest in his police aid phone, said the conflict was fed by both sides of the street.
"The situation is becoming increasingly tense," he said.
On Saturday, Orol Yunqueras, one of the nine Catholic leaders who are in prison pending trial since last year, said he would run in the elections for the European Parliament next year.
"The adoption of candidacy for European elections is the best way to reject the corruption of democratic values and the oppression that has been made by the Spanish government", he said.
London: Some people arrested after car crashing into the house
Three men between the ages of 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after a car was hit several times with a house in London.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday, about 6:30 BST.
Detective Bob Blackmings said damage to the main gate and home itself.
An arrow is thought to have been thrown into the direction of the car at a certain time.
Mega's hit pardons Livington a 1-0 victory against Rangers
Dolly Mengga's First Gollington won victory
The team, coming from a category below, Livington surprised Ringers by causing Steven Gerard to lose his second in 18 matches as team coach from Ibrox.
Dolly Mengga's strike proved crucial while the team of Gary Holt equated the second country's Hibernian point.
Gerard's team has not yet won a meeting outside the firm at Prejership, this season and next Sunday, will face Hearts, the gap with which eight points are.
But before, Rangers will be waiting at the house of Rapid Winna, in the valid match for Europe League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livington has extended the series of successive victories in six meetings, and coach Holt has not yet experienced defeat since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston loses cases in front of well - set opponents
The Holt team should have taken advantage many minutes before marking, as their direct attacks caused many problems.
Scott Robinson managed to pass but beat him weak in the gate, while then Alan Lithgowe hit off on the top of the slide after the head-on-sided by Craig Halettt.
The natives were willing to let Ringers play in front of them, knowing they could cause problems in standard shocks.
And that's how the goal was printed that set the meeting.
Rangers caused a blow of condemnation and Livington created space. Declan Gallarer and Robinson combined, creating the possibility of Menging, who struck and marked at the centre of the area.
By that moment, Rangers had dominated the ball holding, but local protection had resulted in unrecognizable results and portkeeper Liam Kelly had never been put to the test,
This way the game went on in the second part even though Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to make a wait.
Scott Pittman's kick stopped by Ringers' port, Allan McGregore, and Lithgowe hit off from another standard hit by Livington's.
The furniture regularly came to the Livingston area and was continually verified, while the two criminal claims - after Halettt's intervention to the incoming player, Glen Middleton, and another hand toucher - were not taken into consideration.
Feminal game from Livingston - analysis
Alaskar Lamont from BBC Scotland in Tony Macaron arena
An incredible performance and result for Livingston.
For a man, they played great, and they continued to exceed expectations in this growing dictatorship.
The style of the game and their team has not changed much since their return to the front, but a great credit belongs to Holt for the way it's evolved the team since his arrival.
He had many heroes.
Captain Halett was exceptional, leading a perfectly organised defense, while Mega kept Connor Goldson and Joe Warrall in trouble throughout the match.
However, the Rangers lacked inspiration.
Although in some cases they played very well under Gerard’s direction, they lacked quality.
The final pass--just once managed to pass opposing defences--and this is something that must serve as alarm for Ringers, who find themselves in the middle of the table.
Erdogan is expected with double feelings in Colony
Saturday (September 29th) was characterized by the blue sky's smile as Turkey and Germany's leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
This was the last day of President Erdogan's conservative visit to Germany - which was aimed at regulating relations between NATO allies.
They have fallen into controversy over issues such as human rights, media freedom and Turkey's EU membership.
Afterward, Erdogan headed to Colony to open a new giant mosque.
The city hosts the largest number of Turkish population outside Turkey.
For security reasons, police detained a crowd of 25,000 people in front of the mosque, but however many supporters came to the streets around to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan -- many of them Kurdish -- also raised their voice to condemn Erdogan's policies as well as the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
Opposition protests reflect the divisive capacity of a visitor to be worshipped as a hero by some Turks in Germany and despised as autocracies by others.
Dptford road accident: ciclist dies after impact by car
A scientist found death after he crashed into a car in London.
The accident took place near the cross of Bescord Street with Evelyn Street, a busy highway in Deputford, southeast of the city, about 10:15ST.
The driver stopped, and the suppliers came immediately, but the victim changed the scene.
The clash occurred several months after another hammer lost his life in an accident whose author left the country, which happened in Childers Street, about a mile from Saturday's accident.
The Metropolitan police said the officers were working to identify the person and call his family.
Roads have been closed, and buses have been notified to use other routes, while motor drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Prison Long High: Six hurt officers during rebellion
Six prison officers have been left injured during a riot in a high security prison for men, the Burg's office has said.
The rebellion erupted in HMP Long High in Worcesterrire around midnight: 30 BST on Sunday, and still continues.
The specialists at "Tornado" are called to control the riots, which include eight prisoners and which have been confined within a prison wing.
Officers have been treated on scene for some slight injuries on the face.
A Burt Service spokesman said: "The staff of specialized prison training has been mobised to keep the incident currently taking place in HMP Long High.
Six staff members have received injuries treatment.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we have made it clear that the responsible men will refer to the police and can receive an extension of prison sentences."
HMP Long Martin houses over 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison director had been subjected to hospital treatment after an attack by one of the prisoners.
And in October last year, officers of the peacekeeping police were called into prison to take control of a serious situation, where the personnel were attacked with blarards.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phhoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with rapid flooding (which could be an advantage for drought zones)
While tropical depression often strikes Arizona, it is most likely that the first days of the next week, as Hurricane Rosa’s remaining strength passes through the Southwest desert, spreading rapid flooding.
The National Meteorological Service has already issued immediate warnings for the moon-day and Tuesday from the Western Arizona to the southern and eastern Nevada, Southeast California and Utah, including the Phoenex, Flagstaff, Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take the lead in Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching Monday's low hours with rain clouds.
The National Meteorological Service in Foenix said in a newspaper that only "ten tropical cylons have received storm status or tropical depression in a 200-mile radius of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of Arizona border."
The most recent models of the National Uranan Centre predict between 2 and 4 inches of rain, with an isolated amount of up to 6 inches on the Arizona border.
In other desert areas in Southwest, including Central Rockies and the Great Bassen, the rainfall is expected to be at level 1 to 2 inches, while in isolated areas their total total amount could reach 4 inches.
For areas outside the risk of rapid flooding, Rosa's rainfall can be a blessing, as the region has been hit by drought.
Although the floods pose a serious concern, some of these droughts may be beneficial, as Southwest is currently facing drought conditions.
According to the U.S. Centre for Herald Monitoring, less than 40 per cent of Arizona is facing extreme droughts in the second category", Wether.com reported.
Initially, Hurricane Rosa will hit the Mexican peninsula Baja California Peninsula.
Rosa, still with hurricane power on Sunday morning, with high speeds at 85 miles per hour, is 365 miles south of Putina Eugenia, Mexico, and is moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm is facing cold waters over the Pacific, so it is losing power.
Consequently, hurricanes are expected to strike Mexico with tropical storms in the afternoon or Monday evening.
Rainfalls on some areas of Mexico can be strong, presenting significant flood hazards.
"The rainfall of an average level of 3 to 6 inches is expected from Baja California to northwestern Sonora, which can reach up to 10 inches", Weether.com reported.
Later Rosa will move north through Mexico, in the treatment of a tropical storm, before reaching the border with Arizona in the early morning hours of Tuesday as a tropical depression, which will then be moving through Arizona, reaching the southern Uth Tuesday evening.
"The main danger expected by Rosa or its consequences are strong rainfall in Baja California, in northwest Sonora and in the southwestern US desert", the National Urans Centre said.
These clouds are expected to cause sudden floods of danger to life, waste leaks in deserts, and landfalls on mountain terrain.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrests for Missing Murders on Forced
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old have been arrested as suspected of remaining assassinations in the attempt, following the injuries of a 16-year-old knife in Somersets.
Adolet was found wounded in the Missomer Norton area, about 2:00 a.m. BST on Saturday.
He was accompanied to the hospital, where he currently is in "stable" state.
According to Avon and Sommerset police, a 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old were arrested at night in the Radstock area.
Officers have called for the presentation of anyone who may have picked up by the film phone from the event.
Trump says Kavanugh "has faced disgrace and anger" of Democratic Party
"A pro judge Kavanugh's vote is a vote against the ruthless and cruel tactics of the Democratic Party", Trump said at a rally at Western Virginia Whiteling.
Trump said Kavanugh "has been faced with the humiliation and anger" of the Democratic Party during the process of its appointment.
Kavanugh testified before the Congress on Thursday, denying with conviction and emotion the accusations of Christine Blasey Ford that he had assaulted her sexually decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also gave a witness during the hearing over her charge.
On Saturday, the president said that on that day "American communities testified to the greatness, character and courage" of Kawanugh.
"A pro-making vote by Judge Kawanaugh is a pro-tax vote for one of our most enlightened lawyers of our time, a lawyer with a record public service," he said in front of the crowd of supporters in Western Virginia.
The president indirectly cited Kawanaugh's appointment during the talk on the importance of republic's participation in medium-term elections.
"Four weeks separate us from one of the most important elections in our lives.
I won't run, but I'm contributing," he said.
"That's why I'm doing so much effort and I'm struggling for excellent candidates."
Trump argued the Democrats have a mission to do "stabilization and blockade".
The first major procedural vote by Senate on Kawanaugh's appointment is expected to take place no later that Friday, CNN, assistant of a GOPP senior leader, has said.
Hundreds killed by earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, while figures are expected to increase
At least 384 people were killed, many of whom were consumed by the huge waves that crashed on the beaches, when Indonesia's Sulanes Island was hit by an earthquake and tsunami, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the town of Palu on Friday, when waves of heights up to 18 feet (18 m) crashed to the shore at sunset, devouring the deaths of many and destroying everything.
The tsunami followed an earthquake of 7.5.
"On the other day, when the threat of tsunami arose, people were still carrying out their regular activities on the beach, and therefore they didn't run immediately and killed his victim", Suto Pourpo Nugro, spokesman for disaster prevention agency, said at a news conference.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, he took cars, brains, houses, struck everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had passed the open sea at an speed of 800km/h7 km (497 miles an hour), before hitting the coastal line.
Some went up to the trees to escape tsunamis and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Peru.
Air photos published by the disaster agency showed a series of destroyed buildings and shops, distorted bridges, and collapsed and a glass surrounded by water.
The floods continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
The earthquake line was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indosian Agency for Appreciating Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that energy generated by Friday's massive earthquake was about triple the power of the atomic bomb dropped in Hiroshima during World War II.
The city's geographic position, located at the edge of a long, narrow bay, may have doubled the power of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as "great times" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
Some corpses were found trapped under the ruins of destroyed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people had been injured and 29 were gone.
Nugroho said the number of victims and damage rates may be much larger along the coastal line (90 km) north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the quake epicenter.
Communication networks "was completely interrupted without any warning" by Donggala, Nugroho said.
That area has over 300,000 residents", the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that staff and volunteers were traveling towards affected areas.
"This has already turned into a tragedy, but the situation can get worse even," he said.
On Saturday, the agency was sharply criticised after not giving announcement of Palu's tsunami attack, despite the officials' statement that the waves had come at the time the warning was given.
In amateur films distributed in social media, a man on the upper floor of a building may be heard warning passersby on the street about the coming of the tsunami with loud shouts.
Within minutes, a wave blows ashore, carrying buildings and cars.
Reuters failed to verify immediately the authenticity of the film.
Earthquakes and tsunami caused a massive power break, which cut communication across Palu, making it difficult to co-ordinate rescue efforts on the part of authorities.
The army has begun sending cargo planes with aid from Yakarta and other cities, authorities said, but evacuated persons continue to have great needs for food and other basic needs.
The city airport has been reopened only for rescue efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Wido was expected to visit the evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The number of victims from the tsunami in Indonesia amounts to over 800.
The situation is pretty tough.
While the World Vision staff from Donggala has arrived without trouble in the town of Palu, where workers are taking refuge in the tarpousline shelter in their office's courtyard, they witnessed scenes of destruction along the way, Mr. Doseba said.
"They told me they had seen many destroyed houses," he said.
The situation is pretty tough.
Although relief groups began serious efforts to move humanitarian aid mechanisms, some complained that foreign personnel with vast expertise were forbidden to travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, financing, supplies and external staff can begin operating only if the disaster area is declared a national disaster zone.
This hasn't happened yet.
"This is still a catastrophe at the regional level," said Aulilia Arian, a spokesman for the Red Cross in Indonesia.
"After the government says "O.K., this is a national disaster", we can seek national aid, but that status has not been given yet".
The second night after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami in Palau, friends and family of missing persons still had hope that the case of their loved ones would be of little miracles that ever occur in case of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was taken from a well.
On Saturday, rescue forces released a woman who had been left under the debris for two days, with her mother’s body at her side.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian National Paramunism team, had trained two missing paratroopers for Asian Games, which were closed earlier this month in Indonesia.
Some of the other people trapped in the "Raa Roa" hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
"As an old professional in the field of divination, I am very emotionally charged," he said.
Mr. Gendon recalls how in the hours following the flow of the "Raa Roa" hotel news among the presumism community, he had been desperately trying to write to his competitors from Palalu, who were participating in the festival at the beach.
However, his messages ended with only a sign of a gray degree, instead of two blue - colored signs.
"I think that means the messages were not sent," he said.
Thieves steal $1,750 during the refurbishment of a Newport bank in Levee
According to a press statement by the Newport Police Director on Friday morning, some thieves have stolen $1.750 from a Brink worker who was renegotiating a bank in the Newport New York City.
The vehicle leader had been emptying a bank in a entertainment centre and trying to distribute more money, Detective Dennis wrote in a statement.
While he was busy with work, someone "caught running from behind Brian's employees" and stole a bag of money destined for handover.
According to the statement, witnesses had seen several suspects leaving the country, but police have not specified the number of persons involved in the incident.
Any person who has information about their identity should contact the Newport police in the 859-2-2-680 number.
Canye West: Recorder changes name in Ye
The rapper Kanye West will change his name to Yee.
Announcing the change on Twitter Saturday, he wrote: "I officially known as Kanye West".
The 41-year-old West has been called with the Ye nickname, and has used it as the title of his eighth album, which emerged in the market in June.
The change has come shortly before his arrival at Saturn Day Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album "Yanjed".
He will replace singer Arana Grande in the show, which cannot come for "spiritual reasons", the show creator said.
As a shortcut to his current art name, West has been expressed in the past that the word has religious significance for him.
"I think "ye" is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means "t," West said earlier this year, talking about his album title with radio producer Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
I went from Canye, which means "one" in just "Ye," which is the reflection of our good, of our evil, of our confusion, of all things.
Album is more of a reflection of what we are."
He's one of many famous hackers who have changed their name.
Sean Coms has been known differently as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he said he preferred the name Love and Brother Love.
A former West co-ordinator, JJY-Z, has done as he did either with or without a split visa and capital letter.
Mexico's AlMLO vows not to use military against civilians
Mexico's newly-elected president, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has pledged that he will never use military force against civilians as the country approaches 50-year-old member of a bloody revolution against students.
On Saturday at Tlaelolco Plaza, Lopez Obrador pledged that "will never use the army to oppress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, military troops set fire on peaceful demonstrators in the square, killing an estimated 300 people at a time when the students' left movements were moving all over Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support Mexican youths by granting students monthly subsidies and opening more public-free universities.
He has indicated that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities push young people towards criminal gangs.
US should double financing for artificial intelligence
As China becomes increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double the amount spent on research in this area, the investor and artificial intelligence expert Kai-Fi Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments have come after various parts of the US government have announced artificial intelligence discoveries, despite the US lack a general strategy for artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China has announced its plan last year: within 2030, it aims to take the first place for innovation in the field of artificial intelligence.
"The double budget for research in the field of artificial intelligence would be a good start, as other countries are still very behind the US and we are looking for the next major discovery in this area," said Lee.
The double financing could double the chances that the large ranks in the field of artificial intelligence take place in the US, Lee said in an interview for the CNBC this week.
Lee, author of the book "Supperpowers of artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and New Order", which was published this month by Hughton Mifflin Harcourt, is executive director of Synovation Ventures, who has invested in one of the most prominent artificial intelligence companies in China, China's Face+.
In the 1980s, at the "Carnegie Mellon" university, he created an artificial information system that also passed to the leading American player in Othelo, and then worked as an executive director near Microsoft Research and as president of the Google branch in China.
Lee praised the American government's earlier competitions for technology, such as the Academy of Robotics for Advanced Research Projects in the Protection Fuca, and asked when the next contest would be held in order to help identify new visions.
Lee said that often, researchers in the US have to work hard to get grants from the government.
"It's not China that is turning the academic leaders away; it's the corporations," said Lee.
Over the past few years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have employed bright minds from universities to work in the field of artificial intelligence.
Lee said changes in immigration policy can help the US to boost its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I think that the green cards should be automatically given to persons with the doctor's title in the field of artificial intelligence", he said.
In July 2017, the State Council of China issued a plan for the development of the New Society of Artifial Intelligence.
The National Foundation for Nature Sciences in China offers financing for individuals in academic institutions, just like the National Foundation of Science and other government organisations provide money for American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
At the beginning of this year, the US Department of Defence established a Joint Center of Artifiency, which is expected to include partners from industry and academy, and the White House declared the establishment of the Special Infection Committee.
Meanwhile, this month the DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called "AI next".
As for NNSF, it currently invests over $100 million annually for research in the field of artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, US legislation aimed at creating a National Security Commission for Artial Intelligence has not been implemented for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on country name change
On Sunday, Macedonia's people voted in a referendum to decide whether its name would be changed to "Republic of Northern Macedonia", a movement that could resolve a dozens of years-old dispute with Greece, which had blocked its efforts for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, thinks that its northern neighbour's name constitutes a claim on its territory, and has vetoed its NATO and EU membership.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change could compromise the ethnic identity of most of Macedonia's population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has indicated that he will not vote in the referendum, and a boycott campaign has questioned whether turnout in the elections will reach the 50 per cent needed for the referendum's vulnerabilities.
The question in the referendum ballot sheet reads: "Are you pro-one for NATO and EU membership through accession of the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that for Macedonia, as one of the countries created by the breakup of Yugoslavia, it is a price worth paying to achieve membership in facilities such as the EU and NATO.
"I'm here today to vote for the future of the country, for Macedonia's young, so they can live free under the umbrella of the European Union, as it means a safer life for all of us," 79-year-old Olivera Georgiyevska said in Skopje.
Although the referendum has no binding power, a sufficient number of parliament members have indicated they will refrain from keeping the vote's outcome to make it crucial.
The name change requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state election commission said no irregularities had been reported by 1:00 in the afternoon.
However, voter turnout was only 16 per cent, compared to 34 per cent in the latest parliamentary elections in 2016, where 66 per cent of registered voters cast their vote.
"I came to vote for the sake of my children, we have room in Europe," said Gjor Tanevski, 62, voters in the capital in Skopje.
Macedonia's Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dusko cast their ballot in the referendum for the change of Macedonia's name, which would pave the way for the country's membership in NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
In front of parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov was preparing a small scene and was setting chairs in front of tents raised by referendum boycotters.
"We are pro NATO and the EU, but we want to join with the head above, not entering through the back door", Kavadarkov said.
"Our country is poor, but we have dignity.
If they don't want us by name Macedonia, we can go to other states like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Azitic integration".
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring much needed investments for Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 per cent.
"I think the overwhelming majority will be pro, as more than 80 per cent of our citizens are pro EU and NATO", Zaev said after throwing his vote.
He said a positive result would "confirm our future".
According to a poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research, about 30 per cent to 43 per cent of voters would participate in the referendum - a figure below the necessary level of turnout.
Another survey conducted by Macedonian television Telma found that 57 per cent of participants were planning to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 per cent were indicated to vote pro.
For a successful referendum, the turnout rate must be 50 per cent plus one vote.
Failure to make the referendum would give the first strong blow to the pro-European government's policy since its ruling arrival in May last year.
See: Sergei Aguero of Manchester City passes through all of Brighton protection to mark
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sternling stood up for the entire Brighton defense at Manchester City's 2-0 June victory on Saturday, at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguro made his goal in the 65th minute seem extremely easy.
Argentina's shooter took a midway course at the beginning of the action.
He walked through three Brighton defenders, before he walked into the open field.
Next, Aguero found himself surrounded by four green shirts.
He crossed a guard and passed some more at the speed of the Brighton area.
Then he went to the left, where he was at Sternling.
The English striker used his exit in the area to track the Aguero ball, which struck with the right and crossed the portkeeper Matthew Ryan by throwing the ball at the right end of the net.
"Aguro is suffering from a leg problem", City manager Pepe Gourdola told reporters.
"We found that he would play around 55 or 60 minutes.
Here's what happened.
We were lucky he scored goals at that moment."
But it was Stterling who gave them the initial advantage in the Friday League match.
This goal was marked in 29 minutes.
During that action, Aguero took the ball in the Brighton semif.
He verticaled nice for Laroy Sane on his left arm.
Sanan Avanco took some steps before he could follow up to Sternling on the second pillar.
The blue striker took the ball into the net and then slipped outside border lines.
City will face Hofenheim in the valid challenge for the phase of the League of Championships, Thursday at 12:55 in Rhein-Nackar-Arena in Sinesim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to preserve the role of "humplification" against Rockies
With the Nationals removed from the chance to reach the administrators, there was no reason to impose another beginning.
But Scherzer, who is always competitive, hopes to be given the opportunity to mark against Colorado Rockes, but only if there is the possibility of the platform for Rockies, who have an advantage over a match to Los Angeles Dodgets in the National League of West.
Rockies reached at least one chance for the platform through winning 5-2 to National on Friday evening, but are still trying to take over the division title.
"Even though we're playing without any motivation, we can at least score by recognizing the atmosphere of fans here in Dayton, but the fact that the opposition team will play at the highest level against which we can face throughout the year.
Why didn't I want to play at such a challenge?"
The Nationals have not yet announced who will be the title on Sunday, but are reportedly inclined to leave Scherzer in such a situation to start the meeting.
Scherzer, who would be showing 34 as the title, conducted a training session Thursday and could be presented on Sunday, which could be a normal vacation day for him.
Washington's player, who hunts with the right to the right, is 18-7 with an ERA 2,53 ERA and 300 "tricketouts" at 220/3 shots of this season.
Trump gathers Western Virginia in the mine
The president indirectly referred to the situation in connection with his selection for the Supreme Court, Bret Kavanugh, before speaking about the importance of the republican participation in medium-term elections.
"The speaker is crucial to everything we've done so far.
Five weeks separate us from one of the most important choices in our lives.
This is one of the biggest elections -- I'm not running, but I'm contributing, and that's why I'm trying so hard to fight for excellent candidates," he said.
Trump went on, "You see this terrible group of radical Democrats, you see what's going on right now.
And they have decided to regain power in any way, you see the humiliation of their abominations.
They don't want to know who they hurt, who they're pressing for power and control, that's what they want, power and control, but we're not going to give it to them."
The Democrats, he said, have a mission to carry out "the resistance of the blockade".
"And you have seen this in the last days," he said, calling the Democrats "ridden, cruel, filthy, and disloyal".
He referred to by name as Democratic Chief of the Senate Justice Committee, Dianne Feinstein, which aroused frustration by the audience.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you spread the document?
Uh, uh, what?
No, no, I... wait a while... - Her body language was pretty bad--was the worst language of the body I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer an "open shop".
She's non-tolerant to what they say.
When the Momentum activists in my local party voted a motion of disbelief to me, I was not quite surprised.
After all, I'm not the first of the deputies of the Labour Party to be told they're not welcome--all this because we say what we think.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan was treated similarly, simply because he firmly rejected antisemism.
In my case, the motion of disbelief was a criticism of me for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
Regarding the importance of a responsible economic policy regarding national security and Europe, ironicly similar issues that Jeremy contends with earlier leaders.
The report on the meeting of the People's Party in Novingham East said that "we want the meetings to be included and productive".
For the most part of my eight-year period as the local deputy of the Labour Party, GC meetings have been done like that.
Unfortunately, the meetings don't have their previous tone, and the promise of a "soft and sweeter" policy has long been forgotten, if it's ever existed.
It has become increasingly evident that conflicting views are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and every opinion is tried on the basis of its compliance by the party leadership.
This began a little while after Jeremy became a leader, while colleagues with whom I thought that sharing similar political views began to claim that I would take a 180 degrees turn and maintain attitudes with which I would never have agreed - whether on national security or on the EU's sole market.
Every time I speak in public -- no matter what I say -- the criticisms in social media, with people seeking my dismissal, denominate the politics of the centre, they tell me I shouldn't be part of the Labour Party.
And that's not all I've been hurt by.
I am aware that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, since comments about me tend to be a political nature.
I'm fascinated by professionalism and the determination of colleagues who face gender and racial discrimination every day, but don't break.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is normalisation of levels of violence.
Last week, Jeremy Corbiin said the Labour Party should feed a culture of tolerance.
In fact, we are no longer an "open shop", and with every motion of trust and any change of election rules, the party becomes increasingly closed.
Over the past two years, I've been often advised to lower my head, not to be so loud, and that's how everything's gonna be okay.
But that's not why I got into politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a school student, motivated by the lack of Thitcher's government that led to my class's failure to a general school, I have been trying to play for better public services for those who need it -- be a member of a local council or government minister.
I've never hidden my policy, not even in the last elections.
Everyone in Nostham East had clearly pointed out to my political positions and points of opposition to the current leadership.
For all who voted the motion on Friday, I mean that the country is only heading towards a Brex that will affect families, businesses and our public services, I cannot understand the desire to spend time and energy with my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact, the only message I want to pass does not refer to Nottingham Organisation, but my voters, whether or not of the Labour Party: I'm proud of being in your service, and I promise you that no threat to download or political favour will prevent me from acting in your best interest.

83: 38 - 17 Melrose — An Unconquerable Eye Takes the List
The two delayed efforts may have somehow changed the final outcome, but there is no doubt that Aaron deserved to triumph in the extremely fun Tenent's Premierip game today.
Now they head the lists as the only unconventional team among ten teams.
In the end, it was their wonderful protection and courage to take risks that assured the local team, and coach Peter Murchie was absolutely right to be pleased.
"We've shown ourselves at every game, and we're still invincible, so normally I'm happy," he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "We want to congratulate the Ayr team, who took more risks than we are."
Grant Anderson's attempts at the 14th minute, turned into golf by Frazier Climo, passed Aur to the advantage, but a yellow card to the Scottish representative Rory Hughs, came to this challenge from Warren, allowed Melros to display superior numbers and Jaotot Bafi, got a non-fifted top.
Climo increased Ayr's advantage with a penalty, while shortly before the completion of the first part, he marked and turned a individual action into a goal, leading to the 17-5 for Ayr in front of the break.
But Melrose started the second half and Patrick Anderson's attempt, turned into a goal by Bagggot, reduced the difference to five points.
Then there was a long break due to the serious damage of Rugova Knott, who left with the barracks, and after restarting the game, Ari increased the result through a Stafford McDowll, marked by Climo.
Ayr's captain, Blair Macapherson, was later punished with yellow cardon, and Melrose again used the fact that they had a more player, with an effort-drivened golf attempt by Bruce Colvine, at the end of a hard-cut cut piece.
However, locals were restored, and when Streen Huchkinson was punished with yellow cardon because it prevented Climo, without the ball, from the penalty line, Macherson made "tuch Dow", after the back of the three-room (Mamaul) that was traveling ahead.
Climo scored and did the same thing almost after the rerun of the game, as Kyle Rowe seized the ball hit by David Armstroling in the area and brought ahead the attack player (flanker) Gregor Henry, for the fifth attempt of the local team.
"Still Game Star" seems committed to the new career in the restaurant industry
The star of "Still Game" Ford Kieran seems determined to enter the hotel industry after it was found that he has been appointed director of a licensed chain of restaurants.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis's role in the famous BBC show, with co-author and co-prostagonist and his long-term partner in the comedy world, Greg Hempheim.
The couple have announced that the nine season will be the last for this show, and it seems China is planning its life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is director of Adrifton Limed.
The actor refused to comment on history, even though a source for Scott Sun suggested that Kiernan was trying to get into the Glasgou restaurant's "blimmering industry".
Bolivia without getting out of the sea hopes the Court to make its way to the Pacific.
Mariners patrol an improvisation of the navy headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings have set up the blue ocean flag.
On sea bases from Lake Titica in Amazon, the motto is, "The Earth is our property.
His recovery is a task."
To Bolivia without going to sea, the memory of taking over the Chile coast in a bloody conflict for resources during the 19th century is still quite alive -- as well as the desire to sail once again across the Pacific Ocean.
Now these hopes are far more likely than they have ever been for decades, while on October 1st, Bolivia awaits the International Court of Justice's decision after a five-year review.
"Bolivia is characterized by hockey, the spirit of unity and calm, and, of course, is looking forward to the result positively," Roberto Calzadella, a Bolivian diplomat, said.
Many Bolivians will attend the government's session on large screens across the country, hoping The Hague's triunal will decide in favour of Bolivia that -- after decades of incorrect discussions - Chile is obliged to hold talks to give Bolivia a sovereign territory out of the sea.
For Evo Morales, Bolivia's cardiology president -- who faces a cross-border battle for obtaining the second term in next year's elections -- Monday's decision is very important.
"We are very close to restoring into the Pacific Ocean", he pledged at the end of August.
But some analysts agree that there are very few likely that the court will decide in favour of Bolivia -- and that, even if it were, they would change very little.
The UN elite body in the Netherlands does not have the tiger to give another state part of Chile's territory, and has indicated it will not decide the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the government is reaching out with a decision only six months after the hearing of final arguments shows that the issue "was not complicated", said Paz Zárate, an international law expert.
And instead of helping Bolivia's cause, the events of the last four years could have penalized it.
"The issue of access to the sea has been compromised by the current Bolivian administration", Zárata said.
Morally aggressive rhetoric has eliminated any trace of loving - kindness left on Chileans, she suggested.
At a certain point, Bolivia and Chile will continue the talks, but it will be extremely difficult to hold discussions after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltzé, representative of Bolivia at The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was surprisingly quick.
Monday's day will offer Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance "to end the 139-year dispute, with the benefits of intermission," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - still one of the most popular presidents of Latin America - was using the sea issue for political interest.
"Bolivia will never give up on its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
"The decision is an opportunity to understand that we must leave the past behind."
North Korea says nuclear dissertation will not be carried out as long as it cannot trust the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Young Ho says his nation will never commit the first deliberation by nuclear weapons, as long as it cannot trust Washington.
Newly giving a talk Saturday before the UN General Assembly.
He urged the United States to keep promises made during a summit in Singapore among leaders of rival states.
His comments come at a time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeii seems to be on the verge of the resurrection of nuclear diplomacy until now "shut", less than three months after Singapore with Kim Jong Un of North Korea.
According to Ree, hopes that the ongoing sanctions and opposition of the US to the declaration of the end of the Korean War will make North Korea kneeling on its knees are meaningless expectations.
As long as Pyongyang does not take the first step to make important demineralization movements, Washington is reluctant to accept the statement.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism regarding the seriousness of Pyyongang's goal to attract his arsenal, which the state most likely views as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeii is planning to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
The fashion shows in Paris reveal the latest line of giant hats that will soon come to your city streets
If you want to enrich your hat collection or to secure full protection from sunlight, do not seek further.
The designers Valentino and Thomas Browne introduced a series of bizarre giant hats for their SS19 collection in the backyard, which left all the designers in the Moda Week in Paris.
Explicitless hats have been taken and shipped to the Institute this summer, and these designers have produced their surprise designs.
Valentino’s special creation was an extremely extra bean’s hat, decorated with a wide haven of details similar to the feathers surrounding the model’s head.
Other great accessors included saddle-beans decorated with stones, a witch hat, and even an annas--but they were not made to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of strange masks--at times for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks were blistering lips, and they were more similar to Hannibal Lecter than they were of coture.
One creation was similar to the dive equipment, complete with the air pipe and water glasses, while another was like a bowl of molten ice.
And if you like to follow this brave fashion, you're lucky.
The fashion analysts predict that the giant hats can soon come to your city’s streets.
The train of giant hats has followed him to La Bomba, the cap of straw with two broad legs, which we've seen all of us, starting from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkoski.
The cult market that was hidden behind the extremely immoral hat that she received in social media produced another major structure in the backyard--a beach bag of straw, almost as big as the bathroom model holding it.
The light - colored orange bulb, decorated with raffias and a pair of white leather on the top, was the most special creation of the Jacquemus collection in the Paris Moda Week.
The style of famous Lue Armmitage personalities confessed to FEMAIL: "The next day I plan to see giant beach hats and bags on the streets of the cities - as designer has left a cap so large that it would be hard to ignore demand for major accesss".
John Edward: The fundamental linguistic capacity for global citizens
Private schools in Scotland hold record for academic expertise, and this has continued in 2018 with another set of excellent results on exams, further reinforced even by individual and collective success in sports, art, music, and other fields.
With more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scocz Council of Private School (SCIS), attempt to provide the highest level of service for students and their parents.
Private schools aim to prepare their students for further education of higher levels, for their chosen career and their country as global citizens.
As a educational sector that can draft and implement an adjusted educational course, we are witnessing how the branch of modern languages continues to be a popular and popular choice in schools.
Nelson Mandel said, "If you speak to someone in a language he understands, your words are in your ears.
If you speak to him in your own tongue, your words will go to his heart."
Those words are a powerful reminder that we cannot rely solely on English when we want to create relationships with people from foreign lands.
From the results of this year's latest tests, we can confirm that languages are conducting results lists, with the highest degree of calories among private schools.
A total of 68 per cent of students who have studied foreign languages have received the maximum A.
The data collected by 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 per cent of students had received peak A in Mandarin, while 72 per cent of those who studied German, 69 per cent of those who studied French and 63 per cent of those who studied for Spanish, also participated.
This shows that private schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as one of the vital capacities that will undoubtedly be needed by children and young people in the future.
Currently, the branch of foreign languages is considered as important as the STEM branches (i.e. technology, engineering, and mathematics) in the courses of private schools and beyond.
A 2014 study by the United Kingdom Commission for Employment and Skills found that among the main challenges employers faced for the completion of vandals, 17 percent were linked to lack of language skills.
As a result, language skills are becoming increasingly necessary for young people to prepare for their future careers.
With the increase of workplaces dedicated to the possession of foreign languages, these skills are essential to a globalized world.
Despite the career that a person chooses, if he has learned a second language, he will have real advantages in the future as master of such a long - term ability.
The ability to communicate directly with strangers will automatically position a multilanguage person over competitors.
According to a YouTubeGov survey, which included more than 4,000 adults from the United Kingdom in 2013, 75 per cent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation, and French was the only foreign language spoken by a 2D per cent of people.
That is why investing in language is important for modern - day children.
The skill of many languages, especially the possession of language of developing countries, will give children a better chance of employment.
Within Scotland, every school will be different as to languages taught in them.
Some schools will focus on more classical languages, while others will provide languages that are considered the most important of the United Kingdom in the perspective of 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s interest, there will always be a range of languages you can choose in private schools, with logistics staff made up of field experts.
The Scottish private schools are dedicated to offering a school environment that will prepare the children and "mamise" them with the necessary skills to succeed, however the future is.
In these times it cannot be denied that in a global business environment, languages continue to have vital importance for the future of the country, so this should be reflected in education.
Modern languages should indeed be viewed as "war of international communication".
Private schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and flexibility for Scotland's youth.
Ill the fans fall.

LeBron is expected to abuse with Lakers Sunday in San Diego
Waiting is almost over for fans who were waiting to see LeBron James at his first game for the Log Angelies Lackers.
Lacker's coach, Luke Walton, has announced that James will play the pre-seon opening game on Sunday against the Danube Nugges, in San Diego.
But it's not yet known how many minutes he'll play.
"It will be more than 1 and less than 48", Walton said on the official website of Lakers.
Lacker's correspondent wrote in Tweter that, most likely, James will play for a limited number of minutes.
After training early this week, James was asked about his plans for Lacker's six-star game program.
"I don't need matches before the season in this stage of my career to be prepared," he said.
Trump gathering time in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump starts a series of ethical gatherings today at Wheling, Western Virginia.
This will be the first collection of five such scheduled to be held next week, including stops in friendly areas involving Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the adoption vote put on hold for his selection to fill the blank seat at the Supreme Court, Trump aims to establish support for the upcoming medium-term elections, as republics risk losing control in Congress when voting in November.
What time does Trump gathering take place today in West Virginia, and how do we follow it online?
The Trump residence in Whiteling, West Virginia, is scheduled to be held at 7 pm.
You can follow Trump's gathering in Western Virginia online below, through direct transmission to YouTube.
Trump is likely to address this week's hearing hearing sessions at the Bret Kavanugh Supreme Court, which was tense because of charges of his rude sexual conduct, with the expected vote of confirmation from the Senate remained suspended for a week while the FBI conducted the investigation case.
But the primary goal of these numerous gatherings is to help the Republicans get a hot start ahead in the November elections.
Therefore, President Trump's campaign staff said these five gatherings in next week are meant to "give energy to volunteers and supporters as the republics try to protect and expand the majority they hold in the Senate and the House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"The Congress Committee is so important to its agenda that the president will travel to as many states as we look to the busy campaign season," a spokesman for the Trump campaign, who did not want to be identified, said to Reuters.
Planned to develop at Wesbanco Arena in Whiteling, today's evening rally can bring supporters from "Oio and Pennsylvania and cover by the news media in Pittsburgh," according to the Western Virginia news agency "Metro News".
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump visits West Virginia, the state where he won more than 40 per cent per cent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican Union for West Virginia candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is behind the polls.
"It is not a good sign for Morris that the president should come and try to give him a push in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of Western Virginia, according to Reuters.
Kupa Ryder 2018: US team showed willingness to fight while keeping hope alive running to races on Sunday
After three single seasons, the remaining four for Sunday afternoon, may be what this Ryder Cup needed.
This momentum swing, is a completely created sport concept, but a concept where players truly believe and never more in such competitions.
But where can we say that this momentum is now felt?
"They had a six-point split that has now gone to four, so we can say that a kind of momentum has been created to some extent," Jordan Spieth said as he closed the day.
Europe certainly has advantage of the four points ahead, when it stays in play, and 12 points.
As Spieth claims, Americans hope they're in their favor and have a lot of things to be encouraged, especially from the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together the whole day, where three of the four possible points got off.
Spieth has been ruthless since he started shooting to the pit and leading his example.
The party's applause increased as the round came, putting golf ball with a slight blow to bring the match to equality, when he and Thomas were first two points after two rounds.
His easy shot, which gave them victory of the match in the 15th pit, was met with a similar roar, which shows he believes the American team is still not out of the race.
"You just have to work hard and worry about your fight," Sperth said.
All players left now.
18 holes to leave a trace.
The only players with more point than Spyth and Thomas in the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Flettwood, the unreported History of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but adorable European couple has accomplished four out of four and cannot be mistaken.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't catch a shot on the minimum on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided shooting at the minimum also on Sunday morning, Friday evening, and on the second shot Friday morning.
This result and the way their energy seems to flow to the excited and vice versa reinforces the idea that they are players to beat Sunday and that there will be no more known players than Flettwood and Molinari to seal a possible European victory, as the sun goes on "Leol Golf National".
Perhaps both of them at the same time in different holes.
However, statements about a European triumph are still premature.
Bubba Watson and Web Simpson managed very easily with Sergey Garcia, the hero of the four-day games in the morning, when he fell in a couple with Alex Noren.
A point on the minimum and two-seconds ahead placed the Spanish and Swedish in a pit where they had no chance of getting out.
On Sunday, however, no one will be there to help you get out of your pit.
Four and couples' games are so amazing to follow closely because of the interaction between couples, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and how they can change a strategy there.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has taken a significant lead by the final, but these four sessions also showed that the US team will still face some people, especially Statesides, have questioned this.
Europe heads 10-6 as it heads to the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe has an essential advantage on the final day of the Ryder Cup after being released from four games and with couples with a 10-6 advantage over the United States.
The inspiring couple Tommy Flettwood and Francesco Molinari headed the two win - win race against a Tiger Woods hard to boost their advantage at four points in Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, offered to take the trophy that was lost in Hazel two years ago, dominated the helpless American team in the morning double matches, leading to 3-1 results series.
The American team showed more resistance in fours game, winning two matches, but they could not reduce the difference.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points from Sunday's 12 individual matches to keep the trophy.
Flettwood is the first European player to win four order points, and he and Molinari, dubbed "Mollywood", after a sensational weekend are the second couple in the Ryder Cup history to win four points in their opening matches.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed in fours, they combined very well together to beat a helpless Woods and American beginner Bryson Dechamau with an even more dramatic score of 5&4.
Woods, who barely held the two meetings Saturday, displayed occasional explosions of greatness, but he has already lost 19 of his 29 matches in fours and pairs and 7 matches.
Justin Rose, stopped for the four-day game, returned to Henry Stanson's partner in the pair game, and got a 2&1 loss from Justin Justin and Brooks Kopka - ranked in the first and third place in the world.
Europe did not have everything in favor of a very beautiful and fresh day in southwest Paris.
Three times the professional winner Jordan Spring and Justin Thomas decided the difference that should be taken by Americans by two points Saturday.
They won a bold victory against Spanishman Jon Rahm and Ian Polulter in the fourth matches and later returned to beat Paul and Rory McElroy 4&3 in pairs after losing in the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup a team has turned the score behind a four-point gap in individual games, even though the Furyk host team needs only one equality to keep the trophy.
However, since he was the second best player in two days, a counterattack on Sunday seemed to go beyond their capacity.
North Korea Says It Will Not Disarme ‘ No One Without Faith ’
North Korean Foreign Minister told the United Nations that continuing sanctions on Saturday were cutting back on distrust of the United States, and the country would not give up on its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
Ree Yong Ho told the annual body from around the world of the General Assembly that North Korea has taken up "important measures showing good will" in the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, decommissioning areas where nuclear tests were held, and vowing that it would not increase the arsenals of nuclear weapons and technology.
"However, we are not seeing any answers to this matter from the US," he said.
"Without confidence in the US, our national security will have no confidence, and in these circumstances there is no way that we unilaterally disparate ourselves first."
While Rey reiterated the typical complaint in North Korea regarding Washington's resistance to a split approach "in the phase" for the process of nuclear dissolving where North Korea would be appreciated because of the gradual steps it has taken, its declaration seemed important because it does not rule out one nuclear fraction, as Penny has previously done.
Rey referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a summit held for the first time between an American president on duty and North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12th, where Kim pledged to work towards "the nuclear force of the Korean peninsula", while the Trump pledgeed for guarantees regarding North Korea's security.
North Korea has sought an official outcome of the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has indicated that Penian must first give up nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to ease strict international sanctions on North Korea.
"The US insists that the first "cult mechanisms" be carried out and increases pressure through sanctions to achieve their goal in a binding way, even rejecting 'the declaration of the end of the war'," Re said.
"The perception that sanctions can kneel us down is a sunny dream of people who are unaware of us.
But the problem is that continuing sanctions is deepening our distrust."
Ree did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, a statement the US leader stressed earlier this week in the United Nations.
Instead, the minister outlined three meetings between Kim and South Korea's leader, Moon Jae in the last five months and added: "If the side on the issue of nuclear migration would be South Korea and not the US, the process of nuclear dissolving in the Korean peninsula would not have come into this situation without a way."
However, the tone used in the new address was deeply different from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that setting up the US territory under target of Korean rockets was inevitable because "Z. President" Kim Trump called the "man" with a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who threatened last year to "break up fully" North Korea, thanked Kim for the courage shown in taking steps to cement, but said there is still much work to do, and how sanctions should continue to be active until North Korea's dematonation is performed.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn't have a timeframe for this, saying "If it takes two years, three years or five months -- that doesn't matter."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Penny for the steps taken.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Popeo said at the UN Security Council on Thursday that "The implementation of the Security Council sanctions should continue vigorously and without a ban until we realise the full and final implementation of nuclear disparities."
The Security Council has unanimously decided to raise sanctions for North Korea since 2006, in an effort to end the funding of the Penian nuclear programmes and ballistic missiles.
Popeo met with him back at the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Penny again next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeii has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not go well.
He left Penian in July, saying he had made progress, and only within a few hours of North Korea denounced him for doing "the Mafia style demands".
North Korea pledged at a meeting with Moon this month to freeze a missile area, and also a nuclear complex if the United States will take "the relevant measures".
He said Kim had told him that "the corresponding measures" he sought were security guarantees for which Trump pledged in Singapore and the movement towards normalising relations with Washington.
Harvard students get lectures about how to get enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has included all students to sleep more, in a bid to fight the growing culture of "machos' study" through the use of caffeine from these 'free'.
An academic noted that university students number one in the world often don't know when it comes to more basic things about how to take care of themselves.
Charles Chisisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham Hospital and Women's Hospital, prepared the class course, which believes to be the first of its kind in the US.
He was inspired to begin this course after giving a report on the impact of sleep deprivation over learning.
'At the end of him, came to me a girl and said, 'Why is this thing telling me now, in my last year?'
She said no one had told her before about the importance of sleep - which surprised me,' he said of the "The Telegraph".
The course, included in the programme for the first time this year, explains the basic elements of how well - meaning sleeping habits help academic and athletic productivity, and also how to improve their overall well - being.
Paul Barrira, professor of psychology at Harvard Medical School and director general of university medical services, said the university decided to introduce this course after stating that students were seriously deprived of sleep over the week.
An hour - long course involves a series of demanding tasks.
On one side is a view of a dorm room, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, athletes and books so that they can explain the effects of caffeine and lighting and how athletic productivity is influenced by sleep deprivation, and the importance of the routine of hours spent in bed.
In another part, participants explain how sleep deprivation in a long period of time increases the dangers of heart disease, depression, and cancer.
A camp map, with interducative icons, further encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
'We know that student behaviors won't change immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know -- as you have the right to know, health impact when I choose to smoke,' Prof. Cisesler added.
The culture of pride to pass "a night of ignorance" continues to exist, he said, adding that modern technology and growing pressure on students meant sleep deprivation was a ever - increasing problem.
The assurance that you've got enough sleep, a good quality, should be a ‘ secret formula ’ of students to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said--even to avoid weight gain, because sleep deprivation leads the brain into a hunger mode, making them feel hungry constantly.
Raymonde So, a 19-year-old bipolarian studying physical and chemical biology, helped Professor Ozisler in preparing the course, having attended one of his classes' classes last year at Harvard.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to turn him into a course for all the camp.
He hopes the next step, is to ask all of the secondary studies students to conclude a similar research programme before joining competitive institutions.
Prof Czeisler recommended that students have to set an hour of ringing that when they have to go to bed, and also that when they have to wake up, and that they are aware of the damaging effects of the " blue-deftures" that emerge from the electronics and LED lighting that can generate the biology of sleep outside the bed, which leads to problems in the voice of sleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Mega marks the sons of Gerard
Rangers received another shock as visitors as Dolly Mengga hit Steve Gerard's disbanded side of Livingston defeat 1-0 in Livington.
The team from Ibrox was seeking to record his first victory since the February 4-1 triumph in St. Johnstone, but the team of Gary Holt caused the second defeat in 18 games like coach, leaving his team eight points after the fugitive leader of Ladbrokes Prespiier, the Heart team.
Mega marked seven minutes before the first part was finished and with a deployment of the Ringers team, which seemed completely powerless to match.
While Ringers now falls to sixth place, Livingston climbs to third and is directly behind Hybernian for golf differences.
Rangers may expect to have more trouble as their wing player Callum Spencer was treated for a blow to the head after being hit by an likely object thrown by visitors.
Gerard conducted eight changes to his team, which passed Air to the semifinals of the Burfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt introduced the same 11th field, which snatched a stake last week and that he would be pleased with the way his well-organised team killed opponents in each round.
Rangers may have dominated the ball, but Livingston created more when he had it in his possession.
They should've only been marked for two minutes from the start of the meeting, when Mega gave Scott Pittmann to the route of the protected port by Alan McGrequer, was not used correctly by him shooting the ball out.
A long time between Keaghan Jacobs' sentence was found by Captain Craig Halettt, but his partner in defense, Alan Lithgow, just shot him out on the back of the gate.
Rangers took control of the game, but it seemed that they hoped more than they really believed in their game in the opposition zone.
Alfredo Morelos thought he deserved a penalty for a quarter-hour game as he and Steven Lawrence were hit, but the referee Steven Thomson didn't listen to Colombian's complaints.
Rangers managed to do two kicks at the gate in the first part, but former Ibrox reporter Liam Kelly, was not disturbed by Lasana Coulibal's head-to-head strike, and from Oville's unpowered shock.
While Liv's first goal in the 34th minute may have been in conflict with what was viewed in the field, but no one can deny that they deserved only for the disputes they showed.
Again Ringers failed in the long afters for Jacobs.
Scott Arfield didn't react when Declan Glagcher hit the ball to Scott Robinson, who preserved the tranquillity to pass Mega and to mark in a simple way.
Gerard acted on the break between parts as he replaced Koulibaly with Ryan Kent and this change nearly won't take an immediate effect, while the side followed for Morelos, but magnificently ran from his position to block it.
But Livingston continued to make guests play the way they wanted them, where Lithgow and Halkettt followed each other a long time.
Holt's team could extend its lead in the final phase, but McGrigor stood firm and denied Jacobs before Lithgow dropped out of a ball taken from the corner shot.
Rangers' deputy, Glenn Middleton, later claimed during the game for another penalty, while he was distracted with Jacobs, but again Thompson allowed the advantage.
Almanac: Geger’s Extinction
And now a page from our "Sunday Morning" almanage: September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, and toward VAZHDIM... the day that the next physicist Johannes Wilhamm "Han" was born in Germany.
Geinger developed a method of detection and measurement, a discovery that eventually led to the production of what is known as Geinger’s measurement.
A major pillar of science since then, the Geierger became a central pillar of popular culture as well, as in the 1950 movie "The Coronado Arts," with a career story of not professional scientists like Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geinger measure used to track radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put these cults, you can actually hear the effects of atoms released from mineral radioactiveism."
Evans: "Don't tell me, I'm really listening now!"
"Hans" Geger died in 1945, just days before his 63th birthday.
But his invention continues to live.
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system "to tell" bad cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to recognize and kill the bad cells
Vaxins teach immune systems to identify bad cells as part of treatment
Method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, changing them into labs
They can "degradate" a protein that is common in many types of cancer and then recover
A test vaccine is producing promising results in patients who have certain types of cancer.
A woman who was treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to identify bad cells noted that ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, changing them into labs so that they can "detail" -- a protein that is common in some types of cancer called HER2 -- and then reinventing these cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the National Institute for Cancer in Bethsda, Maryland, said, "Our results show us that we have to do with a highly promising vaccine."
HER2 "xin increases several types of cancer," including breast cancer, ovarians, lungs and thick bone, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach to extracting intimate cells from patients "to learn" them how to detect cancer cells has been functioning in dealing with a type of leukemia.
Kanye West showed up at a Pro-Trump rally, wearing a hat with the MANGA inscription, following his performance in SNL.
It didn't go right
Kanye West was clashed with protests in the studio during a broadcast on the "Saturday Night Live", following a story of disappointment where he commended American President Donald Trump and said he would run for this post in 2020.
After performing his third song for that night called "Gost Town", where he was holding a hat in his head that wrote "Make America Greta", he came to speak with strong tone against the Democrats and reaffirmed his support for Trump.
"How many times am I talking to a white person and they say to me, "How can you like Trump, he's a racist?"
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have fled America a long time ago," he said.
SNL began the performance with a paovid in the role of Matt Damon, where Hollywood star played the game of testimony to Brett Kavanauugh before the Senate Justice Commission on charges of sexual harassment set up by Christian Blaise Ford.
Although not transmitted, West's harsh speech records were loaded on social networks by the Association Chris Rock.
It remains unclear whether Rock was trying to mock West with that post or not.
West also complained to spectators that he had been in the background for a difficult time because of what he had decided on in his mind.
"They mistreated me in the back.
They told me, "Don't go to the stage with that hat on your head."
They mistreated me!
And then they tell me I'm fucked up," he said, according to Washington Examineer.
West came to say, "Do you want to see the wreck?" saying "You put my Superman's hat on your head, because that shows that no one can tell me what to do.
Try love."
His comments were received at least twice by SNL spectators and members of the SNL church seemed to feel ashamed, reports Variety, where one person told the newspaper, "The whole study fell silent."
West had been called as a late deputy instead of Arizona Grande, whose ex-boyfriend Mac Miller had changed his life a few days ago.
West surprised many with the interpretation of the song "I Love It," dressed as a bottle of Pererer.
West was supported by the head of the conservative TPUSA group, Cundice Turner, who posted on Twitter: "For one of the most brave souls: FALMONTH IN BALTER."
But Commissioner Karen Hunter posted on Twitter that West simply "was himself and this thing is extraordinary."
"But I choose to repay someone (by buying music or clothing or supporting his "art", for which I believe to shame and spread ideology that is harmful to my community.
And he's free.
So are we," she added.
Before the show, the singer declared on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying he was already "the peace which was previously known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow the tracks of Dicky, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and Peddy.
His rapper friend Snoop Dogg has named Snoop Leon and also the late music legend Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then the artist who was known as Prince.
The charge of attempted murder with a knife in a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
Police said the incident took place in Ballhakamore.
The accused is expected to appear before the Supreme Court of Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be considered by the Public Prosecutor's Service.
The star of "Game of Throns", Keith Hardington, hits toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as swords in character Jon Snow, in the violent series of medieval fantasy "Game of Thrones".
But the 31-year-old actor has hit the male hero's stereotype, saying that showing such role on the screen makes young boys perceive that they must act as strong to respect.
Speaking of The Sunday Times Culture', Keith said he believes that "what's been wrong" and was asked how the toxic masculinity problem could be solved in the era of #MinToo.
Kit, who recently married his acting colleague in "Game of Thronies", also 31 years old, admitted that he felt 'important' in resolving this issue.
"I personally feel very important about this issue right now -- where did we fail to show masculinity?" he said.
'What have we taught men as they grow up, about the problems we're facing now?'
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to the very male characters that appear there.
He went on: 'What is born, and what is learned?
What is taught on TV and what is taught in the streets, that makes young boys believe they should behave in a certain way to feel men?
I think this is one of the big questions of our day - how do we change that?
'Cause obviously something went wrong with the new guys.'
During the interview, he also admitted he would no longer shoot for "Game of Thrones" after the series ended at the end of the next summer, saying that "furreds and horses have come to the edge of his nose.
From November to November, Keith will take part in a refurbishment of the "True West" scene by Sam Shepard, a film producer and his thief brother.
The actor recently indicated that meeting with his Rose wife is the best thing he got from "Game of Thrones".
'In this production I found my wife, so we can say that this show gave me the future family and defined my life from now on,' he said.
Rose played Ygritt's role, the sentimental interest of K's character, Jon Snow, in the fantastic-sciential price series "Emmy".
The couple were married in June 2018 on the property of the Lesley family in Scotland.
HIV/Sada: China Report 14% of new cases
China has announced there is a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and Sida.
There are more than 820,000 people affected throughout the country, health authorities say.
In the second quarter of 2018, some 40,000 new cases were reported.
Most of the new cases have been transmitted through sexual relations, displaying a change from the past.
The HIV virus eventually spread rapidly to some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who receive HIV by this way had almost zero gone, Chinese health officials said at a conference in the Yunan province.
However, year after year, the number of people living with HIV and Sida in China has increased by 100,000.
Transmission of HIV through sex is an acute issue in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexualism was denominated in China in 1997, but it is said that discrimination against LGBT persons still prevails.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies have cautioned that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men will eventually marry women.
Most of the disease’s transmission is due to inadequate protective measures during sex in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to medical drugs for treating HIV as part of the effort to hit this problem.
Maxine Waters denies that the GOP Senate data has been spread by staff members, says these are ‘ dangerous traps ’ and ‘ contributive sectors'
US representative Maxine Waters denounced claims Saturday that a member of her staff had posted personal information to three Republican Serb senators on the pages of lawmakers in Wikipedia.
The Democrat from Los Angeles confirmed that these claims were being postponed by experts and online "right-right extreme".
"The lie, lies and only disgusting lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information released is reportedly includes home addresses and phone numbers of American senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orry Hatch, both of Utah.
The information was presented online on Thursday, posted by an unknown person at the Capitol Hill during a hearing hearing hearing session of the Senate panel for sexual misconduct against candidate for the Supreme Court, Bret Kavanugh.
The leak of information came shortly after all three senators had questioned Kawanauugh.
Some of the conservative pages such as "Gateway Pundit' and 'RedState',' reported that the IP addresses that identify the source of publication were linked to the Waters office and removed data from a Watert staff member, Hill reports.
"This unbiased claim is totally unfair and a great lie," continued Walters.
"The member of my staff -- identity, personal information and security whose safety has been compromised as a result of these false and fabricated claims -- has not been in any way responsible for leaking this information.
This unbiased claim is completely false and a great lie."
Waterers' statement quickly faced online criticism, including former press secretary for the White House, Ar Fleischer.
"This denial becomes rampant," Floscher wrote.
"This means that she does not have the right temper to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn't do, he shouldn't get upset.
It shouldn't be a coincidence.
The defendant's motives should not be questioned.
He must be calm and peaceful."
Fleischer seemed to be comparing Waters' response to the criticism of Democrats for Judge Kavanugh, who was accused of criticising that he had shown extremely nervous during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is preparing to take the place of Waters in the elections in the middle of the mandate, also posted his statements on Twitter.
"Great days, if it will be true," he wrote on Twitter.
In her statement, Waters said her office had signalled "recorded authorities and law-bating institutions on these false accusations.
"We will make sure that the authors are uncovered," she continued, "and they will take legal responsibility for all their actions, which have devastating and dangerous effects for everyone from my staff."
Examining the film "Johnny English Strikes Again" - The comedy with a spy equipped with materials Rowan Atkinson
It has become the case that in every new, influential British film, it has been seen for hidden messages regarding the theme of Brex, and this finds application and the stage of the co-ordination of the "Johny English" company -- which began in 2003 with "John English" and "John" in return in 2011 with "Eyesy's Return".
Will this satirical comedy of how clearly disabled we have been with new national opportunities in the field of exports?
In any case, the face - to - face character of the country, with the face of its weakness and the seemingly freeness of Johnny English pope, has received a authorization to confuse things for the second time - its name, which shows more than anything else that it is a broad and comprehensive creation of territories where there are not spoken English but which are broadcast by cinemas.
Of course he is a master agent, who, no wonder, claims to be fascinating, has little of Mr. Bean's character and one of the figures that contributed only to the release of a sound in the song "Charots of Paradise", at the opening ceremony of the Games - 2012 Olympics.
It is also based on the man of mystery, travelman, and international Atkinson, who once played on television ads that are now forgotten by the "Bharcellacard", leaving the country in chaos wherever it broke.
There's a nice moment or two in the premiere of this movie.
I loved it when Johnny English approached the helicopter dressed in a medieval armor and helica's paper crashed a little bit into his helmet.
Here comes the gift of physical comedy that Atkinson does, but humor seems like hot and sometimes overly excessive, especially when "serious" movies like 007 and Unful Mission have introduced a little bit of comedy as an Inducer in their films.
Humor looks like he's addressing kids more than adults and Johnny English's crazy events and they're not as creative and they're focused on noiseless movements, the same as that that Atkinson did in Bean's character.
The permanent theme of this film is the fact that Great Britain is in serious danger.
A cyberker has been infected in the British Intelligence Super-head network, revealing the identity of British field agents and preventing the agent on duty - unfortunately a small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last chance for a prime minister to appear as a pumpous and ready for battle, which is already suffering an extraordinary non-recognition: Emma Thompson does the best to fulfill the character that looks like Teresa May, but there are not many texts in scenarios that can play.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that every active spy has been compromised, so she will have to rely on someone who retired.
And that means selecting Johnny English himself, who was now employed as school director in a high-end neighborhood, but who informally taught lessons about how to become a secret agent: here is beautiful scenes, because English is offering a spyage academy in the form of a rock school.
English is again called at Whitehall for an emergency meeting and is reunited with his former assistant, the Manyowe Bough, who is again played by Ben Miller.
Bowgh is now a married man, linked to a submarine captain, in the role of a high-line girl, where Vicki Peperdine has been used little wrong for this role.
So Batman and Robin's doing the whole thing in the City Secret Service, they're back in action, facing the lucky Ophelia Bulla played by Olga Kullenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is fascinated by the attractive billions of technologies that claim to solve the difficulties of British computers: Evil Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their ridiculous, funny odysteteo: masked as a waiter, put a beautiful French restaurant in place; cause chaos as they enter the luxurious Volta jat; and English is completely confused as they try to use the Virtual Reality devices to get to know the interior parts of the Volta house.
All sequences normally take place for the final stage, but despite it's funny and loud, the whole thing looks a little like a baby movie.
Very moderate things.
Even as in other movies, Johnny English, I couldn't think: Isn't the British movie industry a role for Romwan Atkinson that would suit his talent?
Landarian Party Denies Plan for Brits to Work Four Days a week, but pay for five days
The Landarian Party, led by Jeremy Corby, is considering a radical plan, which would make the British work four days a week - but paid for five.
The party reportedly wants companies' bosses to save using the artificial intelligence revolution (AI) for employees, giving them an extra day of rest.
We would see that workers would enjoy a three - day vacation weekend - but continue to take the same salary home.
Sources said that the idea would be "put out" with the party's economic agenda and plans to return the country to its employees.
The four-day shift is an idea that has been embraced by the Union Congress as a way for employees to benefit from the economy in a change.
A high-level professor of the Labourish Party told “The Sunday Times: Before the end of the year, a policy review is expected to be announced.
'It won't happen immediately, but one week of four working days is an aspirations that coincide with the party's approach to balance the economy in favour of employees, and also with the party's overall industrial strategy.
The Landarian Party would not be the first to embrace this idea, where and the Green Party has previously pledged four days of work during the general election campaign in 2017.
However, this aspirations are not currently supported by the entire Landarian Party.
A spokesman for the Labourist Party said: "A week of four working days is not the party policy, and is not being taken into account by the party.
Chancellor in Hije, John McDonnall, used last week's conference of the secular party to convey his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to pass the power from the "intellective judges" and "reapers" to public services firms.
The shadow-based plans also imply that current shareholders in water companies may not take all their shares back, because the secular government can carry out "decepts" with the reasoning of actions considered as a violation.
He also confirmed plans to put employees on board companies and to create the long-term Property Funds of Property to exceed 10 percent of capital of private sector firms, which means a paid rate of value to as many as 2,500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy show up at 60 Minutes, if the FBI investigation into Kavanag can change their minds
The FBI investigation into charges against Judge Bret Kawanauugh has delayed a final vote on his appointment at the Supreme Court with at least a week, and raises questions as to whether the investigation bureau findings could affect any republical senator to withdraw his support.
In an interview to be broadcast on Sunday, the correspondent of the "60 Minutes", Scott Peley, asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Gray if the FBI could discover something that would make them wonder.
Kennedy appeared more openly than his colleague from South Carolina.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said that when I was entering the hearing hearing hearing hearing, I said, I spoke to Judge Kawanauugh.
I called after this thing happened, so after the claims came out and I said, "Did you do that?"
He was firm and clear."
However, the vote of Graham looks like engraved on stone.
"I have given up my mind about Brett Kavanugh and the change would only make a bomb charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett denied strongly," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And anyone she mentioned couldn't verify.
He's 36 years old.
I don't see anything going to change."
What is the Global Ciitzen Festival and has he done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the "Glob Citizen" festival -- an annual music show that contains a large and impressive list of stars who interpret and also have a same impressive mission; to end poverty in the world.
Now, in his seventh year, the "Glob Citizen" festival will host crowds of thousands of people at the "Grerat Law" Central Park that not only enjoy Janet Jackson's performances, Cardi and Shand Mendes, but also to be aware of the true goal of showing, to end poverty by 2030.
The "Glob Citizen" festival, which started in 2012, is a extension of "Global Poverty Project", an international immigration group, which hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people who actively fight against it.
In order to benefit a free ticket for the show (even in case you want to pay a VIP ticket), participants must meet a set of tasks, or "actions" as voluntary actions, send an email to a world leader, perform a call, or any other meaningful way that would help raise awareness of their goal to end poverty.
But how successful was the Global Ciitzen Festival when there are 12 years left to achieve its goal?
Does the idea of rewarding people with a free online concert really work to convince them to seek these interventions, or is it just another case of what is known as "opportivism" -- people feeling they're making a real difference by signing an online petition or sending a message to Twitter?
Since 2011, "Glob Citizen" has reportedly recorded more than 19 million "actions" by its supporters, giving a push to different goals.
These actions are said to have helped promote global leaders to declare commitments and policies worth 37 billion dollars, which are said to affect lives of over 2,25 billion people by 2030.
Early in 2018, the group cited 390 pledges and statements as a result of the group’s actions, with at least $10 billion already being distributed or secured as funds.
The group estimates that funds provided so far have given a direct impact on some 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key pledges include "The Power of Nurithion", a United Kingdom-based investor partnership and operating agencies committed to "help children grow up with their full potential," promising them that they would give Rwanda $35m to help end malnutrition in this country, after it took more than 4,700 acts of activists from the "Cibalist."
"With support from the British government, donors, national governments and citizens of the world like you, we can turn the social injustice of malnutrition into a memory of the past," the ambassador of The Power of Nuriation told the crowd at a live concert in London on April 2018.
The group also said that after taking 5,000 actions to call on the United Kingdom to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government declared financing a project, "The Power of Nurithion", which will affect 5 million women and children who need food intervention.
In an answer to the most frequent questions on their website, they were asked, "What makes you believe that we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen said, "It will be a long and difficult path - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But as for any high civic right and as the movement against an apartment before us, we will succeed, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shaw Mende, Card, Janelle Monáe are some of the actors who will perform this year's performance in New York, which will be introduced by Debora-Lee Furs and Hughman.
US could use the Marine for Unlocking to prevent Russian energy exports - Interior Secretary
"If necessary" Washington can rely on his Marina to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including the Middle East, has discovered US Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, according to the Washington Examineer.
Zinke claims that Russia's involvement in Syria - particularly where it is operating at the invitation of the Syrian legitimate government - it is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
"I believe the reason why they are in the Middle East is that they want to supply it with energy, as they do with Eastern Europe, southern Europe's belly," he reportedly said.
And according to this official, there are ways and ways to deal with this problem.
"The United States has the ability, with our Navy, to ensure that sea routes are open and, if necessary, block them so that energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke was addressing participants in an activity conducted by the Energy Consumption Alliance, a non-profit organisation that has generated itself as "the volume of energy consumers" in the US.
He went on to compare Washington's approach to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that these approaches are practically the same.
"The economic effort on Iran and Russia is somewhat the use and replacement of fuel," he said, as he referred to Russia as "a more deceptive" with an economy that depends on fossil fuels.
The statements come as the Trump administration has undertaken a mission to increase the exports of liquid natural gas to Europe, thus replacing Russia, a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To that end, administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "incompatible" gas pipeline project "Noror Strame 2", which, according to Trump, has turned Berlin into a Moscow "bo" project.
Moscow has repeatedly expressed that the $18 billion gas pipeline project "Norream 2', which is supposed to double the capacity of existing gas pipelines to carry it to 110 billion cubic metres, is a clean economic project.
Kremlin argues that Washington's intense opposition to the project is done simply for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the same opinion that energy cannot be a tool used for pressure, and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose the fuel tank," said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after a meeting with American Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The American stance has faced controversy from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The main organisation for the industry in Germany, the Federation of German Industry (DUI), has urged the US to stay away from EU energy policy and from bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a lot of trouble when a third state intervenes in our energy supply," said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industry Federation (DUI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "think seriously" if she will run for presidents in 2020, says Massachusetts Senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that he would "consider seriously" participate in the race for president after elections in the middle of the mandate.
Through a rally in the city in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider running.
"It is time for women to go to Washington and fix our ruined government, and this includes establishing a woman on the top," she said, according to The Hill.
"After November 6th, I will seriously consider running for presidents."
Warren hit President Donald Trump during the rallying to the city, saying he is "bringing the country in the wrong direction.
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren is known for his criticism of Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Bret Kavanugh.
In a quote Friday, Warren said "that, of course, before the vote we need an FBI investigation."
However, a poll released Thursday indicated that a large part of Warren's own electors do not think it should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight per cent of Massachusetts' "able" voters said that the senator should not run, according to the poll conducted by the Sufolk University Political Research Centre/Boston Globe.
Thirty - two percent supported the union.
The survey showed that former Governor Deval Patrick enjoyed greater support for running, where 38 percent supported a possible run-up, and 48 per cent were against this run.
Other high profile Democrats that have been discussed to compete in 2020 include former President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide in January, "Associed Press' reported.
Sarah Paul quoted the post-transparent stress disorder of Trach Paul at the gathering of Donald Trump
Track Paulin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after being summoned to the army in September.
On Monday evening, he was arrested and charged with a family violence incident
"What my son is going through, what he's experiencing after he's returned, I can connect him to other families, which feel the spread of PSD and some of the injuries our soldiers have returned," she told participants at a gathering for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Okhoma.
Paul called his arrest "the chief in the room" and said that her son and other war veterans "have a little changed, hardened, came thinking about whether they receive the proper respect of soldiers and other members of the army, about what they have given the country."
He was arrested in Wisła on Monday, Alaska and was charged with domestic violence after an attack on a woman, following a report of domestic violence and arms while he was drunk, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Police Department in Iceland.
18 states, D.C. support opposition to a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and Colombian District are supporting a legal objection to a new American policy that denies asylum for victims who have escaped criminal groups or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 countries and the district stored a document of explain as friends-in-law in Washington on Friday, in support of changing asylum-seek policies, NBC News reports.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace issue that the American Union of Civil Freedoms has deposited in August against federal policy has not been discovered.
She said her partner "and his violent gang member boys" abused her, but American officials denied her asylum application on July 20th.
She was stopped in Texas.
State lawyers who are supporting Grace describe El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala as countries producing a high number of US asylum applicants because they are countries that have widespread gang problems and domestic violence.
The new asylum search policy in the US returned a decision in 2014, from the Eppelation Board that allowed immigrants without documents to escape domestic violence and apply for asylum.
Colombia County Secretary General General General Carl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "considers decades of state, federal and international laws."
"The federal records require that all asylum requests should be judged according to special facts and circumstances of the case, and such a move conflicts with this principle," stated the friend-in-the-law report.
The lawyers further argued in the report that the ban police made in the introduction of migrants was damaging the American economy, saying their chances are to become entrepreneurs and to "promote the necessary labour arm."
Prosecutor General Jeff Seessions ordered immigration judges in June to no longer give asylum to victims who escape domestic violence and violence from gangs.
"Azili is available to those who leave their country because of fear or persecution based on race, religious faith, nationality or belonging to a certain social group or political conviction," session said on June 11th, on the day of declaring politics.
Asia has never been meant to ease all problems -- even all serious problems -- with people facing every day around the world.
The desperate rescue effort in Palu as the death balance doubles in a race to find survivors
To survivors, the situation was extremely honorable.
"The situation feels very tense," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, while carrying her sick little son to an evacuation centre in the ruined city of Palau.
"Albulance brings troops every minute.
There's no more clean water."
The inhabitants saw them return to their ruined homes, bringing out their goods in water, in an effort to save what they could find.
Hundreds of people have been injured, and hospitals damaged by the 7.5-face earthquake are overcome.
Some of the wounded, including Dwei Harris, who has broken the back and shoulder, were put in the Military Hospital outside Palu, where patients are being treated in external environments because the earth’s shocks continue.
The eyes filled with tears as he recalled the violent shaking of the earthquake in the hotel room on the fifth floor that separated his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save himself.
I think I was crushed under the debris of the wall," Haris told "Associed Press", adding that his family had come to town for a wedding.
"I heard the woman crying and looking for help but then quietly.
I don't know what happened to him and my baby.
I hope they're safe."
U.S. Ambassador accuses China of "clugging" with "opportitive declarations'
A week after an official newspaper of China posted a four-page commercial in an American daily, promoting joint US-China trade benefits, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to distribute its propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump, last Wednesday, referred to last Wednesday's paid supplement to the "Cahine Daily's" proposal at the "Deine Mothers Register's" - newspaper sold to the state of Iouas - after accusing China of attempted interference in the US Congress elections held on 6 November, one charge that is denied by China.
Trump's charges that Beijing was trying to intervene in the US elections marked what US officials said was a new stage in Washington's scandalal campaign to increase pressure to China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to impose ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently confined to a growing commercial war, which has seen a balance of fees on one another's imports.
Chinese and American experts have said China's turning rates in this trade war were scheduled to strike exporters like Ioua, who have supported the Republican Party of Trump.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and former governor for a long time, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing has hit employees, farmers and American businesses.
In an opinion published in the Dys Moines Register's Sunday Sunday, he wrote that, "Kina is already double this harassment by putting propaganda propaganda on our free printing press."
"By distributing its propaganda, China's government is being assisted by the joyful American tradition of free speech and free press by setting a free advertising commercial for Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In contrast to this, in the street clips here in Beijing, you will find very few voices against and you will not see any real reflection of different ideas that the Chinese could have for China's disturbing economic practices, as media is under strong control of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most prominent newspapers in China avoided the bid to publish his article," despite which he did not say what newspaper that was.
Analysts warn that republics are taking the women's vote ahead of elections in the middle of the mandate after Kawanugh scandal.
The more key characters of the republics of the republics are challenged and to protect the candidate for the Supreme Court, Bret Kavanugh, in front of several claims on sexual assaults, analysts have warned that they will face a severe reaction, especially from women, in future elections in the midst of the mandate.
The emotions on this subject have been extremely high, and many republics have publicly declared they want to continue voting the candidate.
These things cannot be undone," Grant Reecher, professor of political science at Sirakuza University, said "The Hill" for an article published on Saturday.
Reeer said he doubts in the last minute of Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s effort for an FBI investigation and that it will be sufficient to calm angry voters.
"The women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget tomorrow or November," Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior national adviser and spokeswoman for the progressive group, according to Washington's DC newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters sang "Interitorial is coming!" as they were demonstrating in the Senate corridors, while republics in control of the Justice Committee decided to move ahead with the Kawangh running despite Dr. Christine Blase Ford, reported.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will reach the Maya," Stu Rottenberg, an independent political analyst, told Stu Rottenberg news page.
"People are saying they have already been on high levels; that's true.
But it may be even higher, especially among the unconstructed female voters on the outskirts and among new voters, aged 18 to 29, who, although not liked the president, generally don't vote at all."
Even before Ford's public testimony detailsing her accusations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court's candidate, analysts suggested there would be a severe reaction if the republics were to continue to support this union.
"This has been turned into a commune for the GOP," Michael Steele, former head of the Republican National Committee, said at the beginning of last week, according to the "NBC News".
"It is not only about the committee's vote or the final vote, or whether the Kawanugh will decide on the prosecution's bank, it also has to do with how the republics have dealt with this issue and how they have treated it," said NBC News, Guy Cecil, director of Primor USA, a group that helps the Democrats' elections.
However, Americans seem to be somewhat divided on who to believe in the vigilance of Ford and Kavanugh's testimony, with this latter with a slightly higher support.
A recent survey by "YuouGov' shows that 41 per cent of respondents strongly believe in Ford's testimony either, while 35 per cent say they trust them either or most likely Kavanaugh.
Also, 38 per cent believe Kavanaugh, probably or certainly lied during his testimony, while only 30 per cent say the same thing for Ford.
After Flake's installation, the FBI is currently investigating claims presented by Ford, as well as from the other prosecutor, Deborah Ramics, reports The Guardian.
Last week, Ford testified before the Senate Justice Committee under oath that Kavanugh attacked him at the age of 17 while he was in a state of drunk.
Ramisar claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court showed his genius organs before her while at a party while they were studying in Yale, the 80s.
World Network Creator plans to launch a new internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of the World Wide Network, is creating a company that aims to rival Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, the "Incompet", is a company built by the Berners-Lee open resources platform, called "Solide".
'Solid' allows users to choose where to save their data and which persons are allowed to access a given information.
In an exclusive interview for "Fast Company,' Berners-Lee said with a joke that the purpose behind "Inclaves" is "the global abuse."
"We have to do it now," he said of this investment company.
"It's a historic moment."
The algorithm uses Solid technology to allow people to create "get their personal data online" or a POD.
It may contain contact lists, lists of things to do, music lists and other personal and professional media.
It's the same as having access to a browser and at the same time Google Drive, Microsoft Outlowok, Slack and Spatify.
What is unique for maintaining personal networking data is that it remains completely in user's hands what kind of information it will access.
The company calls this "one personal empowerment through data."
The Ingroup idea, according to company executive director John Bruce, is to bring together resources, processes and skills needed to help Solid be available to anyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several developers contracted to work on this project, and a volunteer coder community.
Starting this week, technology developers worldwide can create their decentralisation applications using available tools on the Internet site.
Berners-Lee said he and his team were not talking to "Facebook and Google if they should present or not a total change where all of their business models are completely overturned at night.
"We are not asking for their permission."
In a post at the "Medium" published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that the Infishing mission "is to provide trade energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new network built in Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the internet when he founded the World Network consortium at the Massachusetts Technology Institute.
Over the past few months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in debate the network's impartiality.
Even while founding Infish, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Network consortium, the Network Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am extremely optimistic about this new network age," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Van: The Touration of the Victorian Cross during World War I
The only clergyman who won a Victorian Cross during World War I in the quality of the warrior has been reminded of his homeland 100 years later.
Subcollonel, honoured Bernard Vann won the medal on September 29th 1918, in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later, and never learned he had won the highest British military title.
A memorial stone was presented by his two grandsons in a parade in Rashden, Nothamponë, Saturday.
One of the grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "mostly symbolic" for the memorial to appear exactly 100 years from the heroic act that gave his grandfather the medal.
According to "London Gazette", on 29 September, Colonel Vann, directed his battalion through the Saint-Quentin channel "through a dense mist and under the hail of bullets from fields and machine guns."
He then rushed into the fireline and with a "great boldness" headed the battalion ahead and seized one of the weapons in the battlefield and alone killed three people from the opposing troops.
Incline Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 — less than a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions "are something he can never achieve but something that really shows modesty."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, were placed by a crown behind the parade, which was led by the "Brentwood Imperial Youth".
Michael Vann said "was very honored that was part of this parade" and added that "the need of a true hero is being manifested by support that is being given by many people."
MMA's fans stayed awake all night to follow Bellator 206, but instead saw "Dercuscan Pepa"
Imagine, you've been up all night to see Bellator 206, and then you've got the opportunity to see this major event.
The show by San Jose contained 13 matches, including six conflicts in the base package and would appear in real time at night in channel 5 in the UK.
At 6: 00 a.m., while Gegard Mousssa and Rory MacDonald were preparing to fight each other, viewers in Britain were surprised when the transmission changed to display the Desert Pena.
Some remained dissatisfied because they had stayed awake all night until the early hours, especially for the match.
A fan on Twitter described this transition from the fight to a cartoon film for children as "an ugly joke."
"There are rules of the government that determine that at 6:00 a.m., that content was not appropriate to it and we should pass to a child programme," said Dave Schwartz, vice president of marketing and communications at Bellator, when asked about broadcasting.
"Dreckage Pepa," yes."
Company President Bellator Scott Coker said they will work on programming to include and viewers from Britain in the future.
"When I think about reruning, I think we can solve it," Cooper said.
"But there's six o'clock in the morning, Sunday day and we can't solve this problem until Sunday with our watch, so on Monday.
But we're working on it.
Trust me, when the program was changed there was a lot of traffic messages and none of them were friendly.
We were trying to fix it because we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was a government problem.
I promise you it won't happen next time.
We're going to do 5 games instead of six -- as we usually do -- we're trying to give more to fans and maybe outnumber the target.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt ‘ inferior ’ about his sex
Olympic diver, Tom Daley, says he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality--but that motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn't understand until he went to the nine-year school that "not all were like me."
Speaking on the first Radio 4th Radio programme of "Descent Island Discs", introduced by Lauren Loverne, he said he raised a voice for gay rights to give "wait" to others.
He also said that after becoming a parent, he thought less of winning Olympic medals.
The long-term programme host Kirsty Young has taken several months of vacation because he is sick.
Displaying as a person removed from Laverne's first programme, Daley said that while he grew up he felt "inferive" to others because "it was not socially acceptable to please boys and girls."
He said, "Until today, those feelings of indifference, and the fact that I felt differently, have been the real elements that gave me the push and strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that it was worth "something," he said, so he wouldn't let everyone down when they learned of his sexual orientation.
Twice the winner of the bronze Olympic medal, is already an activist of the high profile LGBT and used his participation in the Comonuelth Games in Australia to appeal more to countries to justify homosexuality.
He said he went out open because he felt lucky that he was able to live openly and without consequences and that he wanted to give others "wait."
Three times the world's champion said the fall in love with an American man -- American film producer Dustin Lance Black -- he met in 2013 - "I was unprepared."
Last year, Daley married Oscar Prize winner, who is 20 years older than he is, but said the difference has never been a problem.
"When you're experiencing so many things at such a new age"--he went to the first Olympics at 14 and his father died of cancer three years later--he said it was hard to find someone at the same age to experience the same decline.
The couple became parents in June, of a guy named Robert Ray Black-Dalley and Daley said his "all prospects" had changed.
"If you asked me last year, all I thought was "to win a gold medal," he said.
"You know what, there are more important things than the Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic medallion of gold is Robbie."
His son bears the same name that his father had, Robert, who died in 2011, at 40 years of age after being diagnosed with head cancer.
Daley said his father didn't accept that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked was if we had prepared the tickets to London 2012--because he wanted to be on the first line.
"I couldn't tell him 'that you couldn't be on the first row,' he said.
"I was holding my hand while he returned to breathe, and only after the delay took breath and life was changed and accepted for the first time that he and he were not invincible," he said.
Next year Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
"I knew this was what I had dreamed of all my life--to dive in front of the local public at the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired its first musical selection - Proud from Heather Small - who accompanied him during preparations for the Olympic Games and continues to cause mortar.
Desert Island Dics is given to BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15, British clock.
Mickelson, outside the shape, left on the bench on Saturday at Ryder Cup
American Phil Mitchellson will set a record Sunday when he plays his 47th game in Ryder Cup, but he will have to change his form to avoid turning this historic moment into disappointment.
Mickelson, who is the 12th time of this event, a record by himself, which is organised every two years, was sitting on the bench by Captain Jim Furyk, during the double games (furbates and phosmes).
Instead of being at the center of the action, as it has usually been for the United States, the winner of the major titles spent five times the day supporting the team and working hoping to leave behind concerns.
Not among the players with the most right hit even when he was at the height of his career, 48-year-old is not a suitable player for Le Golf National's complicated field, where the long and difficult fields leave no room for the wrong shot.
And if it wasn't enough the fear of the field, Milosevic, on Sunday, in the ninth match, he's going to face the "British Open" champion, Francesco Molinari, who has formed a team with the original Tommy Flettwood to win their fourth games this week.
If Americans, who have four points less, before the start of the 12 matches, are going to start fast, Mickelson's game can be crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his player, even though it can't mean more than that.
"He fully understood his role today, gave me a stroke of shoulders, threw my hand on my neck and told me he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He is very confident in himself.
He's at Fama's Hall and he's made a lot of contributions to these teams in the past week, and during this week.
I probably didn't think he'd play two matches.
I had thought more, but this was the result, and we thought it was the solution.
He wants to be on the field, like anyone else."
On Sunday, Milosevic will pass Nick Faldo's record for the player with more presentations in Ryder Cup matches.
He can mark his career end at Ryder Cup, where he has not been up to his individual presentations.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeat and seven drawbacks, even though Furyk said his presence brings value to the team.
"He's funny, sarkastic, sharp, likes to bother people, and he's a fantastic guy to have him in the team room," he explained.
"In addition, I think the younger players were having fun dealing with him during this week, and that was nice to see.
He gives more than play."
European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows the great lead could disappear too soon.
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, knows from experience that the significant lead ahead of the last day of the television games in Ryder Cup can be turned into an unpleasant factor.
Danezi made his own decrimination in the face of 1997, in Valderrama, where the team with Captain Sve Balesteros had a five-point lead with Americans closed the tournament by winning with a very narrow margin, 141-1312.
"It reminds us that we had a great lead in Valderrama; we had the great lead in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderra where we won, but with much difficulty," Bjorn said, who was photographed after a 5-3 victory in the "Clas 2018" Friday and headed 10-6 to ‘Lef Go.
So history tells me and everyone on that team that's not over.
We're gonna walk the last march tomorrow.
We're going there and we're gonna do the right thing.
Nothing's over until we get points on the board.
We have a purpose, to try to win this trophy and here is our focus.
I've said all the time, I'm focused on the 12 players we have on the team, but we're aware of who we're facing -- the best players in the world."
Pleased with his players' order, in a difficult golf field, Bjorn added, "I don't want to rush into this phase.
Tomorrow we'll face another monster.
Tomorrow there's the individual performance itself, and that's something else to be done.
It's fantastic when you're in the field with a partner, when things go well, but when you're alone, you're testing your full capacity as a golf player.
This is the message you need to convey to the players, tomorrow you have to give the best of yourself.
Now, forget your partner because he has to go and give the best of himself."
In contrast with Bjorn, opponent Jim Furyk will hope that his players will improve better individually than partners, where the exception is the Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, took three out of four possible points.
Furyk himself has experienced both cases of major returns of the result on the last day, being part of the Olympic team in Brooklyn before losing in what is considered "Crime in Medina" of Europe's team.
"I remember every word," when he was asked how his players had motivated him during the last day, Captain Ben Creshaw, in 1999.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but we need to have a good start, as you saw in Brooklyn and Medina.
When you get the flow on one side, you put a lot of pressure on middle matches.
We set up the formula based on this thing and we'll get the boys in the ranking that we believe is the best, because you know, we're trying to make a miracle tomorrow."
Thomas has the task to start overthrowing the result and face Rory McElroy in the leading match, while Paul Casey, Justin Rosse, Jon Rhm, Tommy Flettwood and Ian Poltter with European players positioning in the first half of the ranking match
"I chose this group and in this ranking I believe covers all roads in the fight," Bjorn said of his election to the people.
New German combat production re-injured again
The new market of the German Navy should have been sent in 2014 to replace Cold War Wars, but will not be ready until next year because of problems and very high costs, local media have reported.
Sending "Rainland-Pfaz", the main ship of new reins of "Baden-Weertberg-Class", has been pushed to the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper "Day Zeit", which quotes a military spokesman.
The ship had to join Marina in 2014, but the problems following the collapse damaged the fate of an ambitious project.
Four ships of the type "Biden-Wertemtberg-class" that were ordered from Navy in 2007, will serve as substitutes for the old "Bremen-class".
The known thing will contain a powerful ball, a series of counter-air missiles and counter-animation and technology against discovery (stalth), such as reductions in detection from radar, red infrastructure and austic waves.
Some of the other important characteristics include longer maintenance periods—should be possible for new brakes to be moved for more than two years away from the country's ports.
However, repeated delays imply that the recent technology warfare that is said to enable Germany to reflect power abroad - will be old - fashioned at the time they enter the ministry, writes “Diday Zeit. ”
The ‘ unfortunate sum'F125, came on the front pages last year, when the German navy officially refused to order this ship and turned it into the Blackohm & Vossttt in Hamburg.
This was the first time Marina turned a ship to her construction after giving up.
They were given little information on return reasons, but the media in Germany cited a series of "largely in software and hardware" that made the ship useless during a war mission.
The programme problems were especially important in the Baden-Wutertembergs ships because they will be operated by a crew of 120 sailors - half the labor force of the old "Bremens".
It was also found that the ship was overfishing, which reduced its productivity and limited marine ability to increase improvements in the future.
The 7,000-strong "Rinland-Palfaz" is believed to be double the weight of the similar categoryship used by Germans in World War II.
In addition to problems, the price of the entire project - including training crews - is also becoming a problem.
It is said to be at a figure of 3.1 billion dollars (3.6 billion) -- from $2.2 billion initially anticipated.
The problems that have afflicted the new brakes are especially important after recent warnings that the power of the German Navy is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the defence committee in the German parliament, acknowledged that Marinas is "recognizing adequate ships to move to another country."
The official said the problem had increased over time, because old ships had been extracted from use, but had not been replaced.
He lamented that none of the Biden-Wuertemberg-clas could join the Navy.
National Trust Watchs Secret Night Woods
A new research being conducted by a company in the mountainous areas of Scotland aims to find out how bats use the ground to hunt for food.
It is hoped that new findings will shed new light on the behavior of unique flying mammals and will help safeguard activities in the future.
Research by scientists in the National Trust for Scotland will follow the common bats of the night, and they called Soprano ppistrells, as well as the black-and-tours and the bubentons in the Inverwee gardens, in Western Ross.
Special registration equipment will be placed at key points throughout the area to track the activities of bats across the season.
The NHS headquarters and volunteers will also conduct field studies using hand detectors.
The analysis of the sounds that will be performed by experts for all records will determine the frequency of the sound of the bats and what each species does.
Then a report and a map of their habitat will be written to provide a detailed picture of their conduct.
Rob Dewar, nature protection consultant for NTS, hopes that the conclusions will reveal which habitats are more important to night bats and how they are used by each species.
This information would help determine the goods of settlement management, such as the creation of pasture and how forests are maintained for night bats and other related species.
The number of bats in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom has fallen significantly during the last century.
They are threatened by developments construction and development work that affect the nest and the loss of habitats.
Winds and lighting can also pose danger, as do sticky letters or chemical ingredients of building materials, as well as animal attacks.
Indeed, the bats are not blind.
However, because of their night - hunt habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching and waiting.
They use a sophisticated find technique by means of sounds to define insects accurately and barriers to flight.
The NTS, who is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 major gardens and 76,000 acres of land in the country, is taking seriously the bats.
There are ten trained experts, who regularly conduct studies, nest inspections, and sometimes engage in rescue programs.
The organisation has even set up its first and single reserve in Scotland dedicated to night bats in Thres, Dumphres, and Galloway, which serves as home for eight of the 10 species of night bats in Scotland.
The administrator of this barracks, David Thompson, says this country is the ideal territory for them.
"This time in Threes we have an excellent area for the bats of the night," he said.
"We have old buildings, many ancient trees and all the right habitats.
But there are still many things about night's bats that remain unknown, so the work we do here and in other countries will help us understand more what they need to be ‘ developed."
It stresses the importance of real night control for bats before performing property maintenance operations because there is a possibility that the sheer destruction of a nest could kill up to 400 female and young bats and thus destroy the entire population of one area.
The night's prey is protected and murder, harassment and concern, or destruction of their mouths is illegal.
Elizabeth Ferrell, Scottish officials near Trust for the preservation of Nana’s Lavel, encourages people to become part of the aid.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species, we simply don't know how their population is moving."
Ronaldo denies rape charges as lawyers prepare to arrest German magazine
Cristiono Ronaldo said that charges of rape against him are "false news", saying people "do want to promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyers are determined to sue the German magazine "Der Spilele", which published these accusations.
Portugal’s striker and Juventus has been charged with rape of an American woman named Catherine Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
On Friday, Der Spileel reported that he later claimed he had paid her $35,000 so as not to talk about the incident.
Speaking on a video in the Institute, run 142 million followers, just a few hours after publishing these claims, Ronaldo, 33, considered the reports "false news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What was said to them today, false news," Golden Top winner said five times in front of the camera.
"They want to promote themselves using my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but this is part of the job.
I am a happy man and everything is going well," the player added smiling.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's attorneys are preparing to sue "Der Spilegel" for these charges, which they have called "unrecognition reports of doubts about private life".
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player will seek compensation for "moral conditions in value that correspond to the seriousness of the violation, which is perhaps one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident reportedly took place in June 2009, in a room of Palms Hotels and Casino in Las Vegas.
According to documents presented at the Clark District Court in Nevada, after meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly went to the player's room, where they allegedly violated him at anus.
Mayorga claims Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and said "99 per cent" he is a "good boy" left in mud by "a percentage".
The document says Ronaldo confirms that the couple had had sexual intercourse but was with the acceptance of both sides.
Mayorga also claims she went to the police and had pictures of her injuries at a hospital, but later agreed to a solution outside the tribunal because she was "revened by the revenge" and was concerned that she would "be tormented in public".
The 34-year-old says she is now trying to return the deal because she continues to be traumad by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was next to the Madrid union from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer went to the Italian giants of Juventus in an agreement of 100m euros.
Brexit: United Kingdom "will forever repent" for losing car producers' status
The United Kingdom "will repent forever" if it will lose the status of the world leader in the production of cars after Brex, said Secretary of Business Greg Clark.
He added that it was "consistent" Toyota in the United Kingdom had said to the BBC that if Britain was to leave the EU without an agreement, society would temporarily prevent production at its plant in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
Japanese car manufacturer said the impact of delays on the border, in the case of an agreement-free exit, would cost losing jobs.
The factory in Burnson - which produces the Toyota Auris and Avensis models - produced almost 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to other European Union countries.
"In my judgment, if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we will stop production at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, administration director of Toyota in Burnson.
Other U.S. car producers in the UK, such as Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed fears of coming out of the EU without agreements and of how cross-border trade will work.
For example, BMW said that after Brex would shut down its mini-severe factory for a month.
Main concerns are related to what car producers refer to as risk of supply chain in the case of a Brex without agreement.
The Toyota production line works on " immediately once ordered", with parts coming every 37 minutes from fuelators from the UK and the EU, to car ordering vehicles.
If, on March 29th, the UK leaves the EU without an agreement, there may be delays at the border, which according to this industry could lead to delays and lack of pieces.
It would be impossible for Toyota to hold at her factory in Derbreire Inventior and more than one day, the company said, and therefore production would stop.
Mr. Clark said the "Chequers' plan of Theresa May's for future relations with the EU "is specifically built to avoid these checks at the border."
"We need a deal. We want to have the best agreement that will allow us not only to enjoy the success of the moment, as well as exploit this opportunity," he said of the BBC Today programme's Radio 4.
"The data, not only from Toyota but also from other producers, shows that we certainly need to be capable of continuing what has been a very successful supply chain."
Toyota could not determine how long production would stop production, but in long term, warned that added costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and eventually lead to reduced jobs.
Peter Tsuwalaris, who has been working in Burns for 24 years and who is the senior official of the Union union in the factory, said members are increasingly concerned: "As my experience is being completed, they don't come back.
A government spokesman said "We have set a precise and reliable plan for our relationship with the EU."
Trump meeting with Rosenstein can be postponed again, says White House
Donald Trump's high-level meeting with Deputy Prosecutor General Rod Rosenstein could "keep up for another week" as the fight for High Court candidate, Bret Kavanugh, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russia's intervention in the elections, ties between Trump and Russia's assistant personnel and the possibility that the president has prevented justice.
The discussion whether Trump will download or not the deputy general of duty, thus putting Mueller's independence at risk, is something that produces gossip for months in Washington.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein took into consideration the introduction of a Listener to record talks with Trump and the possibility of dismissing the president through the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied this news.
But last Monday, he went to the White House, amid reports that he was close to resigning.
Unlike expected, on Thursday a meeting with Trump, located at the United Nations headquarters in New York, was announced.
Trump said "will" not fire Rosenstein, but later the meeting was prompted to avoid a clash with the hearing hearing session held by the Senate judicial committee, where they testified Kawanugh and Dr. Christine Blaise Ford, one of the women who accused him of engaging in sexual misconduct.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long investigation by the FBI for claims against Kawanauugh, further pushing the full vote in the Senate.
The press secretary of Trump, Sarah Sanders, was present today at Fox News Sunday.
When asked about meeting with Rosenstein, she said, "There is not a date yet, it may be this week. I think it could be delayed another week, given everything else that is happening with the Supreme Court.
But, let's see, and I always like to keep the press updated."
Some journalists may object to this statement: Sanders has not held press conferences at the White House since 10 September.
Modernist Chris Wallace raised the question why.
Sanders said that the lack of press conferences did not come as a result of discontent with the stance of television journalists," though she said, "I will not deny the fact that they attract attention."
It then hinted that direct contact between Trump and the press will increase.
"The president performs more quality security sessions than any other president before him," she said, adding, without quoting the data: "We have seen these figures."
It will continue to have press conferences, Sanders said, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask direct questions to the president of the United States, then that's a lot better than to talk to me.
We've been trying to do this a lot, and you've seen that we've done so often over the past few weeks, replacing press conferences in cases where you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump regularly accepts questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or at a press conference with important personalities.
Personal press conferences are rare.
The president may have indicated the reason for this fact during this week, in New York, where he made a control exit and in some strange cases, in front of journalists.
Health Secretary writes employees from the EU, in NHS Scotland, about fears about Brex
The Health Secretary has written staff from the EU working on NHS in Scotland to express gratitude in the name of the country and the desire to stay behind Brex.
Jeanne Freeman, deputy deputy of the Scottish Parliament, has sent a letter, when there are less than six months left since the UK's departure from the EU.
The Scottish government has already taken over costs of applying for permanent residence status for EU citizens working in public services at the local level.
In her letter, Mrs. Freeman wrote: "In the summer, negotiations have continued for the removal of the UK from the EU, drawing closer to gaining a decision in the autumn.
But, the UK government has also intensified its preparations in the case of an agreement-free scenario.
I know this is a very disturbing time for all of you.
For this reason, I wanted to emphasize how much I appreciate the contribution of each member of the staff, regardless of their nationality.
Delegates from the EU and beyond bring in valuable experiences and skills that increase and improve the work of health service, increasing the benefits of patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is certainly your home and we wish you would stay here."
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after head damage
Tennesneste State Tigers Christion Abercrobee was subjected to an immediate surgery after the damage to the head on Saturday, in the 31-27 defeat against Vandery Commodore, The Tennessee journalist Mikegan reported.
Tennesne coach State Rodd told reporters that the damage occurred just before the first part.
"He came to the side line and fell there," Reed said.
The trainers and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen to the sideline before they put it on the barracks and send it for further examinations.
An official of Tennessee State told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville that Abercrombie had completed surgery at the Valley Hospital Hospital.
Harris added that "there are still no details about the type of damage", and Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the damage occurred.
Abercrobee, a second - year - old student, is in his first season with Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
He fulfilled five interventions Saturday before leaving the game, leading to 18 total number of interference during the season.
Foreign - nationality buyers will pay higher chicken taxes when they buy property in UK
Foreign-state buyers will pay higher stamps for purchasing a property in the UK, and additional money will be used to help homeless people according to new plans of the Conservatar Party (Try)
This movement will neutralise the success of Corby's initiative to attract new voters
The stamp tax will apply to those who do not pay taxes in UK
The treasure department expects to gather up to 120 million GBP annually to help homeless people
The Maine will now announce that customers of foreign nationality will pay higher stamps for purchasing a property in the UK, and additional money will be used to help homeless people.
This move will be seen as an attempt to neutralise the success of Jeremy Corbyn's initiative to attract new voters with promises to provide more affordable housing and to "take advantage under target" of high profits persons.
The stamp tax will apply to individuals and firms who do not pay taxes in the UK, while additional money will support the government's initiative to fight lack of housing.
This extra fee -- which adds to the current parliament tax, including the increase of the tax rate presented two years ago for the second houses and for the purchased properties -- can go to three per cent.
The Susari department predicts that this movement will gather up to 120 million GBP per year.
About 13 per cent of the recently built properties in London are purchased by people with house-to-houses outside the UK, which causes price hikes and makes housing more difficult to find by buyers for the first time.
Many wealthy areas of the country -- particularly in the capital -- have been turned into "a ghost city" because of the high number of foreigners who spend most of their time abroad.
This new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for reducing the stamp tax to help young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction firms that they are keeping high prices from buying land but not putting them into use, and called on Mrs. May to give up quotas for affordable homes in order to regulate "the Britain's interest with property".
Mr. Corbyn has proposed some attractive housing reforms, including control of the rent and removal of "no reason".
He also wants to give more authority to the advice of building new homes.
Mrs. May said, "Last year I stated I would dedicate my life to the mandate of the president of the return of the British dream--so, for a better life for any new generation.
And that means fixing the problem market of homes.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is not fair for individuals who do not live in the UK, and foreign societies are easier to buy homes than British workers.
For many people, the dream of owning a house has become a very difficult thing to achieve and injustice to the homeless is more real."
Jack Ross: "My greatest ambition is to train Scotland."
Sunnderland coach Jack Ross says "his greatest ambition" is to become Scotland's coach at a certain stage.
Skocezi, 42, is enjoying the challenge of re-establishing the north-east club, which is currently located in third place in League One ( 3: third province), three points away from the head.
He came this summer to Drita's Stadim after returning St. Mirren to Premier Liguele Skocese last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I appeared once in representative B and that's all," Ross told BBC Scotland Sportsland.
"But as a child, I grew up seeing Scotland many times in Hampden with my father, and it's something that's always attracted me.
However, this possibility will come only if I am successful in running clubs."
Ross's predecessors in Sunnderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moys, Sam Alardy, Martin O'Nil, Roy Kane, Gust, and Paulo Di Canino.
The former coach of Aloa Athletic says he is not concerned that he is following the steps of those big names in a club so big, as he has previously rejected offers from Barnes and Ipswick Town.
"At the moment, my success will depend on if 'I can turn this team into Premier League?'
In view of this club's structure and environments, no doubt it belongs to Premier Liga," he said.
"It's not a simple task to go there, but I'll see myself as successful only if I can get back to the club at Premier Evil."
Ross has only been starting his career as coach for three years after a period of assistant and assistant in Dumbatton and a 15-month period in Heart's management staff.
He then helped Aloa climb up a category up to the third round of the cup, as well as transformed St Mirren from a club near the fall from the category to the winner of the title of the 35ionip next season.
And now, Ross says he feels better than he's ever felt during his career as a member of Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, Stren and Hamilton Academy.
"Maybe it was really a turning point," he says, for taking Aloa's lead.
"I truly believe that training was the right thing for me, more than being a player.
It seems strange because I played well, I lived a good life thanks to this profession, and I enjoyed some good achievements.
But being a player can be difficult.
You have to experience a lot every week.
Once again, I experience much stress and pressure from work, but training seems the right thing.
I've always wanted to train and now I'm doing something like this.
Full interview you can hear on Sunday, Sportsland, September 30, Radio Scotland from 12:00 to 13:00 BST
According to one study, the perfect time "to drink a beer" is Saturday at 5:30 p.m.
Summer heat wave has increased local revenues in the difficult situation in Britain, but has increased pressure on restaurant chains.
The data shows sales in local groups and bars increased by 2.7 per cent in July - but shopping in restaurants fell by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin, a business consultant in the CGA, who compiled data, said, "The continued solar picture as well as the participation of England in the World Cup rather than expected of July to follow the same trend as June, where local sales rose by 2.8 per cent, while the restaurants registered even the highest drop.
Giro at restaurants fell by 1.8% in June, and it got worse further in July.
Bars and locals with key drinking activity recorded the best performance, with higher increases than the reduction of trade in restaurants.
The main food supplies were also recognized as a result of solar weather, though not as significant as restaurants.
It seems that people just want to get out of here for a drink.
Drinks in bars and locals increased by 6.6 percent that month, while food fell by three percent."
Paul Newman, free-time analyst and hospitality analyst in RSM, said: "These results confirm the tendencies we've seen since late April.
When it comes to sales on the unsalked market, the weather and the impact of important social events or sports remain the main factors.
Not surprisingly, restaurant groups continue to face difficulties, although a 4.8 per cent drop in sales per year will have a particularly heavy burden, considering persistent cost pressure.
The long and hot wine could not come at a more difficult moment for food operators, and time will show whether August's average temperatures would provide excessive calm."
Total sales increases in local and restaurants, including the newly opened ones, were 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the slowdown in marketing in brands.
The Coffer Peach index of industry sales, for the MB's bar and restaurant sector, collects and analyzes data from 47 societies, with a total film of more than 9 billion GBP, and it's an industry reference point.
One in five children has secret accounts in social media hiding from their parents
According to one study, one in five children - some of them -- not more than 11 years old — have secret accounts in social media hiding from their parents and teachers.
An survey of 20,000 nine-year education students shows increased profiles "false Int"
This news has increased the fear of postings with sexual content
Twenty percent of students stated they have a "poverty" account showing their parents
In one of five children — some of them less than 11 years old — are taking an account into social media, which is being used in secret to adults.
An survey of 20,000 nine-year-old education students revealed rapid growth in "Intat" profiles - related to the page for photo distribution, Intagram.
This news has increased the fear of posting with sexual content.
Twenty per cent of students said they use a clean "presidial" account showing their parents, but also have private accounts.
A mother who accidentally discovered her 13-year-old secret account found that a teenager urged others "to rape her."
Digital Awaress UK and Laws Conference ("Heedmasters and Headistes" Conference - HMC) found that 40 per cent of the group had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having secret accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said, "It is disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create social spaces where parents and teachers cannot find them."
Elidd Doyle will be "the team of athletes" on the Atlantic board of Scotland.
Elidd Doyle has been chosen on the Atlantic board in Scotland, in the post of the non-existant director of this organisation during the annual meeting of the general assembly.
Doyle is the most decorated track and field athlete and mayor Ian Beattite described this decision as a great opportunity for all sports leaders to benefit from its extensive experience at international level over the past decade.
"Elid enjoys massive respect in the athletic community in Scotland, UK and the world, and we are sure that athletics in Scotland will greatly benefit from doing that part of the board," Beattye said.
Doyle said, "I'm excited that I'm going to serve as the sound of athletes, and I hope I'm going to contribute and help run the sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200m and 400m competition at the Games in Atlanta in 1996, with four complete Olympic gold medals and which is a regular BBC expert, lost the ability to walk after a temporary accident.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time will tell if I will recover and to what extent.
It took a hard work, but I managed to recover fully, I learned to walk again, and today I'm doing street training!
Thank you for encouraging messages!"
Bay pumping declaration comparing mothers to cows shares public opinion
A society on breast pumps has divided public opinion with a commercial that compares mothers to cows' milk.
To start promoting what is considered "the first pump of breastless in the world and that can be worn," consumer technology products society Elvie showed a gas music video to promote the freedom that this new pump of mothers who need to freely express themselves.
Four real mothers dance in a cow stable filled with grass under the sound of a text song as follows: "Yes, I do, but I don't have a tail," and "if you didn't notice, these are not like, it's my chest."
Refrene continues, "Pop it, pump it, feed the baby, pump it, pump it, pick up the ladies."
However, the ads, which is published on the firm's Facebook page, have caused online controversy.
With 770,000 glances and hundreds of comments, the video has received friendly reactions from viewers, with many saying it underestimates the milk industry.
"Useing cows to advertise this product is a very weak decision.
The same is true of us as they need to remain "courage" and "born" to produce milk, only because their "babes" are taken from them a few days after they are born," someone wrote.
Evy/Mother breast pumps inside recipes and doesn't fall into sight. (Evy/Mother)
Another commented: "Absolutely traumatic about mother and child.
Why don't we use it to advertise a breast pump for mothers who can hold their babies?"
Another guy added, "What kind of advertising without sensitivity."
Others supported the commercial, among whom a woman agreed that the song sounded "unsanely funny."
"I think this is a genius idea.
I would've bought one if you still feed the kid with the breasts.
The pump made me feel just like a cow.
The statement is a little crazy but I saw what it means.
This is a genius product," someone wrote.
Another commented: "This is a gas commercial pointing towards mothers using the pump -- sometimes in the workplace or in the toilet -- and they feel like "pilly."
This is not a commercial that values or judges the milk industry."
At the end of the video, the women's group shows that they have all danced with the "spoiled" pump set in recipets.
The concept hidden behind this campaign is based on data that many femalepoxists feel that cowed.
However, the Elvie pump is quiet, there is no string or pipe, is placed inside the recipes and does not fall into sight, giving women the freedom to move, keeping their babies out while they use it.
Anna Balarin, partner and ECD (Dejetre Credit Executive) in Mother commented: "The pumpa Elvis is a product so revolutionary that he deserved a bold and provocative promotion.
By making a parallel between women who want to express freely and milk cows, we wanted to point out the use of breast pumps and challenges that confront them, also in a way of entertainment and similar to the extraordinary sense of freedom that the new pump gives.
This is not the first time that the Elvie pump comes out on the front page.
During London’s fashion week, a mother of two appeared in the gym of the styleist Martha Yakuboski using the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children moved silently to a tent camp at Texas border
The number of forbidden immigrants has increased even though the monthly number of crossings at the border has remained relatively equal, partly as a result of strict rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration that have made it difficult to send children to their supporters.
Usually most supporters have been immigrants without documents themselves, and have been afraid to risk their position in the country by trying to apply for a child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced potential supporters and other adults of the same family would have to deliver fingerprints, and these data would also pass to immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official of the immigration and Customs Agency, testified before the Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied to support unique minors.
Later, the agency confirmed that 70 per cent of those arrested had no previous penal precedent.
"About 80 per cent of individuals who are supporters or members of the supporters' family stand in the country illegally, and a large part of them are foreigners with criminal precedents.
So, we are continuing to follow these individuals," said Mr. Albence.
According to housing workers, attempting to process child data more quickly, officials introduced new regulations that asked some of them to appear in court within a month from the time of the ban, and not after 60 days, as was the previous standard.
Many will appear before immigration judges through video-conferencies and not physically, to argue their request for legal status.
Those who do not qualify will be deported immediately.
According to housing workers and reports taken from the system in recent months, the longer the children remain forbidden, the more likely they are to feel anxious or depressed, which could lead to violent explosions or attempts to escape.
Supporters say that these concerns are more severe in the larger environments such as Turin, where, due to the size of a child, they are more likely to overlook signs showing that a child has difficulty.
They add that moving children into the interior city without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or to say good-bye to friends could cause trauma that many of them already face.
Syria urges American, French and Turkish invaders to withdraw immediately
During his speech at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Waldid al-Mousaleam also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country has already entered the eighth year.
Mowalem, who also holds the post of deputy prime minister, says foreign forces stay in the Syrian land illegally, with the fact that they fight terrorism, and that "they will act with them in the right way."
"They must immediately and unconditionally withdraw," he declared during the assembly.
Moqualemz insisted that "the fight against terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360 people have been killed since 2011, and millions more have been deported from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue "to fight in this sacred battle until we have cleansed all Syrian territories" both by terrorist groups and "inlawless foreign forces."
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, who primarily train and advise Kurdish forces and Arab Syrians who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the territory of this country divided by the war.
For the refugee issue, Moualem said conditions are good for them to return, and blamed "some Western countries" that "promising irrational fears" that prompt refugees to stay away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate their return," he said.
"They are politicizing a case which should be completely humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union have warned they will not provide assistance for the reconstruction of Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a neutral zone in the last large fortress of rebels in Idlib has created opportunities to move ahead with political discussions.
The Russia-Turkey deal avoided a wide range of Syrian forces supported by Russia in this province, where three million people live.
Moualem noted, however, that the deal had "clear guidance" and expressed confidence that military attacks would mark the jihadists, including fighters from Fronti Nusera related to Al-Qaeda, who "will be destroyed".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to call the first meeting of a new committee composed of members of the government and opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and lead the way for the elections.
Moquam presented the conditions for government participation in this committee, saying the work of the panel should be limited "to review the provisions of the current constitution," and warned there is no interference.
Why Trump will win a second mandate
According to this logic, Mr. Trump will be elected in 2020 in addition to the case when, as many people with liberal views hope, accusations and scandals end his presidency before the time.
In what would undoubtedly be "the most dramatic end of a presidency in history!"
So far, there are no signs of publisher fatigue.
Since 2014, the number of viewers during the peak watch has doubled to 1,05 million in CNN and has nearly tripled to 1.6 million in MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has reached the peak of 2.4 million viewers during the peak peak peak, from 1.7 million that was four years ago, while the MSNBC programme, "The Rachel Maddew Square", has reached the peak of a 3.5 million cable channels on large evenings.
"This is a fire, which people withdraw because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Bayer, director of the drama series at the ABC "Dissigated Survior", which tells the story of a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys capitol.
Nell Scovell, an old comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Fow Hard Trusts Square Intending the Hollywood Boys," there is another theory.
She remembers a taxi trip to Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver told him he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? She asked her.
He had answered, "Because it makes me laugh," Mrs. Slovell told me.
There's funny values in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, the stories that come from Washington can determine the future of Roy v. Wade, if immigrant families can unite and health of the global economy.
Ignorement is a luxury that only can afford the most privileged viewers.
Yet, if you find yourself in six hours, looking at a panel of experts arguing on the use of "infected information" by Bob Woodard in his book "Fear," Paul Manurafort's mite jacket, worth 15,000,000 (A USD) worth," said The Washington Post, as well as the vivid descriptions of Stonestones, then this goes beyond a citizenship.
At least I'll never see Super Mario again in the same way.
"A part of what he does and makes it look like a 'rereality show', is that he feeds you with something every night," said Brant Montgomery, executive director of the Wheelhouse Energy and creator of "Pun Stars," regarding actors who are circuiting and unexpected daily developments of the Trump (Fbattres.FL.E.) programme.
You can't leave an episode without seeing or you're left behind.
When I went to Mr. Fleiss this week, the weather was sunny and the temperature outside was 80 degrees outside of his home on the northern coast of Kaua, but he was hiding inside, looking at the MSNBC, while recording CNN.
He could not leave, not while Brett Kavanauugh would face the Senate Justice Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hanging on the stairs.
"I remember when we fulfilled all those crazy programmes in the past and the people who said, "This is the last beginning of Western civilization," Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke but it proved that they were right."

Money from outside the private sector flows into close competition for Congress elections
It is not surprising that the 17th area of Pennsylvania is facing a flood of money, as a result of the reorganisation of electoral areas that force two officials in charge to compete for the same post.
This recent reorganisation in the suburban areas of Pittsburgh has imposed representative Konor Lamb -- which won the post in another area -- in the special elections last spring.
Lamb is running against another candidate, the republic Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the 12 old zone of Pennsylvania, whose new area has been dominated by 17.
This new division of maps came after the Pensilvana Supreme Court's decision, which, in January, said the old areas were assigned in a way non-convincing and unfair in favor of the Republicans.
This competition, in the new area 17, has also prompted a strong deal in financing campaigns from party financing organs, the Democratic Committee for Congress Fields (DCC) and the Republican National Committee for Fields (NRCC).
Lamb became a popular name in Pennsylvania after a narrow score in the late March special elections, for the 18th Albanian electoral zone.
For more than a decade, it was held by the Republicans and President Donald Trump won this area by 20 points.
Political experts view Democrats as easy favour.
US takes into account to penalise El Salvador for support for China, then withdraws
Diplomats confirmed that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognised Beijing, with little push from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until partners expelled the Trump Organisation's management team.
State Department officials decided to remove American heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, Dominican Republic and Panama due to "the recent decisions not to recognise Taiwan anymore," said department spokeswoman Heat Naurt, during a statement earlier this month.
But the penals were considered only against El Salvador, which received a assistance of some 140 million USS from America in 2017, including for control of narcotics, development and economic support.
The proposed measures, including reductions of financial aid and specific restrictions in visa delivery, would be serious for the country of Central America and for its high levels of unemployment and murder.
While interior meetings reached progress, officials of North and Central America's countries postponed a high-level conference with security and economic well-being to attend a similar meeting last year, a move considered as a step forward in efforts to prevent immigrants from moving towards the United States.
But in mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear they wanted the conference to be held, ending any opportunity to impose criminality on El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence has planned to give a speech at the conference, which is projected in mid-October, a signal that shows the importance that the administration costs this meeting, diplomats said.
And all three American envoys returned quietly from El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without strong messages or punishments from Washington.
A White House official for Mr. Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to talk about domestic discussions, provided that their privacy be preserved.
Their accounts were confirmed by an analyst near the administration, who also spoke, demanding the right to anonymousity.
Study the History
The next expected event may be Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller's report for possible hostages from Mr. Trump, for which there is considerable evidence in public data.
It is reported that Mr. Mueller is shifting his investigation to prove whether during his campaign, Mr. Trump has co-operated with Russia in the attack on our elections.
If Congress changes side by side, Mr. Trump will have to render an account before this body, at a time when it is prepared to rise back to voters, and may eventually face an independent jury.
These are too much if, and I don't want to suggest that Mr. Trump -- or that of his counterparts in Europe, it's inevitable.
All of us, from both Atlantic sides, should make choices that will affect how long the conflict will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to commit coups against Hitler, if the West had resisted and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed, and lost the opportunity to avoid years of the massacre that followed.
The course of history depends on these turning points, which speed up or delay the inadequate path of democracy.
Currently, Americans are facing some of these turning points.
What will we do if Mr. Trump downloads Deputy Prosecutor General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls your investigation to Mr. Mueller?
Rosenstein has not been in a difficult situation since this newspaper reported last year, that he had suggested to listen secretly to the president and had speculated that he was not appropriate to remain in office.
Mr. Rosenstein said The Times article is not accurate.
"How will we respond if the new investigation sought by the F.B.I. for Bret Kavanugh is not complete or fair - or if he is confirmed at the Supreme Court despite accusations based on sexual attacks and false evidence?
And most of all, will we vote in the upcoming elections for a Congress that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we fail in these tests, then democracy will face a long winter.
But, I think we won't fail because of the lessons I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jewish woman from Czechoslovakia, who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that invaded the residence of ambassadors I visited.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later, she sent me to light candles on that table bearing the symbol of swastica.
Having this heritage, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Rangers player Graham Dorrans is optimistic before facing Rapid Winna
On Thursday, Rangers expect Rapid Winna, knowing that a victory in front of the Austrians, following the striking equality in Spain in front of Villaral, earlier this month, would place them in a favourable position to qualify in the Group of Europe's League.
A knee damage didn't allow Middle Eastern Graham Dorans to make the first appearance this season in equality 2-2 to Vilagraral, but he believes Ringers could use it as a result of pushing it to achieve bigger things.
"It was an important point for us because Vitalal is a good team," the 31-year-old said.
"We entered the field, believing that we could get something and get out with a point.
We may have written in the end, but in general, I believe that equality was a good result.
Maybe they were better in the first part while we showed up in the second and we were the best team.
On Thursday, it will be another big European evening.
I hope we can get three points but it will be a tough fight because they achieved a positive result in their last fight, but, with fans supporting us, I'm sure we can move forward and get a positive result.
Last year was very difficult, due to the injuries and changes in the club, but now there is a factor of optimism on this team.
The team is fine, and the boys are enjoying it a lot; training is good.
I hope we can move forward, throw the last season behind our backs, and achieve success."
Women sleep less as a result of fear of retirement savings
Regardless of how we wanted family members to care for us, very few people spoke to them about it.
About half of the individuals in the Nation’s study said they spoke with their mates about long - term care costs.
Only 10 per cent said they spoke to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't talk about it," said Holly Snyder, vice president of society for the security of life, Nation.
That's where we have to start.
Talk to your mate and children: You cannot prepare your family for your concerns if you do not first show your own wishes.
Work with your counselor and family, and discuss where and how to take care, as these choices may be an important factor in determining costs.
Also take your financial adviser: the adviser can help you find a way to pay expenses.
The options for financing long-term care include a traditional insurance policy for long-term care, hybrid police for life insurance policy with training to help cover these costs or self-determination through your wealth - as long as you have money.
Prepare legal documents: Avoid legal battles through a authorization.
Take a call for health care, and assign a trusted person to monitor your health care and ensure that experts act in harmony with your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
Also consider taking a ticket to your finances.
Choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions in your name and guarantee the payment of bills if you can't do it on your own.
Remember the little details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Are you able to answer the questions about allergies and medications that you get?
Prepare a written plan with these details so that you can be ready.
"It's not only the financial aspect, but also who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
"What medications will they use?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Prepare this plan."
One person gets shot several times by air rifles in Ilfrecombe
A man was shot several times with an air rifle while he went home after spending the night outside.
The victim, about 40-years, was in the Oxford Grove area, in Ilfrecombe, Duvon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
Police officers stated that this was a "crambled event", which occurred about 2:30 BST.
The victim didn't see the striker.
The abuses taken make no risk for life, and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died as a result of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian town of Palu on Friday, officials have declared that the deaths are expected to rise.
With communications networks outside the office, assistance workers have failed to obtain information from the Donggala regenda climate, an area in the north of Palu, which was closer to the magnitude of the 7.5 earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000,000 people have been evacuated after this disaster.
Below you have some facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulse:
Pallu is the capital of the central Sunwes province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulses, with the population of some 379,000 people in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when it was hit by the earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala is a regenercial that extends to more than 300 miles (80 km) inland to the northwest island of Sulses.
Regenes, a smaller administrative region than the province, had an estimated population of about 299 200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fish and jewelry are the province's main economic activities, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
nikeling is also important in the province, but it's mainly focused on Morowali, on the other side of the Sunward coast.
According to the Agency for the Protection of Disasters in Indonesia, Palu and Donggala have been hit several times by tsunami over the past 100 years.
In 1938 a tsunami claimed more than 200 lives and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
In 1996, another tsunami struck the western part of Donggala, causing nine victims.
Indonesia is situated in the earthquake - prone area of the Pacific Fire Wanza and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Below you find a few of the greatest earthquakes andaunames of the last few years:
2004: On December 26th, a powerful earthquake on the western coast of Aceh in Indonesia, in the northern part of Sumatra, caused a tsunami that struck 14 states, causing 226,000 victims along the Indian Ocean line, from which more than half lived in Achim.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes struck the western coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds lost their lives on the island of Nias Island, on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake measuring 6,8 hit the south of Java, Indonesia's most popular island, causing a tsunami that crashed on the southern coast, and took the lives of about 700 people.
2009: An earthquake measuring 7.6 in the vicinity of the town of Padang, the capital of the western province of Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck one of the islands of Mentawai, in Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 feet [10 m] high that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the Piedie Yaya regime in Aceh, bringing destruction and panic in people after it reminded them of the deadly earthquake and tsunami caused by the 2004 earthquake.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people lost their lives in the collapse of buildings.

The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily blocked thousands of tourists.
Sarah Paul’s eldest son was arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Paulin, the great son of the former Alasca Governor and deputy candidate for president, Sarah Paulin, has been arrested on charges of aggression.
According to a report submitted on Saturday by the state police of Alaska, Paulin, 29, from Wisła, Alaska, was arrested as suspected of domestic violence, preventing domestic violence reporting, and for opposing arrest.
According to the police report, when a female known as his wife tried to call the police to report alleged crimes, he received the phone.
Paul is being held at the Mat-Su detention building and is being held a guarantee in the form of unrecognizable bonds worth 500 dollars, KTUU reported.
According to reports of this network, he appeared in court on Saturday, and when asked about acceptance of guilt, he said he "is absolutely innocent".
Paul faces three violations of the category A, which means he can be imprisoned by up to a year and the equivalent of $25,000.
He is also charged with a category violation of B, which is sentenced to one day in prison and $2,000 fines.
It is not the first time a criminal charge against Paul.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Paul.
His mother, Sarah Paulin, called the police to report the attack.
This issue is currently under consideration by the Court of Vetours in Alaska.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, reports of domestic violence, and armed resistance during the incident.
His girlfriend had claimed he had hit her with his fist in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Paul was criticised by veterans ’ groups after linking her son’s violent behavior with PSD (PROS) as a result of the service in Iraq.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia: Hundreds dead
At least 384 people have lost their lives on Friday, as a result of an earthquake striking the Indonesian island of Sulses.
The 7.5 - magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
The power and communication waves are out of service, and the death toll is expected to increase over the next few days.
The earthquake hit the central part of Sulwesis, which is northeast of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
Social media broadcast videos that show the moment of the shock.
Hundreds of people were gathered for a festival on the beach in the town of Palu, when the tsunami struck the shore.
Federal prosecutors demand rare death sentences for alleged terrorist attack in NYC
Federal prosecutors in New York but seek death sentences for Sayfulo Saipov, suspected of terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people -- a rare sentence that has not been given for a federal crime since 1953.
In October, Saippov, 30, is supposed to have used a rented truck of Home Depot to carry out a terrorist attack on a bicycle road along the western highway, down Manhattan, violating foot and cricles.
To justify the death sentence, prosecutors must confirm that Saippov has killed eight victims "with premeditation" and that it has caused serious body injuries "with premeditation", according to the letter to seek the death sentence, predicted in New York's southern district.
According to a court document, for both of these charges could be sentenced to death.
Several weeks after the attack, a large federal jury placed Saippov in front of 22 indictments, including eight counts of murder in aid of organised crime, charges often used by prosecutors in organised crime cases, and a charge for violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
This attack has resulted in "a considerable and premeditated planning," prosecutors expressed, describing the way of execution of crime by Saipov as "detestable, cruel and without moral."
"Syfulo Habibulavic Saipov caused injuries, injury and loss of Diego's families and friends Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Clevet, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darrerake Erlley, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego, and Ale Pandou," writes in the goal letter.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
A decade has passed since New York's southern district suffered a death penalty case.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was sentenced to murder two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was used on a federal issue in New York City was in 1953 for Julius and El El El Elle Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after being executed after being sentenced to conspiracy and spying on the Soviet Union for profit two years before the Cold War.
Both were executed in electric chairs on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipipov, with Ukrainian nationality, did not show any confusion during days and months after the attack.
He has declared before investigators that he feels good about what he has done, police reported.
According to the indictment, Saigov told authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after he saw ISIS videos on his cell phone.
Police said he had also sought to place the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
He has declared he is innocent for 22 indictments.
David Patton, one of the public lawyers representing Saigov, said they are "very disappointed with the prosecutor's decision.
"We think that the decision to seek the death sentence and not to submit to life imprisonment without appeal will increase the trauma caused by these events in all involved," Patton said.
Saigov's defence team had previously asked prosecutors not to seek death sentences.
Konservato Party MP NIGEL FRAGE should be placed at the helm of Brex's negotiations
Nigel Farage promised today, during a protest at the Conservators' conference, that he will "mobiise the army of the people".
The former UKI leader said politicians should 'press' Euroskpics--because one of the deputies of Theresa May suggested he should be at the helm of negotiations with the EU.
In March, the Conservator Peter Bonne said in Birmingham that the UK 'would be out' if Brex Secretary were Mr. Farage.
But the challenge facing Mrs. May to join its group is pointed out by pro conservatives in the EU, who joined another protest in the city against Brex.
The prime minister is facing difficulties in implementing the plan to compromise to Chequers, amid attacks stemming from those who want to stay or withdraw from the European Union, as well as from the EU themselves.
The Allies insist it will try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite severe reactions – and will force Eurosskopics and laserists to choose between its package and chaos.
During the march, it means far away, Mr. Bonne said she wanted to abandon Chequers' agreement.
He suggested that Mr. Farage should come to the top and be given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
'If he was at the top, we'd be out now,' he said.
Wellingbough's Depute added: 'I will support Brex but we must abandon Chequers' agreement.
Expressing his stance against the EU, he said: 'We did not fight in world wars to be in subjection.
We want to create our laws in our country.'
Mr. Bonne rejected suggestions that public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: 'The idea that the British have changed their mind and wish to stay in the EU is entirely unfair.'
The Senator Andrea, who supports Brex, was also on the march and told reporters: 'I just wanted to say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
'Kiquers' agreement is not supported by the general public, the opposition will not vote, does not support either within our party, and by activists who fill roads and vote on us.
Please, abandon Chequers and start listening.'
In a message directed to Mrs. May, she added: 'Kriminnists keep the job place in times when they keep promises.'
Mr. Farage said during the march that politicians should "press" if they are thinking of abandoning the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
'Now, this is a matter related to trust between us people and our political class,' he said.
'They're trying to betray Brex and we're here today to say 'we won't let you do something like that'.
During a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: 'I want you to force our political class, which is close to leaving Brex, to feel pressure.
'We are mobilizing the army of this country's people who gave us victory in Brex and we will not stop until the United Kingdom is independent, proud and government itself.'
Meanwhile, those pros marched into Birmingham before holding a rally that lasted two hours in the center of the city.
A small group of activists held the banners, which were written against Brex after the weekend presentation of this group.
The supporters of Lord Adonis insulation the conservatives about the security problems they had with a "recognizable application" during the launch of the conference.
'These are the people who tell us that they can prepare TI systems and technology needed for "Canada plus plus plus plus," for open borders, for free trade with Ireland without borders, he added.
It's totally a lighthouse.
There's no such thing as a good Brex,' he said.
Warren plans to "consider carefully" the possibility of running for presidents
US Senator Elizabeth Warren has declared he will "consider carefully the possibility of running for president" after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that Massachusetts' democratic senator spoke of her future during a meeting in the municipality, held on Saturday in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a continuing critic of President Donald Trump, runs to be re-elected in November against the republic Geoff Diehl, who was co-ordinator of the Trump campaign in 2016, in Massachusetts.
It has been central to speculation that it can run in front of Trump in 2020.
The scheduled Saturday afternoon meeting in Holyoke was its 36th meeting with voters according to municipal format, since Trump came to the top.
One of the participants asked whether he planned to run for President.
Warren replied that the time has come for "the souls to go to Washington and fix the broken government, and that includes the establishment of a woman at the top."
Arrested person for killing LSU team player Wyde Sims
Police in Batton Romage, La., announced on Saturday, that he has arrested a suspect for the murder of Warde Sims basketball player on Friday.
Twoton Simpson, 20, has been arrested about 11 o'clock in the morning, Police Department in Baton Rogue announced through a media conference.
The police had released a shooting video on Friday, asking for help to identify the person who appeared there.
Sims, 20, was shot with firearms and killed near the campus of South University at Friday morning.
"Waade Sims changed lives as a result of the wounds of firearms caused to the head," said on Saturday for 247sports, Police Chief Murpy J. Paul.
Wade intervened to protect his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted he was on the scene, carrying a gun, and shooting Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incidents and sent to detention in the police department in the eastern area of Batton Rogue.
Sims, 6'6's, played 32 matches, of which 10 as title, last season, with an average of 17,4 minutes, 5,6 points and 2.9 balls on the game board.
Russia's Grand Prize: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title after team instructions give Sebastian Vettel victory
As soon as Walter Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that Mercedes's team instructions would play a significant role in this contest.
Bottas left the first country and almost "tried" Hamilton after defending his position on the first two rounds and invited Vetel to attack his team friend.
Vetel was the first to make a stop and left Hamilton to compete in "traffick" at the end of the car collection, something that should have brought crucial results.
Mercedes made the stop later and positioned after Vetel, but Hamilton came to the top after some maneuvers that forced the Ferrari pilot to leave the inside behind after a double movement to protect in the third turn.
Max Verstappen started the race from the last row and at the end of the first tour was seventh on the day of his 21st birthday.
Then he was in charge in a large section of the race, which did not change tires to reach a quick finish and passed Kimie Raikconen by ranked fourth.
Eventually, he stopped at the 44th tour, but failed to improve the pace in the remaining eight tours, leaving the fourth Rikconen country.
It's a tough day because Walter did a fantastic job all weekend, and he was a real gentleman who let me through.
The team has done an extraordinary job with these positions exchanges," Hamilton said.
We used very weak body language
President Donald Trump urged Senator Diane Feinstein during a rally Saturday, concerning her insistence, that it was not the person who "in the square" Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing the candidate for the Supreme Court, Brettn Kavanugh, of sexual assault.
During a speech at a rally in Western Virginia, the president did not directly refer to the testimony given by Ford in front of the Senate Justice Committee, but said what was happening in the Senate shows that people are "laws, bad and dishonest."
"The only thing that can happen and the beauty of what's going on in the Senate over the last few days is when you look at anger, when you see people who are angry, evil, evil and virtuous," he said.
"When you see the publications I secretly and then the people who say "oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Remember?
Diane Feinstein, were you taking her to the square?
Remember her answer... did you release the document-- "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't get it out."
Wait a minute.
Don't we... No, we didn't get it out," he said, imitating the senator.
In July, Feinstein was sent letters with details of charges against Kawanauugh from Ford, and the document was released earlier in September - but Feinstein denied that the information had come out of her office.
"I did not hide Dr. Ford's charges, I didn't take her history into the square," Feinstein told the commission, The Hill reported.
"She asked me to keep it secret and I kept it such as she asked me to."
But apparently her denial was not acceptable to the president, who commented during the Saturday evening debate: "In my opinion, the gestures really left for wish.
Maybe he didn't, but I've never seen the worst gestures before."
Taking the candidate for the Supreme Court, who has been charged by three women for outstanding sexual conduct, the president said the Democrats are using alleged charges to reach their goals.
"They are determined to regain power at any cost.
Look at wickedness and uncleanness. They don't care who they hurt, who should step down to take over power and control," Mediati reported as saying by the president.
Liga Elite: Dondane Stars 5-3 Belfast Gands
Patrick Dwrell marks twice for Gyants versus Dudee
Dude Stars compensated the victory against Belfast Giantas on Friday, at the valid challenge for the Elite League, winning the 5-3 return match in Dudee on Saturday.
The Gyantis quickly passed on to double advantage, thanks to Patrick Dwer's kicks and Francis Beauvilleer.

Francisco Bouchard equated Dudee before the two goals of Lucas Ludwald Nissen to secure victory.
This was the third loss of the season in the Elga, to the believers of Adam Keefe, who on Friday evening, returned from the disadvantage to defeat Dudee 2-1, in Belfast.
This was the fourth match between these teams, this season, with the first three won by Gants.

Air traffic control loses its life by ensuring that hundreds of people on an airplane escape the earthquake.
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is being honored as a hero after losing his life by making sure that a aircraft carrying hundreds of people safely sit down.
Over 800 people lost their lives, and many others have been reported missing since a major earthquake struck the island of Sulses on Friday, thus causing a tsunami.
Strong waves continue to bother the area, and many people are trapped in ruins in the town of Palu.
But despite his colleagues fled to escape, 21-year-old Antonis Gunwan Agung refused to leave his post at the hastily shaken control tower at the Pallu airport "Mutara Sis Alfridi Airport".
He stayed to make sure that the 6321 Bakik Air flight plane, who was on the track at that moment, could travel safely.
Then he was thrown out of the traffic control tower when he thought it was falling.
He lost his life in the hospital later.
US spokesman Navir Navi prepared Indonesia", Yohannes Siri, said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australia's ÉABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Baklikpani to Calimantian to take him to a bigger hospital in another town.
Unfortunately, he lost his life this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
"This news breaks our soul," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the number of deaths could reach thousands of people, while the local agency for facilitating disaster consequences says entry into the towns of Donggala, Siggi and Boutong is limited.
▪ It is believed that this number will continue to increase, since there are still many bodies under the rubble, while others have not been found," said agency spokesman Sutopo Puro Nugroho.
The wounds that reached up to six feet [six m] have destroyed Palula, where a massive mary ceremony will be held on Friday.
Military and commercial planes are bringing supplies and aid.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, said about Vojislavsky News." "Every minute the ambulance brings troops.
There's no clean water.
Mine-marts have been plundered everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesianese Red Cross is rushing to help survivors, but we don't know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get even worse."
Indonesia's president, Joko Wido, arrived in Palu on Sunday and addressed the country's army, "I'm asking you to work day and night to carry out any duties related to evacuation.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia was hit by earthquakes earlier in Lombok, where more than 550 people lost their lives.
A plane crash in Micronesia: "Air Niugin" now says one person has lost after a plane crashed into the harbor.
The airline that ran a plane that crashed into the Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now announced a missing person, as it had previously declared that all 47 passengers and crew had been evacuated from the water - diving aircraft.
In a press statement, Nár Niugini said that Saturday afternoon they were not finding a passenger.
The airline said it was co-operating with local authorities, hospitals and investigators trying to find the person.
The airline did not immediately respond to requirements for further information on the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
The local boat helped save passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water, trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
On Friday, officials said seven persons were associated with the hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in hospital on Saturday and that all of them were stable.
The cause of the confrontation and the very consequences of events remain unclear.
The airline and American navy said the plane landed in the sink after it didn't reach the track.
Some witnesses thought that the plane passed the track.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane went down too low.
"This is an extremely good thing," said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that through the water that had reached the betrothal level, he and others managed to reach the emergency exits of the plane.
He said the guards were in panic and screaming, while he suffered a slight injury to his head.
The American Navy said the sailors working in fixing a skeleton nearby helped save them, using a boat of air to transport people to the shore before the plane dived to about 30 feet [30 m] under water.
Data from the Air Safety Network shows that 111 people have lost their lives in clashes with PNG air lines recorded in the last two decades, but Ér Her Niugin was not involved in any of them.
The analyst builds night chronology when a woman dies alive
On Saturday the prosecutor presented her arguments in the rejuvenating of a person who is accused of burning a woman alive from Mississippi in 2014.
US Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours in the quality of the expert in the field of data analysis.
He explained to the jury how he had used phone records to rebuild the defendant's moves, 29-year-old Quinton Tellys, and victim 19-year-old Jessica Chambers, the night this last changed lives.
According to reports by The Clarion Ledger, Rogert said he has received information from several mobile phones showing Telley was with Chambers in the afternoon of her death, in fact the one who rejects his previous claims.
When the data found that his cell phone was the same place as Chambers during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, then the police went to talk to this latter.
Sanford appeared in court on Saturday and testified that he was not in town that day.
When asked by prosecutors if Telces was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that evening, the last one said "he's lying because my truck was in Nashville."
Another disagreement is Telish's statement, which said Chambers had recognised about two weeks before she died.
The phone tablets showed they had only a week they knew each other.
Rockett said that shortly after Chambers' death, Telis had deleted messages, calls and contact data from his phone.
"He wiped it out of his life," Hale said.
The protective side is designed to provide symbiotic arguments Sunday.
The judge declared that the jury would make the verdict that day.
What's the conscious hip?
A three-member hippie group seeks to challenge the negative views of the sound by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claim that the hip hop has departed from its origin of political messages and the messages they discussed social issues.
They want to go back to their origin and get back to their conscious hip.
In the UK, a review of artists like The Fugees and Common has been observed, unlike by artists such as Akala and Lokey.
Another coloured man?
N.I.P.I.I.I.P.D. indictments the couple for leave after you get the "racist" message.
A babysitter from New Jorku has indicted a couple for discrimination at work leaving, having received a message sent by a mother mistakenly, who complains she was "a different coloured man."
The couple have denied to be racist, considering the indictment "defeated".
Lynne Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed her concern when she discovered that the new babysitter Gisele Maurice was a colored woman, the moment she showed up on the first day of work, in 2016.
"OHOOOOOOOOOOOO, a TURGY," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in his message.
However, instead of sending her husband away, she sent Mrs. Maurice twice.
According to the New York Post, after realizing its threat, Plasco-Flaxman, "felt awkward" fired Mrs. Maurice, with the reasoning that their current wedding, which was African-American, had done a weak job and that, instead, she wanted a shrink.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for her only day of work and was then sent home with a "cock in the pocket".
Now, Maurice is suing the couple for compensation for their leave, and he is seeking compensation at 350 dollars a day for a six-month period, for which she was hired for no contract.
"I want to show them that they should not do such things," she said on Friday for The Post, adding "I know it's discrimination."
The couple have denied claims that they are racist, saying that Maurice's departure was the right act, because they feared they couldn't trust him any longer after they offended him.
"My wife sent her something she didn't want to say.
She's not racist.
We are not racist," said Prime Minister Joel Plasco for The Post.
"But would you leave your children in the hands of a person to whom you have been rude, even though wrong?
Your newborn baby?
Tell me."
Viewing the indictment as "defence," Plasco said he and his wife had brought in a child, two months ago and were in a "very difficult situation."
"Can you avenge someone in this situation?
It's not something positive to be done," added Plasco, investment banker.
While the case has gone to court, public opinion has quickly denounced the couple in social media, criticising them for their behavior and logic.
A new letter shows that Daddyington's publishers were afraid readers would not create anything about a talking bear
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the acceptance of the book, said about this letter: "It is hard to put yourself in the place of a person who reads it for the first time before it was published.
We feel a great pleasure now that we have seen the extraordinary success of Padington."
She said her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC, before being inspired by a small toy bear to write the book for children, would have been grieved if his work were rejected, adding that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the book, after his death last year, contained "surpassing and happiness".
As for Padington, which she described as a "very important member of our family," she added that her father was very proud of the success.
"He was a quiet person and didn't brag," she said.
"Paddington was so real to him that it was like having a successful child: you feel proud of him even though it's not exactly your success.
I think that's how he saw Padington's success.
Although it was creation and its imagination, he always credited it to the character of Padington."
My daughter was changing lives, and I was forced to say goodbye to her by the phone.
After arriving, her daughter was rushed to Louis Pasten Hospital 2, in Nis, where doctors were trying to save her life but without results.
"Nad regularly called me to tell me it was too heavy, that he didn't believe he'd make it," said Mrs. Edna-Laperouse.
"Then I received a phone call from Nad who told me she would die within two minutes and that I should say goodbye.
And I did.
I said, "Tash, I love you so much, honey.
We'll be together soon.
We'll be together.
The medications that doctors had given her to keep her heart at work were losing the effect and were slowly leaving her system.
She had died a few years ago and now everything was being "contained".
I was forced to sit down and wait, knowing this was happening.
I could not mourn or scream because I was surrounded by family and friends.
I had to be tough."
In time, Mrs. Edna-Laperuse, grieving for the loss of her daughter, boarded a plane with other passengers--who were unaware of what she was experiencing.
"No one knew," she said.
"I kept my head down and cried all the time.
It's hard to explain, but during that flight, I felt a deep regret for Nad.
I felt he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Women carrying letters to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones in death are working to prevent others from being killed.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Hummres have posted e-mail messages on a Wells bridge, as well as phone numbers of people who can call for support.
Mrs. Davis's son was 13 when he started suffering from depression and killed himself at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parents to feel as I feel every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, with residence in Lüdney, said her son was a promising cook with a smile "infertile".
"Everyone knew about his smile.
People always said his smile lit up every room."
However, he gave up his job before changing lives, as it was "in a really dark moment."
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 years old at the time, was the person who found his brother after committing suicide.
Mrs. Davis said, "I constantly worry that there will be a domino effect."
Mrs. Davis created the papers, "that people may know there are people who can help and they can talk to, even with a friend.
Don't sit in solitary - you need to talk."
Mrs. Humphres, who has been Mrs. Davis's friend for many years, lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, not long after his mother died.
"He didn't say he felt sad, depressed, or something else," she said.
"Some day before Christmas we noticed the change in behavior.
He was extremely upset on Christmas Day -- when the children opened their presents, he didn't look into his eyes and did nothing."
She said his death was a great tragedy for them, but that they should pass: "It is something that destroys the whole family.
We were destroyed.
But we all have to go ahead and fight."

Bret Kavanugh's future depends on the east side after the FBI investigation begins.
"I thought that if we could give something similar to what it required -- a limited investigation in time and in the object -- maybe bring some harmony," said Mr. Flake on Saturday, adding that it was afraid the committee was "disbanding" between the numerous obstacles of opposers.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanugh and his Republican supporters want to investigate the FBI?
Their investigation comes all along as a result of time.
Congress elections are only five weeks away -- November 6th if the republics get bad, as expected, they will be greatly weakened in efforts to select the person who loves at the country's highest court.
George W. Bush called the senators, playing to support Mr. Kavanugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and through him met with Mr. Bush's wife, who was his personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI releases her report?
They will be voted in the Senate, where 51 republics and 49 Democrats currently exist.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanauugh could gather at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Deputy President Mike Pence to end this situation and confirm it at the Supreme Court.
Blee number of deserters in North Korea under Kim's leadership
The number of deserters in North Korea has fallen since Kim Jong came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker has declared.
Park Byeong-seug, quoting data from the Union's Ministry in South Korea, has claimed there were about 1127 deserts last year - compared to 2706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said the main factors were the strictest controls in the borders between North Korea and China, as well as the highest fees demanded by human beings traffickers.
Penny hasn't made public comments.
Most of the deserters from North Korea receive citizenship from South Korea.
Seoul has claimed that more than 30,000 people from North Korea have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most leave to China, which has the largest length of the border with North Korea, and can simply be passed there compared to the Ciligised Zone (DMZ) among the two Koreans, which is protected by numerous forces.
China considers immigrants illegal and not refugees as refugees, and often repeats force.
Relations between North and South Korea -- which technically still are in war -- have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, leaders of the two countries met in Peniane, and their talks focused on delayed negotiations for deletarianisation.
This meeting came after the June historic meeting between American President Donald Trump and Kim Jong, in Singapore, where they agreed, in general terms, to work for a Korean peninsula without nuclear weapons.
But Saturday, the North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Young-ho blamed the US sanctions for lack of progress by the moment.
"Without confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security, and in these circumstances, there is no chance that we, unilaterally, should dislocat first," Mr. Re said during a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Britt Kavanugh "hysteric", and says he is not worthy to serve at the Supreme Court.
The minority leader at the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called the Supreme Court's appointment Bret Kavanugh "hyster" and said that because of his temper, he was unable to serve at the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments on Saturday, during an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't think that if a woman had ever been brought like that, people would say 'hysteric'," said Pelosi for her response to Kavanuh's testimony to the Senate's Justice Committee on Thursday.
Kawanugh formally denied the charges that he had sexually attacked Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when both of them were teenagers.
During his promotional speech, Kawanugh was very concerned and at some point almost screaming or "caught up" when he talked about his family and his high school years.
He accused Democrats in front of the committee, calling them charges against him as "a shelling and co-ordinate of his image", organised by liberals angry by the death of Hillry Clinton in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelos expressed her opinion that Kawanugh's testimony provided evidence that he could not serve at the Supreme Court, as she showed his prejudice against the Democrats.
"I think he punished himself with those statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and Democrats", she said.
Pelosi hesitated to answer the question if he would try to give Kawanaugh a no-confidence motion in case of his appointment, and if the Democrats win most of the countries in the House of Representatives.
"Let me tell you -- if he's not telling the truth in front of Congress or the FBI, then he's inexplicable not only for the Supreme Court, but also for the court where he is now," Pelosi said.
Kavanugh is currently a judge at the Apel Court in Washington.
Pelosi added that, as Democrats, was concerned about Kawanugh's decisions against the Law for face-to-face care or the Roe-Wade issue, as he is considered a conservative judge.
In the hearing of his appointment, Kawanauugh avoided questions about whether to abolish certain Supreme Court decisions.
"It is not the time for a hysterical and unilateral person to become a member of the court and wait for us to say, "How good!" Pelosi said.
And women have to use it.
This is a righteous verbal attack, months and years of anger that flares up, and it cannot lead to the end without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," Mrs. Stinem said to me 45 years later.
"I don't think this is weird.
She went on to say, "I was greatly helped by a woman who worked in a leadership position, who said that she also cried when she was angry, but had developed a style that was as often as she would get angry and start crying, telling the co-ordinators, "You might think I'm upset and so I'm crying.
But I'm actually angry."
And then she kept talking.
And I thought this was a brilliant idea."
Tears are a way of expressing anger, partly because they are completely misunderstood.
One of my most vivid memories of an old job, in an office where men prevailed, where at one point I found myself crying out of angerless anger, was the moment when a larger woman caught me to the throat - a cold manager that I always had a little fear - pushed me towards the stairs.
"Never let others see you crying," she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're upset and they'll be glad they succeeded in getting you upset."
Patresia Schroder, then a Democratic member of the Colorado Congress, had worked with Gary Hart at his candidacy for the President.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was found in the middle of an underground relationship on the board of a boat called "Monkey Business" and was taken outside the race, Mrs. Schroder, extremely angry, realized that there was no reason why he didn't think he would run for presidents himself.
"This wasn't a well-to-do decision," she said laughing, 30 years later.
"In the race were already seven other candidates, and the last thing they needed was a more candidate.
Someone called it "Borbarbary and Seven Judjat".
Since the campaign was in its last phases, she was left behind the fund collection, so she vowed she would not compete if she failed to raise $2m.
But it was a useless war.
She found that some of her supporters who gave 1,000 dollars to the men, only $250.
"Don't you think I got any discounts?" she asked herself.
During the talk that he declared that he would not develop an official campaign, she was so overwhelmed with emotion — gratitude for people who supported him — the strong heart of the system that made it so difficult for the collection of money and the recognition of voters instead of delegates, and anger with sex - that she drowned.
"It seemed like I had suffered a nervous crisis," Mrs. Schroder recalled regarding the way the press reacted to it.
"It looked like Kleinex was my sponsoring corporation.
I remember thinking what people would write on my gravestone?
"She cried?"
U.S.K. trade routes to Beijing
The first generation of trade war between the US and China were dumb, and as the war is far from over, a division between the two countries could constitute an advantage for Beijing in the long run, experts say.
US President Donald Trump issued the first warning earlier this year, placing taxes on top Chinese export goods, including solar panels, steel and alcohol.
The most significant explosion was what happened this week, when new fees affected goods worth 200 billion dollars (150 billion pounds), effectively taxing half of the goods that went into the US from China.
Beijing has been taking revenge every time "in nature", ultimately setting fees between five and ten per cent and more than $60 billion American goods.
China has pledged to return the US to the same currency, and the second largest economic power in the world is not likely to be delivered soon.
Removing measures from Washington means surrender in the face of their demands, but for China's President Xi Jinping, it would be very embarrassing to publicly bow down to the US.
However, experts said that if China plays its letters properly, the pressures coming from the business struggle with the US can back China in long term, to reduce the interoperability of these two economies.
"The fact that political decisions, quickly made in both Washington and Beijing, can cause economic decline in each of these countries, is something far more dangerous than what is seen from abroad," said Abigail Grace, an Associated researcher at the research Centre for New American Security, which focuses on the Asian continent.
Syria is 'ready' for refugee returns, says Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready for voluntary return of refugees and is appealing to help rebuild the country destroyed by a struggle that has lasted for more than seven years.
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Waldid al-Mualeum said conditions in the country are improving.
"Today, the situation in the country is much more stable and secure due to progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to redesign areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
Currently, there are all conditions for voluntary refugee returns to their homeland, where they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that hit their daily lives and their welfare.
The UN estimates that about 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the beginning of the war, in 2011.
About six million others who still live in the country need humanitarian help.
Al-Mualeam said the Syrian regime would welcome help to rebuild the ruined state.
However, he stressed that the country would not accept assistance or assistance provided by countries that sponsored the uprising.
Europe wins the Redder Cup trophy, in Paris
The European team has won the trophy of Ryder Cup 2018 after defeating the US team at final 165 with 10,5, in Le Golf National, on the way to Paris, France.
The US has already lost six consecutive matches on European territory, and it has been winning this trophy in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained its crown after the team of Danish Captain Thomas Bjorn managed to get 14,5 points needed to defeat the United States.
American star Phil Mitchellon, who was the most difficult player in the tournament, took the first hit in the water and closed the 16th-footer hole with more than the fixed level, losing the match in front of Frenchco Molinari.
The Italian golf player Molinari shined on all of his rounds, becoming 1 of the four players who have achieved the score of 5-0-0, since the current format began to apply in 1979.
American Jordan Speth was defeated 5&4 by the highest ranking player in the European team, danezi Thror Olesen.
The number one player in the world ranking, Justin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to Englishman Ian Poltter, who could have played at his final final of Ryder Cup.
Spanish veteran Sergei Garca, who has played at eight Ryder Cup, became the most successful European player of all times in this tournament, with 25.5 points in career.
"Zakonically, I don't cry, but today I can't keep myself.
It's been a hard year.
I'm very grateful Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I'm very, very happy to be back in the cup.
The success is of the team, and I am happy that I had the opportunity to help them," Garca said quite excited after winning the European team.
He passed his address to his fellow countrymen, John Ram, who defeated the American golf legend Tiger Woods, in direct challenges Sunday.
"I find an extraordinary pride that I conquered Tiger Woods. I grew up looking at that player," said 23-year-old Rahms.
Woods lost all his games in France, and now there are statistics 13-21-3, during his career in Ryder Cup.
A strange statistic by one of the largest players of all time, who has won 14 important titles, ranked second after Jack Nicklaus.
The US team encountered difficulties all weekend to take the ball to the right place, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played golf clubs along the whole tour.
US Captain Jim Furyk spoke after his team's disappointing presentation, "I'm proud of these guys, and they fought hard.
There were several times during this afternoon when we exerted pressure on the European team.
We fought hard.
Congratulations Thomas.
He's a great captain.
The 12 of his players played quite well.
We'll regroup, work with the PGA in America, as well as our Ryder Cup committee, and we'll move on.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be captain.
We need to get the hat back.
They played better than we did."
