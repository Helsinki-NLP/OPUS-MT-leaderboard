The people of the land did not change at all, but they still needed to adjust to the way they had been before.
From time to time, as a new population, they began to adjust to the new environment, and they began to look less and less like the rest of the population.
Eventually, after thousands or millions of years, the two populations will look very different so they are no longer of the same species.
