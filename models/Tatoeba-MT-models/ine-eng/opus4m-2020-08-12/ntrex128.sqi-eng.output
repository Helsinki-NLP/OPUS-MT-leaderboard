Members of the Wells Assembly concerned that they "look like fools"
Among some members of the Assembly is a concern about the proposal to change their title to MWP (Members of the Parliament of Wales).
This has come as a result of plans to change the name of the assembly in the Wells Parliament.
Members of the Assembly from all over the political spectrum are concerned that this may lead to ridicule.
A Labour Party Assembly member said his group was concerned "that this rhymes with Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside of Wells: In wells, twp means "stupid" and pwp means "cake".
A member of the Wells Party said the whole group was "unsatisfied" and proposed alternatives.
A Wellsian conservative said his group was "thinking" about the name change, but it was said there was little difference between the words "MWP" and "Budalla".
In this context, the expression "w" in wellsically is similar to that of "u" in Yorkshire's English.
The Assembly Commission currently drawing up legislation to declare the name change, said: "Surely the final decision on the appointment of Assembly Members will depend on the members themselves."
The Wells Government Act 2017 gave the Welsh tagri assembly to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a consultation with the public, and the latest proposal for the Assembly's appointment as "The Wells Parliament" found broad support.
Regarding the issue of the title of the Assembly Members, the Commission favoured the designation "Members of the Wells Parliament" or "WMP", but the "MWP" option found more support in a consultation with the public.
Members of the Assembly seem to be suggesting alternative choices, but the fight for consensus can be turned into a headline for Chief Elin Jones, from which the presentation of legislation on changes is expected within a few weeks.
Reform legislation will include other changes in the way assembly functions, including rules for the exclusion of Assembly Members and the structure of the committee system.
During the legislative discussion, the final vote on their appointment will remain for the Members of the Assembly.
Macedonians vote in the referendum for the country's name change.
On Sunday, voters will vote for changing their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The people's vote was put into an effort to resolve a multi-year dispute with neighboring Greece, which also has a province called Macedonia itself.
Athens has long insisted that its northern neighbour's name is a claim on its territory and has consistently opposed its demands for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, a referendum opponent for the change of name, has said he will not recognise the votes.
However, referendum supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that changing the name is just the price to be paid for EU and NATO membership.
St. Martin's Camps fall silent, while churches in Harlem face difficulties
"Historically, the elderly people I've talked to say there's been a bar and a church in every corner," said Mr. Adams.
"Today both are missing."
He was told that the disappearance of crops is understandable.
"Today, people socialise in other ways," he says.
"The bars are no longer the meeting point of the neighborhood, where people go regularly."
As far as churches are concerned, he expresses concern that money from the sale of property will not last as long as leaders claim "and sooner or later they will return to the starting point."
He added that churches can be replaced by palaces full of people who will not support the holy places left in the neighborhood.
"The overwhelming majority of people buying housing environments in these palaces are white," he said, "so the day will soon come when these churches will be closed once well, as it is unnecessary for most people placed in these dwellings to become members of these churches."
The two churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a metropolis of colourful people — the Metropolitan Community in 1870, Saint Martin a decade later.
The original white - Methodist congregation was moved in the 1930 ’ s.
The building was made up of a congregation of colored people who had their place of worship nearby.
Saint Martin passed a congregation of colourful people under the direction of Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers on the 125th Street, a major shopping street in Harlem, who refused to work or promote colourful people.
In 1939, the building was badly damaged by a fire, but since Father Johnson's family members made plans for reconstruction, they ordered the carion.
Rev. David Johnson, Father Johnson's son and heir to St. Martin's, called him "the campaign of the poor."
The expert who played in the career in July called it something else: "A cultural treasure" and a "historic irreplaceable instrument."
The expert, Tiffany Ng from Michigan University, also said that this was the first karion in the world to be played by a colourful musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to a larger career in the Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Grabiweather said St. Martin didn't replace him.
The events of recent months in St. Martin have been a complicated confession by architects and contractors, some of whom were sent by church secular leaders and others from the episcopal diocese.
The Council -- the leading authority of the family, made up of the Time Leader -- wrote to the diocese in July, concerned that it "would try to transfer costs" to the council of the family, despite the fact that the latter was not involved in the employment of the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some family members complained about a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Fishing the 13-year-old wound during a dive to catch gafore in California
A shark has attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy on Saturday as he was drowning to catch cockroaches in California on the day of the opening of the cockroach season, officials say.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m., near Beacon's beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel has voiced for KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been drowning with some friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning, when he had heard the boy screaming for help, and then had driven towards him along with a group to get him out of the water.
Hammel said he had at first thought that the boy was just excited by the catch of a gafore, but then "I realized that he was shouting "I got bitten!
He bit me!"
Hammel says that when he got to the boy, he couldn't see that his whole keyboard was broken.
"I called to everyone who went out from the water, saying, 'There is a fish in the water!' Hammel said moreover.
The boy was transported by helicopter to the "Rady's" children's hospital in San Diego, where he was declared critical.
The species of the shark responsible for the attack was unknown.
Coast Guard captain Larry Giles said at a media conference that a shark was seen in the area a few weeks ago, but was identified as a harmless species of shark.
Giles added that the victim had suffered traumatic injuries in the upper part of the body.
Officials stopped access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours, for investigative and security purposes.
Giles said that there are over 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are considered harmless.
Sciencebury's plans to enter MB's cosmetic market
Sciencebury's is competing with Boots, Superdrugs and Debenhams with large shop-style cosmetics, with a specialist salesman's staff.
Within the framework of a considerable effort to enter the US cosmetic market of 2.8 billion pounds, which is continuing to grow as fashion and household clothing sales suffer decline, the biggest cosmetic decorations will be tested at 11 shops around the country and will spread to more shops next year if they succeed.
Investing in cosmetics comes at a time when supermarkets are looking for ways to fill the spaces of rafts used for televisions, microwaves, and home appliances.
Sciencebury's said he would double his offer of cosmetic products to 3,000 products, including for the first time such brands as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing lines from L'Oreal, Maybellin and Burt's Bees will also be given more space, with dedicated areas for related brands, similar to those in shops like Boots.
Also, the supermarket will re-market its cosmetic line Boutique, so that most of the products are made up of vegan ingredients -- something that is increasingly required by older buyers.
In addition, the retailer of "Fragrance Shop" perfumes will test concessions at two Sciencebury's stores, the first of which was opened last week in Croydon, in southern London, while the second is expected to open later this year in Sally Oak, Birmingham.
Online purchases and a trend toward the daily purchase of food in small amounts in neighborhood stores mean that now supermarkets need to do more to attract people.
Mike Coupe, the CEO of Sciencebury, has said that outlets will start to look more and more like big shops, while the supermarket network is trying to fight Aldi and Lidl prices down with more services and consumer products.
Sciencebury's has placed "Argos" outlets in hundreds of shops and has presented a series of "Habitats" that after purchasing the two networks two years ago, which he believes has stimulated sales of food products and made them the most profitable purchases.
The previous supermarket's attempt to restructure its cosmetic and pharmaceutical departments resulted in failure.
Sciencebury's tested a partnership with Boots in the early 2000s, but the union broke down after a debate on how to divide revenues from pharmacies into its supermarkets.
The new strategy comes three years after Sciencebury sold his pharmaceutical business to 281 Celesio stores, owners of the Lloyds pharmaceutical network, for 125 million pounds.
He said "Lloyds" would play a part in the plan, adding a wide range of luxurious skin care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, the commercial director of Sciencebury, said: "We have transformed the look of our cosmetics packaging to improve the environment in favour of our customers.
We have also invested in a specialized training staff, which will be ready to give advice.
The range of our brands is designed in such a way that it adapts to any need, and the attractive environment and desirable locations show that we are now a cosmetic destination, which differs from the old way of making purchases."
Peter Jones is "depressed" after Holly Willoughby withdraws from the 11 million-pound deal
The star of Dragons Den, Peter Jones, has been "skinned" since TV presentation Holly Willoughby has been drawn from an 11 million pounds deal with his dedicated business a certain lifestyle to focus on its new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their housework brand and Truly accessory.
The business of these two was compared to Gwyneth Peltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old presenter of "This Morning" addressed Instagram to announce her departure.
Holly Willoughby has outraged the "Dragons Den" star, Peter Jones, after last-minute withdrawal from their winning business dedicated a certain lifestyle - to focus on its new promising contracts with "Marks & Spencer" and "ITV".
Sources say Jones was "depressed" when the golden girl of television agreed during a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new agreements -- worth up to 1.5 million pounds -- meant that she had no more time to dedicate to their brand of household ornaments and accessories "Truly".
The business was compared to Gwyneth Peltrow's Goop brand and was expected to double its estimated worth of 11 million pounds.
By the time Willoughby was 37, he was addressed to Instagram to announce her departure from "Truly", Jones flew outside Britain to one of his holiday homes.
A source has been said: "Truly was undoubtedly at the top of Holly's priorities.
It would be her long - term future that would accompany her during the next decades.
Its decision to withdraw left all the persons involved absolutely attached.
No one could believe what was happening on Thursday, it was so close to the opening.
In the offices in Marlow there is a warehouse full of goods that are ready to be sold."
Experts believe that the removal of the presenter "This Morning", which is among the most successful British stars, can cost the firm millions, due to considerable investment in products starting from pillows and candles to household clothes and furniture, and cause further delays in opening it.
And this could be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, the mother of three children, and her husband Dan Baldwin, have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined as her director in March.
Couples spend vacations together, and Jones has 40 per cent of shares in Baldwin's television production firm.
Willoughby is expected to become M&S brand ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as the I'm A Celebrity presenter.
Last night, a source near Jones has said, "We do not want to comment on his business matters."
Hard talk "and then fall in love"
He made a joke about criticism that he would receive from the news media because of his comment, which some would describe as "not worthy for a president", and because of the positive attitude towards North Korea's leader.
Why has President Trump been handed over so much?
He said Trump mockingly imitating the voice of news reporters.
"I didn't give up at all."
He said Kim is interested in a second meeting, as their first meeting in Singapore in June was greeted by Trump as a major step towards the CNC.
But negotiations for cinucleration have been cut off.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's main diplomat, New Yong Ho, addressed world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday, saying that North sees no "corresponding reaction" from the US to the first steps taken by North Korea for nuclearization.
Instead, he says, the US is continuing sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump held a much more optimistic view in his meeting talk.
"The things are going better with North Korea," he said.
"We were entering the war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have a great relationship."
He said his efforts to improve his relationship with Kim have resulted in positive results -- stopping rocket testing, helping to release hostages and returning to the home of the rest of American soldiers.
In his speech about his relationship with Kim, he defended his unusual approach.
"It's very simple to act as president, but instead of having 10,000 people outside who are trying to enter this vast arena, we would have about 200 people staying there," Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
The tsunami and the earthquake in Indonesia destroy an island, killing hundreds
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, nonprofit foreign organisations were told that their presence was not necessary.
Despite the relocation of more than 10 per cent of the Lombok population, no national disaster has been declared, which is a precondition for catalysing international aid.
"Unfortunately, they have done so in many cases clearly that they do not seek international support, the issue is somewhat challenging," Mrs. Sombung said.
While "Save the Children" is setting up a team to travel to Paul, it is still uncertain whether the foreign staff can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palau to see if international agencies would be allowed to contribute to aid efforts.
Considering the frequent fluctuations of Indonesia’s land, the country remains extremely unprepared in the face of natural wrath.
While shelters against tsunamis have been built in Aceh, they are rarely found in other coastal areas.
The apparent lack of a siren for the tsunami warning in Palau, despite the issue of a warning, is likely to have contributed to the loss of life.
Even in the best of circumstances, the journey between many islands of Indonesia is difficult.
Natural disasters make logic even more complex.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok for the treatment of the victims of the earthquake is traveling to Palau, but it will take at least three days to reach the new disaster zone.
President Yoko Widodo has used Indonesia's single infrastructure to improve as his electoral campaign's main focus, and has invested a lot of generous money for roads and railways.
But the lack of funding has disturbed Mr. Yoko's administration, while he is in the face of the new elections that will take place next year.
Mr. Yoko is also facing pressure from ongoing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim community have embraced a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people have been killed, and tens of thousands have been displaced from their homes after the destruction of Christian and Muslim groups on the streets, where tradesmen, archers, and other cold weapons have been used.
See: Livepool Daniel Sturridge marks a similar goal in recent minutes against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge has saved Liverpool from a loss in Prime Minister League against Chelsea, with a goal in the 89th minute of Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge received a passport from Jerdan Shaqiri at about 30 yards away from Chelsea's gate, while his team was losing as a result 1-0.
He pushed the ball easily to his left before he hit the far door.
The ball flew over the area until it turned to the right and top corner of the network.
The ball saved the air from Keppa Arizabalaga and ended up in the net.
"The goal was to put in the right position to take the ball and players like Shaq always play with the balls ahead, so I tried to create myself as long as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming, I checked the ball with a touch, and I didn't think too long, but I just hit it."
Chelsea was led by the result 1-0 in the first part, after a goal in the 25th minute by the Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The blue attacker made a review at Mateo Kovacic during that game, before he swung near the field and sprinted toward the hemisphere of Liverpool.
Kovacic made a quick combination in the middle.
Then he gave a beautiful vertical look that led to Hazard in the area.
Hazard passed the defense in duel speed and with a left hit he marked on the second column, passing the ball behind Liverpool's porter's arms, Alison Becker.
Liverpool will face Naples at the Champion League's Teams stage, Wednesday at 3 p.m., at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton at the UEFA European League on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
The number of deaths from tsunami in Indonesia goes to 832
The number of deaths from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has increased in 832, the national disaster agency has been expressed in the first hours of Sunday.
According to reports, many people have been blocked under the ruins of buildings torn by the 7.5 earthquake that hit Friday and caused up to 20 feet high, said the agency's spokesman Sutopo Purwo at a press conference.
The city of Palau, with a population of more than 380,000, is lying under the ruins of broken buildings.
Police arrest a 32-year-old man suspected of murder after a woman finds death from a knife wound
A murder investigation has been reported after the wife's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
The 44-year-old was found at 7:55 a.m. with knife wounds at Grayson Mews on John Street, while a 32-year-old man was arrested as suspected of murder.
Police have called on residents of the area who have seen or heard anything to be presented for testimony.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The trial is in the early stages, but I would like to call any person who has been near John Street in Birkenhead, who may have seen or heard anything suspicious, to contact us.
I would also like to call on anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have caught up on film, to contact us as they may have information essential to our investigation."
A police spokesman has confirmed that the victim is a resident of Birkenhead and her body is found inside a residence.
This afternoon, friends who thought they knew her came to the scene to ask questions about the place she was found this morning.
Investigations are ongoing, while the police have said they are notifying the victim's family.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews has tried to enter his apartment, but has been informed by the police that no one is allowed to enter or leave the building.
He's gone without a word when he's discovered the event.
Now, residents are being informed that they will be allowed to enter their homes in just a few hours’ time.
A police officer has been heard telling a man that the whole area is being treated like a crime scene.
A woman has arrived in the scene of the crime.
She repeats the words "this is terrible" without rest.
At 2: 00 p.m., two police vans were inside the perimeter, and another van was outside.
A number of officers were stationed within the perimeter, monitoring the dwelling block.
Any person with information is asked to send a direct message @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact "Crimestopers" anonymously in number 0800 555 111 by choosing code 247 of 30 September.
Statue of Cromwell in Parliament, last monument touched by debate on "rewrite of history"
Its removal would be a deserved punishment for the Taliban destruction of many of England's cultural and religious artifacts by his Puritan fanatical followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as "marriage" and "an effort to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "In the middle of the current debate on the removal of the statues, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell's painting outside the Palace of Westminster was signed.
The iconoclasm of English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps this would be a wrong sacrifice of Cromwell for his predecessor Thomas in the past century.
The excellent portrait of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is a testimony to the opinion of the 19th century and part of the history of a figure that many think is still worthy of praise.
Mr. Goldsmith said about "The Sunday Telegraph": "Many people, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, saw Cromwell as a parliament's defender from external pressure, which, of course, in his case was the monarchy.
The fact that this is a fully accurate portrait is the subject of ongoing historical debates.
What is certain is that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is an individual well-known figure that represents one side of that medal.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be celebrated and remembered."
To the killer of the death wound to the Chinese farmer
A farmer has been attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwest China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only with his last name "Yuan", has been found dead with a broken artery and covered in blood near a pig stall in the Lupanshiu market in Guizhou province, reported "South China Morning Post" on Sunday.
A pig farmer is getting ready to inject a pig vaccine at a stable on May 30, 2005, in Xining Province of Shanghai, China.
It is said that he had traveled with his cousin from neighbor Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered the door of a pig stall nearby.
He said there was a big male pig in the stable with a blood mouth.
A medical examination has confirmed that the herd of 550 pounds has injured the farmer for death, according to the report.
"My cousin's feet were bloodthirsty," his cousin identified with the nickname "Wu," as quoted in the news of the evening in Guiyang.
In the security camera footage, Yuan was seen entering the market at 4:40 p.m. on Thursday morning to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed his husband didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager has reported on the evening news that the pig was kept in isolation to prevent another attack, while the police gathered evidence on the scene.
According to reports, the Yuan family and market authorities are negotiating a compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of people attacked by pigs have been noted before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, causing the husband serious injury.
Ten years ago, a 650 - pound [650 kg] pig caught a wellsian farmer after his tractor until his wife drove the animal out.
After a farmer from Oregon was killed by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba said to the CBC News that usually the pigs are not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as "stimulant".
"They just want to play.
They're like very curious little things... their purpose is not to hurt you.
You just have to show them proper respect," he said.
The effects of Hurricane Rosa are expected to bring large, wide-scale settlements to the US Southeast
As predicted, the power of Hurricane Rosa is waning as it moves toward the coldest waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, during the following days, Rosa will cause floods in northern Mexico and in the southwestern US.
On Sunday morning, at 5 o’clock in the morning, Rosa was accompanied by wind speeding 85 miles an hour, classified as Category 1, and located 385 miles in the southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, on the Pacific, a low-atmospheric pressure zone is beginning to form, moving east towards the Western US Coast, while Rosa is expected to approach the Bay of California Peninsula on Monday in the wake of a tropical storm, it will continue to push the great tropical wet towards its north, towards the southwestern US.
On Monday, Rosa will give up to 10 inches in some parts of Mexico.
Then, the operation of tropical humidity with the low - atmospheric pressure zone will cause strong rainfall during the following days, with extensive rainfall in the southwest.
At the local level, rainfalls from 1 to 4 inches will cause immediate flooding, floods of waste, and possible precipitation of the land in the desert.
High tropical humidity will cause the rate of rainfall in certain areas to reach approximately 2 to 3 inches per hour, especially in some parts of Nevada and southern Arizona.
2 to 4 inches of rain is predicted in some South-West areas, mainly over a large part of Arizona.
There is also the possibility of immediate floods with rapid deterioration of conditions because of the scattered nature of tropical rains.
Because of the risk of tropical deserts, you are not advised to walk in the desert.
The great storms can turn the canyons into powerful rivers, and the storms will bring strong winds and dust storms to the area.
The approach to the low - atmospheric pressure zone will bring heavy rains to some parts of the southern coast of California.
The total waste level can reach over half an inch, which can cause small waste streams and slippery roads.
For the region, these will be the first rains season.
Several scattered tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona on Sunday evening and Monday morning, before the rains are extended on Monday and Tuesday evening.
Strong releases will be distributed on four sides on Tuesday and will continue until Wednesday.
October in the United States can be characterized by high temperature fluctuations, with temperatures falling in the Arctic, while tropicals remain warm.
Sometimes this leads to drastic temperature changes in short distances.
A good example is the drastic difference in temperatures across the central US on Sunday.
Between the city of Kansas in Missouri and Omaha in Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa, the temperature difference is about 20 degrees.
During the following days, the remaining heat of the summer will try to accumulate and expand again.
A good part of the Central and Eastern US is expected to start October with warm temperatures, with an average of 80, from the South Poles to certain parts of the Northeast.
The New York City could reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast shows high temperatures on average in the eastern US during the first half of October.
Over 20 million people have attended Brett Kavanaugh's trial session
More than 20 million people have followed the interesting testimony of the High Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of a sexual attack that is suspected to have occurred in the 1980 ’ s, Christine Blasey Ford.
Meanwhile, the political bloc continued, and broadcasters interrupted regular programs to broadcast the return in the last minute of Friday's events -- an agreement reached by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake to conduct a weekly FBI investigation into charges.
Ford was told before the Senate Judicial Committee that it is 100 per cent certain that Kavanaugh had touched him while he was drunk and had tried to take him to a gymnastics party.
Kavanaugh, in a flashy testimony, said it was 100 per cent certain that this had not happened.
The number of followers is likely to have been greater than that of 20.4 million people, reported by Nielsen on Friday.
The company was measuring average visibility in CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News and MSNBC.
The figures for other transmission networks, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business, were not immediately available.
And Nielsen usually has trouble counting the viewers from the offices.
To put this figure in perspective, the size of this audience is similar to that of a football elimination or to that of the Academy Awards.
The Fox News channel, whose opinionists have strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, was the main source of other networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the 24-hour session, Nielsen said.
ABC came in second with 3.26 million viewers.
The CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
Interest continued to be high even after the trial session was concluded.
Flake was the main character in Friday's drama.
After the office of the moderate Republican issued a statement that he would vote in favour of Kavanaugh, he was filmed by the CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning as he faced protestors whistling while trying to move to the elevator to attend the judicial session of the Judicial Committee.
In the transmission of CNN books, he appeared looking down for a few minutes while being corrected.
"I'm standing here, facing you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the country the truth?
He said to them, "You have power, but there are so many women who have no power."
Flake was expressed that his office had issued a statement, and before the elevator door closed, he said he would have more to say during the committee session.
A few hours later, all cable and satellite networks were covering directly the moment when the Judicial Committee would vote for the passing of Kavanaugh's candidacy for vote in front of all members of the Senate.
But Flake said he would do so only with the conviction that the FBI would investigate charges against the candidate during the following week, as a minority of Democrats had asked.
Flake was partially convinced by discussions with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and a few other senators after him, Flake made the decision.
The Flake election was smart, as it was clear that the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without conducting the investigation.
President Trump has requested the opening of an FBI investigation into charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of "playing political games" with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused critics of her plans for leaving the European Union of "playing political games" with Britain's future and of compromising national interest in an interview for Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, Britain, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview with her on the main page of the newspaper, former foreign minister Boris Johnson continued the attack on her Brexit plan, called "Checkers", saying that the proposal that Britain and the EU pay taxes on each other is "very absurd".
The murder of Wayne Sims: Police arrest suspect Diteon Simpson for the death of the LSU player
Police have arrested a suspect for the murder of Wayne Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Twenty-year-old Diteon Simpson has been arrested and questioned in prison environments under the charge of unannounced murder, the Baton Rouge Police Directorate has said.
Official sources have released the video of Sims and Simpson's confrontation, and the police say Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police have found Simpson's DNA trails on the scene, reports the CBS WAFB branch.
Following Simpson's questioning, the police said he's admitted to shooting guns on Wayde, causing him to die.
The amount for his release is set at $350,000, the lawyer reported.
The Medical Office of the Eastern Municipality of Baton Rouge has issued a preliminary report on Friday, stating that the cause of death has been a wound caused by firearms from head to neck.
The department thanks the refugee task force near the State Police of Louisiana, the state police criminal laboratory, the Southern University police and the area's citizens for helping with investigations leading to the author's arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva has thanked the area's legislative authorities for "their zeal and for putting justice in the country."
Sims was 20 years old.
The six - foot - long six - inch - tall boy grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, had also played basketball for LSU.
In the last season, he had an average of 5.6 points and 2.6 hits for each game.
On Friday morning, coach of the LSU basketball team, Will Wade, said the team was "pained" and "associated" by the death of Wayde.
"For this we worry all the time," Wade said.
Volcano throws hail on the city of Mexico
Hire from the Popcatepetl volcano has reached the southern neighborhoods of Mexico's capital.
On Saturday, the National Centre for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after the crater was rebuilt and 183 gas and snow releases were registered within 24 hours.
The center had monitored a number of cracks and cracks.
Images in the social media showed fine layers of snow that had covered car windows in some neighborhoods of the city of Mexico, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have seen an increase in volcanic activity, which is 45 miles (72 km) south-east of the capital, since a 7.1-scale earthquake hit Central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists before the independence poll anniversary
Six people have been arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after protesting pro-independence with the peacekeeping police, while thousands have joined rival demonstrations to mark the first annual polling of Catalan polarizers for separation.
A group of masked pro-separatists, surrounded by peacekeeping police forces, struck with eggs and powder paint, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that usually starve from tourists.
Later in the day there were cracks, while the police had to use rubber sticks to end the strikes.
For several hours, repeating the phrase "We don't forget, we don't forgive", pro-independence groups faced the unionist protestors who shouted "Rifte Spain".
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries received during the protests, according to local press reports.
In the region where feelings for independence prevail, tensions continue to remain high one year after the October 1st referendum, which is considered illegal by Madrid but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
The overwhelming majority of voters chose independence, regardless of whether participation was low, as citizens against separation boycotted the votes.
According to the Catalan authorities, about 1,000 people were injured last year after the police tried to stop the polling stations in the region through violent clashes.
On Friday evening, pro-independence groups set up camps outside to prevent a demonstration in support of national police.
The demonstration continued, but he was forced to take another turn.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician, who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said he had no hope that Catalan would gain independence in the future.
"Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents in tears of joy that they would be able to vote, but now we are stuck," he said.
Despite the fact that in the local elections last December they achieved a vital victory, although with a narrow result, the Catalan pro-independence parties have had difficulty keeping a low profile this year, as many of their most well-known leaders have voluntarily left the country or are in custody and awaiting a trial for their role in organizing the referendum and declaring independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, who was registering the protest on his phone in police aid, said the conflict was fueled by the politicians of both sides.
"The situation is getting more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who are in prison pending the trial since the end of last year, said he would run for elections for the European Parliament next year.
"The rejection of the candidacy for European elections is the best way to oppose the return of democratic values and the pressure that the Spanish government has given us," he said.
Londonderry: Some people arrested after the car hits the house
Three men, 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested because a car has been hit several times with a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday, around 7:30 p.m.
Detective Bob Blemmings said damage has been caused at the main gate and in the apartment itself.
It is thought that at an appointed time, an arrow was shot in the direction of the car.
Manga hit Livingston with a 1-0 win against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured the victory
The team from a category below, Livingston surprised Rangers by causing Steven Gerard to lose the second in 18 matches as a team coach from Ibrox.
The Dolly Menga hit proved decisive while Gary Holt's team matched the second-country Hibernian points.
Gerrard's team hasn't won an out-of-field meeting at Premiership yet, this season and next Sunday, will face Hearts, the difference with which is eight points.
But first, Rangers will wait at Rapid Vienna's home in a valid match for the European League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston has extended the series of match winnings to six meetings, and Coach Holt has not yet experienced the loss since Kenny Miller replaced last month.
Livingston lost his chances in the face of unresolved opponents
Holt's team should have been in advantage many minutes before they signed, as their direct attacks caused Rangers many problems.
Scott Robinson managed to get past but hit the weak at the door, and then Alan Lithgow hit out on the top and after the chase by Craig Halkett.
The villagers were willing to leave the Rangers to play in front of them, knowing they could cause problems in standard hits.
And so was the goal of the meeting.
Rangers caused a stroke, and Livingston created space. Declan Gallagher and Robinson combined to create the possibility of Manga, which hit and marked the center of the area.
Until then, Rangers had dominated the holding of the ball but the local defense had proved impenetrable and porter Liam Kelly had almost never been tested,
This kind of game continued in the second part even though Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to make a wait.
Scott Pittman's hit was stopped standing by Rangers Allan McGregor's porter while Lithgow hit out of another standard Livingston hit.
The harpsichords were constantly coming to the Livingston area and were constantly cleaned up, while the two claims for the Penalties - after Halkett's intervention against the incoming player as deputy Glenn Middleton, and another for touching hands - were taken into consideration.
Livingstone's Phenomenal Game - Analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
A performance and a phenomenal result for Livingston.
For one person, they played a great game and continued to surpass expectations in this increasing trajectories.
The style of the game and their team hasn't changed much since they got back to the top, but a great merit belongs to Holt for the way he's electrified the team since its arrival.
He had a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett was extraordinary, leading an organized defense perfectly, while Menga kept him in trouble with Connor Goldson and Joe Worall throughout the match.
However, the Rangers lacked inspiration.
Although in some cases they played very well under Gerard’s direction, they lacked quality.
The final pass was missing -- only once they managed to pass the opposing defense -- and this is something that should serve as an alarm for Rangers, who find themselves in the middle of the table.
Erdogan is expected with doubting feelings in Cologne
Saturday (September 29th) was characterized by clear sky smiles as Turkish and German leaders met for the morning in Berlin.
This was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - which aimed at regulating relations between NATO allies.
They have fallen into opposition on issues such as human rights, media freedom and Turkey's EU membership.
Then Erdogan went to the Colony to open a new giant mosque.
The city houses the largest number of Turkish people outside Turkey.
For security reasons, the police stopped the meeting of a crowd of 25,000 in front of the mosque, but many supporters went out on the streets to see their president.
Hundreds of Protestants against Erdogan -- many of whom were Kurdish -- also raised their voice to condemn Erdogan's policies as well as the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
The opposition protests reflect the divisive ability of a visitor worshiped as a hero by some Turks of Germany and despised as autocratic by others.
Road accident in Deptford: Cycling dies after car crash
A cyclist has found death after being hit by a car in London.
The accident has occurred near the Bestword Street crossing with Evelyn Street, a traffic road in Deptford, southeast of the city, about 10:15 BST.
The driver stopped, and the ambulances came right away, but the victim changed his life.
The crash took place a few months after another cyclist lost his life in an accident where the author left the scene, which occurred at Children Street, about a mile away from the country of the Saturday accident.
The Metropolitan Police reported that officers were working to identify the person and to inform his family.
Roads are closed and buses are announced to use other roads, while car drivers are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Officers Hurt During a Rebellion
Six prison officials have been injured during a riot in a high-security prison for men, the Prison Office has been said.
The rebellion exploded at the HMP Long Lart in Worcestershire about 09:30 BST on Sunday, and still continues.
Specialist officers of "Tornado" have been called upon to keep the disturbances under control, including eight prisoners who are confined within one arm of the prison.
Officers have been treated locally for some minor facial injuries.
A Prison Service spokesman said: "The prison staff with specialized training is mobilized to keep under control the incident currently taking place in HMP Long Lart.
Six staff members have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we have made it clear that the responsible persons will be referred to the police and may be extended to prison sentences."
HMP Long Martin shelters over 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison director had been subjected to hospital treatment after an attack by one of the prisoners.
And in October last year, peacekeeping police officers were called to prison to keep under control a serious situation, where personnel attacked with billiards.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with immediate flooding (which may be an advantage for the coastal areas)
Although tropical depression rarely occurs in Arizona, it is likely that this will happen in the first few days of the next week, as the remaining power of Hurricane Rosa passes through the southwest desert, spreading the risk of immediate flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings for immediate flooding for Monday and Tuesday from West Arizona to South and East Nevada, Southeast California and Utah, including the cities Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take the lead in Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching late Monday with rain.
The Phoenix National Meteorological Service said in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones have received the status of storm or tropical depression in a 200-mile line from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 billion from the Arizona border."
The latest models of the National Urban Centre predict 2 to 4 inches apart, with an insulated amount of up to 6 inches on the Arizona Mogollon border.
In other desert areas in the southwest, including central Rockies and the Great Basin, the reserves are expected to be at level 1 to 2 inches, while in isolated areas their total can reach 4 inches.
For areas outside the risk of immediate flooding, Rosa's rains can be a blessing, as the region has been hit by drought.
Although floods are a serious concern, some of these floods may be beneficial, since the southwest is currently facing severe weather conditions.
According to the U.S. Center for the Monitoring of Dentistry, less than 40 per cent of Arizona is facing extremes of the second category," weather.com reported.
Initially, Hurricane Rosa will hit Mexico's Baja California Peninsula.
Rosa, still heavily hurricaneed on Sunday morning, with winds speeding up to 85 miles an hour, is located 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and is moving north at 12 miles an hour.
Storms are fighting cold waters over the Pacific, and power is being lost.
Consequently, it is expected that the hurricane will strike Mexico with tropical storms in the afternoon or at the evening of the moon.
Rainfalls over some areas of Mexico may be strong, presenting considerable flood risk.
"The rainfall of an average level of 3 to 6 inches is expected from Baja California to the northwest Sonor, and can reach up to 10 inches," weather.com reported.
Then Rosa will move north through Mexico, in the wake of a tropical storm, before reaching the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday morning as tropical depression, which will then move through Arizona, reaching southern Utah on Tuesday night.
"The main risk expected by Rosa or its consequences are the strong droughts in Baja California, the northwest sonor and the southwestern desert of the United States," the National Urban Centre said.
These floods are expected to cause immediate flooding with life - threatening floods, floods of waste in the deserts, and landslides in mountain terrain.
Midsomer Norton's Attack: Four arrests for remaining murders in an attempt
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old have been arrested as suspected of remaining murder in an attempt, following the 16-year-old with a knife in Somerset.
The adolescent was injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, around 4:00 BST on Saturday.
He was accompanied to the hospital, where he is currently in "sustainable".
According to Avon and Somerset police, a 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old were arrested during the night in the Radstock area.
Officers have called for the presentation of anyone who could have caught a movie with a cell phone from the event.
Trump says Kavanaugh "has faced the humiliation and anger" of the Democratic Party
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the ruthless and cruel tactics of the Democratic Party," Trump said at a meeting in West Virginia Wheeling.
Trump said Kavanaugh "has faced the humiliation and anger" of the Democratic Party during the process of his appointment.
Kavanaugh testified before the Congress Thursday, denying with conviction and emotion the charge of Christine Blasey Ford that he had sexually assaulted him decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified during the session regarding her charge.
On Saturday, the president said that that day "the American people witnessed the greatness, character qualities and courage" of Kavanaugh.
"A vote for the appointment of Judge Kavanaugh is a pro vote for one of the most educated lawyers of our time, a lawyer with a clean public service record," he said before the group of supporters in Western Virginia.
The president emphatically mentioned Kavanaugh's appointment during the talk on the importance of Republican participation in the temporary elections.
"For five weeks we are divided by one of the most important elections in our life.
I will not run, but I am contributing," he said.
"So I'm making so much effort and I'm fighting for great candidates."
Trump argued that the Democrats have a mission to make "resistance and blockade".
The first main procedural vote by the Senate on Kavanaugh's appointment is expected to take place no later than Friday, CNN deputy GOP's senior director said
Hundreds killed by the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, while figures are expected to rise
At least 384 people were killed, many of whom were caught by the giant waves that hit the beach when the island of Sulawes in Indonesia was hit by a earthquake and tsunami, the authorities expressed them on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday, when the dams up to six meters (18 feet) collapsed on the shore in the fly, attempting to cause the death of many and destroy everything that came forward.
Cunami followed a 7.5-face earthquake.
"Last night, when the tsunami threat was born, people were still carrying out their usual activities on the beach, and as a result they did not run immediately and fell victim," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the spokesperson of the Indonesian disaster prevention agency, said at a press conference.
"Cunami didn't come alone, he took with him cars, trunks, houses, hit everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had reached the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h (497 miles per hour), before hitting the shoreline.
Some people went up to the tree to save the tsunami and survive, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Peru.
The aerial photographs published by the disaster agency showed a series of destroyed buildings and shops, broken and broken bridges, and a well surrounded by water.
After the earthquake, quakes continued to strike the coastal city on Saturday.
The number of earthquakes was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy emitted by the massive Friday earthquake was about three-thirds of the atomic bomb power dropped in Hiroshima during World War II.
The city's geographical position, which is at the edge of a long and narrow line, may have multiplied the power of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as "a great deal" and said thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels were broken down.
Some bodies were found blocked under the ruins of broken buildings, he said, adding that 540 people had been injured and 29 had disappeared.
Nugroho said that the number of victims and the scale of the damage may be much larger along the 300 km (190 miles) coastline in northern Palau, in an area called Dongala, which is closer to the earthquake epicenter.
Communication networks "stopped completely without any warning" from Dongala, Nugroho said.
That area has over 300,000 inhabitants," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were traveling towards affected areas.
"It's already turned into a tragedy, but the situation may get worse," he said.
On Saturday, the agency was severely criticised after not giving notice of Paul’s beating from the tsunami, despite the fact that officials expressed their doubts at the time of the warning.
In amateur movies distributed in social media, a man on the top of a building can be heard by warning passersby down the road about the coming of the tsunami with furious shouts.
In a few minutes, a dam breaks down on the shore, taking the buildings and cars with it.
Reuters couldn't verify the truth of the film immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a massive energy stop that cut communications across Paul, making it difficult to coordinate efforts to save from authorities.
The army has begun sending cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, the authorities said, but evacuated persons continue to have great needs for food and other basic needs.
The city airport is reopened only for survival efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Yoko Widodo was expected to visit the evacuation centres in Palau on Sunday.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia is over 800.
The situation is quite difficult.
While the World Vision staff from Dongala have arrived without problems in the city of Palu, where workers are staying in interalpine (rubbers) in their office yard, they witnessed the scene of destruction on the road, said Mr. Doseba.
"They told me they had seen many houses destroyed," he said.
The situation is quite difficult.
Although relief groups began serious efforts to move humanitarian aid mechanisms, some complained that foreign relief workers with extensive expertise were stopping them from traveling to Paul.
According to Indonesian regulations, funding, supplies and external staff can begin to circulate only if the disaster zone has been declared a national disaster zone.
This hasn't happened yet.
"This is still a disaster at the regional level," said Aulia Arriani, a Indonesian Red Cross spokesman.
"As the government says, "O.K., this is a national disaster," we can seek national help, but this status has not yet been given."
The second night after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday in Paul’s home, friends and families of missing persons still had the hope that the case of their loved ones would be one of the few miracles that sometimes occur in the event of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was taken out of a well.
On Saturday, the forces of salvation freed a woman who had remained under ruin for two days, with her mother’s corpse next to her.
Gendon Subandano, the Indonesian national team coach of preshutism, had trained two of the missing preshutists for the Asian Games, which closed early this month in Indonesia.
Several other people locked up at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandag, were his students.
"As an old pro in the field of prejudice, I am very emotionally charged," he said.
Mr. Gendon recalls how in the hours following the news of the collapse of the "Roa Roa" hotel among the community of prejudice, he had tried desperately to write to the WhatsApp competitors from Palau, who were taking part in the festival at the beach.
However, his messages ended only with a gray scale sign, instead of two blue marks.
"I think this means that the messages were not sent," he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 while refilling a ATM in Newport in Levee
According to a press statement by the Newport Police Directorate on Friday morning, some thieves have stolen $26,750 from a Brink employee who was refilling a ATM in Newport, Levee.
The car manager had been emptying a ATM at a entertainment centre and trying to distribute money to others, Detective Dennis wrote in the statement.
While he was busy, someone "came running after Brink's employee" and stole a cash bag for surrender.
According to the statement, the witnesses had seen some suspects leaving the scene, but the police have not specified the number of persons involved in the incident.
Any person who has information about their identities should contact Newport police in number 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Reception changes the name of Ye
The Kanye West will change his name to Ye.
Posting a change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "Recognised officially as Kanye West".
The 41-year-old West has been called with the Y novelty for a long time, and has used it as the title of his eighth album, which came out to market in June.
The change came shortly before his release on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album "Yandhi".
He will replace the singer Ariana Grande in the show, which cannot come for "emotional reasons", the show's creator said.
Compared to being a shortening of his current name of art, West has been said in the past that the word has a religious meaning for it.
"I think "yes" is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means "you," said West at the beginning of this year, talking about his album title with the radio artist Big Boy.
"So I am you, I am us, we are us.
I left Kanye, which means "one," in just "Ye," which is the reflection of our good, our evil, our confusion, everything.
The album is more a reflection of what we are."
He is one of many famous rapists who have changed their name.
Sean Combs is known differently as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, or Diddy, but this year he said he preferred the name Love and Brother Love.
A former West co-worker, JAY-Z, has done as he has done with or without a separate visa and capital letters.
Mexico's AMLO promises not to use the army against civilians
Mexico's newly elected president, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has pledged that he will never use military forces against civilians, as the country's 50th anniversary of a bloody reprisal against students is approaching.
On Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza, Lopez Obrador vowed that "he will never use the army to oppress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, the military forces set fire to peaceful demonstrations on the streets, killing 300 people, at a time when the students ’ left movements were taking the lead throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support Mexican young people by granting monthly grants to students and opening more public universities free of charge.
He has said that unemployment and lack of opportunities for education push young people towards criminal gangs.
US needs to double funding for artificial intelligence
While China is becoming increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US has to double the amount spent on research in this field, says the investor and artificial intelligence expert Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
Comments have come after various parts of the US government have declared discoveries of artificial intelligence, despite the lack of a general official strategy for artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China has announced its plan last year: within 2030, it aims to take the first place for innovation in the field of artificial intelligence.
"Distribution of the budget for research in the field of artificial intelligence would be a good start, since other countries are still far behind the US and we are looking for a great breakthrough in this field," Lee said.
The double funding may double the chances that a major breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence will be made in the US, Lee said in an interview with the CNBC this week.
Lee, author of the book entitled "The Superpowers of Artificial Intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order", published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the executive director of the Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's most sophisticated artificial intelligence companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at the University of Carnegie Mellon, he created an artificial intelligence system that also passed on to the top American players in Othello, and then worked as executive director near Microsoft Research and as president of the Google branch in China.
Lee congratulated the previous US government competitions for technology, such as the Robotics Challenge of the Advanced Research Projects Agency in the Defence Field, and asked when the next competition would take place, in order to help identify new visionaries.
Lee said often, US researchers need to work hard to get grants from the government.
"China is not what is removing academic leaders; it is corporations," Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have employed enlightened minds from universities to work in the field of artificial intelligence.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy can help the US push its efforts into the field of artificial intelligence.
"I think green cards should automatically be given to people with the title doctor in the field of artificial intelligence," he said.
In July 2017, the State Council of China issued the Plan for the Development of the New Generation of Artificial Intelligence.
The National Foundation for Natural Sciences in China offers funding for people in academic institutions, as the National Science Foundation and other government organisations give money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Early this year, the U.S. Department of Defence set up a Joint Centre for Artificial Intelligence, which is expected to include partners from industry and academies, and the White House announced the establishment of the Optional Committee for Artificial Intelligence.
Meanwhile, this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called "Al Next".
As for the NSF, it currently invests over $100 million a year for research in the field of artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, US legislation aimed at establishing a National Commission of Safety for Artificial Intelligence has not been implemented for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum for the country's name change
On Sunday, the Macedonian people voted in a referendum to determine whether its name would change to "the Republic of North Macedonia", a move that could resolve a decade-old dispute with Greece, which had blocked its efforts for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, thinks its northern neighbour's name is a claim on its territory, and has imposed a blocking veto on its membership in NATO and in the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the new name proposed, but nationalist opponents argue that the change could compromise the ethnic identity of the majority of Macedonian slaves.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum, and a boycott campaign has cast doubt if the election participation will reach 50 per cent needed for the validity of the referendum.
The question on the referendum ballot reads: "Are you for NATO and EU membership through the accession of the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that for Macedonia, as one of the countries created by the dissolution of Yugoslavia, this is a price worth paying to achieve membership in structures such as the EU and NATO.
"I came today to vote for the country's future, for Macedonia's young people, so that they can live free under the shadow of the European Union, because this means a safer life for all of us," 79-year-old Olivera Georgievska said in Skopje.
Although the referendum has no binding power, a sufficient number of members of parliament have said they will stick to the voting result to make it decisive.
The change of name requires a majority of two-thirds in parliament.
The state electoral commission said no irregularities had been reported until 1 p.m.
However, voting was only 16 per cent, compared with 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, where 66 per cent of registered voters cast their vote.
"I am going to vote for my children, we have the country in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, voters in Skopje's capital.
Macedonia's Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dusko cast their vote in the referendum on the change of Macedonia's name, which would pave the way for the country's membership in NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, 30 September 2018.
In front of parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov was preparing a small scene and setting chairs in front of the tents set up by referendum boycotters.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads up, not entering from the back door," Kavadarkov said.
"Our country is poor, but we have dignity.
If they don't want us as Macedonia, we can address other states like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring much needed investments for Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20 per cent.
"I think the overwhelming majority will be pro, as more than 80 per cent of our citizens are pro-EU and NATO," Zaev said after his vote was cast.
He said a positive result would "confirm our future".
According to a poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research, about 30 to 43 per cent of voters would take part in the referendum -- a figure below the required level of participation.
Another survey conducted by Macedonian TV Telma found that 57 per cent of participants planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 per cent said they would vote in favour.
For a successful referendum, the participation scale should be 50 per cent plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would give the first strong blow to the pro-Western government's policy, since its arrival in power in May last year.
See: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City passes through all of Brighton's defense to mark
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling faced all of Brighton's defense in Manchester City's 2-0 victory on Saturday, at the Ethihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made his goal in the 65th minute look extremely easy.
Argentina's hunter got a mid-term pass at the start of the action.
He ran through three of Brighton's defenders before he went out in the open field.
Later, Aguero found himself surrounded by four green blouses.
He crossed a defender and quickly drove some others into Brighton's area.
Then he followed to the left where Sterling was.
The English attacker used his exit into the area to follow the Agueros ball, which hit right and crossed the porter Matthew Ryan by throwing the ball on the right corner of the network.
"Aguero is suffering from a foot problem," city manager Pep Guardiola said to reporters.
"We discussed that he would play about 55 or 60 minutes.
Here's what happened.
We were lucky he scored a score at the time."
But it was Sterling who gave the whites the first advantage in the Prime Minister League's fight.
This goal was scored at 29th minute.
During that action, Aguero took the ball in Brighton's hemisphere.
He was perfectly verticalized for Laroy Sane on the left.
Sane moved a few steps before he followed Sterling on the second column.
The white man took the ball to the net and then pulled it out of the border lines.
The city will face Hofenheim in the valuable challenge for the Champions League's Teams, Thursday at 12:55 p.m. at Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to preserve the role of the "pimpler" against Rockies
With Nationals removed from the chance to reach the eliminations, there was no reason to impose another beginning.
But Scherzer, who is always a competitor, hopes to be given the opportunity to score against Colorado Rockies, but only if there is the possibility of a playoff for Rockies, which have an advantage over a fight against Los Angeles Dodgers in the National West Law.
Rockies reached at least one opportunity for playoff due to victory 5-2 against the Nationals on Friday night, but they are still trying to get the title of the division.
"Even though we are playing without any reason, at least we can score by recognizing the atmosphere of the fans here in Denver but also the fact that the opposing team will play at the highest level against which I can face throughout the year.
Why wouldn't I want to play in such a challenge?"
Nationals have not yet announced who will be entitled on Sunday, but they reportedly tend to leave Scherzer to start the meeting in such situations.
Scherzer, for whom the 34th presentation would be entitled, held a training session on Thursday and could appear in the field on Sunday, which could be a normal day of rest for him.
The Washington player, who shot right, is 18-7 with an ERA 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts at 220 2/3 of the shootings this season.
Trump assembled West Virginia in a meeting
The president referred to the situation with regard to his election to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, before discussing the importance of the Republican participation in the temporary elections.
"The swimmer is crucial for everything we've done so far.
Five weeks are divided by one of the most important choices in our life.
This is one of the biggest elections -- I'm not running, but I'm contributing, and that's why I'm trying so hard to fight for excellent candidates," he said.
Trump went on, "You see this terrible group of radical democrats, you see what's going on right now.
And they have split up their minds to regain power in any way, you see their shame and their filth.
They don't want to know who they are. They don't want to know who they are.
Democrats, he said, have as their mission to make "resistance and blockade".
"And you've seen this in the last days," he said, calling the Democrats "infuriated, cruel, fucking and unfaithful".
He was referred to as the Democratic Chief Senator of the Senate Judicial Committee, Diane Feinstein, which raised discontent from the audience.
"Do you remember her answer?
Is it you who spread the document?
Well, well, what?
No, well, no, I... wait a minute...--her body language was pretty bad--it was the worst language of the body I've ever seen."
The job party is no longer an open church.
It's unbearable to those who say what they think.
When Momentum's activists in my local party voted for the motion of disbelief against me, it didn't get that far.
Finally, I am not the first of the Members of the Working Party who are told not to be welcome - all this because we say what we think.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan was treated similarly, simply because he firmly opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of disbelief was a criticism of me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corby.
With regard to the importance of a responsible economic policy, national security and Europe, ironically similar issues that Jeremy was in opposition to previous leaders.
In the announcement of the work party meeting in Nottingham East, it was said that "we want meetings to be inclusive and productive".
For most of my eight-year period as local Labour Party MPs, GC meetings have been so.
Unfortunately, the meetings no longer have their previous tone, and the promise of a "softer and more polite" policy has been forgotten since, if ever.
It has become increasingly evident that the opposite views are not tolerated in the Working Party, and every opinion is judged on the basis of its acceptability by the party's leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, while colleagues with whom I thought shared similar political views began to claim that I would take a 180 degree turn and maintain positions with which I would never have agreed -- either on national security or on the EU market alone.
Whenever I speak in public -- no matter what I say -- they blow up criticisms in the social media, with people looking for my discharge, denouncing the central policies, they tell me that I shouldn't be part of the Labour Party.
And this isn't just me.
I am aware that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, since comments about me tend to be of a political nature.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who face gender and racial discrimination every day, but do not give up.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is normalization of levels of violence.
Last week, Jeremy Corbin said the Working Party should feed a culture of tolerance.
In fact, we are no longer a "open church", and with every motion of faith and any change in the rules of choice, the party becomes more and more closed.
Over the past two years, they've often advised me to sit down, not to be so loud, and so everything "will be fine".
But that's not why I got into politics.
Since I joined the Working Party 32 years ago as a school student, driven by the disregard of thatcher's government that led my class to failure in a general school, I have tried to praise for better public services for those who need the most -- either as a member of a local council or as a government minister.
I've never hidden my policy, not even in the last elections.
Everyone in Nottingham East had clear political positions and points of opposition to the current leadership.
For all those who voted for the motion on Friday, I just want to say that the country is heading towards a Brexit that will touch our families, businesses and public services.
But in fact, the only message I want to follow is not addressed to Nottingham Momentum, but to my electors, whether they are members of the Working Party: I feel proud to be in your service and I promise you that no threat to discharge or political favor will prevent me from acting in your best interests.

Father 38 - 17 Melrose — The Invincible Father Takes the Lead
Two late attempts may have somewhat changed the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to triumph in the extremely entertaining Tennant's Premiership match today.
Now they lead the lists as the only unbeatable team among the ten teams.
Finally, it was their wonderful protection and courage to take the risk of winning the local team, and Coach Peter Murchie was fully right to be pleased.
"We've shown ourselves in every game, and we're still unbeatable, so I'm usually happy," he said.
Melrose's Robyn Christie said, "We want to congratulate the Air team, who took more risks than we do."
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, released empty by Frazier Climo, passed Air in favour, but a yellow card for Scottish representative Rory Hughes, who came for this challenge from Warriors, allowed Melrose to show numerical superiority and Jason Baggot received an unused top.
Climo increased Ayr's advantage with a penalty while shortly before the end of the first part, he marked and returned to the empty individual action leading the result to 17-5 for Ayr before the break.
But Melrose well started the second part, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, which came back empty from Baggot, reduced the difference to five points.
Later, there was a long interruption as a result of Ruarid Knight's serious injury, which left with a barge, and after the game was resumed, Ayre increased the result through an attempt by Stafford McDowall, noted by Climo.
Captain Ayre, Blair Macpherson, was later punished with yellow cardboard, and Melrose again exploited the fact that they had a more player, with an attempt not to empty out Bruce Colvine, at the end of a piece of harsh presing.
However, the locals returned and when Struan Hutchinson was punished with yellow cardboard because he blocked the Climo, without a top, from the penalty line, MacPherson did "touch down", behind Ay's three (low) back ahead.
Climo pointed out and did the same almost after the game was resumed, after Kyle Rowe caught the ball hit by David Armstrong in the area and led ahead the attacker (flander) Gregor Henry, for the fifth attempt by the local team.
"Still Game" star seems set for a new career in the restaurant industry
Ford Kieran's "Still Game" star seems determined to enter the hotel industry, as it was discovered that he was appointed director of a licensed restaurant chain.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis's role in the BBC's famous show, with his long-term partner, Greg Hemphill, co-scanarist and co-protagonist.
Doubt has declared that the ninth season will be the last for this show, and it seems Kiernan is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is Director of Arifingmorn Limited.
The actor refused to comment on history, although a source for Scottish Sun made it clear that Kiernan was trying to enter Glasgow's "flowering restaurant industry".
"The sea is ours": Bolivia without going to the sea hopes the court will open the way to the Peacemaker
Marines patrol an improvisation of the Navy headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings have raised the blue ocean flag.
At sea bases from Lake Titicaca in Amazon, the bike is marked: "The sea is our property.
His recovery is a duty."
Throughout Bolivia without exit to the sea, the memory of getting the coast from Chile in a bloody conflict for resources during the 19th century is still quite alive -- as well as the desire to sail once again through the Pacific.
Now, these hopes are much greater than ever since, while on October 1st, Bolivia awaits the decision of the International Court of Justice after a five - year review.
"Bolivia is characterized by the wave, the spirit of unity and peace, and, of course, is looking forward to the outcome," said Roberto Calzadella, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will attend the GJND session on large screens across the country, hoping the Hague tribunal will decide in favour of Bolivia that - after decades of irregular discussions - Kili is obliged to hold talks to give Bolivia a sovereign landlocked territory at sea.
For Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indian president -- who faces a controversial battle for the second term in the next year's elections -- is quite important.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe there is very little chance that the tribunal will decide in favour of Bolivia -- and that, however, they would change little.
The UN body of headquarters in the Netherlands has no tagrim to give another state part of Kile's territory, and it has been said that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
The fact that the GJND is issuing a decision only six months after hearing the final arguments indicates that the issue "was not complicated", Paz Zárate, an expert on international law, said.
And instead of helping Bolivia's cause, the events of the last four years could have punished her.
"The issue of access to the sea has been compromised by the current Bolivian administration," Zárate said.
Morale's aggressive rhetoric has disappeared every trace of remaining kindness to the chilies, she suggested.
At a certain point, Bolivia and Chile will continue the talks, but it will be extremely difficult for discussions to take place after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was strangely swift.
Monday will offer Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Kilin" and a chance "to end 139-year-old disputes, with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales -- still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America -- was using the maritime issue for political interests.
"Bolivia will never give up her right to have access to the Pacific," he added.
"The decision is an opportunity to understand that we should leave behind the past."
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not take place for as long as it can't trust the US
North Korea's Foreign Minister New Yong Ho says his nation will never do the first nuclear weapons disarmament for as long as he can't trust Washington.
A young man was giving a talk on Saturday before the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to keep the promises made during a summit in Singapore among rival states leaders.
His comments come at a time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be at the threshold of the resurrection of nuclear diplomacy so far "sleeping", and three months after Singapore with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
According to Rie, the hopes that the US' continued sanctions and opposition to the declaration of the end of the Korean war will make North Korea kneel, are empty hopes.
As long as Pyongyang doesn't act first to make important gambling movements, Washington hesitates to accept the statement.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is a broad scepticism about the seriousness of Pyongyang's goal to attract its arsenal, which the state most likely sees as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompey is planning to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris reveal the latest line of giant hats that will soon come on the streets of your city
If you want to enrich your hat collection or provide full protection from the sun’s rays, do not look any further.
Stylists Valentino and Thom Browne presented a series of huge chapels for their SS19 collection in the parlour, which left all the stylists open in the fashion week in Paris.
Very impractical hats have been given to Instagram this summer, and these stylists have brought their amazing creations to the fore.
The special creation of Valentinos was a very extraordinary beaver hat decorated with a wide, detailed structure that surrounded the head of the model.
Other large accessory included gemstones decorated with stones, a magic hat, and even a pineapple -- but they are not made to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of strange masks -- bash in time for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks had sharp lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than a haute couture.
One creation was similar to the incubators, also filled with the air tube and water glasses, while another was like a molten ice cube.
And if you like to follow this brave way - you're lucky.
Fashion analysts predict that giant hats may soon come to your city’s streets.
The trend of giant hats has followed that of La Bomba, the two-legged castle chapel we've all seen, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand hiding behind the chapel was very impractical given to the social media, and it produced another great creation on the wall -- a bag of beach from a cage, almost as large as the model of the bathroom that was wearing it.
The bag of roasted orange raffia, decorated with raffia and with a white handle on top, was the most special creation of the collection La Riviera SS19 of Jacquemus in the Fashion Week in Paris.
Stylist of the famous characters Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "In the next summer, I expect to see the chapel and the giant beach bag on the streets of the cities -- since the stylist has left such an impact that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for large accessors."
John Edward: Key language skills for global citizens
Private schools in Scotland hold the record for academic excellence and this has continued in 2018 with another set of excellent results in trials, further reinforced by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other fields.
With over 30,000 students all over Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Private Schools Council (SCIS), are trying to offer the highest level of service to their students and parents.
Private schools aim to prepare their students for further higher education, for their chosen career and their country as global citizens.
As an educational sector that can prepare and implement a suitable educational curriculum, we are witnessing how the modern - language branch continues to be a popular and popular choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you speak to someone in a language that he understands, your words go to the ears.
If you speak with him in your own language, your words will enter into his heart."
Those words are a powerful reminder that we cannot rely solely on English when we want to establish a relationship with people from foreign lands.
From the results of this year's recent trials, we can see that languages are taking the lead in the results list, with the highest degree of past notes among private schools.
A total of 68 per cent of students who have studied foreign languages have received maximum A.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 per cent of students had received the maximum A grade in Mandarin, while 72 per cent of those studying for German, 69 per cent of those studying for French and 63 per cent of those studying for Spanish had also received A grade.
This shows that private schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as one of the vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Currently, the foreign language branch is considered as important as the STEM branch (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) in the backbones of private schools and beyond.
A 2014 study by the United Kingdom Commission for Employment and Skills found that among the main challenges employers faced in filling out vacant countries, 17 per cent of them were related to the lack of language skills.
As a result, language skills are becoming increasingly needed to prepare young people for their future careers.
As foreign - language employment increases, these abilities are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career a person chooses, if he has learned a second language, he will have real advantages in the future, as master of such a long - term ability.
The ability to communicate directly with foreign people will automatically position a multilingual person over competitors.
According to a YeGov survey, which included over 4,000 adults from the United Kingdom in 2013, 75 per cent of them were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to develop a conversation, and French was the only foreign language spoken by a 2-digit population, specifically 15 per cent.
That is why investing in language teaching is important for today’s children.
The possession of many languages, especially the possession of the languages of developing countries, will give children a better chance of employment.
Within Scotland, each school will be different as regards the languages taught in them.
Some schools will focus on more classic modern languages, while others will offer the most important languages for the United Kingdom in the 2020 perspective, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the interests of your child, there will always be a number of languages you can choose in private schools, with a teaching staff made up of field specialists.
Scottish private schools are dedicated to offering a school environment that will prepare children and "arm them" with the necessary skills to cope with them, regardless of the future.
At this time, the fact that in a global business environment, languages continue to have a vital importance for the future of the country must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should really be considered as "international communications residents".
Private schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence for young people in Scotland.
It's a good thing to do.

LeBron is expected to debut with Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans waiting to see LeBron James in his first game for Log Angels Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the opening game of the pre-season Sunday against Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, it is not yet known how many minutes he will play.
"There will be more than 1 and less than 48," Walton said on Lakers' official website.
Lakers' correspondent wrote on Twitter that, most likely, James would play for a limited number of minutes.
After training at the beginning of this week, James was asked about his plans for Lakers' six-season program.
"I don't need matches before the season in this phase of my career to prepare," he said.
Trump meeting time in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump, launches a series of elections tonight at Wheeling, West Virginia.
This will be the first meeting of five such planned to hold next week, including stops in friendly areas including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote of approval to suspend his election to fill the empty country in the Supreme Court, Trump aims to provide support for future temporary elections, as Republicans risk losing control in Congress when the elections are held in November.
What time does Trump's gathering take place today in West Virginia, and how do we follow him online?
The Trump meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled to be held at 7 p.m. East Time this evening, Saturday 29 September 2018.
You can follow the Trump tube in West Virginia online below, via direct YouTube transmission.
Trump is likely to address hearing sessions this week at the High Court of Candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who was tense because of charges of his innocent sexual conduct, with the expected vote of the Senate's confirmation suspended for a week while the FBI was conducting the case investigations.
But the primary aim of these many meetings is to help Republicans take a leap forward in the November elections.
So President Trump's campaign staff said these five meetings next week aim "to give energy to volunteers and supporters as republicans try to protect and expand the majority of the Senate and the House of Representatives," according to Reuters.
"Congression control is so important for its agenda that the President will travel to as many states as possible as we address the fierce campaign season," a campaign spokesman for Trump, who did not want to be identified, told Reuters.
Planned to take place in Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, tonight's gathering can bring support from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and cover from the Pittsburgh media," according to West Virginia's Metro News Agency.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump visits West Virginian, the country where he won more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican Senate candidate for Western Virginia, Patrick Morrisey, who has remained behind the polls.
"It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come and try to give him a push in the poll," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Cup Ryder 2018: US team showed readiness to fight while keeping their hopes alive by running races until Sunday
After three consecutive seasons, the remaining four for Sunday afternoon, may be what this Ryder Cup needed.
This swing of the wheel is a completely created sports concept, but a concept where players truly believe and never more than in such competitions.
But where can we say that this bitch feels right now?
"They had a six-point break that has now gone into four, so we can say that a kind of trusty heat has been created somewhere," Jordan Spyeth said as he closed the day.
Of course, Europe has the advantage of four points ahead, when they remain in the game and twelve points.
As Spieth states, Americans hope that the findings are in their favor and have many things to encourage, especially in the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day, where they took three out of four possible points.
Spythe has been ruthless from the start of shooting to the grave and is leading by giving his example.
The party’s brothels increased as the round came, entering the golf ball with an easy hit to lead the match to the match, when he and Thomas were two points down the two rounds earlier.
His easy shot that gave them the victory of the match in the hole 15 was expected with a similar booklet, which shows that he believes that the American team is not out of the race yet.
"You just have to work hard and worry about your fight," Spieth said.
All the players left now.
18 holes to leave a trace.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputable story of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but adorable European couple have accomplished four out of four and cannot be mistaken.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who did not have a shot at the minimum Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided the shots at the minimum even Sunday morning, Friday evening and the second nine shots on Friday morning.
This result and the way their energy seems to flow to the enthusiastic crowd and the anaesthelas reinforces the idea that they are players to be able to be on Sunday and that there will be no other player known more than Fleetwood and Molinar to seal a possible European victory, while the sun falls on "Le Golf National".
Probably both at the same time in different caves.
However, statements for a European triumph are still early.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson were very easy to handle with Sergio Garcia, the four-morning hero when he got married with Alex Noren.
A point on the minimum and two doubts at the ninth front placed Spain and Sweden in a hole from which they had no chance of going out any more.
On Sunday, however, no one will be there to help you get out of your grave.
The four and a couple's games are so amazing to follow from around because of the interaction between the couples, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and how they can change a strategy there.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has taken a significant lead until the end, but these four sessions also showed that the US team will still be fighting, although some people, especially the Stateside, have questioned this.
Europe heads 10-6 as it approaches the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe has a fundamental advantage on the final day of the Ryder Cup since it has come out of the four and with couples with a 10-6 advantage over the United States.
The inspiring doubt Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the two-win race against a Tiger Woods that was difficult to increase their advantage at four points in Le Golf National.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, offered to win the trophy he lost in Hazeltin two years ago, dominated the powerless American team in the early morning match, leading it to the 3-1 series of results.
The American team showed more resistance in the game four, winning two matches, but they could not reduce the difference.
Jim Fury's team needs eight points out of the 12 individual Sunday matches to hold the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European first player who has won four points in a row, while he and Molinari, overcoming 'Molliwood', after a sensational ending, are the second couple in the history of the Ryder Cup who win four points in their opening match.
After crashing Woods and Patrick Reed in the game four, they combined pretty well together to make a powerless Woods possible and the American beginner Bryson Dechambeau with an even more dramatic result 5&4.
Woods, who conducted two Saturday meetings with difficulty, showed repeated explosions of greatness, but he has already lost 19 of his 29 matches in the game four and with couples and 7 matches in a row.
Justin Rose, stopped for the four-morning match, returned to partner Henrik Stanson in the match with couples and received a 2+1 loss from Dustin Justin and Brooks Kuepka -- ranked in the first and third countries in the world.
Europe had nothing in favor of a very beautiful and fresh day in southwest Paris.
Three times, professional winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas made the difference that the two - point Americans had to make on Saturday.
They won a courageous 2&1 victory against Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four matches and later returned to defeat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the match with couples after they had lost in the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team returned the result after a difference between four points in individual games, although the Fury team has only one match to hold the trophy.
However, since he was the second best player for two days, an attack on Sunday seems to go beyond their capabilities.
North Korea says it will not be disarmed 'in no way' unilaterally without gaining confidence
North Korea's Foreign Minister told the United Nations that the continued sanctions on Saturday were deepening the mistrust of the United States and the country would not give up in any way its nuclear weapons unilaterally in such circumstances.
New Yong Ho told the annual body from around the world of the General Assembly that North Korea has taken "significant measures that show good will" in the past year, such as the ban on nuclear and missile tests, the dismantling of nuclear testing areas and the promise that it will not add to the nuclear weapons and technology arsenal.
"However, we are not seeing any response to this from the US," he said.
"Without faith in the US, our national security will not have self-confidence, and in these circumstances there is no way we can discredit ourselves unilaterally."
While Ri reiterated the usual complaints of North Korea regarding Washington's resistance to a split "in phase" approach to the nuclear disarmament process where North Korea would be valued due to the gradual steps it has taken, his statement appeared important because it did not exclude unilateral nuclear disarmament, as Peniani had previously done.
The new one referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a summit held for the first time between an American president in office and North-Korean leader in Singapore on June 12th, where Kim pledged to work towards the "nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula" while Trump pledged to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea has requested an official conclusion of the Korean War 1950-53, but the United States has said that the Peniani must first give up nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to mitigate the rigid international sanctions on North Korea.
"The US insists that nuclear disarmament be initially carried out and increased pressure levels through sanctions to achieve their goal compulsorily, even by denying the 'declaration of the end of the war'," Ri said.
"The perception that sanctions can bend us is dreams in the sun of people who are uninformed about us.
But the problem is that the continuation of sanctions is deepening our disbelief."
The new didn't mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, a statement that the US leader earlier stressed during this week in the United Nations.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and the leader of South Korea, Moon Jae in the past five months and added: "If the nuclear disarmament issue were to be South Korea and not the US, the process of nuclear disarmament in the Korean peninsula would not have come into this situation without a way out."
Nevertheless, the tone used in the New Speech was fundamentally different from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that the deployment of the U.S. territory under the direction of the North Korean missile was inevitable after "Mr. President Devil" Trump called Kim "the rocket man" with a suicide mission.
This year in the United Nations, Trump, who threatened last year to "completely destroy" North Korea thanked Kim for the courage shown in taking the steps to disarm, but said there was still much work to be done and that sanctions should continue to be active until North Korea carries out nuclear disarmament.
Wednesday, Trump said he didn't have a time frame for this, saying, "If it takes two years, three years or five months -- that doesn't matter."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward the Penian for the intermediate steps.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said at the United Nations Security Council Thursday: "The implementation of the Security Council's sanctions should continue vigorously and without interruption until we carry out the full and final verification of nuclear disarmament."
The Security Council has unanimously imposed the increase of sanctions for North Korea since 2006, in an effort to end the financing of the Penian nuclear programmes and ballistic missiles.
Pompey met with the new side of the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Penian again next month to prepare a second summit.
Pompeii has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not go so well.
He left Peniani in July saying he had made progress, and within a few hours North Korea denounced him for having done "Mafia-style demands."
North Korea pledged at a meeting with Moon this month to disarm a missile area and also a nuclear complex if the United States would take "related measures".
He said Kim had told him that the "related measures" he was seeking were the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and the movement towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take lessons on how to rest enough
A new course at Harvard University this year has included all students to sleep more, in an effort to combat the growing culture of the study 'mass' through the use of caffeine from these 'payments'.
One academic observed that university students number one in the world often have no knowledge when it comes to basic matters than how to care for themselves.
Charles Cheisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham Hospital and the Women's Hospital, prepared the lecture course, which he believes is the first of this kind in the US.
He was inspired to start this course after giving a report on the impact that sleep deprivation has on learning.
'At last a girl approached me and said to me, 'Why is this saying to me now, in my last year?'
She said no one had spoken to her before about the importance of sleep -- something that surprised me,' he said about 'The Telegraph'.
The course, included in the program for the first time this year, explained to students the essential elements of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, as well as how it improves their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and general director of university medical services, said the university decided to present this course after finding that students were seriously deprived of sleep during the week.
An hour - long course includes a number of interactive tasks.
On the one hand, there is a view of a convertible room, where students click on the cupboards of coffee, beads, athletes and books to explain to them the effects of caffeine and lighting and how athletic performance is affected by sleep deprivation, as well as the importance of the hourly routine that needs to be spent in bed.
In another part, participants were explained that sleep deprivation over a long period of time increases the risk of heart attack, ischemia, depression, and cancer.
A map of the camp, with interactive icons, further encourages participants to think about their daily routine.
'We know that student behavior will not change immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know -- just as you have the right to know -- the health effect when you choose to smoke," added Prof. Cheisler.
The culture of pride to spend 'a sleepless night' continues to exist, he said, adding that modern technology and ever-growing pressure on students meant that sleep deprivation was a permanent and growing problem.
The assurance that you've received enough sleep, of a good quality, must be the 'secret weapon' of students to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said -- even to avoid weight gain, because sleep deprivation leads the brain to a hunger mode, making them feel constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19 - year - old Californian studying physical and chemical biology, helped Professor Cheisler prepare the course, having participated in one of his lessons last year’s lessons in Harvard.
He said the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to return to a course for the whole camp.
He hopes that the next step is to ask all post-university students to complete a similar study programme before joining competing institutions.
Prof. Cheisler recommended that students should set an hour of daylight when they should go to bed, and also that when they should wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of ‘blue light’ that comes out of electronic displays and LED lighting, which can bring out the biological rhythm of sleep out of work, which leads to problems in sleepiness.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Manga marks against Gerard's boys
Rangers got another hit as a visitor while Dolly Menga hit the broken side of Steven Gerard's loss 1-0 in Livingston.
The team from Ibrox was looking to record his first victory since the 4-1th February triumph in St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team caused his second loss in 18 matches Gerrard as a coach, leaving his team eight points behind Ladbrokes Premiership's escaped leader, Hearts.
Manga scored seven minutes before finishing the first part and with a placement of the Rangers team that seemed totally powerless to balance.
As Rangers now falls into sixth place, Livingston climbs into third and is directly behind the hibernian for a gap of empty.
Rangers may expect more trouble after their arm player Calum Spence was treated for a blow in the head after being hit by an object likely thrown by visiting fans.
Gerard made eight changes in his team, which passed Air to the half-finals of the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt, entered the same 11-year-old field that kidnapped a point of Hearts last week and that he would feel satisfied with the way his well-organized team killed the opponents in every round.
Rangers may have dominated the holding of the ball, but Livingston created more when he owned it.
They should have noted only two minutes from the start of the meeting, when Manga's first pass to Scott Pittman at the door square protected by Allan McGregor, was not exactly used by him by shooting the ball out.
A long line of execution by Keaghan Jacobs found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner, Alan Lithgow, just shot him out in the back of the gate.
Rangers took control of the game but it seemed they were more hoping than they really believed in their game in the opposing area.
Alfredo Morelos thought he deserved a penalty after four hours of play while he and Steven Lawless were beaten, but Arbitrary Steven Thomson did not hear the Colombian complaints.
Rangers managed to do two knocks on the front door, but Ibrox's former porter Liam Kelly did not worry about hitting Lassana Coulibaly's head and hitting Ovie Ejaria without strength.
While Livi's first goal in the 34th minute may have been contrary to what was seen in the field, no one could deny that they deserved it only for the fight they showed.
Sersh Rangers failed in the long passage service for Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher hit the ball towards Scott Robinson, who kept the silence to pass Menga and to mark it in a simple way.
Gerard acted on the break between the parts while Coulibaly replaced Ryan Kent and this change for a while did not have an immediate effect while the companion followed Morelos, but the impressive Kelly ran away from his position to block it.
But Livingston kept making the guests play the way they wanted, where Lithgow and Halkett were playing with each other a long time later.
Holt's team could have stretched its lead in the final phase, but McGregor stood firm and denied Jacob before Lithgow shot out of a ball taken from the song hit.
Ranger's deputy Glenn Middleton later claimed during the game for another penalty, while he got confused with Jacobs, but again Thomson allowed the advantage.
Almanac: Eyewitness of Mother Geiger
And now a page from our Almanac of "Sunday Morning: 30 September 1882, like today 136 years ago and in VAZDIM... the day when the next physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the production of what is known as Geiger's measurement.
A main pillar of science since then, Mature Geiger has become a main pillar of popular culture as well, as in the 1950's film "Coronado's Yellows," with a box of non-professional actors like Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:

A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system "to distinguish" bad cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system "to distinguish" bad cells and kill them
Vaccines teach the immune system to recognize bad cells as part of treatment
Method involves removing immune cells from a patient, changing them to a laboratory
They can 'get out' a protein that's heavy in many types of cancer and then reinject
A vaccine that is being tested is showing promising results in patients with certain types of cancer.
One woman who was treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize bad cells noted that cancer in the ovaries had disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient, changing them to a laboratory so that they ‘extend’ a protein that is present in a number of types of cancer called HER2, and then in the reinjection of these cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the U.S. National Institute for Cancer in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results show us that we have a very promising vaccine to do."
HER2 "promotes the growth of some types of cancer," including breast, ovaries, lungs, and the colon cancer, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach to immune cell extraction from patients "to teach them how to discover cancer cells has worked in treating a type of leukaemia.
Kanye West appeared in a Pro-Trump tube, wearing a hat with the MAGA caption, after its appearance in SNL.
Don't go right.
Kanye West grumbled with studio protests during a broadcast on Saturday Night Live, following a disappointing interpretation where he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would run for this post in 2020.
After interpreting his third song on that night called "Host Town", where he was wearing a hat that wrote "Make America Great", he followed to speak with strong tone against the Democrats and refocused his support for Trump.
"Every time I talk to a white person, they tell me, "How can you like Trump, he's a racist?"
Well, if I were concerned about racism, I would have left America a long time ago," he said.
SNL began the show with a parody in Matt Damon's role, where Hollywood star was playing Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judicial Commission on the charges of sexual harassment raised by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, recordings of West's harsh speech were uploaded to social networks by comedy Chris Rock.
It's unclear if Rock's trying to make fun of West with that post or not.
Also, the West complained to the spectators that he had spent a difficult time in the backyard because of what he had put in his head.
"They treated me badly in the back.
They told me, 'Don't get on the stage with that hat in your head.'
They treated me badly!
And then they tell me I'm grounded," he said, according to Washington Examiner.
West said, "Do you want to see the buried one?" saying, "Put my superman hat on your head, because this shows that no one can tell me what to do.
Try love."
His comments were received at least twice by the spectators and members of the SNL caste seemed to feel ashamed, Variety reports, where a person told the newspaper: "All the studio fell silent."
West was called a late deputy in place of Ariana Grande, whose former lover, rector Mac Miller, had changed his life a few days ago.
West surprised many people with the interpretation of the song "I Love It", dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West was supported by the chairman of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who posted on Twitter: "For one of the bravest souls: THE BELONGINGS THAT YOU HAD IN THE TURMS."
But the broadcast moderator Karen Hunter posted on Twitter that the West was just "self and this is extraordinary."
"But I choose MOS to reward someone (by buying music or clothes or by supporting his "art"), whom I believe to be embarrassing and spreading ideology that is harmful to my community.
While he's free.
So are we," she added.
Before the show, the singer said on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying he was already "the shadow that was formerly known as Kanye West."
He's not the first artist to change his name and follow Diddy's tracks, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His reper friend, Snoop Dogg had the name Snoop Lion and also the late Prince music legend, changed his name to a symbol and then the artist known as Prince.
Accusation for attempted stabbing at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed at a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
Police said the incident happened in Ballyhackamore.
The accused is expected to appear before the Court of First Instance of Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be examined by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Game of Thrones, Kit Harington, good toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as a sword in the character Jon Snow, in the violent series of the medieval fantasy "Game of Thrones".
But 31-year-old actor has hit the stereotype of male hero, saying that the display of such roles on screen makes young boys realize that they should act as strong to respect them.
Speaking of 'The Sunday Times Culture', Kit said he believes that 'something has gone wrong' and asked how the problem of toxic masculinity can be solved during the #MeToo era.
Kit, who had recently married his acting colleague at the "Game of Thrones", Rose Leslie, also at the age of 31, admitted that he felt 'very important' the solution to the issue.
'Personally I feel quite important this matter for the moment--where have we been wrong with the display of masculinity?' he said.
'What have we taught men as they grow up about the problems we're facing now?'
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to the excessive masculinity shown there.
He continued: 'What is born, and what is learned?
What is learned on TV and what is learned on the street, making young boys believe that they should behave in a certain way to feel like men?
I think this is one of the big questions of our time - how do we change this?
For something clearly went wrong with the young men.
During the interview, he also admitted that he would no longer be running for "Game of Thrones" after the series ended at the end of the next summer, saying that 'the horses and chariots have come to the top of his nose'.
From November, Kit will take part in a ‘TRUE WEST’ reinstatement by Sam Shepard, who is the story of a film producer and his brother's thief.
The actor recently showed that meeting with his wife, Rose, is the best thing he received from "Game of Thrones".
'In this product I found a woman, so we can say that this show gave me the next family and determined my life from now on,' he said.
Rose played the role of Ygritte, the sentimental interest of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in the fantastico-scientific winning series of 'Emmy' awards.
The couple married in June 2018 in the property of the Leslie family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports an increase of 14% of new cases
China has reported an increase of 14% of the population living with HIV and AIDS.
There are more than 820,000 people affected throughout the country, health authorities say.
About 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the new cases have been transmitted through sexual relations, showing a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of blood transfusions.
But the number of people taking HIV through this way had almost gone zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
Yet, year after year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
The transmission of HIV through sex is an acute issue in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexualism was decriminalized in China in 1997, but it is said that discrimination against LGBT people still prevails.
Due to the country's conservative values, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men will eventually marry women.
Most of the transmission of the disease is due to inadequate protective measures during sex in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to the treatment of HIV in children as part of the attempt to strike this problem.
Maxine Waters denies that GOP senators' data is being disseminated by staff members, saying these are 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiracy theory'
US representative Maxine Waters denounced on Saturday claims that a member of her staff had posted personal information from the three American senators of the Republic on the lawmakers' pages in Wikipedia.
The democracies from Los Angeles claimed that these claims were being postponed by experts and online pages "of the right extreme".
"False, lie and only disgusting lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information reported includes home addresses and phone numbers of American senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, posted by an unknown person in Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing on sexual misconduct against the High Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The flow of information came shortly after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Some of the conservative pages such as 'Gateway Pounds' and 'RedState' reported that IP addresses identifying the source of publications were linked to the Waters office and collected data from a Waters staff member, Hill reports.
"This baseless claim is totally false and a big lie," Waters continued.
"The member of my staff -- the identity, personal information and security of which has been compromised as a result of these false and selfish claims -- has not been in any way responsible for the flow of this information.
This baseless claim is totally false and a big lie."
Waters' statement immediately faced online criticism, including the former White House press secretary, Ari Flescher.
"This denial is frustrated," Fleischer wrote.
"That means she doesn't have the right attitude to be a Congressman.
When someone is accused of something they haven't done, he shouldn't get upset.
It shouldn't be provocative.
The defendant's motives should not be questioned.
He must be calm and peaceful."
Fleischer seemed to be comparing Water's response to the Democrat's criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of being extremely nervous during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who is running to occupy Waters in the middle of the term, also posted his statements on Twitter.
"The big rush, if it's true," he wrote on Twitter.
In her statement Waters said her office had signalled "the relevant authorities and law enforcement institutions over these false charges.
"We will ensure that the authors are discovered," she continued, "and that they take legal responsibility for all their actions, which have a devastating and dangerous effect on everyone from my staff."
Review of the film "Johnny English beats again" - comedy with the unequipped spy Rowan Atkinson
It has become the case that in every new British- influenced film, it is seen for hidden messages related to Brexit's theme, and it finds implementation and in the resumption of the comedy-action company "Johnny English" - which has its beginnings in 2003 with "Johnny English" and its return in 2011 with "Johnny English Recovery".
Will this satirical comedy reveal how clearly unable we are to relate to new national export opportunities?
In any case, the character with an eye out of the country, with his face as rubber and apparently Johnny English, has received permission to mess things up for the second time -- his name, which shows more than anything else that he is a wide comical creature scattered about territories that are not spoken English, but that are frequented by cinemas.
Of course, he is a secret agent of the poor, who, despite the strangely claiming to appear as a magician, has little by Inspector Clouseau, a little by Mr. Bean's character, and a portion of that guy who contributed only by playing a sound in the Chariots of Fire song, at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Games.
It is also based on the man of mysteries, travellers and international Atkinson, who once played on television advertisements that have now been forgotten about 'Barclaycard', leaving the place in chaos wherever he went.
There's one or two nice moments in this movie's premiere.
I liked it very much when Johnny English approached the helicopter in a midget, and the helical sheet crashed slightly into his helmet.
Here is the virtue of the physical comedy performed by Atkinson, but humor seems like cows and sometimes too much, especially when the 'series' films such as 007 and the Unmundated Mission have also introduced little comedy as an ingredient in their films.
Humor seems to be directed to children more than adults and the shocking events of Johnny English are not as creative and focused on silent movements as those of Atkinson in Bean's character.
The permanent theme as well as in this film is the fact that Great Britain is in serious danger.
A cyber hacker has been infiltrated into the super-secret network of British agents, discovering the identity of British agents on the ground and has lulled the agent into duty -- unfortunately a small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last chance for a prime minister to appear as a popoise and ready to fight, who is already suffering an extraordinary political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is doing his best to realize the character like Teresa May, but there is not much text on the stage that she can play.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that every active spy is compromised, so she will have to rely on someone who's retired.
And that means choosing Johnny English himself, who was now employed as a school principal in a high-level neighborhood, but who informally taught you how to become a secret agent: here are beautiful scenes, because English is offering a school-school espionage academy.
English is called back to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and reunited with his former assistant, the multiple Bough, who is once again playing by Ben Miller.
Now Bough is a married man, connected to a submarine captain, in the role of a high-level girl, where Vicki Pepperdine has been used a little bit of a mistake for this role.
So Batman and Robin did things totally back in His Majesty's Secret Service, are again in action, fighting with the beautiful fatal woman Ophelia Bulletin played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is enchanting by the attractive billionaire of technology who claims to be able to solve the difficulties of British computers -- the fake Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their ridiculous and defiant hatred: masked as cameras, set fire to a beautiful French restaurant; cause chaos as they enter the luxury yacht of Volta; and English is completely confused as he tries to use the virtual reality equipment to get to know the interiors of Volta's house.
All the sequences are normally made for the final scene, but despite its fun and noisy, everything seems a little bit like a movie for children.
Quite moderate stuff.
Even as in other movies Johnny English, I couldn't think of it: didn't the British film industry have a role for Rowan Atkinson that would suit his talent?
The Labour Party denies that there is a plan for British workers to work four days a week but to be paid for five days
The Labour Party led by Jeremy Corby is considering a radical plan that would make the British work four days a week -- but pay for five.
The party is reported to want company leaders to save using the artificial intelligence revolution (AI) for workers, giving them an extra day of rest.
We would see that workers would enjoy a weekend of three - day vacations — but would continue to take the same road home.
Sources said the idea would "be consistent" with the party's economic agenda and plans to turn the country into a favour to the workers.
Spending a week with four working days is an idea that is covered by the Union Congress, as a way for workers to benefit from the changing economy.
A high-level source of the Labour Party said 'The Sunday Times': 'A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
'Not to happen immediately, but a four-day work week is an aspiration that matches the party's approach to balancing the economy in favour of workers and also with the party's overall industrial strategy.'
The Labour Party would not be the first to include this idea, where the Green Party was promised a week ago with four working days during the general election campaign in 2017.
However, this aspiration is not currently being supported by the entire Labour Party.
One Labour Party spokesman said: 'A four-day work week is not the party's policy and is not being taken into account by the party.'
The Chancellor in Hye, John McDonnell, used last week's Labour Party conference to convey his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to pass power from 'anonymous directors' and 'beneficiaries' to public service firms.
The cabinet's plans in the shade also mean that current shareholders in the water companies may not take all their shares back, because the Labour government can carry out 'down' with the justification of the actions considered to be violations.
He also confirmed plans to place employees on company boards and to create the All-Inclusive Property Funds to pass 10 per cent of the capital of private sector firms, which means a dividend paid annually in value up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy shows at "60 Minutes", if the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh can change their mind
The FBI investigation of charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least one week, and raises questions as to whether the findings of the investigation bureau may affect any republican senator to withdraw his support.
In an interview to be broadcast Sunday, the correspondent for the "60 Minutes" issue, Scott Pelley, asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could discover something that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina college.
"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
"I said that when I was entering the hearing session, I said I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I got her on the phone after this happened, so after the claims came out and I said, "Did you do this?"
He was determined and clear."
Graham's vote, however, seems to be rocked.
"I have shared my mind about Brett Kavanaugh and the change would only make a bomb charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And anyone mentioned could not verify it.
She's 36 years old.
I don't see anything going to change."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will organise the "Global Citizen" Festival, an annual musical show that contains a large and impressive list of stars that interpret and also have a mission so impressive; to end poverty in the world.
Now, in his seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will wait for thousands of people in the Great Lawn in Central Park not only to enjoy the interpretations of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to be aware of the real purpose of the show, to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international legal group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it.
In order to benefit from a free ticket for the show (except in case you want to pay a VIP ticket), participants must fulfill a set of duties, or "actions" as voluntary work, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call, or any other meaningful way that would help raise awareness of their goal to end poverty.
But how successful has the Global Citizen Festival been when it has remained for 12 years to reach its goal?
Does the idea of rewarding people with a free concert work a real way to convince those who are looking for these interventions, or is it just another case of what is known as "activism with clicks" -- people who feel they're making a real change by signing an online petition or sending a message on Twitter?
Since 2011, "Global Citizen" has been said to have registered more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, giving a boost to various purposes.
It is said that these actions have helped to encourage world leaders to declare $37 billion worth of political commitment, which is said to affect lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group quoted 390 pledges and statements as a result of the group's actions, where at least $10 billion have already been distributed or secured as funds.
The group estimated that the funds provided so far have had a direct impact on some 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the main pledges include "The Power of Nutrition", a partnership of UK-based investors and implementing agencies, committed to "help children grow with their full potential," promising them to give Rwanda $35m to help end the disaster in this country, after receiving more than 4,700 "citizens" from Global Citizen activists.
"With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and citizens of the world like you, we can turn social injustice of regret into a past memory," the "Power of Nutrition" group told the Ambassador of the "The Power of Nutrition" to a concert directly in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after taking 5,000 actions to appeal to the United Kingdom to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government declared financing a project "The Power of Nutrition", which will affect 5 million women and children who need food intervention.
In an answer to the most frequently asked questions on their website where they asked, "What makes you believe that we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen replied: "It will be a long and difficult journey - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But as every high degree of righteousness, and as the motion toward an apartment before us, so shall we go out: for together we are stronger than they.
Janet Jackson, the Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are some of the actors who will play in this year's show in New York, which will be presented by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The US can use the Navy for "blocks" to prevent Russian energy exports - Interior Secretary
"If necessary," Washington may rely on his Navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including the Middle East, has discovered US Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, according to Washington Examiner's quote.
Zinke claims that Russia's involvement in Syria -- especially where it is operating at the invitation of the Syrian legitimate government -- is a pretext to explore new energy markets.
"I believe the reason why they are in the Middle East is that they want to supply it with energy as they do with Eastern Europe, the southern belly of Europe," he said.
And according to this official, there are ways to deal with this problem.
"The United States has the ability, with our Navy, to ensure that the maritime roads are open and, if necessary, to block them, so as to ensure that energy does not reach the market," he said.
Zinke was addressing participants in an activity developed by the Energy Consumer Alliance, a non-profit organization that has identified itself as "the voice of energy consumers" in the US.
He continued comparing Washington's access to treatment with Iran's Russia, pointing out that these accesses are practically the same.
"The economic option on Iran and Russia is a little bit more exploitation and substitution of fuels," he said, as he referred to Russia as "a deceptive scourge" with an economy that depends on fossil fuels.
The statements come after the Trump administration has undertaken a mission to increase exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe, thus replacing Russia, a much freer option for European consumers.
To that end, officials from the Trump administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" project of the 'Nord Stream 2' gas stationer who, according to Trump, has turned Berlin into a "robber" in Moscow.
Moscow has consistently said that the $11 billion project of the North Stream 2 gas station, which is supposed to double the existing gas station's capacity to bring it to 110 billion cubic meters, is a clean economic project.
Kremlin argues that the hot opposition to the Washington project is simply made for economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the same view that energy cannot be a tool used for pressure and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose the supplier," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US stance has faced the opposition from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The main industry organisation in Germany, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has asked the US to stay away from EU energy policy and from bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a lot of problems when a third state interferes in our supply of energy," said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Federation of Industries (BDI) after a brief meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "think seriously" if he will run for president in 2020, says Senator Massachusetts
Senator Massachusetts Elizabeth Warren said Saturday that he would "consider seriously" participating in the presidential race after the mid-term elections.
During a gathering in the city of Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider the nomination.
"It is time for women to go to Washington and regulate our ruined government, and this involves putting a woman on top," she said according to The Hill.
"After 6 November, I will take seriously the presidential nomination."
Warren hit President Donald Trump during a rally in the city, saying he "is leading the country in the wrong direction.
"I'm terribly worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy," she said.
Warren is known for her criticism of Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a Friday squeezing, Warren said "that we certainly need an investigation by the FBI before we vote."
However, a survey carried out Thursday showed that much of Warren's voters themselves do not think that it should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight per cent of Massachusetts's "possible" voters said the senator should not run, according to a poll conducted by the Suffolk/Boston Globe University Political Research Centre.
Thirty-two percent supported this candidacy.
The poll showed that former Governor Deval Patrick enjoyed greater support for the candidacy, where 38 per cent supported a possible candidacy and 48 per cent opposed the candidacy.
Other high profile democratic names that have been discussed to race in 2020 include former president Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially settle in January, 'Associated Press' reported.
Sarah Palin cites Trak Palin's post-traumatic stress disorder at Donald Trump's gathering
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after being called to the military in September.
Monday night he was arrested and charged with a domestic violence incident
"What my son is going through, what he is experiencing after he has returned, can connect him to other families that feel the spread of PTSD and some of the wounds our soldiers are returning with," she told participants at a meeting for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Paul called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said that her son and other war veterans "come a little changed, hardened, come to think if they receive proper respect from soldiers and other members of the army, for what they have given to the country."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence after an assault on a woman, after a report of domestic violence and armed robbery while he was drunk, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesperson of the Police Department in Wasilla.
18 states, D.C. support opposition to a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the Colombian Circle are supporting a legal opposition to a new American policy that denies asylum to victims who have saved criminal groups or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the circuit deposited an explanatory document as court-martials in Washington on Friday, in support of changing asylum-seeker policies, NBC News reports.
The full name of the prosecutor in Grace's case against the Session that the American Union of Civil Liberties has deposited in August against federal policy has not been discovered.
She said her partner "and her violent gang members," abused her, but American officials denied her asylum claim on July 20th.
She was banned in Texas.
State lawyers supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as producing a high number of asylum applicants in the US, because they are states with widespread gang problems and domestic violence.
The new US asylum policy returned a 2014 decision from the Emigrant Appeals Board that allowed immigrants without documents to save family violence and apply for asylum.
Colombian District Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores all decades of state, federal and international law."
"Federal laws require all asylum requirements to be tried according to the facts and specific circumstances of the case, and such a measure falls in line with this principle," the friend-judgment report said.
The lawyers further argued in the report that the police's ban on the entry of immigrants and damaging the American economy, saying their findings are to become entrepreneurs and "supply the necessary arm of work".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges in June not to give asylum to victims who escape domestic violence and gang violence.
"Azili is available to those who leave their country because of fear or persecution based on race, religious belief, nationality or affiliation in a particular group of social or political convictions," the session said on June 11th, on the day of the political declaration.
Asylum has never been thought to ease all the problems -- even all the serious problems -- that people face every day throughout the world.
Desperate efforts to save Paul while the balance of death is doubled in a race to find survivors
To the survivors, the situation was very honorable.
"The situation is quite tense," said 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, while keeping her little and sick son in an evacuation centre in the devastated town of Palusa.
"The ambulance brings troops every minute.
There's no clean water anymore."
The inhabitants saw to it that they returned to their ruined houses, bringing out their goods immersed in water, trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people have been injured, and the hospital damaged by the 7.5-ball earthquake is widespread.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Harris, who broke his back and shoulder, were placed at the Military Hospital outside Palus, where patients are being treated in the outer environment because of the earth’s earthquakes still continue.
His eyes filled with tears as he recalled the violent earthquake in the hotel room on the fifth floor he shared with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save yourself.
I think I was pushed under the ruins of the wall," Harris said to 'Associated Press', adding that his family had come to town for a wedding.
"I heard the woman was crying and asking for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to him and my kid.
I hope they're safe."
US Ambassador Indicts China for 'Gackaging' with 'propagandist advertising'
A week after China's official newspaper posted a four-page ad in an American daily that promoted the joint profits of US-China trade, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread its propaganda.
US President Donald Trump, last Wednesday, referred to the supplement with 'China Daily' in the 'Des Moines Register' - the most sold newspaper in the state of Iouas - after accusing China of attempting to intervene in the US Congress elections held on 6 November, a charge denied by China.
Trump's accusations that Beijing was trying to intervene in US elections marked what US officials told Reuters was a new phase in Washington's expanded campaign to add pressure to China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to set up advertising to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in a growing trade war, which has seen an equalisation of tariffs on imports from each other.
Chinese and American experts have said China's payroll rates in this trade war were set to hit state exporters like Ioua, who supported the Republican party of Trump.
Terry Branstad, US Ambassador to China and former governor for a long time in Ioua, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing has hit US employees, farmers and businesses.
In an opinion published in the 'Des Moines Register' Sunday, Branstad wrote, "China is already doubling this scourge by placing propaganda advertising advertising on our free press."
"As China's government distributes its propaganda, it is helped by the happy American tradition of free speech and free press by placing a fee-based advertisement in the Des Moines Register," Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, in newspapers kiosks on the road here in Beijing, you will find very few voices against and you will not see any real reflection of the different thoughts the Chinese may have on China's disturbing economic trajectory, being that the media is under strong control of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that "one of the most prominent newspapers in China, he avoided the offer to publish his article," even though he did not say which newspaper it was.
Analysts warn Republicans are changing women before elections in the middle of a post-Kavanaugh scandal
The more the main characters of Republicans to solidarity and protect the candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, in front of some sexual assault claims, analysts have warned that they will face a severe reaction especially from women in future elections in the middle of the mandate.
Emotions on this topic have been very high, and many republics have publicly declared that they want to continue voting for the candidate.
These things can't go away," Grant Reeher, professor of political sciences at the Syracuse University 'Skolla Maxwell told 'The Hill' about a published article Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s last minute's attempt for an FBI investigation and that this would be enough to calm angry voters.
"The state will not forget what happened yesterday -- they will not forget it either tomorrow or November," Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior national adviser and spokesman for the 'MoveOn' progressive group, said Washington D.C. newspaper on Friday.
On Friday morning, protestors sang 'Nentor is coming!' as they were demonstrating in the Senate halls while Republicans in control of the Judicial Committee decided to step forward with Kavanaugh's candidacy despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"Enthusiasm and democratic motivation will reach the top," news page Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst, said.
"People are saying it's already been on high levels; that's true.
But it may be even higher, especially among undecided voters of women on the outskirts and among young voters, aged 18 to 29, who, although they do not like the president, usually do not vote at all."
Even before Ford's public testimony detailing her sexual assault charges against the High Court candidate, analysts suggested that there would be a severe reaction if Republicans continued to support this candidacy.
"This has turned into a collided GOP disorder," said Michael Steele, former chairman of the National Committee of Republicans, at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee's vote or the final vote or whether or not Kavanaugh will be established in the accused's bank, it's also about the way the Republicans have dealt with this issue and the way they have treated that woman," NBC News, Guy Cecil, the director of Priority USA, said, a group that helps select Democrats.
However, the Americans seem to be somehow divided about who to believe in in the custody of Ford and Kavanaugh, with the latter having a slightly higher support.
A recent survey by ‘YouGov’ shows that 41 per cent of respondents undoubtedly believe in or with a lot of potential Ford's testimony, while 35 per cent say they believe in or with a lot of potential Kavanaugh.
Also, 38 per cent think that Kavanaugh, likely or doubtless, has lied during his witnessing, while only 30 per cent say the same about Ford.
Following Flake's insistence, the FBI is currently investigating the claims made by Ford and the other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reports The Guardian.
Last week, Ford testified before the Senate Judicial Committee, under oath, that Kavanaugh attacked him at the age of 17 while he was in a state of drunkenness.
Ramirez claims that the candidate for the Supreme Court, showed his genital organs before her while they were at a party during their studies in Yale, in the 1980s.
World Wide Network Creator plans to start a new web to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of the World Wide Network, is creating a company that aims to rival Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest technology legend project, 'Inrupt,' is a company built by Berners-Lee's open-source platform called 'Solid'.
'Solid' allows users to choose where their data is stored and what individuals are allowed to have access to certain information.
In an exclusive interview for 'Fast Company', Berners-Lee said with joke that the goal after 'Inrupt' is "world domination."
"We need to do it now," he said to this innovative company.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology to allow people to create "keeping their personal data on the network" or an POD.
It may contain lists of contacts, lists of things to do, musical lists, and other personal and professional tools.
It's the same as being available in a browser and at the same time Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify.
What is unique for storing personal data on the network is the fact that it remains entirely in the user’s hands about what kind of information it will access.
The company calls this "personal power through data."
The idea of Inrupt, according to company executive director John Bruce, is to bring together the resources, processes, and abilities needed to help Solid to be available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some developers hired to work on this project, and a voluntary coding community.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their decentralised applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team aren't talking to "Facebook and Google whether or not to present a total change where all their business models are completely immersed during the night.
"We're not asking for their permission."
In a post on 'Media' published Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that the Inrupt mission "is to offer commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps to protect the integrity and quality of the new solid-built network."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Network Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Over the past few months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the network's impasse debate.
While Inrupt is founded, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Network Consortium, the Network Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am quite optimistic about this new era of the network," Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of the Victorian Cross during World War I for the clergy
The only cleric who has won a Victorian Crusade during World War I in the qualities of the warrior is remembered at his birth, 100 years later.
Colonel Bernard Vann won the medal on September 29, 1918, in the Bellengise and Lehaucourt attack.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never realized that he had won the highest British military title.
A memorial stone was presented by his two grandchildren in a paradise in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of the grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "extraordinaryly symbolic" to show the memorial exactly 100 years from the heroic act that gave the medal to his grandfather.
According to 'London Gazettee', on September 29, 1918, Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Saint Quentin Canal "through a heavy fog and under the crack of bullets from the fields and the mitralos."
He then rushed to the line of fire and with a "great courage" led the battalion forward and caught one of the weapons in the field and killed only three people from the opposing forces.
Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 — a little more than a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions "are something he can never achieve but something that really shows modesty."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, settled from a post-paradise crown headed by the Brentwood Imperial Youth group.
Michael Vann said he "was quite honored that it was part of this parade" and added that "the value of a real hero is being shown by the support given to him by many people."
MMA fans stayed awake all night to follow Bellator 206, but instead they saw "Derrkucucen Pepa"
Imagine, you've been awake all night to see Bellator 206, and then you're being deprived of the opportunity to see this major event.
The San Jose show consisted of 13 fights, including six fights in the base package and would be displayed in real-time during the night on channel 5, in the MB.
At 6:00 a.m., while Gegard Mouses and Rory MacDonald were preparing to fight each other, viewers in Britain were surprised when the transmission changed to show Derrkucec Pepa.
Some were unhappy after staying awake all night until the first hours, especially for this game.
A fan on Twitter described this transition from fighting in a cartoon for children as "a bad joke."
"It is the rules of the government that determine that at 6 p.m. that content was not appropriate and we should switch to a children's programme," said Dave Schwartz, deputy marketing and communication vice president in Bellator, when asked about the transmission.
"Pep's Deer," after.
Bellator company president Scott Coker said they will work on programming to include viewers from Britain in the future.
"When I think about the retransmission, I think we can solve it," Coker said.
"But there's six o'clock in the morning, Sunday, and we won't be able to solve this problem until Sunday with our hour, so Monday with their hour.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program changed, there were lots of messages going around, and none of them were friendly.
We were trying to fix it because we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was a government problem.
I promise you it won't happen next time.
We're going to make the show with five matches instead of six -- as we usually do -- we're trying to give them more for fans, and maybe we're going over the bill.
It's a bad situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior about his sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality -- but it gave him reason to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn't understand until he went to nine-year-old school that "they weren't all like me."
Speaking on Radio 4's 'Desert Island Discs' first program, presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he raised the voice for homosexual rights to give "hope" to others.
He also said that after becoming a parent, he thought less about winning Olympic medals.
The permanent presenter of the long program, Kirsty Young, has taken a few months to rest because he is sick.
Showing himself as a protracted person in Laverne's first program, Daley said that while growing up he felt "inferior" to others because "it was not socially acceptable to like boys and girls."
He said, "To this day, those feelings of inferiority, and the fact that I felt differently, were the real elements that gave me the motivation and strength to succeed."
He wanted to prove that it was worth "something," he said, not to disappoint everyone when they learned about his sexual orientation.
Twice the winner of the bronze Olympic medal, he is already a high profile LGBT activist with high profile and used his participation in the Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to legitimize homosexuality.
He said he was open because he felt lucky that he was able to live openly and without consequences and that he wanted to give others "hope."
The world's champion said three times that falling in love with a man -- the American film producer Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 -- "has caught me unprepared."
Last year, Daley married the Oscar Prize winner, who is 20 years older than he is, but said the difference in age has never been a problem.
"When he experiences so many things in such a new age," he went to the first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later--he said it was difficult to find someone at the same age who had experienced the same low-rise.
The couple became parents in June, a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said his "all perspectives" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, everything I thought was 'I should win a gold medal'," he said.
"You know what, there are more important things than the Olympic gold medals.
My gold Olympic medal is Robbie."
His son bears the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011, at the age of 40, after being diagnosed with head cancer.
Daley said his father didn't admit he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked was if we had ready tickets for London 2012 -- because he wanted to be in the first row.
"I couldn't tell him that you couldn't be in the first row," he said.
"I was holding my hand while he was breathing and only after the rest was breathing and changed my life for the first time I accepted that he was not irreversible," he said.
The next year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
"I knew this was what I had dreamed of all my life -- to dive in front of the local audience at the Olympics, there was no better feeling," he said.
It also inspired his first musical selection -- Proud from Heather Small -- which has accompanied him during the preparations for the Olympic Games and continues to cause his mornicity.
Desert Island Discs is released on BBC Radio 4 Sunday at 11:15 a.m., British hour.
Mickelson, out of shape, left in the chair on Saturday at Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson will set a record Sunday when he plays his 47th match at Ryder Cup, but he will have to change his form so as not to return this historic moment to disappointment.
Mickelson, for whom it is the 12th time that participates in this event, a record of his own, organized every two years, was left on the table by Captain Jim Fury during the dubious games (fourballs and foursomes).
Instead of being at the heart of the action, as usual for the United States, the winner of major titles five times spent the day supporting the team and working with hope that he would leave behind the concerns.
Not among the players with the fairest hit even when he was at the top of his career, the 48-year-old is not a suitable player for the complicated Le Golf National field, where the long and difficult fields do not leave room for wrong shots.
And if not enough fear of the field, Mickelson, Sunday, in the ninth match, will face the British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has formed a team with the leading Tommy Fleetwood to win their fourth match this week.
If the Americans, who have four fewer points before the start of the 12 fights, start it hard, Mickelson's game can be decisive.
Fury expressed faith in his player, even though he could not say more than that.
"He fully understood the role he had today, gave me a stabbing of his shoulders, put his hand in my neck and told me he would be ready tomorrow," Fury said.
"He has a lot of faith in himself.
He's in the Famous Hall and he's made a lot of contributions to these teams in the past, and this week.
I probably didn't think he was gonna play two games.
I had thought more, but it finally turned out that way, and we thought it was the solution.
He wants to be in the field, like anyone else."
On Sunday, Mickelson will pass Nick Faldo's record for the player with more performance at Ryder Cup matches.
It can mark the end of his career at Ryder Cup, where he wasn't at the height of his individual appearances.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven equations, although Fury said his presence brings value to the team.
"He is hospitable, sarcastic, sharp, he likes to bully people, and he is a fantastic boy to have him in the team room," he explained.
"Also, I think the younger players were having fun dealing with him, during this week, and that was nice to see.
He gives more than just the game."
Captain of Europe, Thomas Bjorn knows that great leadership can soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, Europe's captain, knows from experience that the considerable leadership ahead of the last day of the tech games at Ryder Cup can be turned into an unpleasant factor.
Danez made his debut in the 1997 face in Valderrama, where the team with Captain Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead against the Americans closed the tournament by winning with a very narrow difference, 141⁄2-131.2.
"Remembers to yourself that we had a great lead in Valderrama; we had a great lead in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderrama where we won but with a lot of difficulty," said Bjorn, who was photographed after having seen the victory 5-3 in 'Class 2018' on Friday and yesterday to lead 10-6 in 'Le Golf National'.
So history tells me and everyone on that team that it's not over.
We'll walk tomorrow with the last march.
We'll go there and do the right thing.
Nothing's finished until we get the points on the table.
We have a goal, we try to win this trophy, and here's our focus.
I've said it all the time, I'm focused on the 12 players we have on the team, but we're aware of who we've got -- the best players in the world."
Satisfied with the performance of his players, in a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: "I don't want to rush into this phase.
Tomorrow we'll face another monster.
Tomorrow, individual performances come out, and that's something else to do.
It's great when you're in the field with a partner, when things go well, but when you're alone, then you're testing your full capacity as a golfer.
This is the message you must follow to the players, tomorrow you must give the best of yourself.
Now, forget your partner because he must go and give the best of himself."
Unlike Bjorn, opponent Jim Furyk will hope that his players will perform better individually than with partners, where only Jordan Spyeth and Justin Thomas, have received three out of four possible points.
Furyk himself has experienced two cases of major return of the result on the last day, being part of the winning team in Brooklyn before losing to what is considered the "Meditha in Medina" of the European team.
"Remember every word," when asked how he had motivated his players during the last day of Captain Ben Crenshaw in 1999.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but we must have a good start, as we saw in Brooklyn and Medina.
When you get a flow in one arm, you put a lot of pressure on the middle games.
We put the formation based on this and we'll get the boys into the ranking we believe is best, since you know, we're trying to do a miracle tomorrow."
Thomas has a duty to launch the downfall and will face Rory McIlroy in the main match, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter with European players standing in the first half of the ranking
"I chose this group and in this order I believe it covers all the roadside in the match," Bjorn said about his tech choices.
The production of a new German struggle is being postponed again
The new German Navy freight should have been sent in 2014 to replace the Cold War battles, but will not be ready until at least next year due to the very high cost and problematic systems, local media have reported.
The "Rheinland-Pfalz," the main ship of the new 'Baden-Wwerttemberg-class' frigates, has been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper 'Die Zeit', quoted by a military spokesman.
The ship had to join Marina in 2014, but problems after the shipment damaged the fate of the ambitious project.
The four ‘Baden-Wwerttemberg-class’ ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will serve as replacements for the old ‘Bremen-class’ flags.
As it is known, it will contain a powerful ball, a series of anti-aircraft missiles and anti-ships and detection technology (steel), such as a reduction in detection from radar, red infrared and acoustic waves.
Some of the other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible for new freights to be moved for more than two years away from the country's gates.
However, the ongoing delays mean that the fights of the latest technology -- which are said to allow Germany to reflect power abroad -- will be obsolete at the time they enter the service, writes 'Day Time'.
The F125 F125 Fregate came out on pages last year, when the German Navy officially rejected the order for this ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss marine yard in Hamburg.
This was the first time Marina returned a ship to her builder after her surrender.
They were given little information about the reasons for the return, but the media in Germany quoted as being a series of "great defects in software and hardware" that made the ship useless during a war mission.
The problems in the programme were particularly important in the Baden-Wwerttemberg-class ships because they will be operated by a crew of 120 sailors -- half the working power of the old 'Bremen Class' fractals.
It was also discovered that the ship was too heavy, which reduced its performance and limited Marina’s ability to add improvements to the future.
"Reinland-Pfalz" of 7,000 tonnes is believed to be twice the weight of ships of similar category used by Germans in World War II.
In addition to the physical parts with problems, the whole project's price -- including team training -- is also turning into a problem.
It is said that it has reached a figure that makes no mention of €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) - of €2.2 billion that had originally been predicted.
The problems that have gripped the new freight are becoming particularly important after recent warnings that the German Navy's power is diminishing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the defence committee in the German parliament, admitted that Marina is "enduring suitable ships to move to another country."
The official said the problem had been added over time because the old ships had been removed from use but had not been replaced with new ones.
He said with regret that none of the new baden-Württemberg-class frigates could join the Navy.
The National Trust Observes the Secret Life of Night’s Darkness
A new research that is being carried out by a company in the mountainous areas of Scotland aims to find out how nighttime larks use the ground to hunt for food.
It is hoped that new findings will shed new light on the behavior of single flying sailors and will help protective activities in the future.
The study by scientists in the National Trust for Scotland will follow the usual night loops and those called soprano pipstrelelles as well as the long brown and daubenton loops in the Inverewe gardens in Western Ross.
Special recording equipment will be placed at key points throughout the area to track nighttime eclipse activities throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct field studies using hand detectors.
A sound analysis by experts for all recordings will determine the frequency of night noise sounds and what each species does.
Then a report and a map of their habitat will be prepared to give a detailed overview of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, NTS Nature Protection Adviser, hopes that the conclusions will show which habitats are most important to the night skyscrapers and how they are used by each species.
This information would help determine the property of the local administration, such as the cultivation of crops and how forests are maintained for the night hares and other associated species.
The number of nightmares in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom has become significant over the past century.
They are under threat from construction and development that has an impact on the populace and loss of habitat.
Wind and lighting turbines may also pose a risk, such as attachment letters or chemical components of building materials, as well as domestic animal attacks.
Indeed, the darknesses of night are not blind.
However, because of their habit of hunting during the night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use sophisticated location detection techniques through sounds to accurately determine insects and obstacles during flight.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, is taken very seriously with nightmares of the night.
There are ten trained experts who conduct regular studies, speech inspections, and sometimes include in rescue programs.
The organisation has even set up the first and only reserve in Scotland dedicated to nightmares in Thrave, Dumfries and Galloway, which serves as a home for eight of the ten species of nightmares in Scotland.
The administrator of this reserve, David Thompson, says that this country is the ideal territory for them.
"Here at Three, we have a great area for night falls," he said.
"We have old buildings, many old trees and all the proper habitat.
But there are still many things about the dark of the night that remain unknown, about the work we do here and elsewhere will help us understand more about what they need to 'developing'."
He stresses the importance of carrying out checks on the night before performing property maintenance work because there is a chance that the imminent destruction of a speech may kill up to 400 women and young people at night, thus destroying the entire population of an area.
The nightmares of the night are protected and killing, harassing and worrying or destroying their speech is illegal.
Elizabeth Ferrell, a Scottish worker near the Trust for Night’s Watchfulness, encourages people to become part of the relief team.
She said, "We still have much to learn about our nightmares at night and many of our species, we just don't know how their population is moving."
Ronaldo denies allegations of rape while lawyers prepare to indict the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo said the charges of rape against him are "false news," saying that people "want to promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyers are determined to indict the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which published these charges.
The attacker of Portugal and Juventus has been charged with rape by an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
On Friday, Der Spiegel reported that he was later alleged to have paid her $375 000 to avoid talking about the incident.
Speaking in a live video on Instagram, addressed to 142 million of his followers, just hours after the publication of these claims, Ronaldo, 33 years of age, considered reports as "false news."
"No, no, no, no, no.
What he said today is false news," Gold Top winner said in front of the camera five times.
"They want to promote themselves using my name.
It's normal.
They want to become famous by saying my name, but that's part of the job.
I am a happy man and everything is going well," the player added smiling.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to charge Der Spiegel with these charges, which they have called "unacceptable reports of private life doubts."
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for "moral damage to the value corresponding to the seriousness of the violation, which is perhaps one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident is said to have occurred in June 2009, at a Palms Hotel and Casino suite in Las Vegas.
According to documents presented at the Clarke Circuit Court in Nevada, after meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga are said to have gone to the player's room, where he is alleged to have raped him in anus.
Mayorga claims Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and said "99 per cent" he is a "good boy" left in the mud by "one per cent."
The document says Ronaldo confirms that the couple had committed sexual intercourse but that it was with the acceptance of both sides.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that she had photos of her injuries in a hospital, but later she agreed on a solution outside the court because she was "damaged by revenge" and that she was concerned that she would "suffer publicly."
34-year-old says she is now trying to reverse the deal because it continues to be traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was at the joint with Real Madrid by Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer he passed to the Italian Juventus giants in an agreement of 100m euros.
Brexit: United Kingdom "will regret forever" for losing the status of car manufacturers
The United Kingdom "will regret it forever" if it loses the status of world leader in the production of cars after Brexit, business secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "disquieting" that Toyota in the United Kingdom had told the BBC that if Britain were to leave the EU without an agreement, the company would temporarily stop production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese car manufacturer said the impact of delays at the border, in the event of unagreed exit, would cost the loss of jobs.
The factory in Burnaston, which produces the Toyota Auris and Avensis models, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, of which 90% were exported to other countries of the European Union.
"In my judgment, if Britain comes out of the EU at the end of March, we will stop production at our factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's administrative director at Burnaston.
Other car manufacturers in the MB, such as Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also expressed fear of leaving the EU without an agreement and of how cross-border trade will work.
For example, BMW said that after Brexit will close its Mini series factory for a month.
The main concerns relate to the fact that car manufacturers refer to supply chain risks in the case of an unagreed Brexit.
Toyota's production line works on the basis "as soon as ordered," with parts coming every 37 minutes from the suppliers from the MB and the EU, for ordering cars.
If, on March 29th, MB comes out of the EU without an agreement, there may be delays within which this industry may lead to delays and missing parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep the inventory at her factory in Derbyshire more than one day, the company said, and to produce it would stop.
Mr. Clark said Theresa May's 'Checkers' plan for future relations with the EU "has been built specifically to avoid these controls at the border."
"We need an agreement. We want to have the best deal that will allow us not only to enjoy the success of the moment to also take advantage of this opportunity," he said for the Today's programme at BBC Radio 4.
"The data, not only from Toyota but also from other producers, show that we certainly need to be able to continue what a successful supply chain has been."
Toyota could not determine how long the production would stop, but in the long term, he warned that the added costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and thus lead to reduced jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and who is the senior official of the United Union trade union at the factory, said members are increasingly concerned: "According to my experience when these countries close, they are no longer returning.
One government spokesman said: "We have set a definite and reliable plan for our relationship with the EU in the future."
The Trump meeting with Rosenstein can be postponed again, White House says
Donald Trump's high-level meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could "extend for a week" after continuing the fight for High Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh said on Sunday the White House.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russia's election interventions, the links between Trump and Russia's assistant staff and the possibility that the president has obstructed justice.
The debate whether Trump will discharge the deputy general from duty, thus endangering Mueller's independence, is something that has created rumors for months in Washington.
Earlier this month, New York Times reported that Rosenstein took into consideration the appointment of an listener to record talks with Trump and the possibility of downloading the president through Amendment 25.
Rosenstein denied the news.
But last Monday, he went to the White House, among reports that he was near giving up.
Unlike what I expected, a meeting with Trump was announced Thursday, which was at the United Nations headquarters in New York.
Trump said he would "prefer" not to discharge Rosenstein but then the meeting was pushed to avoid a clash with the hearing held by the Senate's judicial committee, where Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford testified, one of the women who accused him of innocent sexual conduct.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week investigation by the FBI into claims against Kavanaugh, pushing further the full vote in the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, was present today at Fox News Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said, "It's not yet a date, it could be this week.
But let's see, and I always like to keep the press up-to-date."
Some journalists may object to this statement: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since 10 September.
Moderator Chris Wallace raised the question why.
Sanders said the lack of press conferences did not result from the dissatisfaction with the attitude of television journalists," although she said, "I will not deny the fact that they attract attention."
Later, it was made clear that direct contact between Trump and the press would be increased.
"The president conducts more quality assurance sessions than any other president before him," she said, adding, without quoting the data: "We have seen these figures."
It will continue to have a press conference, Sanders said, but "if the press has a chance to question directly to the President of the United States, then this is much better than talking to me.
We're trying to do this often and you've seen that we've done it often in recent weeks, replacing press conferences in cases where you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly accepts questions when he leaves the White House or when he participates in open - air sessions or at a press conference with important personalities.
Individual press conferences are rare.
The president may have shown the reason for this fact, during this week, in New York, where he made a controversial statement and in some strange cases, in front of reporters.
Health Secretary writes to EU employees in NHS Scotland about fear of Brexit
The Health Secretary has written to staff from the EU working at NHS in Scotland to express gratitude on behalf of the country and the desire to stay even after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, members of the Scottish parliament, has sent a letter, when less than six months have elapsed since the EU's departure.
The Scottish government has already taken over to cover application costs for the status of permanent resident for EU citizens working in local public services.
In her letter, Mrs. Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations on the removal of the EU from the EU have continued, approaching a decision in autumn.
However, the MB government has also intensified its preparations in the case of an unagreed scenario.
I know that this is a very worrying time for all of you.
For this reason, I wanted to stress how much I appreciate the contribution of each member of the staff, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that grow and improve the health service work, increasing the benefits of the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is certainly your home and we want you to stay here."
Christian Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after head injury
Tennessee State Tigers resident Christian Abercrombie submitted an immediate surgical intervention after the damage to the head followed on Saturday at the loss of 31-27 against Vanderbilt Commodores, reported The Tennesseean journalist Mike Organ.
Tennessee State Coach Rod Reed told reporters that the damage occurred shortly before the first part.
"He came to the sidelines and fell there," Reed said.
The coaches and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen on the side line before they put it in the bar and sent it for further tests.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville that Abercrombie had completed surgery at the Vanderbilt Hospital.
Harris added that "there is still no detail on the type/scale of damage" and Tennessee State is trying to understand when the damage happened.
Abercrombie, a second-year student, is in his first Tennessee State season after moving from Illinois.
He made five interventions Saturday before leaving the game, bringing him to 18 total number of interventions during the season.
Foreign buyers will pay the highest bill when buying a property in MB
Foreign buyers will pay the highest bill for the purchase of a property in the MB and the additional money will be used to help homeless people according to the new Conservative Party plans (Tory)
This move will neutralise the success of Corby's initiative to attract new voters
Pulse tax will apply to those who do not pay taxes in MB
Treasury Department expects to collect up to GBP 120m a year to help homeless people
Theresa May will announce today that foreign buyers will pay the highest bill for purchasing a property in the MB and additional money will be used to help homeless people.
This move will be seen as an effort to neutralise the success of Jeremy Corby's initiative to attract new voters with promises to provide more affordable shelter and to "sign" high-income people.
The pullover tax will apply to individuals and firms who do not pay taxes in the US, while additional money will support the government's initiative to fight the lack of housing.
This extra fee -- which adds to the current fee of the chicken, including the increase in the tattoo scale presented two years ago for the second houses and for the properties purchased for rent -- can go up to three per cent.
The Treasury Department predicts that this move will accumulate up to GBP 120m per year.
About 13 per cent of recently built properties in London are purchased by non-MB residents, which causes price increases and makes it more difficult to find accommodations by buyers for the first time.
Many rich areas of the country -- especially in the capitals -- have become "phantom cities" because of the high number of foreign buyers spending most of their time abroad.
This new policy comes just a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the chicken tax to help young people buy their first home.
He accused the major construction firms of keeping high prices by buying land but not putting into use, and called on Mrs. May to give up quotas for facing homes, in order to regulate Britain's turf with property.
Mr. Corby has proposed some attractive housing reforms, including the control of rentals and the removal of "no reason".
He also wants to give more authority to counsel on building new houses.
Mrs. May said: "Last year I declared that I would dedicate the mandate of the prime minister of the British dream recovery -- so, for a better life for every new generation.
And that means we fix the problem of the home market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work, and build a life here.
However, it is not right for individuals, who do not live in the US and foreign societies, to buy homes more easily than British workers.
For many people, the dream of owning a house has become something too difficult to achieve and the injustice to the homeless is more than real."
Jack Ross: 'My greatest ambition is to train Scotland'
Sunderland Coach Jack Ross says "his greatest ambition" is to become Scotland's coach at a certain stage.
Scotland, 42 years of age, is enjoying the challenge of awakening the northeastern club, which is currently located in the third place in League One (third category), three points away from the head.
He arrived this summer at the Light Stadium after returning St. Mirren to the Scottish League Prime Minister last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I once appeared in representative B and only so," Ross told BBC Scotland Sportsound.
"But as a child I grew up seeing Scotland many times in Hampden with my father, and it is something that has always drawn me.
However, this possibility will only come if I succeed in the direction of clubs."
Ross' ancestors in the direction of Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Alloa Athletic's former coach says he's not worried that he's following the steps of these big names in such a big club since he's previously refused offers from Barnesley and Ipswich Town.
"For the moment, my success will depend on the fact that if I can bring this team back to the Premier League?
Given the structure and environment of this club, there is no doubt the country in the Premier League," he said.
"It's not easy to go there, but I would see myself as successful only if I could get the club back to Premier League."
Ross has only been a coach for three years after a period as assistant coach in Dumbarton and a 15-month period in the Hearts management staff.
Then he helped Alloa climb a category up to the third round of the Cup, as well as transform St Mirren from a club near the fall from the category to the championship title winners next season.
And now, Ross says he feels better than he ever felt during his career as a Clyde player, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
"Perhaps it was really a turning point," he says, for taking Alloa's direction.
"I really believed that training was the right thing for me, more than being a player.
It seems strange because I played well, I made a good life because of this profession, and I enjoyed some good achievements.
But being a player can be difficult.
You have to experience a lot of things every week.
As a result, I experience a lot of stress and pressure from work, but training seems to be the right thing to do.
I've always wanted to practice and now I've been doing something like this.
The full interview can be heard on Sunday, 30 September, at Radio Scotland from 12:00 to 13:00 BST
According to one study, the perfect time to drink a beer is Saturday at 5:30 p.m.
Summer's heat wave has increased local income in difficult situations in Britain, but has increased pressure on restaurants' chains.
Data show that sales in local groups and bars increased by 2.7 per cent in July, but shopping in restaurants fell by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin, a business consultant in the CGA, who compiled the data, said: "The continuous weather with the sun and England's participation in the World Cup for longer than expected, influenced July to follow the same trend as in June, where local sales grew by 2.8 per cent, while restaurants registered even higher decline.
The tour to the restaurant fell by 1.8% in June, and worsened even further in July.
Bars and venues with main activity supplying drinks registered the best performance, with higher growth than reduction of trade in restaurants.
Locals with the main activity of offering food also recognized the decline as a result of the sun's weather, although not as significant as restaurants.
Looks like people just want to get out for a drink.
Drink sales in bars and locals increased by 6.6 per cent that month, while food fell by three per cent."
Paul Newman, a leisure and hospitality analyst at the RSM said: "These results confirm the trend we have seen since the end of April.
When it comes to sales in the retail market, the weather and the impact of important social or sports events remain the main factors.
It is no wonder that groups of restaurants continue to face difficulties, although a 4.8 per cent drop in sales per year will have a particularly heavy burden considering the ongoing cost pressure.
The long and hot summer could not come at a more difficult time for food operators, and the time would indicate whether the average temperatures of August would give the desired calm."
The total increase in sales at the premises and restaurants, including newly opened ones, was 2.7 per cent in July, reflecting the slowdown in brand launch.
The Coffer Peach industry sales tracking index, for the bar and restaurant sector in the MB, collects and analyzes data from 47 companies, with a total turnover of more than GBP 9 billion, and is the point of industry reference.
One in five children has secret social media accounts that hide their parents
According to one study, one in five children — some of whom are not over 11 years of age — have secret accounts in the social media that hide parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 nine-year-old education students showed an increase in "false Insta" profiles
This news has increased the fear of sexual content posts
Twenty per cent of students said they have a "main" account that shows their parents
One in five children — some of whom are not more than 11 years of age — are opening the social media account, which they use secretly in adults.
A survey of 20,000 nine-year-old education students showed a rapid increase in Insta's "false" profiles -- related to the photos distribution page, Instagram.
This news has increased the fear of sexual content posts.
Twenty per cent of students said they use a clean "main" account that shows their parents, but also have a private account.
A mother, who accidentally discovered her 13-year-old daughter's secret account, found that a teenager encouraged others to "violence."
The study of Digital Awareness UK and the "Headmasters and Headmasters" Conference of Independent Schools (HMC) revealed that 40 per cent of the 11 to 18-year-olds had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having secret accounts.
HMC chief Mike Buchanan said: "It is disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create social spaces where parents and teachers cannot find them."
Elid Doyle will be "the voice of athletes" on the athletic board in Scotland
Elid Doyle has been elected to the Athletics Board in Scotland, at the post of non-executive director of this governing body, during the annual general assembly meeting.
Doyle is the most decorated Scottish athlete of the streets and fields, and President Ian Beattie described this decision as a great opportunity for all sports leaders to benefit from its extensive international experience during the past decade.
"Eilid enjoys massive respect in the athletic community in Scotland, the MB and the world, and we are sure that athletics in Scotland will benefit extremely much by making that part of the board," Beattie said.
Doyle said, "I am enthusiastic that I will serve as the voice of athletes and I hope to contribute and help in the direction of sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200-metre and 400-metre race in the 1996 Games in Atlanta, with four gold medals in total and who is a regular expert on BBC, lost his ability to walk after a temporary ischemic hit.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago I suffered a stroke.
I can't walk.
The doctors said that only time would tell him if I was going to be healed and to what extent.
It took a tiresome job, but I was able to recover completely, I learned to walk again, and today I am carrying out a thorough training course!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Ginger pump advertising that compares mothers to cows divides public opinion
A company for the production of giraffe pumps has shared public opinion with a commercial that compares mothers to cows ’ eggs.
To launch the promotion of what is considered "the world's first no-sound and wearable breast pump," the consumer technology product company Elvie showed a host music video to advertise the freedom that this new pump gives to mothers who need to express themselves freely.
Four real mothers dance in a cow barn filled with bar under the sounds of a song with text as follows: "Yes, I'm mad at myself, but I don't have a tail" and "If you hadn't noticed, these aren't tears, it's my chest."
Refrene continues: "Bombs, pumping, feeding babies, pumping, pumping, milling ladies."
However, advertising, which has been published on the firm's Facebook page, has sparked online debate.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from viewers, many of whom say it underestimates the "treasures" of the milk industry.
"The use of cows to advertise this product is a very weak decision.
Just like us, they should remain "pregnant" and "born" to produce milk, only their babies take away from them a few days after they are born," someone wrote.
Elvie giraffe pump is placed inside the recipes and does not fall into sight (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment: "Precisely traumatic for the mother and the child.
Why don't we use it to advertise a giraffe pump for mothers who can hold their babies?"
Someone else added, "What non-sensitivity ads."
Others supported the advertisement, among which a woman admitted that the song seemed "for fun."
"I think this is a brilliant idea.
I'd have bought one if you were still feeding the baby with the juice.
The pump made me feel just like a cow.
Advertising is a little crazy, but I saw what it meant.
This is a brilliant product," someone wrote.
Another comment: "This is a host advertisement addressed to mothers who use the pump (often in the workplace or in the toilet) and feel like "the cow."
This is not an ad that evaluates or judges the milk industry."
At the end of the video, the group of women shows that they've all danced with the "hidden" pump placed in the recipes.
The concept behind this campaign is based on the data that many women using giraffe pumps say they feel cows.
However, the Elvie pump is soundless, no wire or pipe, placed inside the recipes and does not fall into sight, giving women free to move, keep their babies, and even get out while they are using it.
Ana Balarin, partners and ECD (Creative Executive Director) in Mother commented: "The Elvis pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a courageous and provocative promotion.
By making a parallel between women who want to express themselves freely and milk cows, we wanted to highlight the use of the breast pump and the challenges they face, also showing in a fun and similar way the extraordinary sense of freedom that the new pump gives.
This is not the first time Elvie pump comes out on the first page.
During the fashion week in London, a mother of two children appeared on the stylish Marta Jakubowski wall using the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children have been displaced in a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of banned immigrant children has increased even though the monthly number of crossings at the border has remained relatively the same, partly as a result of rhetoric and rigid policies presented by the Trump administration that have made sending children to their supporters difficult.
Usually, most of the supporters have been even undocumented immigrants themselves, and they are afraid to risk their position in the country by deciding to apply for a child.
The risk was increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential supporters and other adult members of the same family would have to give signs of hands, and these data would also pass on to the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official of the Immigration and Customs Agency, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people, who had applied to support unscrupulous bribery.
Later, the agency confirmed that 70 per cent of those arrested had no previous criminal precedent.
"About 80 per cent of individuals who are supporters or members of the family of supporters remain in the country illegally and a large part of them are foreigners with criminal precedent.
So we are continuing to follow these individuals," said Mr. Albence.
According to the shelter workers, making sure to process child data more quickly, officials introduced new rules that required some of them to appear in court within a month of the time of the ban, not after 60 days, as was the previous standard.
Many of them will appear before the immigration judge through videoconferencing and not physically, to argue their claim for legal status.
Those who do not qualify will be deported immediately.
According to shelter workers and reports received from the system in recent months, the longer the children stay banned, the more likely they are to feel anxious or depressed, which may lead to violent explosions or attempts to escape.
Supporters say that these concerns are more pronounced in larger environments such as Tornillo, where, due to the size, signs that a child has difficulty are more likely to be ignored.
They add that moving children to your city without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to your friends may cause the trauma that many of them already face.
Syria calls for American, French and Turkish "the occupying forces" to withdraw immediately
During his speech at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, although the war in the country has already entered the eighth year.
Moualem, who also holds the post of deputy prime minister, said foreign forces remain in the Syrian country illegally, with the pretext that they are fighting terrorism, and that "they will act with them in the right way."
"They should withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he said during the assembly.
Moualem insisted that "the fight against terrorism has almost ended" in Syria, where more than 360 000 people have been killed since 2011, and millions more have been expelled from their homes.
He said Damascus will continue "to fight in this holy battle until we have cleansed all Syrian territories" both by terrorist groups and by "foreign foreign forces".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising the Kurdish and Arab forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the territory of this country divided by war.
On the refugee issue, Moualem said the conditions are good for them to return, and he blamed "some Western countries" for "spreading irrational fear" that push refugees to stay away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate their return," he said.
"They are politicizing a matter that must be entirely humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not provide assistance for the reconstruction of Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
UN diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a neutral area in the last major fort of the rebels in Idlib has created an opportunity to move forward with political discussions.
The Russian-Turkish deal avoided a wide-ranging attack by the Russian-backed Syrian forces in this province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement had "clear guidelines" and expressed confidence that military attacks would target the jihadists, including those fighting from Front Nusra related to Al-Qaeda, who "will be destroyed".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to call soon the first meeting of a new committee made up of members of the government and the opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem outlined the conditions for the government's participation in this committee, saying the panel's work should be limited "in reviewing the mothers of the current constitution," and warned that there should be no intervention.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to this logic, Mr. Trump will be resolved in 2020 unless, as many people with liberal views hope, accusations and scandals put an end to his former presidency.
In what would certainly be "the most dramatic discovery of a presidency in history!"
So far, there's no sign of the viewer's fatigue.
Since 2014, the number of viewers during the peak hour has doubled to 1.05 million in CNN and has nearly tripled to 1.6 million in MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers during the peak hour, of 1.7 million who were four years ago, while the MSNBC program, "The Rachel Maddow Show", has reached the top of the cable channel classification with 3.5 million viewers during the evenings with big events.
"It's a fire that people are drawn to because it's something we don't understand," said Neal Baer, director of the drama series in ABC "Designated Survivor," which tells the story of a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an old comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys," has another theory.
It recalls a taxi trip to Boston before the 2016 elections.
The driver said he'd vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? She asked.
He said, "Because it makes me laugh," Mrs. Scovell told me.
There are fun values in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, stories coming from Washington can determine the future of Roe v. Wade, if immigrant families can unite and health of the global economy.
Ignore is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can face.
However, if you find yourself after six hours seeing a panel of experts discussing the use of "pacified information" by Bob Woodward in his book "Fear," Paul Manafort's gold-skin bomber, worth $15,000 ("a dress filled with pride," The Washington Post) said as well as the implications of Stormy Daniels' live descriptions, for Mr. Trump's anatomy, then it goes beyond being an informed citizen.
At least I'll never see Super Mario the same way again.
"A part of what he does and what makes it look like a 'reality show' is that you are fed with something every night," said Brent Montgomery, executive head of the Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the "Pawn Stars," about the actors circulating and unexpected daily developments of the Trump programme (debate with N.F.L., praise for Kim Jong).
You can't leave an episode out of sight, or you can stay behind.
When I went to Mr. Fleiss this week, the time was sunny and the temperature outside was 80 degrees, outside his house on the northern coast of Kaui, but he was hiding inside, watching MSNBC, while registering CNN.
He could not leave, not while Brett Kavanaugh was facing the Senate Judicial Committee and the future of the Supreme Court, which depended on the plumbing.
"I remember when we carried out all those crazy programs in the past and people who said, "This is the last beginning of Western civilization," Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but it turned out they were right."

The money from outside the private sector flows into the tight competition for Congress elections
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's area 17 is facing a cash flow, as a result of the reorganization of the electoral zones, which obliges two officials to race for the same post.
This recent reorganisation in Pittsburgh peripheral areas has established Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won a position in another area, in the special elections, last spring.
Lamb is running against another candidate, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents Pennsylvania's 12th-old zone, which is over-set by the new 17th zone.
This new division of maps came after the decision of the Pennsylvania High Court, which, in January, stated that the old areas were impartially and unfairly designated in favour of the Republicans.
This race, in the new area 17, has also spurred a strong confrontation in the financing of campaigns by the party's main funding bodies, the Democratic Committee for Congress Campaigns (DCCC) and the National Republican Committee for Campaigns (NRCC).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a close victory in the special elections that were held widely in March for the 18th election area of Pennsylvania.
For more than a decade, that post was held by the Republicans, and President Donald Trump won the area with 20 points of difference.
Political experts see democrats as an easy favor.
The US takes into consideration punishing El Salvador for supporting China, then withdraws
Diplomats found that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little push from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until partners expelled the organisation's manager team.
State Department officials decided to remove US heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of "the latest decisions not known in Taiwan," department spokesman Heather Naurut said during a statement earlier this month.
But the penalties were only discussed with El Salvador who received a US aid of about 140m in 2017, including for drug control, development and economic support.
Proposed penalties involving reductions in financial assistance and restrictions imposed on visas would be severe for Central America's country and its high levels of unemployment and murder.
As internal meetings progressed, officials from the countries of North and Central America pushed a high-level conference focused on security and economic well-being to follow a similar meeting last year, an action that was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from going to the United States.
But in mid - September, senior officials of the administration made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, ending any opportunity to impose penalties on El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence has planned to hold talks at the conference, which is foreseen in mid-October, a signal that shows the importance of the administration's meeting, the diplomats expressed.
And the three American envoys returned peacefully from El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without strong messages or punishment from Washington.
A White House official for Mr. Bolton refused to comment on the details of the debate described by three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal discussions, provided that their anonymity was preserved.
Their explanations were confirmed by an analyst near the administration, who also spoke, seeking the right to anonymity.
Study history
The next event that is expected to take place may be the report by Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller on possible interference by Mr. Trump, for which there is considerable evidence in the public data.
It is reported that Mr. Mueller is moving his investigation to verify whether during his campaign, Mr. Trump has co-operated with Russia in the attack on our elections.
If Congress changes its arm, Mr. Trump will have to account for this organ at a time when he is prepared to appear before the voters again, and perhaps he can face an independent jury.
This is a lot if, and I don't want to suggest that Mr. Trump's fall or that of his counterparts in Europe is inevitable.
All of us, from both sides of the Atlantic, have to make choices that will affect how long the conflict will last.
In 1938, German officials were ready to push the state against Hitler, if the West had resisted and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed, and we lost the opportunity to avoid the years of the next massacre.
The course of history depends on these turning points, which speed up or delay the impenetrable course of democracy.
At present, Americans are facing some of these turning points.
What will we do if Mr. Trump downloads Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has not been in a difficult situation ever since this newspaper reported, during the past year, that he had suggested secretly listening to the president, and had speculated that he is not fit to remain in office.
Mr. Rosenstein said the Times article was not correct.
"How will we respond if the new investigation requested by the F.B.I. for Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or correct - or if he is confirmed in the High Court despite allegations of sexual assault and false evidence?
And above all, will we vote in the next elections for a Congress that will consider Mr. Trump's responsibility?
If we fail in these tests, then democracy will face a long winter.
But I believe we will not fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jewish woman from Czechoslovakia, who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that conquered the embassies I lived in.
She survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later sent me to burn the Saturday candles at the table holding the symbol of the swan (broken cross).
Having this heritage, how can I not be optimistic about our future?"

Ranger player Graham Dorrans is optimistic before facing Rapid Vienna
On Thursday, Rangers await Rapid Vienna, knowing that a victory in front of the Austrians, after the striking match in Spain against Villareal, earlier this month, would put them in a favourable position to qualify for the G Group of the European League.
A sleep damage didn't allow mesfuser Graham Dorrans to make the first show this season at the 2-2 Villareal equation, but he believes Rangers can use that result as an incentive to achieve bigger things.
"It was an important point for us because Villareal is a good team," 31-year-old said.
"We went into the field believing that we could take something and we got out with a point.
Perhaps we could have noted at the end but, in general, I believe that equality was a good result.
Maybe they were better at the first while we showed up at the second and we were the best team.
Thursday will be another big European evening.
I hope we can get three points, but it'll be a difficult match because they achieved a positive result in their past match, but with the icons that support us, I'm sure we can move forward and get a positive result.
Last year was very difficult, because of the injuries and changes in the club, but now there is a factor of optimism in this team.
The team is good, and the boys are enjoying this very much; training goes well.
I hope we can move forward, throw the past season behind our arms and achieve success."
Women sleep less as a result of fear of pension savings
Although the study participants had a clear idea of how we would like family members to be careful about them, very few people talked to them about it.
About half of the individuals in the nationwide study said they were talking to their husbands about long - term care costs.
Only 10 per cent replied that they were talking to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't talk about it," said Holly Snyder, deputy president of the society for life insurance, Nationwide.
Here's where we should start.
Talk to your spouse and your children: You cannot prepare your family to care for you unless you first show your wishes.
Work with your counselor and your family, and discuss where and how to benefit from care, as these choices can be an important factor in determining costs.
Also take your financial advisor: The consultant can help you find a way to pay for your expenses.
Long-term care financing options include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life-saving policy to help cover these expenses or self-security through your wealth - for as long as you have money.
Prepare legal documents: Avoid legal battles through authorization.
Take a look for health care and appoint a trusted person who will supervise your health care and ensure that experts act in accordance with your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
Also consider getting a prosecution for your finances.
Choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions on your behalf and guarantee payment of bills if you cannot do something like that yourself.
Don’t forget the details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is on the way to the hospital.
Are you able to answer questions about allergies and medicines you're taking?
Prepare a written plan with these details so that you can be ready.
"Not only is the financial aspect at stake, but who are the doctors?" Martin asked.
"What medications will be used?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Prepare this plan."
A person is shot several times with an air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air rifle as he went home after spending the night outside.
The victim, about 40 years old, was in the Oxford Grove area in Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
Police officers stated that this was a "random act", which took place around 02:30 BST.
The victim didn't see the attacker.
The injuries suffered do not pose a risk to life, and the police are looking for witnesses.
Tribulation and tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died as a result of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials have declared that the number of dead is expected to increase.
With out-of-function communication networks, assistance workers have not been able to obtain information from the Dongala Regency, a region in northern Palau, which was closer to the earthquake epidemic of 7.5 faces.
In Palau, more than 16,000 people have been evacuated after this disaster.
Below are some facts about Paul and Dongala on the island of Sulawes:
Palu is the capital of the central province of Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow line on the western coast of the island of Sulawesi, with a population of about 379,800 inhabitants, in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when it was hit by the earthquake and tsunami.
Donghala is a regency extending more than 300 km (180 miles) along the coast line north-west of the island of Sulawesi.
Regenca, a smaller administrative region than the province, had an estimated population of about 299 200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fisheries and molluscs are the province's main economic activities, especially in the coastal region of Dongala.
Nickel extraction is also important in the province, but it is mainly concentrated in Morowal, on the other side of the Sulawesi coast.
According to the Disaster Reduction Agency in Indonesia, Palau and Donghala have been hit several times by tsunami during the last 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dongala.
In 1996, another tsunami struck the western part of Dongala, causing nine casualties.
Indonesia is located in the fire ring’s seismic area in the Pacific Ocean and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Below are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: On December 26, a powerful earthquake on the western coast of Aceh Province, Indonesia, in the northern part of Sumatra, caused a tsunami that struck 14 states, causing 226,000 victims along the Indian Ocean Coastline, of which more than half lived in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes struck the western coast of Sumatra at the end of March and early April.
Hundreds lost their lives on the island of Nias Island, on the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-faced earthquake struck the south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that hit the south coast and killed some 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-front earthquake near the city of Padang, the capital of the western province of Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5 - face earthquake struck one of the Isles of Mentawai, in Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 20 feet [10 m] that destroyed tens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A Czech earthquake hit Regent Pidie Jaya in Aceh, bringing destruction and panic to people after reminding them of the destruction caused by the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time, there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people lost their lives from the collapse of buildings.
2018: Powerful earthquakes struck the tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, most of whom in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily blocked thousands of tourists.
Sarah Pauline's older son is arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the great son of former Alaskan governor and deputy candidate for President Sarah Palin, has been arrested with the charge of aggression.
According to a report submitted on Saturday by the Alaskan state police, Paulin, 29 years old, by Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested as a suspect of domestic violence, obstructing domestic violence reporting and refusing arrest.
According to the police report, when a woman known to him tried to call the police to report alleged crimes, he received the phone.
Paul is being held in Mat-Su's prison yard and a guarantee is being held in the form of unsecured $500 bonds, KTU reported.
According to reports of this network, he was brought before the court on Saturday and when asked about the admission of guilt, he declared "it is absolutely innocent".
Paul faces three category A violations, which means he can be imprisoned for up to a year and sentenced to $250,000.
He is also charged with a category B violation, which is punishable by a day in prison and $2000 fines.
It's not the first time a criminal charge against Paul has been filed.
In December 2017, he was accused of attacking his father, Todd Paulin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
This issue is currently being considered by the Veterans Court in Alaska.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, family violence reporting, and intoxicating armaments during the incident.
His girlfriend had claimed that he had hit him with a fist in his face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups after linking her son's violent behavior with PTSD (post-traumatic stress syndrome) as a result of the service in Iraq.
Tribulation and tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds Dead
At least 384 people have lost their lives on Friday, as a result of an earthquake that hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
The 7.5 - face earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication networks are out of service, and the number of dead is expected to rise during the following days.
The earthquake hit the central part of Sulawesi, northeastern Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
Social media broadcast videos showing the moment of the strike.
Hundreds of people were gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors seek a rare death penalty for suspected terrorist attack at NYC
Federal prosecutors in New York but seeking a death penalty for Sayfillo Saipov, the suspected terrorist attack in New York City that killed eight people -- a rare punishment that has not been given for a federal crime since 1953.
In October, Saipov, 30, is believed to have used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out a terrorist attack on a bicycle road along the western highway, in lower Manhattan, crossing footpaths and bicycles.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov has killed eight victims "inadvertently" and that he has caused serious bodily injuries "inadvertently", according to a letter aimed at seeking the death penalty presented in the southern part of New York.
According to a court document, both of these charges could be punishable with death.
A few weeks after the attack, a major federal jury put Saipov in front of 22 charges, including eight charges of murder in aid of organised crime, charges often used by prosecutors in cases of organised crime, and a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
This attack has come as a result of "a considerable and predictable planning," prosecutors said, describing Saipov's way of executing the crime as "disgusting, cruel and moral."
"Sayfull Habibullaevic Saipov caused injuries, damage and loss to Diego Enrique Angelini's family and friends, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucci," writes the letter of purpose.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been a decade since the last time New York's southern district criminally prosecuted a death penalty case.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to eternal prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was used in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed after being convicted of conspiracy and espionage for the benefit of the Soviet Union, two years before the Cold War.
Both were executed in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to the court documents, Saipov, with a Uzbek nation, did not show a tendency during the days and months following the attack.
He has declared to the investigators that he feels good about what he has done, the police reported.
According to the warrant, Saipov told the authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after seeing no video of ISIS in his cell phone.
Police said he had also asked to place the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
He has declared himself innocent for 22 days.
David Patton, one of the public lawyers representing Saipov, said they are "very disappointed with the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty and not admit guilt associated with eternal prison without appeal will increase the trauma caused by these events among all the people involved," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to ask for a death penalty.
Conservative Party MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be put at the top of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage today promised, during a protest at the Conservative conference, that he would 'mobilise the army of the people'.
The former UKIP leader said politicians should 'taste' Eurosceptic pressure - since one of Theresa May's MPs suggested that he should be at the forefront of negotiations with the EU.
In March, Conservative Deputy Peter Bone told Birmingham that the MB would 'be out' if Brexit's secretary would be Mr. Farage.
But the challenge faced by Mrs. May to join her group has been noted by the conservatives for the EU's position, who joined you another protest in the city against Brexit.
The prime minister is facing difficulties in implementing the compromise plan reached in Chequers, among the attacks coming from those who want to stay or leave the European Union, as well as from the EU itself.
The Allies insist that it will try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite severe reactions - and will force the Eurosceptics and Labourists to choose between its package and chaos.'
During the march, Largim means Largim, Mr. Bone said he wants to abandon the Chequers agreement.
He suggested that Mr. Farage should take the lead and give him responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
'If he'd be in the head, now we'd be out,' he said.
Wellingborough MP added: 'I will support Brexit, but we must leave the Chequers deal.'
Expressing his stance against the EU, he said: 'We did not fight in world wars to be submissive.
We want to draw up our laws in our own country.'
Mr. Bone rejected the suggestions that the public opinion has changed since the 2016 vote: 'The idea that British people have changed their minds and want to stay in the EU is completely false.'
Conservative Andrea, who supports Brexit, was also in March and said to reporters: 'I just want to say, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
'The Chequers agreement is not supported by the general public, the opposition will not vote, neither is it supported within our party and by activists who fill the streets and vote for us.
Please leave the Chequers and start listening.'
In a message addressed to Mrs. May, she added: 'The prime ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises.'
Mr. Farage said during the march that politicians should "feel pressure" if they are thinking of abandoning the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
'Now, this is a matter of faith between us -- people -- and our political class,' he said.
'They're trying to betray Brex and we're here today to tell them we won't let you do anything like that.'
During a message addressed to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: 'I want you to force our political class, which is near Brexit's abandonment, to feel pressure.
'We are mobilizing the army of the people of this country who gave us the victory in Brexit and will not stop until the United Kingdom is independent, proud and self-government.'
In the meantime, these pro residences marched to Birmingham before holding a two - hour meeting in the city center.
A small group of activists held banners written by the Conservatives against Brexit, after this group was shown in the weekend.
Labourers' supporter Lord Adonis ironed with the conservatives about the security problems they had with a "social application" during the conference's launch.
'These are the people who tell us that they can prepare the TI systems and the technology needed for Canada plus, for open borders, for free trade without borders with Ireland,' he added.
'It's totally a farce.
There's no such thing as good Brexit,' he said.
Warren plans to "consider carefully" the possibility of candidacy for the president
US Senator Elizabeth Warren has stated that he will "carefully examine the possibility of candidacy for president" after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Democratic Senator of Massachusetts spoke about her future during a meeting in the town, held Saturday in Western Massachusetts.
Warren, a continued critic of President Donald Trump, candidacy for re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was co-director of Trump's campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
It was at the heart of speculation that it could run in front of Trump in 2020.
The meeting organised on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was its 36th meeting with voters in municipal format, from the time Trump came to the top.
One of the participants asked if he had planned to run for the president.
Warren replied that the time has come for "women to go to Washington and regulate the corrupt government, and this includes putting a woman in charge."
Arrests a person for killing the LSU team player, Wade Sims
Police at Baton Rouge, La., reported on Saturday that a suspect has been arrested for the murder of the Wayne Sims basketball player on Friday.
Diteon Simpson, 20 years old, has been arrested about 11 o'clock in the morning, the police department in Baton Rouge, through a media conference, announced.
The police had posted a video of the shootings on Friday, where they were looking for help to identify the person who appeared there.
Sims, 20 years old, was shot with firearms and killed near the campus of the University of South during Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims changed his life as a result of gun wounds caused by fire in his head," police chief Murphy J. Paul said Saturday for 247 sports.
Wade intervened to protect his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being on the scene, carrying weapons, and shooting Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incidents and sent to the police department in the eastern Baton Rouge area.
Sims, 6'6' long, played 32 games, of which 10 were titled last season, with an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 points in the match table.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title after the team's instructions give the victory to Sebastian Vettel
Since the moment Valter Bottas qualified before Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it has become clear that the direction of the Mercedes team" would play a considerable role in this race.
Bottas left the first place and almost "judged" Hamilton after defending his position in the first two cycles and invited Vettel to attack his team's friend.
Vettel was the first to make a stop and left Hamilton to race in "traffic" at the end of the car pool, something that should have been decisive.
Mercedes stopped a round later and was positioned after Vettel, but Hamilton came out at the head after some maneuvers that forced Ferrari pilot to leave space behind after a double move to protect himself in the third turn.
Max Vertappen started the race from the last row and at the end of the first round was the seventh, on the day of his 21st birthday.
Then he was at the top of a large part of the race after not changing his tires to reach a quick finish and passed Kimi Raikkonen by ranking the fourth.
Eventually, he stopped in the 44th cycle but failed to improve the pace in the eight remaining cycles by releasing the fourth place to Raikconen.
It's a hard day because Valter did a great job all weekend and showed up a real gentleman who let me through.
The team has done an extraordinary job with these positions," Hamilton said.
Very Low Use of Body Language
President Donald Trump ironed Senator Diane Feinstein during a meeting on Saturday, concerning her insistence, that it was not the person who "pulled out" Christine Blasey Ford's letter accusing the candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, of sexual assault.
During a speech at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not refer directly to the testimony given by Ford before the Senate's Judicial Committee, but said what was happening in the Senate shows that people are "legal, bad and unfair."
"The only thing that can happen and the beautiful thing that is happening in the Senate over the last few days is when you look at anger, when you see people who are angry, wicked, bad and unfair," he said.
"When you look at the publications that came out secretly and then people say, "Oh, I didn't.
I didn't do it."
Do You Remember?
Diane Feinstein, were you the ones who pulled the letter out?
Remember her answer... did you extract the document-- "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't pull it out."
Wait a minute.
We didn't...No, we didn't," he said, imitating the senator.
In July, Feinstein was sent a letter containing details of charges against Kavanaugh from Ford, and the document came out early in September -- but Feinstein denied that the information had come out of her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't get her story out," Feinstein told the commission, reported The Hill.
"She asked me to keep it secret and I kept it as she asked."
While her denial seemed unacceptable to the president, who commented during Saturday night's debate: "In my opinion, the gestures really left to wish.
Maybe he didn't, but I've never seen the weakest findings before."
Defending the candidate for the High Court, who has been charged with three women for innocent sexual behavior, the president said the democrats are using alleged charges to achieve their aims.
"They are determined to regain power at any time.
Look at wickedness and corruption, they don't care who they hurt, who they should break to gain power and control," Mediate reported as words spoken by the president.

The Giants quickly passed the double advantage due to the beatings of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvilier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie compared the results for the local team before Dwyer returned the Giants in favor.

Air traffic controller lost his life by making sure hundreds of people on an airplane survive the earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is honored as a hero after losing his life by ensuring that a plane carrying hundreds of people is safely seated.
Over 800 people lost their lives, and many others have been declared lost after a major earthquake hit the island of Sulawes on Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong waves continue to disturb the area, and many people have been buried in graves in the city of Palu.
However, despite his colleagues running away to escape, 21-year-old Antonio Gunavan Agung refused to leave his post at the check-in tower that ran wild at the Palus airport "Mutira Sis Al Jufri Airport".
He stood to ensure that the Flight 6321 of Batik Air, which was on the runway at that time, could be safely launched.
Then he was thrown out of the traffic control tower when he thought it was crashing.
He lost his life in the hospital later.
Speaker of "Air Navigation Indonesia", Johannes Sireit, said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australia's "ABC News" reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to take it to a larger hospital in another city.
Sadly, he lost his life this morning before the helicopter arrived at Paul.
"This news breaks our soul," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the number of deaths may reach thousands of people, while the local agency for mitigation of the consequences of disasters says entry into the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"It is believed that this number will continue to grow, as there are still many bodies under the graves, while others have not been found," agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said.
The dams that reached up to six meters have destroyed Paluna, where a mass death ceremony will be held on Friday.
Military and commercial aircraft are providing supplies and assistance.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, said about "Sky News": "Every minute the ambulance brings troops.
There's no clean water.
Mini-markets have been stolen everywhere."
Jan Gelfand, the leader of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said to CNN: "The Red Cross is rushing to help the survivors, but we do not know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get worse."
Indonesia's president, Yoko Widodo, arrived on Sunday in Palu and addressed the country's army: "I am asking you to work day and night to carry out any duties related to evacuation.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Indonesia was hit by earthquakes earlier in Lombok, where more than 550 people lost their lives.
Micronesian plane crash: "Air Niugini" now says a person has lost after a plane crashed into the lagoon
The airline that operated an aircraft that crashed into the Pacific Bay in Micronesia now declared a missing person, since it had previously declared that all 47 passengers and crew had safely evacuated from the plane that was sinking into the water.
In a press statement, "Air Niugini" said Saturday afternoon they were not finding a passenger.
The airline was said to be collaborating with local authorities, hospitals, and investigators in an effort to find the person.
The airline did not respond immediately to requests for further information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local ships helped save passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water trying to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
On Friday, officials said that seven people had been escorted to the hospital.
The airline said that six passengers stayed in the hospital on Saturday and that they were all able to stay.
The cause of the crash and the very consequences of the events remain unclear.
Airline and U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon after it failed to reach the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane crossed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane landed very low.
"This is an extremely good thing," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said that through the water that had reached the level of the bell, he and others managed to reach the emergency exits of the plane.
He said that the guards were panicking and shouting, while he suffered a slight headache.
The U.S. Navy said that the sailors working on a scale nearby helped to save them, using an airship to transport people to the shore before the plane sinks about 30 meters (100 feet) below the water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network show that 111 people have lost their lives in collisions of PNG-registered airlines in the last two decades, but "Air Niugini" was not involved in any of them.
Analyst builds night chronology when a woman is burned alive
On Saturday, the prosecutor presented her arguments in the retrial of a person who is accused of having burned a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
American Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as an expert in the field of data analysis.
He explained to the jury how he had used phone data to rebuild the defendant's movements, 29-year-old Quinton Tellis, and the victim, 19-year-old Jessica Chambers, the night that this last changed his life.
According to reports by The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett stated that he had received location data from some cell phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers on the afternoon of her death, the fact that he rejected his previous claims.
When the data revealed that his cell phone was in the same place as that of Chambers during the time he said it was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to him last.
Sanford was brought before the court on Saturday and testified that he was not in town that day.
When asked by the prosecutors if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was on Sanford's truck that night, the last one said he was "lie because my truck was in Nashville."
Another disagreement is Tellis's statement, which said she knew Chambers about two weeks before she died.
Telephone tables showed that they had only one week they knew each other.
Rowlett said shortly after Chambers died, Tellis had deleted messages, calls and contact data from his phone.
"He hid it from his life," said Hale.
And it is expected that He will make clear to you on the day of resurrection the Qur'an.
The judge declared that the jury would take the decision that day.
The High Breed: What's a very conscious hip?
A group of many with three members seeks to challenge the negative views of this band by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims that hip bouch has been removed from its origin of political messages and messages dealing with social issues.
They want to return to their originality and make it known again to the conscience.
In the MB, a review of artists such as The Fugues and Common has been observed other than artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another man with a color?
My grandfather from New York indicted the couple to leave the job after receiving a "racist" message.
A New Yorker grandfather has indicted a couple for discrimination in separation from work, after having received a message sent incorrectly by a mother, who complains that she was "another man of color."
The couple have denied that they are racist, considering the indictment as "depression."
Lynsey Plasco-Faxman, the mother of two children, expressed her concern when she discovered that the new grandfather Giselle Maurice was a colourful woman, at the time she presented her first day of work, in 2016.
"Jooooooooooooo, another man in colour," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Faxman to her husband in the message.
However, instead of sending her husband, she sent her to Mrs. Maurice, twice.
According to the New York Post, after understanding her glove, Plasco-Faxman, "suffered in horror", she paused Mrs. Maurice, reasoning that their current grandfather, who was African-American, had done a weak job and that instead of her, she wanted a Filipino.
Mrs. Maurice was paid for her only day of work and was then sent home with a "jacket in her pocket".
Now, Maurice is indicting the couple for dismissal compensation, and is asking for compensation at $350 a day for a six-month period for which she was employed, even without contracts.
"I want to tell them that they shouldn't do such things," she said to The Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination."
The couple have denied claims that they are racist, saying that the removal of Maurice was the right action, because they were afraid that they could not believe them after they had offended him.
"My wife sent her something she didn't want to say.
She's not racist.
We're not racist," said spouse Joel Plasco for The Post.
"But would you leave the children in the hands of a person to whom you have been rude, even though wrong?
Your newborn child?
Tell me."
Considering the indictment as "defence," Plasco said that he and his wife had brought a child to life two months ago and were in a very difficult situation.
"Can you avenge anyone in this situation?
It is not a positive thing to do," Plasco, investment banker, added.
While the case has been brought before the court, the public opinion has quickly denounced the couple in the social media, criticizing them for their behavior and logic.
A new letter shows that Paddington’s publishers were afraid that readers would not connect to a speaking gold
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was admitted, said about this letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the place of a person who reads it for the first time before it was published.
We feel great pleasure now that we have seen the extraordinary success of Paddington."
She said her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC, before he was inspired by a little toy bear to write the book for children, would have been upset if his work would be refused, adding that last year's 60th year of publication of the book, after his death, contained "tribulation and happiness".
As far as Paddington is concerned, which she rated as a "very important member of our family," she added that her father was very proud of success.
"He was a quiet person and didn't boast," she said.
"Paddington was so true that it was the same as having a successful child: you feel proud of him even though it is not exactly your success.
I think that's how he saw Paddyton's success.
Although it was his creation and imagination, he always gave the credit to Paddington's own character."
My daughter was changing her life, and I was forced to call her by phone.
Upon arrival, her daughter was taken urgently to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nyi, where doctors had tried to save her life but had no results.
"He called me regularly to tell me it was very heavy, that he didn't think he would get out," Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse said.
"Then I received a call from Nad who told me that she would die within two minutes and that I should say goodbye.
And that's what I did.
I said, "Now, I love you very much.
We'll be together soon.
We'll be together.
The medications that doctors had given her to keep her heart at work were losing her effect and slowly leaving her system.
She had died a few years ago and now everything was "lost".
I was forced to sit down and wait, knowing that this was happening.
I couldn't cry or yell because I was surrounded by family and people.
I had to be strong."
In time, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, weeping for the loss of her daughter, jumped on a plane by the side of other passengers -- who were not aware of what she was experiencing.
"No one knew," she said.
"I held my head down and all the time I was crying.
It's hard to explain, but during that flight, I felt a great pity for Nad.
I felt he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Women holding black post letters to prevent suicides in the bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones as a result of suicide are working to prevent others from killing themselves.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted letters of inspiration on a well in Wells as well as phone numbers of people who can call for support.
Miss Davis' son was 13 when he began suffering from depression and killed himself at the age of 18.
"I don't want no parent to feel as I feel every day," she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45 years old, living in Lydney, said her son was a promising cook with a "sticky" smile.
"Everyone knew about his smile.
People always say his smile lights up every room."
However, he gave up his job before changing his life, since it was "at a truly dark moment."
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, then 11 years old, was the person who found his brother after he committed suicide.
Mrs. Davis said, "I keep worrying that there will be a domino effect."
Mrs. Davis created the letters, "so people know that there are people who can help them and who they can talk to, even with a friend.
Don't sit alone - you have to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been Mrs. Davies' friend for many years, lost Mark, her 15-year-old partner, not long after his mother died.
"He didn't say he was feeling upset, depressed or anything else," she said.
"Several days before Christmas, I noticed a change in behavior.
He was extremely upset on Christmas Day -- when the children opened their presents, he did not see them and did not take any action."
She said his death was a great trauma to them, but that they should go beyond that: "It's something that destroys the whole family.
We've been destroyed.
But we all have to go ahead and fight."

Brett Kavanaugh's future depends on the spring line after the FBI's investigation
"I thought if we could give something similar to what he was looking for -- a limited investigation in time and object -- maybe we could bring some harmony," Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he was afraid that the committee was "dispersing" among the many obstacles of the opponents.
Why didn't you want Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters to investigate the FBI?
Their hesitation comes all as a result of time.
The election for Congress is only 5 weeks away, on November 6th -- if Republicans get out badly, as expected, they will be greatly weakened in their efforts to select the person they want in the country's highest court.
George W. Bush has called the senators, praising them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and through him I met his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI pulls out her report?
It will be voted in the sittings, where there are currently 51 republics and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh could gather at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice-President Mike Pence to put an end to this situation and confirm it in the High Court.
Number of deserters in North Korea under Kim's leadership
The number of deserters in North Korea has fallen since Kim Jong came into power seven years ago, a South Korean legislator has declared.
Park Byeong-seug, quoting data from the Union Ministry in South Korea, has stated that there were about 1127 deserts last year -- compared with 2706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said the main factors were the strictest controls on the borders between North Korea and China and the highest rates requested by human beings traffickers.
Peniani didn't make public comments.
Most deserters from North Korea receive subjugation from South Korea.
Seoul has stated that more than 30,000 people from North Korea have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean war in 1953.
Most of them go to China, which has the largest border length with North Korea, and there can be passed more simply than the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas, which is protected from multiple forces.
China considers foreign immigrants to be illegal deserters, not refugees, and often repatriates them with strength.
Relations between North and South Korea - which are technically still at war - have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Penian and their talks focused on late negotiations on denuclearisation.
This meeting came after the historic meeting of June, between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong, in Singapore, where they agreed, in general terms, to work for a Korean nuclear-weapon-free warhead.
But on Saturday, North Korea's Foreign Minister New Yong-ho blamed US sanctions for the lack of progress so far.
"Without faith in the US, there will be no faith in our national security and in these circumstances, there is no chance that we unilaterally disarm the first," Mr. New said during a speech at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh " hysterical," and says he is not worthy to serve in the High Court
The leader of the minority in the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelos, called the appointment of the High Court Brett Kavanaugh "historic" and said that because of his temper, he was unable to serve in the High Court.
Pelos made these comments Saturday during an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't think that if a woman had ever done so, people would say ' hysterical'," Pelos said about her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judicial Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh categorically denied the charges that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his presentation, Kavanaugh was very concerned and at some point almost screamed or "taken his mouth" when he spoke about his family and the years of high school.
He accused the democrats explicitly in front of the committee, calling charges against him "a grotesque attack and coordinated against his figure", organised by liberals angry with Hillary Clinton's loss in the 2016 presidential elections.
Pelos expressed her view that Kavanaugh’s testimony proved that he could not serve in the Supreme Court, since she showed his prejudice against the Democrats.
"I think he punished himself with those statements and the way he attacked Clinton and Democrats," she said.
Pelos refused to answer the question whether he would try to give Kavanaugh a motion of disbelief in the event of his appointment, and if the Democrats win most of the countries in the House of Representatives.
"Let me tell you -- if he is not telling the truth before Congress or the FBI, then he is ineligible not only for the Supreme Court, but also for the court where he is now," Pelos said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Court of Appeal in Washington.
Pelos added that, as a democrat, he was concerned about Kavanaugh's rulings against the Law on Facable Care or on the Roe's case against Wade, since he is considered a conservative judge.
At the sessions for his appointment, Kavanaugh avoided questions as to whether he would exonerate certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"It is not the time for a hysterical and unilateral person to become a member of the court and wait for us to say "how well!" said Pelos.
And women should use it.
This is a direct verbal attack, months and years of rage that explodes, and it can't lead to the end of it without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," Mrs. Steine told me 45 years later.
"I don't think this is unusual.
She continued, "A woman who worked in a leading position helped me a lot, who said she was crying when she was angry, but she had broken a style that whenever she was angry and started to cry, she said to the co-depute, "You can think I'm upset and so I'm crying.
But I'm actually angry."
And then she kept talking.
And I thought that was a brilliant idea."
Lots are a way to express anger, partly because they are completely misunderstood.
One of my most vivid memories of an old job, in an office where men prevailed and at one point I found myself crying out of incessant anger, was the moment when a larger woman grabbed me by the neck--a cold manager I had always been afraid of-- pushed me to the stairs.
"Don't ever let others see you crying," she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're upset, and they'll be happy to get bored."
Patricia Schroeder, a Democratic Congressman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidacy.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was found in the middle of an extramarriage relationship on the board of a boat called "Monkey Business" and was taken out of the race, Mrs. Schroeder, very angry, realized that there was no reason why he should not even think of running for president.
"This wasn't a well-balanced decision," she said laughing, 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was one more candidate.
Someone called it "Borbardha and Seven Jewels."
Since the campaign was in its final stages, it had remained behind with the fundraiser, so she promised not to race unless she could raise $2 million.
But it was a vain war.
She found that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men gave her only $250.
"Don't they think I'm getting any discounts?" she asked herself.
During his talk that he was not going to carry out an official campaign, she was so excited — gratitude for the people who supported her, anger with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and anoint voters instead of delegates, and anger with sexism — that she was killed.
"It seemed as if I had suffered a nervous crisis," recalled Mrs. Schroeder about how the press reacted to it.
"It looked like Kleinex was my sponsorship corporation.
I remember thinking what people would write on the stone of my grave?
"She's crying"?
Advantages of US-China Trade War for Beijing
The first outbreaks of trade war between the US and China were deafening, and while the war is far from over, a split between the two countries can benefit Beijing in the long term, experts say.
US President Donald Trump issued the first warning early this year, imposing taxes on the main Chinese export goods, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most sensitive scale was the one that happened this week, when new tariffs touched goods worth $200 billion (150 billion pounds), effectively taxing half of the goods entering the US from China.
Beijing is avenged every time "in nature", finally setting rates from five to ten per cent over US$60 billion.
China has pledged to return the US with the same currency, and the second largest economic power in the world is unlikely to surrender soon.
Removing measures from Washington means surrendering to their demands, but for Chinese President Xi Jinping, it would be very embarrassing to bow publicly to the US.
However, experts said that if China plays its cards correctly, the pressures arising from the US trade war could positively support China in the long term, to reduce the interdependence of these two economies.
"The fact that political decisions, made quickly in both Washington and Beijing, can cause economic downturn in each of these countries, is much more dangerous than what has been seen from the outside," said Abigail Grace, an associate researcher at the research centre for new American security, which focuses on the Asian continent.
Syria is 'ready' to return refugees, Foreign Minister says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is appealing for help to rebuild the land destroyed by a war that has lasted for more than seven years.
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said conditions in the country are improving.
"Today, the situation in the country is much more stable and secure due to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normality.
Already, there are all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to their country, from which you had to flee because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that hit their daily lives and well-being.
The UN estimates that about 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the war began in 2011.
About six million others who still live in the country need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome help to rebuild the destroyed state.
However, he stressed that the country would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from the countries sponsoring the uprising.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup trophy in Paris
Europe's team has won the Ryder Cup 2018 trophy after defeating the US team with a final result of 16.5 to 10.5, in Le Golf National, outside Paris, France.
The US has already lost 6 matches in the European territory and has been winning this trophy in Europe since 1993.
Europe reclaimed the crown after the Danish captain’s team, Thomas Bjorn, got 14.5 points needed to defeat the United States.
The American star, Phil Mickelson, who was the most difficult player during the tournament, led the first hit into the water and closed the 16th hole with 3 more shots than the assigned level, losing the match in front of Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer, Molinari, shined in all his rounds, becoming 1 of the 4 players who achieved the result 5-0-0, since the current format began to apply in 1979.
American Jordan Spyeth was defeated by a 5&4 player with the lowest ranking on the European team, Danish Thorbjorn Olesen.
The number one player in the world ranking, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 and 1 to Englishman Ian Poulter, who could have played at his final Ryder Cup.
Spanish veteran Sergio Garcia, who has played at eight Ryder Cup, became the most successful European player of all time in this tournament, with 25.5 points in career.
"Normally, I don't cry but today I can't hold myself.
It's been a tough year.
I'm very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and trusting me.
I'm very, very happy we took the cup.
Success is on the team, and I am happy that I had the opportunity to help," Garcia said excitedly after the European team's victory.
He passed the word to his fellow countryman, John Ram, who defeated the 2-1 American golf legend, Tiger Woods, in direct challenges on Sunday.
"I feel an extraordinary pride that I beat Tiger Woods. I grew up seeing that player," 23-year-old Rahm said.
Woods lost all his matches in France and now he has statistics 13-21-3, during his career in Ryder Cup.
A strange statistics from one of the largest players of all time, who has won 14 important titles, ranked second after Jack Nicklus.
The US team faced difficulties throughout the weekend to take the ball to the right place, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-caliber golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk spoke after the disappointing appearance of his team, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought hard.
There were moments during this paradise when we put pressure on the European team.
We fought fast.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
His 12 players played pretty well.
We'll regroup, work with PGA in America and with our Ryder Cup committee, and we'll move forward.
I love these 12 boys and I'm proud to be the captain.
We need to take off the hat.
They played better than us."
Red Tide: Focus on Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
Recent reports from the Commission on Fish and the Living World (FWC) in Florida show a general drop in red baticella concentrations in some areas of Tampa Bay.
According to FWC, improved levels of pollution have been reported in the county of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte, and Collier - a fact that suggests a fall in concentration.
The Red Batica has extended pollution to a length of 130 billion coastal lines from the north of Pinellas to the south of Lee Contest.
The contaminated areas can be found about 10 miles from the Hillborough County Coast, but in less than last week's area.
The Red Batica has also been noted in the Pasco Continent.
Over the past week, average concentrations near or off the coast in Contena, low and high concentrations in Contena Hillsborough, data on high concentrations in Contena Manatee, data on high concentrations, near or off the coast, in Contena Sarasota, data on average concentrations in Contena Charlotte, data on high concentrations, near or off the coast, in Contena Lee, and low concentrations in Contena Collier have been reported.
In the counties of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee, and Collier continue the reports of difficulty in breathing.
Last week, no difficulty in breathing in northwestern Florida has been reported.
