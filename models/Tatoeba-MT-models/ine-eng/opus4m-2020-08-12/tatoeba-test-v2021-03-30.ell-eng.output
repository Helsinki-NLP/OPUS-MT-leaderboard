I don't think I'm ready for the exam.
Mary answers the teacher's question.
They'll fix him.
We don't have school tomorrow.
Rome wasn't built in one day.
I like to dance.
Everything's gonna be okay.
Why didn't you come?
Tell them we're here.
We need you.
We didn't have secrets.
Why do you learn French?
I got a green shirt.
You're much faster than me.
Tom lives in Australia now.
Look at me and listen to me.
You want me to tell him?
Give it to Tom.
Peter loves Jane.
Keep smiling.
I refuse to allow this.
Good morning.
Do you like the juice?
You seem disappointed.
Tom knows all about them.
Did you sleep at all?
Tom's a crazy kid.
That's right.
We're laughing a lot.
Tell me what you'll get in the exam.
I don't think two languages are enough.
Can you lend me your car tonight?
Where exactly did you put him?
Her daughter is a nurse.
I think we should talk to them.
You should be grateful.
Tell him to come see me.
Tell him not to come.
I'm going to the church with the car.
You're a lot smarter than me.
Who's left?
Where exactly did you put it?
Write everything.
Germany is in Central Europe.
I'm proud.
Tom's not laughing.
Amy's gonna be home by 3:00.
I showed him my room.
The man wants to know the truth.
She went home.
Tom doesn't want to learn French.
I'm not ready yet.
Tom noticed that Mary was wearing a new dress.
I'm unemployed.
I'm not gonna lose her.
I'm trying to be happy.
Tom teaches me French.
Are you asking me to stay?
Find Tom.
Are you sure you want to go with Tom?
Tom couldn't understand Mary's joke.
Tell them I'm innocent.
The fish's not my taste.
Sit down.
Do you have anyone?
He's a high school student.
You'll see.
I'm not satisfied with that.
They're lost again.
Tom would've done everything for you.
It's okay?
What's the title of your new book?
Are you kidding me?
Could I find out where you're working?
Can anyone explain it to me?
Who is she?
We have to tell him.
His jokes really kill me.
You've paid too much.
Are we sure we want to hire Tom?
We want to do it right.
I ate the meat.
Flowers and trees need clean air and water.
They have wine.
How can we find Tom?
He says he still loves me, but I don't believe him at all.
We had a green house.
Time and place of the meeting have closed.
Tom's here.
How are things in Boston?
I've been promoted recently.
Millie doesn't drink water.
There are exceptions.
I love flowers.
They won't talk.
Tell him I'm here.
Don't play here.
Please, close the door.
Squirrel's doing good in health.
I wonder if Tom forgot to tell Mary he had to.
What would you have her do?
He's kissing him.
Tom said he didn't want to eat anything.
I'll stop.
Tom worked in Australia.
You're competitive.
I've lost my appetite.
I wish I wasn't Canadian.
What's light isn't gold.
I asked Tom to play guitar.
It's on my cell phone.
Throw his dirty clothes on the floor.
Are you a journalist?
Tom is a head taller than me.
Where can we buy it?
Now it's 2:30.
Everyone knew you.
This book is yours.
Tom knew who was in his house.
Where's the oven?
You betrayed me.
We loved them.
You're not my father.
You're not Canadian.
Who's that?
Tom forgot his bag on the train.
They killed our boobs.
My name isn't Kuzey.
I saw the girl.
We're still in Boston.
Try it.
The phone's ringing.
Tom lives in Boston.
Thomas lives in a hippie community.
The water is hot.
You have to hide.
I'm already working.
She likes to run.
Tom didn't want to touch it.
It was urgent.
You're wearing exact scissors.
Is anyone here?
Tom is the only Canadian here.
Tom's gonna live.
It was too late.
These aren't fish.
That's a phrase.
We need more volunteers.
Are you really Canadian?
People today attach more importance to people's culture than to the past.
Tom's not my friend anymore.
It's very clean.
Do you know when they'll be back?
It's easy for Tom.
Can you help us translate this text?
Did you drink your hair?
Did Tom see you?
We love each other.
I walk every day.
Tom didn't want to play poker.
I have to go to school.
You shot him?
We may need some.
This is a proposal.
How did you get through the holidays?
Tom didn't tell me his secret.
We invited them to dinner.
Have we been invited?
I'll warn you.
I'll try to find you.
Do they call you?
I'm unemployed, too.
Tom's house has been completely destroyed.
Tom caught Mary.
It's from France.
Why are you angry?
Tom was born in Boston.
You want to buy a house in Germany?
They're not happy.
Do you know who he is?
Did you see the baseball on TV last night?
Mary photographed her mother with her cell phone.
I wanted to die.
It does the same for me whether it comes or not.
I don't understand English.
It's not about money.
Would you like to see them?
You ruined him.
We learned to fly like birds and swim like fish, but we forgot how to live like humans.
I've learned a lot.
We don't trust strangers.
Tell her I'm busy.
I'm not gonna be late.
We need to know what happened.
Try not to think about it.
I love you, Tom.
Let me clarify my position.
I never stopped loving Mary.
You're not welcome here.
He's not there.
Are you 18?
I want to do sports.
Tom was alive.
Thomas' phone hit, but he ignored it.
Can you teach me French?
The price was extrabreeding.
About.
Where's your friend?
Do you know any Greek myth?
It's closed at 40.
What time are you leaving?
Tom gave Mary a French dictionary.
The captain gave us a good definition.
He went with him.
Why aren't you here today?
He tried to throw it with love plays.
I'm married.
Tell them to help me.
The text is not read.
Tom hugged Mary.
Wouldn't you go to Australia to build a store?
What do you call that?
Larry's still at school.
My office is in the center of town.
He's got two sisters.
You're not Canadian.
I visited Boston years ago.
Tom rejected Mary.
Tom has a twin brother.
I'll translate.
We stayed in Boston for three nights.
I'm starting to find you tired.
I don't want to wait that long.
Tom's wearing gloves.
The letters are written by the girl.
Someone screamed.
He didn't go to the lake.
He's speaking French now.
I'm taller than you.
Have you lost the evidence?
Are you afraid you'll lose your money?
Tell them to do the same.
Do you know when Tom will be back?
Tom has no red hair.
Can I borrow your headphones?
Why are you so happy today?
I'm an aberrant.
I think Tom's drunk.
Tom is your teacher.
The news made him happy.
We were enemies.
Who's got it?
We have nowhere to go.
How many squares can you see?
This bus goes to the art museum.
We're in Boston.
He lives in Dubai.
I don't know what you're looking for.
Are they big?
Tom's from Boston.
Every day Tom drinks.
The cat is under the table.
We can't tell you.
He doesn't see any television.
I'm the coach.
Tom's gonna be working this afternoon.
Who is she?
Dinner.
He chased the teacher.
I thought Tom liked the griffins.
I don't have any money with me.
He'll be watching you.
Tom and Frank are good friends.
How was Boston?
Tom claims he can speak French.
Tom put pink on the wall.
We're too busy.
Harder, please.
You're mine.
Please breathe from your nose.
The company canceled the plan.
"Fire!" yelled.
Work hard.
I don't come here very often.
I'm gay.
You're an easy-to-do.
Tom's not a hero.
I'm happy to be able to help.
Tom wasn't the one who killed Mary.
These keys aren't mine.
She was the last customer.
Do you like white wine?
They made a mistake.
I say it and I repeat it.
Open the radio.
Tell them to come home.
I don't like spiders.
I couldn't sleep.
Are you learning Chinese?
There's a lot of money.
That won't happen again.
Russia is big.
The teacher is friendly.
You destroyed her.
I'm sorry, I can't sit here for a long time.
I'm Harvard's graduate.
Tom died before his son was born.
Look what I can do.
You can't do anything.
I don't want you to tell her.
Tom has a friend who lives in Boston.
What brings you here?
I made me sleepy.
I won't lose!
It's a good investment.
The snow was clouding the visibility.
Don't apologize.
Thomas bought something.
He's got a house.
The girl has a white horse.
Tom's a little jealous.
I still want to marry you.
Now's your chance.
You can choose any book you want.
Where are your suits?
Tom's not a Canadian.
I'm talking.
The best way to learn English is to go to America.
You thought I was Canadian?
I'll be with you.
I haven't received an answer to my letter.
Can I borrow your gun?
Is everyone ready for the trip?
The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams.
I'm reading it.
I want to talk to Tom.
You shot him.
Tom is Turkish.
Can you take it out of the 10th?
Don't stop!
I'm the only one who didn't need to do it.
Tell her you'd like to leave.
He's smart.
When are you leaving for vacation?
It's Anitas' house.
Tell her it's urgent.
He likes to play soccer.
How old were you when you left Australia?
There was no salt left.
Tom gave us some apples.
Let's be honest.
I'm going to Athens.
I know.
I broke your fingers.
He's talking like a trucker.
When do you read?
He hasn't answered yet.
Where's the money?
I bet he doesn't tell the truth.
I don't agree with you.
No one could have imagined it.
It'll be hard.
I want to be an actor.
When I was sick, Tom came and prepared dinner for me.
I would like to speak all the European languages.
The seventh is considered a lucky number.
Where are your suits?
I can't say for sure what's going to happen.
Tom paid.
I'm not tired at all.
They're red.
He said something.
Ever since I got married, I've been out of work.
Why do you hate Canadians so much?
I can't lie to him.
I'm from Norway.
Is that a horse or a carriage?
I'm grateful he's done it.
And I'm kind of tired.
Are you sure you don't see things?
Don't apologize.
He's walking late.
Come with us.
Nobody wants to take responsibility.
Is his father Japanese?
Attention, please!
Are you sure you hit the last button?
Tom was dangerous.
What time do they start?
I'm a cop now.
I'd think about it.
Tom's from Australia.
Where do you want to eat?
That would never happen in Boston.
I like to play piano.
They didn't know me.
I'll fight.
We all know what Tom did.
Tell them you're not ready.
I have to read.
I want you to stay.
What are you reading?
We're not happy.
She's as smart as he is.
Where are you feeding them?
Tell her to leave.
There are only three of these.

Open your eyes.
We'll see.
Tom has to stay.
I need to learn a lot of foreign languages.
What would you say about a drink?
And the Greeks sucked fish.
He was cooperative.
No one encouraged him.
He dreamed he was kissing him.
Who's the title of your new book?
We've got each other.
He made the same mistake twice.

I saw him come out.
Tom will never let this happen.
You see me?
Tom bought a dog.
I like eating pineapple.
He wants to go to America.
Tom has two brothers, one lives in Boston and the other lives in Chicago.
I really love you.
How about a drink?

Welcome to the team.
Please repeat what I'm saying.
The library's on the left.
Are you awake?
Where do you speak French?
You know you're getting older when you have to explain to a Greek woman who was Melina Mercuri.
Who cares?
Tell me what you want.
First God
I know your older brother quite well.
He'll be back in a few days.
I lied to you.
Who's missing?
Is he Japanese?
Tell Tom I went fishing.
All right, try again.
Tom and Mary need help.
The kids look scared.
Tom took off his hat.
I want to see the streets.
Which one is mine?
Algeria is relatively safe now.
Tom will help me.
You're very rich.
There's no tea left.
All visitors have left.
Who killed Tom?
I'm proud of my brother.
Take them with you.
Come out.
I wish I had been born in Canada.
You're impatient.
You're impatient.
What did you promise to do?
I did not participate in the debate.
Note: In English we celebrate nationalities, days of the week, and languages.
Tom loved me.
You were guilty.
I trust you.
Wouldn't you go to Australia to build shops?
How many times have you kissed Tom?
My name is Kirillos. I'm happy to meet you.
He's got nice legs.
His current behavior confirms what we've assumed.
You'll eat.
The problem is you're not Canadian.
We're not happy.
Tom's asleep.
Is he coming?
Tell us where to go.
Sami got drunk and went to the Lila's bathroom.
When I grow up, I'll be a pilot.
Do you have any sugar?
I went home.
Language is a living organism.
Can you help Tom?
I need to see you.
Tom was driving his girlfriend's car.
We were laughing.
Take me with you.
I have to go to bed.
They're alive.
They'll fix it.
Tom flew from Boston to Chicago.
Help me get her up.
This country is very poor.
Would you mind if we spoke in particular?
Is your car black?
Tom's gonna be there to see you.
You made the same mistake again.
Kate doesn't celebrate her birthday almost ever.
How much do you want to pay?
Aren't you happy?
I'm sorry, Tom.
Tom's a little smaller than your daughter.
That's exactly what you need right now.
I did some research.
Do you feel tired?
"It's still raining, eh?
I left for London.
I love dogs.
Are you afraid you won't lose your money?
He's cold. Why don't you wear a sweater?
You ruined me.
Would you like to see them?
The birds are red.
Find me a glass.
I need more money.
They all speak French.
Every time I hear this song, Tom comes to mind.
We circled for an hour trying to find the hotel.
I'm not a farmer.
I'm eating.
Your friend's here.
I'm over thirty.
Don't put sugar in the coffee.
I'd like you to stay with me.
If you're wrong, give it up, if you're right, don't talk.
It's lucky.
It makes me laugh.
Tom trusts you.
Where were you yesterday?
Tom's John's brother.
Are you sure Tom can do this?
He's got a lot of money.
The good that I want you to be honest with me, or I'll tell our mother.
The girls were looking at each other.
Brazil is the largest country in South America.
I like running.
Sammy says that about your own safety.
I never eat meat.
Dispersions do not need to correspond to a natural quantity. Anything that can be a dispersal area is enough to define the addition between dispersals and multiplication with a degree of size.
His money's in the bank.
I'm very proud.
I love my country.
We went into a serious discussion.
They're here.
I think someone likes Tom.
Will you visit me?
"Why don't you go?" "Because I don't want to."
You were guilty.
I'd like to see the party.
As he hit the phone, Tom woke up.
Tom can't help Mary today.
Mary wore her best dress.
Tom's invincible.
Tom can speak French and English.
Tom predicted Mary would do that.
I can't leave.
I'm an acquaintance.
He wants to know how to cook.
I'm gonna start with a tomato soup...
I need you.
Are you all right?
This book belongs to Paolo.
It doesn't look like Tom's Canadian.
I don't understand French at all.
They'll fix it.

Who shot them?
He's writing to me all the time these days.
Take it.
Too bad you couldn't come.
Write something.
It took me three hours to drive from Boston here.
Tom pushed his nose into the window.
You're smaller than me.
She's eating.
I need your car.
Tom thinks Mary killed John.
I'll find them.
I got here at 2:30.
You might be right.
Oxygen is needed for combustion.
Everything all right?
You're unbelievable.
Tell her I'm innocent.
My brother lives in Boston.
What are you reading?
All right, thank you.
Only I can save you.
Where's a notebook?
Tom owed Mary money.
Tom doesn't drive fast.
His current attitude confirms what we assumed.
Tom told me he'd like to repair Boston.
Where's the cook?
The experiment failed.
More powerful.
Don't be so hard on your son.
Her question is very difficult to answer.
Tom saw her.
It wasn't Tom who killed Mary.
You're alive.
You convinced me.
This is my daughter.
I was talking to Tom.
She must be sick.
I'm proud.
We'll make a visit to our friends.
I'm getting used to it.
And talking about genocide, today's Columbus Day.
Sami hired another chamber.
I want some orange juice.
The toilet entrance is very dirty.
Is Tom from Boston?
Do we really have to leave now?
Would you like coffee or tea?
Tom, I'm afraid we'll find our ball.
Where's your house?
Tom wrote a lot of plays.
They voted.
He wrote the book.
I haven't given it to Tom yet.
You're still alive.
I'll never forget tonight.
I don't know if I have time.
I hope to see them.
I'm not gonna reveal her secrets.
Mary answers the teacher's question.
Tom said he thought I was impressed.
I drink at least once a month.
I want some cheese.
He shot her.
I don't know the Arabic alphabet.
Answer the question.
The problem is you're not Canadian.
I'll be in the car.
What's the title of your new book?
He lives in London.
I lost the last two lessons.
I'd like an explanation.
Where did you learn to speak French?
Tom failed.
Open your book on page ten.
This elevator is out of operation.
There were so many people in the room that after violence I could move.
He'll visit his uncle.
What do people eat for breakfast in Australia?
Tom has blue eyes.
How many tickets did you get?
If you're busy, I'll help you.
I've got wine.
We've arrived first.
I'm smarter than him.
I'd like to cancel my ticket.
Who taught you French?
You're very attractive.
Come in, please.
I ate something.
Tom's leaving tomorrow.
Don't do anything you'll regret.
This book is too small.
I was very hungry.
Run!
Everyone started running.
When does Tom read?
We're gonna kill you.
You're old enough to do it yourself.
"What would you like?" "I'd like a dog."
You're working hard.
Tom wants to live in Boston.
It's really a good theory, the only disadvantage I think it's probably common in all the philosophical theories.
Why am I not surprised by that?
I was in Boston in October.
I wasn't at that meeting.
He spends a lot of money on shoes.
Tom has decided to leave Boston.
I'm good at keeping secrets.
I'm very nervous now.
I thought you were Japanese.
There's a lot of trouble here.
Who saw you?
They're bigger than her.
Please repeat what I'm saying.
You don't need a friend.
Europe is a continent.
I wonder why Tom didn't talk to Mary.
Language is the vehicle of thought.
Do you really believe these stories?
Mike's the tallest of three.
Did you ask them to wait?
She's crying.
It'll work.
I assume you're Canadians.
Yeah, I know.
Tom's gonna die?
I'd like to go see a movie.
Many questions remain.
I like Irish music.
Give me a box.
What's your height?
I wanted to be in Paris.
French is a difficult language.
I don't want to talk to Tom right now.
I should have some tea.
Tom puts too much sugar in his tea.
Mary has very far hair.
I'm exhausted.
I know what her name is.
Thank you so much for coming, guys, and I'll see you at the next lesson.
That's Tom's dog.
I know something's hidden.
Tom moved his head.
I happened to meet her at the store.
Tom's trying to learn French.
Tom decided to go to Boston.
Don't you remember them?
I'm out.
Tell them I'll do it.
Do you have the source code?
Tell him your theory.
These apples are big.
I want soup.
Here?
Where did you find the key?
Could this not be right?
Tom can't stand the hot and liquid summers here and that's why he went to the mountains.
Bill, take the phone with you at night.
I'll help in any way I can.
Please tell me your opinion.
Tom's waiting for you.
Isn't it Italian?
She gave it to me.
I'll pay you.
There were many pornographic magazines in his room.
Let's leave her alone.
I just got back from Australia.
Tom was very friendly.
You're drunk!
Thomas is a rich man.
Tell us about Tom.
Thank you.
Are you awake?
Algeria is very different from the United States.
It wasn't a pleasant experience.
He teaches us French.
You're so beautiful you don't need a soft one.
Why do you want to go to Turkey?
He ran as fast as he could get his feet.
I like fishing.
I don't like these sweets.
The back door was broken.
I feel younger again.
Tom ate a orange.
You're the expert.
Tell him I'm ready.
I have an appointment with the doctor.
Yeah.
It's true!
Can I use your phone?
It's from Greece.
Sometimes I get you.
Tom was singing.
I love the taste of mania.
Tom hated Mary.
Where can I buy tickets?
I was hungry.
When's your birthday?
I'm not your enemy.
I asked Tom to sign the papers.
Save them.
Tom didn't want to touch it.
I brought you something.
I made me sleepy.
Our teacher is a real idiot.
Tom wasn't ready to talk about it.
We've suffered.
Tom was impressive.
Mary is in custody with strangers.
We're gonna shoot.
I'm sorry.
Where's the exit?
It was dark when I came home.
Life is hard.
Who's Tom talking about?
Your father won't buy it.
Tom pushed the door.
I live here.
I hope you call again.
Are you sure I'm the only Canadian here?
Talk later.
Put the book on top of the others.
The bird is in the sky.
Tom hired Mary.
Mike, how's it going?
Tom married Canadians.
Tom says he's going to Boston in October.
You want me to tell him?
You saved us.
Who are you sending a message?
Can I borrow a pencil?
We only have three choices.
Selina's behind the clouds.
You need to talk to Tom.
Tom worked in Australia.
I want money.
Tom's rocking.
Don't take out the light.
He was very happy.
The Chamber was obviously disappointed.
Aren't you a teacher?
Tell him we're busy.
Tell her to help us.
Tom's staying.
Thank you. You're fantastic.
Will Israel be attacked in Iran?
I like to laugh.
I washed my shirt.
We'll talk later.
Eating later will help you feel more grassy.
I'm French.
We forgot you didn't like pizza.
I got up early yesterday.
Tom's helping Mary.
He'll protect you.
Tom's driving.
My father's rich.
Are you new?
I remember that word.
I'll decide.
Tell them you're not ready.
I showed her my room.
It's not hard for the French.
Someone's yelling.
We found her.
Where are you swimming?
His hair was brown.
Everything repeats the same mistake.
I don't want to open the window.
Steven's dead.
We can't stop you.
What language do they speak in Switzerland?
Help me get him up.
Is it Japanese?
Why does he hate you so much?
Let Tom swim.
Here and how long have you been a teacher?
Try to stay still.
This is a bed.
I want to get to the hotel before tonight.
Are you drunk?
He tried to write an essay.
What are you gonna tell them?
Where are you going?
I miss my father.
I want to tell you something.
He's using you.
He's never been to Okinawa again.
I thought you were Canadian.
Why did you kiss her?
I hope the bus ride isn't boring.
Who sold Tom's car?
Tom stabbed Mary.
At first, I couldn't understand.
I'm talking to Esperanto.
California's pregnant.
I'm happy!
All of them are Canadians.
You're not welcome.
She's a pretty girl.
He's helping him.
Nothing's missing.
She started singing.
That's a menu.
I wasn't drunk.
She wants you to kiss her.
Tom was here a minute ago.
I had a hard day.
His mother speaks Italian.
I'll leave her a promise.
Where are the girls?
You won't be alone.
Tell her I don't want to go.
I saw her take it.

I know where Tom was born.
Pull straight up until you see the post office and then turn right.

Tom's eating a lot.
There were so many people in the room that I could hardly move.
He'll be walking.
You're ready.
We recognized her.
He's on a diet.
You're sick.
Tom's an obedient man.
I underestimated him.
Are you really Canadian?
All of a sudden, I started taking weight.
How many Canadian friends do you have?
This is Ala's book.
It was my wife's idea.
Tom wanted Mary.

Why did Tom buy a new car?
Tom was wearing a white shirt.
Tom would have defended me.
You were perfect.
How much do you want?

I remember.
You're working Monday?
I don't know how much Tom gets out.
Nobody's sitting here.
Are you talking to me?
A small step for man, a giant leap for humanity.
You must listen to the truth.
Tom knows you.
Give me three minutes.
Tom wants to stay here.
I'd like a orange juice.
I'm ironing my suit.
That's not true.
We need actions, not words.

Are you taller than Tom?
Yesterday I went to the park with Mary.
I'm the only one who didn't have to do it.
He's awake.
I was able to do it this morning.
I thought you were Canadian.
He doesn't even know how to write or read.
Sorry, what time is it?
We have three children.
Tell them to help me.
Tom was dressed like a girl.
How much does the pants make?
I like my coffee to be hot.
Tell them we're busy.
I like the way you think.

He's a mess.
Do you have a tattoo?
That's original.
"Should I help you?" "No, thank you, I'm just kidding."
Mary protected her husband.
You're not Japanese.

Tell me your address.
We got what we deserve.
Let's talk about this.
You don't trust me, do you?
My job is to teach English.
That makes me very happy.
Tell them I won't do that.
I like Boston very much.
I'd like to help you.
My lord is cutting me.
You'll be safe with Tom.
He tried to convince him to help us.
Excuse me, do you speak English?
You're late last night.
We're students.
Why are they angry?
I hope it went well.
I'm human.
Everyone likes the money.
Tom's talking to Mary.
Tom did a lot of great things.
There are five fish in my tank.

We recognized them.
I heard the news on the radio.
Do you miss Tom?
His wife doesn't even know why he died.
You have to watch this movie.
Drive safely.

There was no time.
After the accident, the wounded were transferred to the hospital.

As you wish!
Who are your parents?
I played tennis.
And with the others, I don't like wearing socks.
We're planning on going to your party.
Thank you for coming!
Tom was singing.
He's a dancer.

He wanted to see his boss in Tokyo before he left for America.
Come early.
How many letters did you send to Tom?

I want you to go back to Boston.
They've gone crazy.
You're a liar.
We're not guilty.
I drink milk.
I admire you.
I didn't go to the zoo.
These are my favorites.
One speaks English and the other speaks Japanese.
When are you planning on getting married?
They're writing.
What can I do about it?
I can't imagine what it might mean to be there.
It was English.
I had no doubt.
I'm not tired at all.
She's beautiful.
What do you want me to say?

His answer was negative.
I understand.
You're still alive.
How old are they?

We'll die if we stay here.
Do you want to have some guards?
I have a friend.
She didn't understand Mary's joke.
Are you gonna tell them?
She's very glistery.
Who brought you here?

We don't want her.
This room is used as a kitchen.
Who are you talking about?
Someone's singing.
How many Spring Rolls did you eat?

This tea is good.
That's the last warning.
Give us three minutes.

You're Canadians, aren't you?
I'll have to tell them.
Have you read this book?

Right.

Where did you find the keys?
Some people do terrible things.

Tell me your names.
What exactly did Tom do?
I'll meet you at the hospital.

There are many words I don't understand.
We've got to make things right.

Were you happy?

When did Tom get those shoes?
I don't know where Tom's pants are.
Tell them I won't do that.
I'm not very good at that.
I was hoping to see Tom.
This is where we're all Canadians.
Tom made some mistakes in the test.
Tom's cooking.
I was scared.
It's better to find out someone how to fish than to give him a fish.
I was so angry.
I get it.
Honestly, I don't like it.
Tom's gonna listen.
Were you alone?
We need more drivers.
I think you're on the right track.
It makes me laugh.
I'm at a friend's house.
Have you slept at all?

I don't think it's fair.
I'm Mexican.
I have a special relationship with my aunt.
I need your help.
Tom wanted me to learn French.
What are Tom's chances of winning?
Tom doesn't need a lawyer.

You're weak.
Where's the newspaper?
He went home with his feet.
Tom's gonna cry.
Where's he staying?
When are you coming?
We're ready to help.
Are you ready?
Tell them not to come.
That's not accurate.
The knife at the table wasn't cut enough to cut the meat, so I used my sister-in-law.
Is that your car?
I kissed her.

Tell her how important it is.
I like to sing.
Tom lost all his money.
What are you gonna tell Tom?
Tom has something to tell you.
How many hours did Tom work yesterday?
Why are we poor?
Tom's naked from the middle to the top.
I hope they find Tom.
I'm waiting for you from both of them.
Take them with you.
Give me your money.
What can you say in English?
French is not an easy language.
It's not my fault.
Can you answer?
I have to be there before seven.
How many oranges did Tom eat?
"What do you want to know?" "Everything."
Tom was still helping Mary.
Tom's going to graduate in October.
Tom's gonna help Mary.
Close the window before you get out.
I wasn't at his funeral.
I never imagined it would be so easy to do that.
Wait a minute.
Tom's gonna catch Mary.
Tom ignored Mary's advice.
Tom decided to go to Boston.
Are you sure you don't want me to talk to Tom about it?
I'm your doctor.
Look at that tall building.

These are ours.
Our team has good players.
I always put my team first.
I have a lot of friends who live in Boston.
That's not a fish.
Emily's doing the lessons she's got for the house.

I'd like to help you.
I didn't like it.
Cherries are red.
We were both very upset.
Why'd you put red on the bag?
Tom and Mary remained good friends.
You speak any language other than English?
Tom's too late.
How often do you eat outside?
I'm 19 years old.
When do you have a birthday?
Did you know Tom well?
I was in the right place at the right time.
Are you sure you stepped the last button?
It's not hard to learn English.
The date will be set at a later date.
Nobody's coming.
If you're busy, I'll help you.
I have a bunch of things to do.
I punished them.
Your friend is here.
I'm thirty years old.
How was the beach?
You're Tom's daughters, right?
Tom had a glass of wine.
I've told you things I've never told anyone else.
Tom was wearing gloves.
She's very curious.
I like China.

Do you like white wine?
He'll find it tomorrow.
I just said a big joke.
The house's broken down.
Put the book in the office.
Can I see your birth certificate?
Tom can't tell you anything.
We need him.
Eating meat?
I saw you on TV.
I'm not your teacher.
I'll buy one.
I understand.
If you can, please follow me.
He started talking to the dog.
They all ran out.
They speak English and French in Canada.
It's dead.
Tell them how important it is.
The party's Sunday.
This is where we're all Canadians.
Listen to him rocking.
Tom sent you?
Tom was laughing.
I've lost my style.
How is that word spoken?
He saved me.
I got an idea.
Where's the bank?
Don't drink.
I'm expecting your help.
It's almost 2:30.
What is it?
Who knows the answers?
I read this book last week.
Tom has black circles under his eyes.
We weren't talking about Tom.
They trusted you.
You think this is a game?
I just finished the bathroom.
We're not gonna change anything.
Look what I did!
Tom's a Harvard graduate.
You have 30 days.
Tom bought a little gift to Mary.
Russian is a Slavic language, spoken as a mother tongue in Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, and is widely used, although without official recognition, in Latvia, Estonia and many other countries, which were the democracies of the former Soviet Union.
Tom said you'd come.
Many tourists visit Boston every year.
I'm bigger than that.
Why don't you say so?
I'm still trying to find Tom.
"How many years are you?" "I'm twenty-three years."
Get some water.
I wish I had been born in Canada.
Are you sure you hit the last button?
We recognized them.
There's plenty of candles burning.
That's unfair.

He's strong.
We're close enough.
Tom took F to the gym.
Did you see who did it?
We're not millions.
Let's thank them.
You'll see the difference.
Don't tell Tom about the party.
I don't know why Tom's not here.
He never forgets his money.
It's almost 20 years old.
You have to stay.
I didn't vote.
Are you mad at Tom?
My parents live a strange life in the region.
He lost all his money at the casino.
I love green peppers.
You made the same mistake.
She said she had a good appearance.
What are you gonna tell Tom?
Thomas found me.
We're too busy.
I can live without water.
We've given your command the highest priority.
We make mistakes sometimes.
Could I use it?
They killed her.
My car's brilliance.
I have to tell you the truth.
You never trusted me.
We don't know where Tom went.
Who's the boss now?
I'm pregnant.
Can you teach me some milk?
I'll show you how it works.
What did you say about us?
These are our children.
Dick made sure to solve this problem.
I'm not Italian.
I want to kiss Tom.
The text is incomprehensible.
We need more volunteers.
You're more powerful than these.
Tom put in his room white.
The flying snow came down by flying out of the tree.
Tom says he's hungry.
I don't live in Boston.
Who's this dog?
Tom was waiting for Mary for at least an hour.
Most of them are Canadians.
Now you're cooking.
Are you sure Tom can do this?
Are you sure you don't remember?
Tom likes to fuck.
Who's Tom talking to?
Read them.
Do you speak Japanese?
Get out of here.
Do you speak my language?
Can we talk?

I feel lonely.
I have a lot of plans for the future.
Tom was turning the walls white.
I'm Tom's mom.
Tom loves vegetable.
Tell them everything.
Tom's very conservative.
Fame doesn't work.
Put on a chair.

Mary knew she'd win.
Millie has beautiful eyes.
This is his only chance.
The wine was excellent.
Let me finish.
I was sick yesterday.
I'm very strict with that.
Thank you for inviting me to the party.
How many apples do they have?
I don't remember when I first met him.
I'm hungry.
I don't have anything to open the can.
May I ask you a question?
How's the weather there?
I want to hire you.
Do you like running?
Are you committed?
They don't understand French at all.
I've been waiting for you for two hours.
You're not watching.
I'm dancing.
Are you happy?
He hit the phone.
I'll open it.
We weren't careful enough.
You want to tell them?
Let me talk to you, please.
They've lost everything.
You're invincible.
Tom's sleeping like a baby.
Come in, please.
Give me what you got.
I don't think I can go swimming today.
Tom was sentenced to a year's imprisonment.
I don't have time to read books.
I hate liars.
Reject my request.
You're disobedient.
I can't find him.
Don't you think you're overreacting?
Your husband learns Italian.
How many moles do you have in your neighborhood?
Who were you talking to?
Tell her I'll do it.
I'll be with Tom.
About 600 languages are in the process of disappearance due to English.
Did you call them at the party?
I never imagined it would be so easy to do that.
Are you new?
There was a big castle in my town.
He's in front of the door.
I think they're going to Australia just to have fun.
Tom's maggots are rocking.
I'm Richard.
What did you open him with?
Would you like a reservation for a trip to Australia?
I think she's sick.
Tom didn't want to touch her.
Tom will understand.
Where did he kiss you?
They know us.
Tell her you'd like to leave.
Tom helped Mary.
I had my birthdays yesterday.
Tom has a Canadian passport.
Tell them I'm here.
Tom never asked me for money.
It helped me a lot.
The planes allow people to travel long distances quickly.
Don't you have anything better to do?
In my opinion, you are beautiful.
Let's all go home now.
With the rain stopped, the game started again.
Tom has my keys.
He seems happy.
We've prepared well.
Were you happy?
Tom will forgive you.
You like putting me to sleep, don't you?
Is it?
It's a lot smarter.
They'd listen to us.
I got up early.
We'll have to wait.
I think he's my friend.
What did you do there?
The time will come when you will understand.
I'll eat it.
Tell her to stop.
I told him.
We're from Boston.
Does Tom know French?
These cars are built in Japan.
Can I ask you something?
I work in a bank.
We'll stop you.
The superheating of the planet is in motion to turn the tops of the mountains into mere rocks to less than one blood.
"Did you do this on Monday?" "No, I didn't."
Tom's smiling.
He loves Tom, not me.
I'm tough enough with that.
The cars are necessary.
Tell him you can't do it.
Why do you hate Canadians so much?
I was lucky.
Pick whoever you want.
I live on Park Street.
Where's the exit?
My favorite color is blue.
Tom's family lives in Boston.
She speaks Russian.
The kids are asleep.
You seem disappointed.
Tom works for Mary's father.
You're much faster than me.
Why don't you go play with her?
Is it blue?
Tell me this isn't true.
He left without saying anything.
I advised you not to buy this house.
Tom's popular.
That's very expensive.
He was disappointed.
The dog's white.
When are you coming?
Mary is my husband.
Looks like someone's taking you on the phone.
How many tickets did you get?
I've never been to Paris.
Tom has visited Australia three times.
It'll snow today.
I heard voices.
No, thank you.
Tom said it was wrong.
Do you believe in everlasting life?
I'll fight.
Millie doesn't eat a apple.
I don't like the wine.
You're smarter than her.
How much do you want?
Who knows the answers?
They killed Tom.
I rarely eat outside.
Kneel down!
Please, hurry up.
You're drunk!
We've seen him.
They have potatoes in France but not in the Netherlands.
What can we do for Tom?
We think it's unfair.
Did you invite them to the party?
You've got to clean up your class.
Why are you laughing?
We have a lot of schools.
Mary is blackmailing Tom.
He's not talking; he's screaming!
Are you from Australia?
They won.
What did you eat?
We're proud of Tom.
The horses are animals.
You're smarter than them.
I love what you do.
What football team do you support?
I'm getting up at 6:30.
I like rice.
Tom put his books down.
They ate at the restaurant.
I like that shirt.
Are you ready?
Good evening, what are you doing?
I won't tell anyone you're in Boston.
Tom's hiding under the bed.
Anything else?
Tom's crazy.
Are you going to Boston next week?
You look happy today.
I want you to stay.
We're gonna bury her.
That's easy to say, hard to do.
She showed me her room.
When will he come?
Australia is a good country.
They'll fix it.
I don't care whether you go or not.
It was weird.
No one understands him.
Tom doesn't have much money.
Tom grew up in Boston.
Do you have a red pencil?
Everyone knows me.
Mary believes you.
You're bigger than her.
Let me make my position clear.
I never understood that.
She's washing her head.
You're smarter than him.
Time will show.
I'm not gonna be there.
We didn't know who he was.
Is your car black?
I'm sending them a message.
Tom left for Boston.
Tom's not fair.
Tom wrote three letters.
Tom's not your brother.
Where are you from, my friends?
I had a lot of coffee.
He likes the walk.
The man's young.
He's not Algerian.
My car is faster than yours.
I don't live in Boston.
Tom likes all my friends.
What does she want?
Stop your stupidity.
Our university has a good library.
My horse is white.
Tom's back from Australia.
I'll sit with you.
I'll call you tonight.
I'm from Kyoto.
He's mentally jealous of his wife.
Can I have one of these?
Pass me the pepper, please.
Was anybody in the car?
That's my baby.
No one's moved.
It's not easy to speak French.
Tom came home tired.
Stop Tom.
They're bigger than her.
Did you hear her speak French?
I read a book last night.
He was accused of nepotism.
Tell us about your trip.
Tom says it's urgent.
Tom had to accept things the way they were.
I'm twenty-six.
He likes to read newspapers.
We'll find them.
My father was a Greek.
They were mine.
Are you shy?
You can't kill all of us.
He didn't know what to say.
I wouldn't like to lie to her.
I saw Tom in the library.
Tom plans to stay in Boston until October.
Let me make my position clear.
Is it important?
I assumed you were Canadians.
You bought a new house.
You never cared about me.
The thief turned into a police officer.
Can I get you out of here?
I thought we could stay here all day.
Tom and Mary seem to be messing around all the time.
Tom gave me $30.
Tom didn't want to touch her.
He knew it from the beginning.
Everything went well.
Amy asked me a question.
Let them come and see me.
You played.
I wonder which way is shorter.
There's a safe in Tom's office.
I want to go with Tom.
Who sent it?
I hope to see you soon.
Carol reads Spanish.
They all agreed with his idea.
Come quickly.
You have to stay.
I grew up in that neighborhood.
That's hard.
I'll fight.
He's still here.
Nobody's sitting here.
Where were you last Monday?
He met him three years ago.
Tom translated the document from French to English.
It was empty.
"Thank you." "Please."
I have something to say.
Everyone's waiting for Tom.
Did Tom do that to you?
You need to help your friends.
I'm not gonna lie.
Who did you go to the dance with?
You don't make enough contributions.
You're my best friend.
Tom's supplies are impressive.
Give me what you got.
Keep talking.
Don't leave me here alone.
Tell them how important it is.
You shot them.
I'll pray for Tom.
I'm too big for Mary.
Who discovered the phone?
He forgot to take out the light.
Give me 30 minutes.
They seem happy.
They're working hard.
Tell her you can't do it.
You ruined it.
You have a few books.
We're ready to help.
What did your teacher ask you about?
Tom loved Mary very much.
Is it yours?
I'll buy a new one.
Tom's afraid I'm gonna lose.
I'm very tired.
I want to learn guitar.
Do you like your car?
Chosen mayor.
Did you help Tom?
It's my turn now.
It's a witness to my life.
Tom gave me that tie.
I wish I had been born in Canada.
I miss her.
Were you happy?
She's happy.
You're incredibly stupid.
I won't wait for you.
Is Tom sick?
What do you want?
We like the kids.
He was wearing a black hat.
I closed my eyes.
Tell him you don't need it.
I like to dance.
You got the wrong key.
I thought Tom was a Canadian.
They were young.
He died fast.
Are you angry?
What are you doing?
Tom's a mathematician.
Are you Tom's friend?
How did you lose it?
Every year, the world population increases by two percent on average.
Tom was the prime suspect.
I thought you were Canadian.
I'd never think I'd meet you here.
I want you to sing.
Let me go!
Tom killed Mary.
Are you speaking Hebrew?
Who sold his car to?
You're so weird.
Come here now.
They speak French.
We have to finish it all by Monday morning.
Yeah, sure.
Your husband's cheating.
Tom's a subordinate.
The merchants only look at the profits.
He married him for his money.
Many people in the world like picnic food.
Mary's playing piano.
I don't love Tom.
I have to go to sleep now.
I want to live in Brazil.
Do good to those who hate you.
What exactly are you trying to prove?
Tell her you lied.
English isn't my mother tongue.
Will you give me your number, please?
Leave it there.
He may have his flaws, but I like him.
Don't believe it.
Who's your teacher?
I always hear music; I can't live without her.
It'll be hot today.
Kiss Tom.
Who?
Tom's very quiet.
He made me a cake.
Is your car fast?
I got up this morning at seven o'clock.
What the hell did Tom mean by that?
He's a quiet man.
I ran to the bus stop so I wouldn't miss the last bus stop.
Thomas told me Mary was in prison.
I'm fine, thank you for asking!
I saw Tom walk with Mary in the park last Monday.
They've sold the TV.
If you have anything to say, say it.
This house isn't too big.
Tom was busy.
I like to laugh.
I'm rich.
You want to marry me?
I like music and English.
He slept at ten yesterday.
You haven't told me who you are yet.
I have as many books as Tom.
I like that song.
You're a patient woman.
You'll be safe with Tom.
Give me another chance.
There's a book store on the table.
We should choose the right person for each position.
Think first!
Do you trust this man?
Who's gonna count the stars?
This is a game for four players.
Don't come near the dog.
Yeah, I'm coming!
Tom's missing his wife and kids.
Where did you go last Sunday?
Hold both your hands on the wheel.
He made me a cake.
Is Tom lying?
Where was he born?
That's original.
No one ever came to see me at the hospital.
You're not thirty.
Everything was perfect.
It's very fun to listen to music.
I think Tom's right.
Life is small, though the smile lasts only a second.
Now I know the truth.
My mother came.
Betty's here lately.
Did he accept it?
I think you don't often help other people.
Wait, I want to tell you something.
Next time I'm in Boston, I'll try to visit you.
I know a lot of pilots.
We were competing to survive.
We're not afraid.
Is that what you want?
You're not yourself.
It was yours.
The house is too big for us and beyond it is very expensive.
Are you sure I'm the only Canadian here?
Australia is a fantastic country.
They're laughing.
"He kissed you?" "Yes." "I knew it!"
I'm on the floor.
I have more money than you do.
Tell me about your son.
Still living on Park Street?
Lock the door.
He's so young.
Tom and Mary talk but they're not legally married.
We went to a nice restaurant.
Tom doesn't hate you.
They trust him.
Are you a member of a gym?
Where do you want to go?
There are books here.
I helped my father yesterday.
Nonsense!
I just did what Tom asked me to do.
Tom told us not to be afraid.
I have to learn French.
Two beers, please.
Tom will survive.
Larry lives in Melbourne.
Lock the door.
That thing moved me.
Let me make my position clear.
They don't need money.
Mary's Tom's girl.
That boy has black hair.
What do you know about Australia?
No one knows how it works.
You look tired.
We were both very hungry.
He died last week.
Tell them to stop worrying.
Everyone laughed.
She lost her money, her family, her friends.
Tom has red hair.
Please cancel my order and return the money.
He's green.
Tom's an actor.
Tom showed Mary the pictures.
It's not your job!
I can't lend you this book.
Tom saw Mary work.
Tell them you're not ready.
I'm a translator.
I think I have a lot to offer.
I'll show you.
You're staying here tonight.
I told Tom not to use them.
I refuse to accept this.
We all know you.
Drink some water.
My dog likes cats.
Are you alive?
He's a good singer.
Tell him I'm sick.
Tom survived in 2013 in Australia.
My love for you is hard to explain.
What is that?
Why did you stop?
Tom saved her from the fire.
Food's good.
I'll go with you.
Save them.
I wanted to tell you the truth.
The streets are covered with snow.
How happy I am today!
I can't see you.
He let me see her daughter.
My house is near school.
I assumed you were Canadian.
You were busy.
It was easy for me to solve the problem.
I'd like you to stay with me.
Tom was married to Canada.
I'll wait for you here at 2:30.
The rejection hurts.
I hope this continues.
I thought I heard Tom's voice.
What did you say?
Come with me to Boston.
Do you fall often?
I've felt so embarrassed to be seen by so many people.
I'm doing what I have to do.
Peter loves Jane.
Tom put his hair in black.
Yeah, I'll be right there.
I took it for a joke and I didn't answer.
Tell them I'm ready.
When did you buy it?
Tell them I'm not doing this.
I'm not a doctor.
When I was sick, Tom came and prepared dinner for me.
My favorite color is orange.
Are you a Canadian citizen?
I'll wait for you at 2:30.
Anybody here?
Tom laughed when Mary said that.
Mary is my wife.
He's looking forward to seeing him again.
Tom moved to Australia in 2013.
Is there bread?
Throw him out.
I'll watch TV.
See you in about an hour.
My last husband was very stupid.
You look busy.
I'm walking like a penguin.
Do you like putting me to sleep?
Her husband's got a hell of a fight.
He lied to us.
Florence is the most beautiful city in Italy.
Is it Canadian?
Do you have a car?
We've talked a lot about this.
I like coffee.
Do you like cooking Japanese food?
We're worried about you.
I'm a woman.
You're rich.
You're working hard.
We're clean.
I love you very much.
You see them?
I know what it's like to be poor.
Do you like your new job?
I'm glad to see you again.
How am I gonna find it?
She's the most beautiful woman.
A week ago, I had an export of teeth.
You can take a cab.
I rarely watch a documenter.
Tom told Mary to sit down.
I can read English, but I can't speak English.
I think I know why you're here.
That kid's name is Tom.
A friend in need is really a friend.
In a voice and the goat.
He thought it was peculiar.
I like green tea.
I want to leave early today.
His father dedicated his life to science.
Michael broke the plates.
Tom married a Canadian.
There's no such thing as an elephant, so there's no real man.
No thought!
I'm not gonna be there.
I like your car.
This road is dangerous.
Do you like driving fast cars?
Take my coat.
Don't look down on this rock.
When did you finish it?
Kids like to drink fruit juice.
You'll learn to speak Portuguese!
Tom has a good vision.
Tom didn't like the idea.
What's he gonna order at the restaurant?
They burned the paper.
The paper is easily burned.
I thought it was okay.
I wish I wasn't Canadian.
I don't understand music.
You're so weird.
Tom's writing late.
What number of shoes are you wearing?
He ate dinner.
Take them with you.
You have to go.
I can't understand.
Tom didn't play well.
Did you buy it on the black market?
He set up the company.
Is it hard to be a security guard?
Does Tom know French?
We helped them.
We will continue the debate.
I'm paying for tonight.
The Japanese are Asians.
What are they doing?
We're waiting for Tom.
I saw them today.
The cubs have big eyes.
I'd like you to meet tomorrow.
I don't think Tom was kidding.
My cat's white.
What time is it in London now?
What else did you tell him?
Don't you close the door?
I can't remember Tom ever having a meal.
Tell them I'm not here.
Tom's gonna change.
What are they gonna do?
Tom told a lot of stories to the kids.
She wants you to kiss her.
This is the best dictionary available in the library.
It's inexhaustible.
Tell me what you want.
You like me?
I want to see you dance.
Tom was dressed in black.
Where did you go?
That's my table.
It's not fair life.
Tom and Mary were busy.
You like Boston?
There's a bottle in the fridge.
Don't start yet.
Tom wants me.
We want one.
They canceled the fight because of the rain.
Dan and Linda were married from 1994 to 2002.
I've waited a long time for her.
You'd listen.
Don't leave me like that.
These bananas aren't ripe.
Tom's gonna die.
I'm too exhausted to think, how much better to read.
Germany has been excluded from South Korea.
What'd he get out of it for?
Get down!
You're bigger than me.
Tom thought Mary was depressed.
You can't teach a cowboy to walk straight.
We left him some cake.
Where was he born?
You're talking.
You're a liar.
You look like flowers.
You shot her.
We know you're in pain.
I wish I'd gone with Tom to Australia.
Go on, please.
Tom told me Mary wanted to see me.
I like baseball.
This goes beyond my jurisdiction.
You know the answer?
Tom said he liked the rain.
Tom threatened to kill himself.
I thought you were Japanese.
We won't forget.
When did you buy it?
I usually play football after school.
Tom stole Mary's car.
You were busy.
Do you accept a credit card?
Where's your drink?
Tom's written three books.
We're ready to play.
I assumed you were Canadian.
This political party is environmentally well aware.
Luckily he didn't die in the accident.
Tom sang us a French song.
Don't let Tom out.
Are you Mary's husband?
I don't think Tom should be here today.
No one encouraged her.
He can't drive.
It was expected.
This polythron is restful.
Tell them you don't need him.
He likes the paper game.
The strong must help the weak.
I need a computer.
Tom seems tired.
Tell him I'm not gonna do this.
I used to eat pizza.
Look what she brought me about my birthday!
He's often here.
You're not ready.
I don't have a cat.
He's helping him.
Tom lost all his money.
I have to buy one.
I don't think so.
Tom was the best.
Cecilia wasn't a teacher.
There are about three thousand twins in Constantinople.
I made it to the station so I wouldn't lose the last station.
What's his name?
Where was Tom?
You're not fast enough.
Your dog's too big.
Tom doesn't have much money.
They made mistakes.
I know her.
Harvard was founded in 1636.
You're not thirty.
Do you have your own room?
He's afraid of cats.
Pua sings.
You're much smarter than me.
Why are you late this morning?
Call me tonight.
Would you like meat or fish?
Tom's already dead.
Tom ignored Mary.
When did you buy it?
Tell him to leave.
We want to create the slightest possible setback.
We were born the same day.
You're indecisive.
She promised me she'd come.
That wasn't necessary.
If you can read this, then you can speak a language.
Everyone agrees.
I survived.
Tell her to come here.
I always dreamed of going to Australia.
You can wait here.
I laughed a lot.
When I first met her, she was about 30.
We were looking for treasure.
It's Tom's.
I'm after Tom.
All people are dead, all Greeks are human, so all Greeks are dead.
The message was in French.
Tom's violent.
Why is she mad?
He didn't want to.
I'm a cook.
When do your vacations start?
What happened in Boston?
I don't want you to change.
You got a pound.
How could this happen to Tom?
The party's Monday.
I need my tools to fix it.
Destroy this temple.
Tom's taller than Mary.
You're rich.
Tom's alive?
I don't think I like them.
All roads lead to Rome.
We need to find more chairs.
Someone stole my passport.
He surprised me.
Who taught you French?
Tell them.
He lives in Morocco.
Prove that you love me.
I told Tom not to use them.
No one's gonna stop you.
Tell them you can't do it.
He's working as a translator.
I've seen you for years and years.
One woman asked me if I could tell her where there was a road.
Where's the wall?
She lost her bag.
Now's your chance.
I'll try to find you.
You said you wouldn't drink today.
Tell Tom I'm hungry.
You're very brave.
I can't drink milk.
All of a sudden, these two are still under repair.
We'll be back in twenty minutes.
I want you back in Boston.
Come quickly!
I've never been to Paris.
I'm sorry, but I don't know.
You're perfect.
Where's the money?
What's your dream?
What would you say to her?
Why are you out today?
If I wasn't stupid, I'd buy it.
We don't work for Tom.
Please, teach me French.
My dog is smaller than yours.
I owe Tom a lot of credit.
Do you feel tired?
Do you like red wine?
Who were they talking about?
Tom's not Canadian.
Don't call me Tom.
I'm trying to learn English.
Can you touch the fingers of your feet?
That box is bigger than that here.
We know that work is dangerous.
She's lucky.
I want the job done fast.
I wanted to tell you the truth.
Can I borrow your headphones?
Where did you get the keys?
I can read Spanish without any difficulty.
Your kids will be safe with Tom.
Tom hates himself.
Good luck convincing him.
Why are you smiling?
You're better than those.
I'll buy a new one.
Tom's gonna change.
That's unfair.
I speak French.
Can I borrow your headphones?
I don't remember his little name.
We'll meet at the theater.
You think this is a game?
I haven't seen a heterophile in a week.
The man visits Moscow.
Tom said he was going to Boston in October.
Tom didn't want to go out without his hat and his gloves.
When did you get married?
Are you drunk?
You're an attractive woman.
Tom's sweating.
They don't have what we want.
You're so beautiful.
It's simple. It's nice.
The horse's not white.
Tom has a lot of imagination.
Don't give it to him!
I'm sure someone loves you.
He sells vegetables.
I like to sing.
Tom's playing with his cat.
Play.
I know you.
My father is tall.
Where are you going?
They both want the same thing.
I'll be back in Australia in two days.
He's begging you to finish your job.
Can you come and work for us?
I like this room.
Are you better now?
I'm not kidding.
Are you really Canadian?
Tell her you lied.
We're learning Chinese.
He's younger than me.
Tom forgot to buy milk.
I panicked.
Why are you always against me?
We'll work.
I don't have as much experience as you do.
I'm writing a sentence in German.
I'd like to know who did this.
Why do our schools look like prisons?
They're not green.
As usual, he got up early in the morning and went to jogging.
Did you shoot them?
Let me clarify my position.
I think he's innocent.
He's got blue eyes.
Tom walked.
Where do you work?
Nice suit.
Please come before 2:30.
I'm a man.
You didn't help me.
Somebody needs to talk to Tom.
His real name is Tom.
We can't change history, but we can learn from it.
He's not married.
Your English is perfect.
Tom's got money.
Son of a bitch!
It's not raining.
Tell them you're not ready.
What are you gonna order at the restaurant?
Let's wait for Tom.
This hat is too small for you.
This horse is white.
I'm sick of it.
I slept all day.
What city do you live in?
Didn't you read the story?
It weighs more than 80 kilos.
My parents are in Australia.
My brother's guitar is new.
They'll fix him.
Where are you going?
You should remember all those dates.
Did you invite him to the party?
You're unbelievable.
Save Tom.
He's sharing a room with his brother.
