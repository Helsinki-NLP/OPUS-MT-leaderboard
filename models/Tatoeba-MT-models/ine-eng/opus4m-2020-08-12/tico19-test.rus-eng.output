You know, I have diabetes and everything.
You said you were experiencing this chest pain.
The rate of cumulative coroner disease (COVID-19) in the European Union and the United Kingdom increased rapidly between 1 January and 15 March 2020.
The cumulative spread of coronary infection (COVID-19) has similar trends in the countries of the European Union/the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, thus confirming that, despite various stages of its development in different countries, the COVID-19 pandemic is growing rapidly in all countries.
Taking into account the experience of Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care offices, it is necessary to increase the level of readiness for flow of patients with COVID-19 who will need treatment and, in particular, intensive therapy.
On 31 December 2019, several cases of an unknown hetology were reported in the Uhan Province of Hubei.
On 9 January 2020, the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention reported that a new type of coronation virus, now known as severe acute respiratory syndrome type 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is the cause of the infection.
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 has become known as a coronary infection (COVID-19).
According to today's available data, about 80 per cent of people with COVID-19 have a mild disease, i.e., respiratory tract infections with or without pneumonia, and most of the patients are cured.
Approximately 14 per cent of COVID-19 cases develop into a more severe form of hospitalization and the remaining 6 per cent take a critical form when intensive therapy is required.
The mortality rate of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 is approximately 4 per cent.
This study analyzes the trends of COVID-19 cumulative disease in each country of the European Union (EU)/European Economic Area (EEA) and in the United Kingdom and compares them with trends in the Chinese province of Hubei.
We are also comparing the current number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and the UK with data on Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Cases of COVID-19 in EU/EEA and United Kingdom
Since the outbreak in China, the COVID-19 has spread to other countries, and the COVID-19 pandemic is currently developing in the rest of the world according to the same dynamics as in China.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the COVID-19 pandemic.
In the issue of Eurosurveillance of 5 March 2020, Mr. Spiteri (Spiteri) and his colleagues reported on the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 disease in Europe, which met the criteria under which WHO determines the presence of the disease.
The first three confirmed cases in the EU/EEA were registered in France on 24 January 2020, all three of whom returned from the Chinese province of Hubay.
As at 15 March 2020, cases of COVID-19 were detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and in the United Kingdom, with 39 768 cases of infection and 1,727 deaths, of which 17,750, including 1,441 with a fatal outcome, were recorded for Italy alone.
Determination of cumulative quantity and cumulative morbidity of COVID-19
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) daily updates data on the number of registered cases of COVID-19 in each country of the world from official sources, such as the Ministry of Health of those countries, national and regional health authorities and WHO.
These data are used to analyse trends in the spread of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK and to compare them with data on Italy.
The COVID-19 cumulative disease was calculated as the rate of active prevalence of COVID-19 in 14 days, taking into account the usual flow of COVID-19 in each EU/EEA country and in Britain for the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also presented the cumulative number of cases recorded in each country at 8:00 on 15 March 2020, compared with data on Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Trends in development of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the UK
Trends in the development of COVID-19 cumulative disease for a 14-day period in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom in general were consistent with trends observed in the Chinese province of Hubei (Figure 1).
The cumulative morbidity of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK as a whole began to grow by about 21 February, and on 28 February 2020 a sharp leap occurred in this indicator (additional material).
This was mainly due to a sharp rise in the number of registered diseases in Italy, but similar trends were observed in all other EU/EEA countries and in the United Kingdom to increase the cumulative disease of COVID-19 (additional material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA and UK compared to the similar figure for Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
According to this data, the total number of cases already registered as at 8:00 on 15 March in 15 other EU/EEA countries and in the United Kingdom is comparable to the number recorded in Italy about 3 weeks earlier.
Our results show a rapid increase in the number of recorded cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The observed trends in cumulative disease COVID-19 suggest that the pandemic is developing at a comparable rate in all countries.
In spite of this, different stages in different countries, differences in responses taken by national public health authorities, and possibly different criteria for the recognition of disease cases and different rules for the selection of patients for the analysis of the presence of COVID-19, including “reversing” testing.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy reported that approximately 10 per cent of patients with COVID-19 require intensive therapy, and the media noted that hospitals and intensive care offices in those regions had already been filled.
Currently, data on the incidence of patients with COVID-19 in the hospital and/or intensive care offices in the EU/EEA are available only for 6% and 1% of cases respectively (data not provided).
However, it is necessary to systematically collect such data in order to supplement the current monitoring data, the subject of which is the number of cases recorded and the number of deaths.
According to a study conducted in 2010-2011, there was a significant distribution in the number of chickens in intensive care and sick care offices: from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 chickens per 100,000 in Portugal.
This means that other countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 chickens in intensive therapy and intensive care offices for 100,000 patients in 2010-2011).
The ECDC's sixth updated report on risk assessment results for COVID-19 presents a model for loading health system resources with assessment data on hospitalization of COVID-19 infected in each EU/EEA country and in Britain, where the risk of lack of available chickens in intensive therapy offices exceeds 90 per cent.
As the cases are currently grouped into certain regions of the EU/ECE and the United Kingdom, and hospitals and intensive care offices normally serve the population of a particular territorial group, it is recommended to provide information on cases of infection and the number of chickens in intensive care offices at the 2nd level of the territorial unit nomenclature for statistical purposes (NUTS-2).
The experience of Italy and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is developing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care offices should therefore be prepared for the Sars-CoV-2, which is not weakened for a long time, and for increasing the number of patients with COVID-19 in need of medical care and, in particular, intensive therapy, which can be observed in the affected regions of Italy.
According to the latest ECDC report on the results of the risk assessment, an operational, preventive and integrated approach to preventing the spread of SARS-COV-2 is important, with a subsequent shift from deterrence to minimisation, as due to the projected projected rapid increase in the number of diseases faced by decision-makers and hospitals, it may simply not be time to consider, take and adjust their responses accordingly if such measures are not taken in advance.
The report on the results of the risk assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
Countries have only a short period of time during which they can intensify their monitoring efforts to slow down the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the burden on their health systems.
If not, in the next few days or weeks, the health system in other EU/EEA countries will be confronted with the flow of patients who will need intensive therapy.
The outbreak of the 2019 coronary infection (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) of type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a tragedy for mankind: more than 3,000 people have died in China and other countries of the world, and more than 80,000 have been infected.
Similarly to the homologous SARS-CoV virus, which caused the development of a severe severe respiratory syndrome in thousands in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also be transmitted by flying mice and causes similar symptoms using a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 is less than the severity of the disease and less mortality than SARS, but it is much more infected and affects older people more often than young people and men more often than women.
In response to the rapid increase in the number of publications on the new disease, this article proposes an ongoing and comprehensive review of the rapidly developing subject of the study.
We will consider the basic aspects of epidemiology, hetology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, the forecast of further flow and the prevention of the disease.
While the answers to many questions are still to be found, we hope that this review will help us to understand and eliminate the dangerous disease.
The spring holiday (Chinese New Year), which was released on 25 January 2020, was an unprecedented and unforgettable event for all Chinese people who were urged to stay home during and for weeks after the outbreak of the new virus infection.
In view of the high level of coronation (COV) that caused the outbreak of severe severe respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, the World Health Organization (WHO) called this SARS-CoV-2 virus on 11 February 2020, and the associated disease was coronal infection 19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in the Chinese city of Uhan and spread rapidly throughout the country and then almost 50 other countries around the world.
More than 80,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases were reported as of 2 March 2020, more than 40,000 patients recovered, and more than 3,000 patients died.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is an “enemy one for society” and potentially more dangerous than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months more than 200 COVID-19 publications were published, including articles on its virology, epidemiology, hetology, diagnosis and treatment, starting with the first report of 7 January 2020, which identified the sequence of the virus from a number of patients.
This review is an attempt to summarise the results of research in a new and rapidly developing subject area.
As far as possible, we are trying to compare COVID-19 with SARS and other coronation-induced diseases, the coronation of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), which erupted in 2012.
We will also discuss the facts at that time about prevention and forecasting of the disease flow, as well as some other issues that are not less pressing.
Coronaviruses have traditionally been among pathogens that are not deadly to humans and mainly cause approximately 15 per cent of the total respiratory disease 4.
However, in this century, we have encountered twice the highly pathogenic human coronary syndromes, i.e. severe severe respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), which caused the outbreak of diseases originally in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012 respectively and soon spread to many other countries with a terrible level of disease and mortality.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 is the third outbreak of coronary infection in the history of mankind.
As shown in Figure 1.1, the report on the cluster of cases of pneumonia of unknown origin was first submitted to the National Commission for Health of the PRC from Uhan on 31 December 2019.
Seven days later, the genetic sequence of the virus was released.
On 15 January 2020, the first case of death was registered in Uhan.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly in neighboring cities, provinces and countries.
On 20 January, it became known that there was a disease in nursing staff, which made it possible to transfer the virus from human to human.
On 23 January, quarantine was introduced in Uhan, and urban public transport ceased.
On 24 January, according to the first clinical study of this disease, 21 of the 41 patients with confirmed coronary infection had direct contact with the marine product market in Mr. Uhan, who was considered to be the starting point for the spread of infection from an unknown animal.
On 30 January, WHO announced that the outbreak of the crown virus was a global public health emergency.
At the time of preparation of the report, the disease had spread throughout China and had already spread to about 50 other countries around the world (Figure 2).
Given the rapid development of the situation, the final scale and the degree of risk of flashing still need to be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a multicentre clinical study involving 8,866 patients, including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients, presented the following updated picture of epidemic development (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
The SARS-CoV-2 infection has been subject to all age groups, but mainly people between the ages of 30 and 65 have been affected.
Nearly half (47.7%) of those infected were over 50 years old, quite few were under 20, and only 14 of those infected were not yet 10 years old.
SARS-CoV-2 infection among men above (0.31/100 000) than among women (0.27/100 000).
COVID-19 was mainly clustered in the province of Hubei and in the neighbouring regions.
On average, 5 (2-9) days passed from the time of onset of COVID-19 symptoms to the diagnosis.
The incubation period was on average 4.8 (3.0 to 7.2) days.
From the onset of symptoms to the onset of death on average, there were 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The baseline reproduction rate (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
By 23 January 2020, there had been an exponential increase in the number of people infected with large transport transports prior to the New Year ' s celebration of China.
Mortality among patients with confirmed diagnosis was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10–1.86%) and the corrected mortality rate among patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02–4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 infection were gender (male), age (≥60) and severe pneumonia.
Coronaviruses are a subfamily of large cervical viruses containing one string of meaningful RNAs.
They can be divided into four species, i.e. alpha, beta, gamma and deltas, from which alpha- and beta-coronaviruses are known to affect people.
In the case of serotype SARS and MERS glucoproteins (S) celebrate is associated with cell receptors of type 2 angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE2) and dipeptidylpeptidase-4 (DPP4) respectively, followed by membrane synthesis.
In cytoplasm, the virus RNA gene is released; after replication of the virus genome, the genomic RNA together with cloudy glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins generates viral vectors that then merge with the membrane, releasing the virus.
The first reports on the genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 appeared on 10 January 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 is found to be a new type of beta-coronavirus, with 99.98 per cent matching 10 consecutive samples collected in the first instance of outbreaks of the disease on the Juanan marine product market in Uhan.
Genetic SARS-CoV-2 is closer to SARS-CoV than to MERS-CoV.
Using a illuminating electronic microscope, SARS-CoV-2 particles were found in ultrasonic cuts of the human respiratory epithelial.
The human enzyme ACE2 has been found to be a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, as well as for SARS-CoV.
However, S-protein SARS-CoV-2 is less likely to be associated with ACE2 human enzyme than with SARS-CoV, which explains the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes patients to have a less severe disease than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also generate previously unknown short-liver protein, encoded orf3b, and secretified protein, encoded orf8.
The ORF3b protein of SARS-CoV-2 may play a role in the pathogen of the virus and suppress IFNβ expression; however, the ORF8 contains no known functional domain or motive.
On 18 February 2020, by collecting the authors in the head with Zhou (Zhou) presented reports on the cryoelectronic tomography of the structure of the full-sized ACE2 human enzyme with a 2.9 Å permission in a complex with a B0AT1 amino acid carrier.
They found that this complex, which included open and closed formations, was collected as a dimer and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex could bind two S-proteins, which served as evidence when they were identified and infected.
B0AT1 may be a therapeutic target in the conduct of a drug box to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Origin and interim landlord
It is known that the source and SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were flying mice, from which the virus was transmitted to man through the jaws and calves, respectively.
Through the phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronation viruses, it was found that the first owners of SARS-CoV-2 were mice, as the new 96% virus is identical to two SARS-like coronation viruses, namely those of the SL-CoVZX45 and SL-CoVZX21 mice.
However, it remains unknown what kind of temporary owner the virus has been able to overcome the type of barrier and to infect humans; the way of transmission must also be identified.
Mr. Zji (Ji) and his colleagues assumed that the carriers of the virus from flying mice to humans had become snakes, in which the homologous recombination took place in S-protein.
As a result of their study, Chinese scientists from Guanchou assumed that pangolins, long-term dairy farmers who eat ants and are often used in traditional Chinese medicine, are potential intermediate owners of SARS-CoV-2; this assumption is based on a 99 per cent genetic similarity between the pangoline coronation virus and SARS-CoV-2.
However, the difference in 1 per cent between the two genomes is still very large, so it is considered that the final results with specific evidence have not yet been obtained (Figure 33).
The physical and chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still largely unknown.
In the laboratory conditions SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV may survive for 48 hours in the dry environment and for up to 5 days at temperatures below 20 °C and 40 to 50 per cent of moisture.
SARS-CoV-2 can have similar properties.
SARS-CoV-2 is known to be sensitive to ultraviolet and heating up to 56 °C for 30 minutes; effective blocking of virus activity may result in air, 75 per cent ethyl alcohol, chlorinated disinfectants, percussion acid, chloroforms and other chlorine-containing solvents, but not chlorhexidine.
The human population as a whole has no immunity to SARS-CoV-2, so people are susceptible to the new virus.
There are currently no data on detailed studies of immune response to SARS-CoV-2.
Thus, we can only refer to earlier studies of other coronary viruses, in particular SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Figure 4).
As a rule, the host virus first recognises the immune system by means of the image-recognition receptors (RAs), including P-type jet receptors, Toll-like receptors, NOD-like receptors and RIG-I-like receptors.
Through various mechanisms, the virus produces the expression of inflammatory factors, dendrite cells and type I interferon synthesis, which inhibit the spread of the virus and accelerate macrophages phagocytes against virus antigens.
However, the N-label of SARS-CoV can prevent immune reactions.
Adequate immune response is soon included in the fight against the virus.
T-lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells, play an important role in protecting the body.
T-cells CD4+ stimulate the generation of virus-specific antibodies in B-cells, and T-cells CD8+ directly kill the virus-affected cells.
T-helpers produce anti-inflammatory cytokines that help protect cells.
However, coronavirus can inhibit the T-cell function by causing their programmed death.
Humorous immunity, including components such as C3a and C5a, and antibodies, also plays an important role in the fight against viral infection.
For example, antibodies separated from the healer neutralized the MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, the hyperreaction of the immune system has resulted in a local education of a large number of free radicals, which could cause serious damage to the light and other organs, and in the worst scenario, leading to poly-organism insufficiency and even death.
The SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by a cluster phenomenon, is more likely to affect elderly people with concomitant pathologies and pregnant women.
Probability of infection above those who are affected by a large number of viruses or have immune system violations.
According to a study of the first 425 cases of infection in Uhan, the estimated mean incubation period SARS-CoV-2 is from 1 to 14 days, mainly 3 to 7 days.
However, a study of 1,099 cases showed that the average incubation period lasted 3 days, with the distribution from 0 to 24 days.
The later study, based on demographic data in 8,866, showed that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0 - 7.2) days.
It is very important for health authorities to adjust the time limits for quarantine measures introduced, taking into account the most accurate calculations of the duration of the incubation period, which will prevent the spread of the virus to those infected with the disease with no symptoms.
In general, 14-day quarantine has become available for people who have contacts with the virus or who have been infected.
Should the quarantine period be extended to 24 days?
The main and first symptom of COVID-19 is often a high temperature, which can be the only manifestation or accompanied by other symptoms, such as dry cough, difficulty breathing, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, hives, chest pain, diarrhoea, cough and vomiting.
In some patients, recovery and/or hypoxia occurred a week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, the disease progressed rapidly, and patients developed severe respiratory disease, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy.
Patients with high temperature and/or respiratory disease and acute illness should be tested for virus with an early diagnosis even if there are no pathologies in the chest images.
The demographic study, conducted at the end of December 2019, found the following signs and symptoms: 98 per cent high temperature, 76 per cent dry cough, 55 per cent drought and 3 per cent diarrhoea; 8 per cent of patients required artificial ventilation.
Similar results were obtained from the last two studies of cases of infection in the family and transmission of the virus from unsymptomatic infected people.
Comparative results were obtained in 2012 in the study of patients with MERS-CoV, who also had major symptoms of high temperature (98 per cent), dry cough (47 per cent) and recovery (55 per cent).
However, 80 per cent of them were required for artificial ventilation of light, much higher than those in patients with COVID-19, and corresponded to a higher rate of mortality from MERS than from COVID-19.
Patients with MERS also experienced diarrhoea (26%) and throat pain (21%).
The main symptoms of patients with SARS are high temperature (99-100%), dry cough (29-75%), diarrhoea (40-42%), diarrhoea (20-25%) and throat pain (13-25%), and artificial ventilation of patients is required.
As of 14 February, mortality from COVID-19 was 2 per cent and the total number of confirmed cases worldwide was 66 576.
Compared to this, the mortality rate from SARS to November 2002 was 10 per cent of 8,096 confirmed cases.
In the case of MERS, the June 2012 demographic study showed mortality at 37 per cent of the 2,494 confirmed cases.
As a result of an earlier study, the baseline reproduction rate (R0) for SARS-CoV-2 was determined at 6.47 at 95% confidence interval (CI) from 5.71 to 7.23, whereas R0 for SARS-CoV was only in range 2 to 4.
A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-COV on symptoms, mortality and R0 is given in Table 1.1.
The above-mentioned indicators show that SARS-CoV-2 is higher than MRS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but the mortality rate in the event of a new virus infection is lower than the last two.
Thus, keeping the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic will be much more difficult than the Mers-CoV and SARS-CoV epidemics.
A cluster event often occurs within one family or group of people who have gathered together for some reason or who have been together in some transport, such as a cruise liner.
Patients often traveled to Mr. Uhan or other affected regions, lived there or contacted infected or sick during the last two weeks before the onset of the disease.
However, according to the reports, people may be infected with the virus for more than two weeks without any symptoms, and treated patients who have been removed from the hospital may again be infected with the virus, which is an alarming signal for the extension of quarantine.
At an early stage, patients have normal or reduced leukocytes (especially lymphocytes) in peripheral blood.
For example, 1,099 patients with COVID-19 had a leukocyte lymphoma < 4×109/L, including leukocyte < 1×109/L, as well as an increased level of asparagine aminotransferase and virus.
In some patients, elevated levels of liver enzymes, muscle enzymes, and myoglobin were found in the blood, and in most patients, elevated levels of C-reactive protein and erythrocytes were observed in the blood.
Patients with severe disease had an increased level of D-dimer, a fibrin breakdown in the blood, and the number of lymphocytes steadily decreased.
The majority of patients with COVID-19 in the X-ray study of the breast cell were diagnosed with pathologies characterized by uneven darkness from both sides or light-glass-type darkness.
Patients often develop atypical pneumonia, severe mild and severe respiratory disease (LDS).
In developing the ODS, uncontrolled combustion, fluid accumulation and progressive fibrosis result in a significant change in gas exchange.
Type I and Type II pneumonia decreases the level of surface-active compounds and increases surface pressure, thus reducing the ability to expand easily and increasing the risk of loss of light.
Thus, the worst results of X-ray research often coincide with the most serious cases of disease.
On 18 February 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 demonstrated the detection of pneumocytes, the formation of gialin membranes and intertwined lymphocyte infiltration, and the multi-nuclear syncitial cells in mild patients who died of the disease correspond to viral infection pathologies and PSD and are similar to those found in patients with SARS and MERS.
As the main criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19, the SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection method was used through a polymeric reverse transcriptase chain reaction (reverse transcriptase PCR).
However, given the high level of false negative results that could accelerate the epidemic's development, the diagnosis of clinical manifestations in China began on 13 February 2020 (not based solely on the PCD with the reverse transcriptase).
The situation with SARS diagnostics was similar.
Therefore, data on disease history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and X-ray results are critical for effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, a team of experts led by Mr. Feng Zhang described the SHERLOCK repeat-based methodology protocol for the detection of SARS-CoV-2; this method allows for the detection of synthetic fragments of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA at 20 × 10-18 mol/l to 200 × 10–18 mol/l (10–100 copies per microlitre of the reference sample) with less than one hour without the use of complex equipment.
This new methodology, if successfully tested on clinical medicinal products, can significantly improve the sensitivity and comfort of tests.
Due to the lack of experience with the previously unknown coronation virus, physicians may mainly provide only supportive therapy to patients with COVID-19 while trying to use any therapeutic methods that were used or proposed for the treatment of other coronation viruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as other viral diseases (Table 2).
These therapeutic methods include the current or potential use of antivirals, immunosuppressants, steroids, healthy patients' plasmas, traditional Chinese medicine and psychological support.
Even healthy patients were advised to use plasma for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are speeding up the development of antibodies and vaccines to fight the virus.
In the initial stages of SARS-CoV-2, it attacks mainly easily, and may lower the impact of other bodies expressing ACE2, such as the gastrointestinal tract and the pouch.
However, the violation of work and the refusal of breathing organs are a major threat and cause of patient death.
Thus, support for respiratory function, including general oxygen therapy, high oxygen concentration, non-invasive artificial ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation, is critical for the relief of symptoms and life saving.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need support in the form of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a modified method of extrapulmonary circulation used to treat a risk of heart or respiratory failure.
In addition, the maintenance of salt water balance, prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shocks and the protection of vital organs are essential for patients with SARS-CoV-2.
Cytokine storm is known to be a result of the hyperreaction of the immune system of patients infected with SARS and MERS.
The cytokine storm is a form of a systemic combustion process that is developing in response to a series of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1b, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ and MCP-1.
These cytokines produce immunocytes for the release of a large number of free radicals, which are the main cause of the development of ODS and of polyorganic insufficiency.
In the treatment of cytokine storm, especially in patients with severe conditions, immunosuppression is essential.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab were used to treat cytokine storms, monoclonal antibodies acting as interlequin-6 inhibitors.
Other methods of treatment of cytokine storm based on immunosuppression include modulation of the immune response to T-cell control; inhibition of the production of cytokines IFN-γ, IL-1, and TNF; suppression of yanus-kinase; use of blinatumomab, cytokine-signalling suppressors 4 and histodeacetase inhibitors.
In order to reduce the severity of the inflammatory effects of SARS virus treatment, steroids are widely used as immunosuppressants.
However, steroids at high doses do not benefit from the treatment of severe minor injuries in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
On the contrary, they can cause serious side effects, especially a vasculular osteonecrosis, which significantly aggravate the forecast.
However, short courses of corticosteroids in small and medium doses are recommended for use with caution when treating patients with COVID-19 in critical settings.
There was no proven effective anti-virus therapy at the time of the preparation of the document.
However, the internal introduction of remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue, was effective in treating an American patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a recently developed antiviral medicine, originally developed by Gilead for the treatment of Ebola and Marburg virus diseases.
Later, remdesiver also demonstrated the possibility of suppressing other viruses with one-off RNA, including those of MERS and SARS.
Based on this data, Gilead has provided this medicinal product to China to conduct male studies in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and the results of these studies are eagerly awaited.
In addition, baricitinib, α-interferon, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin were proposed as possible options for the treatment of patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir may be accompanied by diarrhoea, cough, vomiting, fever and other side effects.
Patients should be closely monitored for interactions with other medicinal products.
Plasma of healers and anti-inflammatory agents
Blood collection in infected patients has been used for the treatment of other patients with the same disease or for the protection of the healthy population for a long time.
In fact, the blood of healthy patients often contains relatively high levels of antibodies to fight pathogens.
The antibodies are in immunoglobulin produced by B-lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other international objects; they recognise and address certain pathogen molecules and neutralize them.
Based on this assumption, plasma was removed from the blood samples of the group of patients treated with COVID-19, which was then introduced to 10 severely ill patients.
Within 24 hours, their symptoms improved, the intensity of inflammation and viral load decreased, as well as increased oxygen saturation.
However, it is still necessary to propose that the method be applied to the public prior to specific therapy, which has not yet been carried out and which has not been explained.
In addition, due to the therapeutic effect, some plasma-related deficiencies should be carefully addressed.
For example, antibodies may excessively stimulate the immune system and cause cytokine emission syndrome, which, taking into account toxicity, poses a potential risk to life.
Blood antibody levels are usually low, and plasma is much needed to treat patients in critical conditions.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies quickly enough to combat the global epidemic.
Thus, it is more important and practical to allocate B-cells of healthy patients and to identify the genetic code of effective antibodies or to carry out screenings to find effective antibodies against critical virus proteins.
So we can immediately go to the mass production of the antidote.
The Chinese have used traditional medicine to treat various diseases.
However, its effectiveness depends to a large extent on the combination of many components of the formula, which differs depending on the diagnosis of the disease based on the theories of traditional Chinese medicine.
Most of the effective components are still unknown or have unspecified action, since the separation and verification of these components or their optimal combination seems difficult.
Because of the lack of effective specific therapy, COVID-19, traditional Chinese medicine has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate severity of symptoms or for patients who recover from severe disease.
For example, Shu Fen Zze Du capsules (Shu Feng Jie Du) and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules were found to be effective in the treatment of COVID-19.
The majority of cured patients with COVID-19 were reported in a number of provinces of China, where Chinese traditional medicine was used for treatment of 87 per cent of patients, including in Ghana (63.7%), Nancy (50 per cent) and Hunan (50 per cent), while in Hubei, where Chinese traditional medicine was used for treatment of only about 30 per cent of patients with COVID-19, the lowest rate of recovery (13 per cent) was recorded.
However, this is quite a rough comparison, as the assessment should take into account the number of other factors of influence, such as the number of patients and the severity of their disease.
On 18 February 2020, Mr. Boli Zhang (Boli Zhang) and his colleagues published research materials, which compared treatment exclusively with Western medicine and combined treatment with Western medicine and traditional Chinese medicine.
They found that the time limits for normalization of body temperature, removal of symptoms and hospital care were less felt in patients treated with a combination of Western and Chinese traditional medicine than in patients treated only by Western methods.
The most surprising fact is that the proportion of patients with worsening symptoms (from mild to severe) was noted below in the group treated by combining Western and Chinese traditional medicine with only Western therapy (7.4 per cent versus 46.2 per cent), and mortality in the first group was lower than in the second (8.8 per cent versus 39 per cent).
However, the effectiveness and safety of Chinese traditional medicine still require more closely controlled studies carried out in a larger and larger number of regions.
The specific interest is also to obtain, as far as possible, a description of the mechanism of action and an explanation of the aspects of the effectiveness of the components used in traditional Chinese medicine methodologies or their combination.
Patients suspected or confirmed of COVID-19 experience mainly severe fear of acute and even fatal illness, and quarantined people also experience nausea, loneliness and extreme irritation.
In addition, symptoms of infections such as nausea, hypoxia and cough, as well as side effects such as sleeplessness from corticosteroids, may cause even greater anxiety and psychological stress.
Early stages of the outbreak of the SARS virus have reported a number of psychiatric conditions, including chronic depression, increased anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor shocks, psychotic symptoms, delirium and even suicidal behaviour.
Compulsory monitoring of contacts and quarantine, among the measures taken by health authorities to prevent the COVID-19 epidemic, can increase people ' s concern and guilt about the spread of infection, quarantine and social glue to their families and friends.
Therefore, psychological and psychiatric assistance should be provided to patients with COVID-19, persons suspected and contacted, as well as to all others required.
Psychological support should build multi-profile mental support teams, provide clear information with regular and accurate updating of information on SARS-CoV-2 and treatment plans and use professional electronic devices and applications to avoid close personal contact.
Effective vaccines play an important role in stopping the transmission chain from vectors of infection and infected people to susceptible hosts and are often used in addition to anti-virus therapy to prevent new viruses.
Vaccines based on S-protein have been carried out to develop long-term and highly neutralizing antibodies and/or protective immunity to SARS-CoV.
Animal studies have produced live attenuated vaccines from SARS viruses.
However, prior to the start of clinical studies, the effectiveness of these possible vaccines should be determined in the natural environment when administered to elderly patients, the pattern of fatal dose infection and the level of protection against zoonotic virus infection.
Perhaps the reason is that SARS disappeared 17 years ago, and since then no new case has been reported.
At the same time, there are still sporadic cases and clusters of diseases caused by the Mers virus that occur in the Middle East and which spread in other regions through the conservation of zoonoses in endemic habitats.
Vaccination strategies were developed to combat MERS using inactivated virus, DNA plasma, virus vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and components of recombinant proteins, and some of these strategies were evaluated on animals.
The development of a safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine for persons with no immunity is an urgent and critical task that requires a solution to prevent the outbreak.
However, there are serious difficulties due to the long-term (average 18 months) necessary for the development of the vaccine and the dynamic removal of coroner viruses.
As a previously unknown disease, COVID-19 is only beginning to show a full picture of the clinical course of the disease among thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients are able to recover gradually without complications.
However, COVID-19, similar to SARS and MERS, is also associated with high frequency of complications and high mortality in patients with severe disease.
Therefore, it is critical for health authorities to establish a predictive model of disease in order to determine the priority of the measures they have taken, especially in areas where there is a shortage of resources.
Based on current clinical studies, the following factors may affect or be associated with the predictability of disease in patients with COVID-19 (Table 33):
Age: Age was the most important factor in predicting the flow of the SARS virus, which is also true in the case of COVID-19.
COVID-19 mainly affects patients from 30 to 65 years of age, 47.7 per cent of whom are over 50 years of age, according to the above-mentioned study 8 866 cases.
Patients requiring intensive therapy were more likely to have baseline diseases and complications and were significantly older than those who did not require such therapy (average 66 years versus 51 years), which showed that age was a predictive factor for patients with COVID-19.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 infection among men above women (0.31/100 000 versus 0.27/100 000), as mentioned above.
Sickness and complications: Patients with COVID-19 requiring intensive therapy are more likely to develop severe myocardial and arrhythmia.
Cardiological events were also the main cause of death in patients with SARS.
SARS-CoV-2 was also reported to be associated with ACE2-positive Holangiocytes, which could cause a liver failure in patients with COVID-19.
It should be noted that age and baseline diseases are closely intertwined and may harm the results.
Deviations found in laboratory studies: The level of C-reactive protein in the blood reflects the severity of the inflammatory process or tissue damage and is proposed to be considered as a potential predictive factor in the flow of the disease, the response to therapy and the final recovery.
It was also proposed to take into account the relationship between the level of C-reactive protein, the severity of the disease and the prognosis of COVID-19.
In addition, an increased level of lactate dehydrogenase, asparagine aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase and creatinine may be predicted.
These enzymes are excreted in large quantities by various organs, especially heart and liver, and they are released when tissue is damaged.
Therefore, they are traditionally markers of heart or liver dysfunction.
The main clinical symptoms: data from the X-ray of the breast cell and the development of clinical symptoms over time should be taken into account in order to predict the results and complications of COVID-19 treatment with other factors.
Use of steroids: as described above, steroids are immunosuppressants widely used in infectious diseases as additional therapy to reduce the severity of the inflammatory process.
Since corticosteroids have been widely used to treat patients with severe forms of SARS, many of the survivors have developed a vasculous osteonecrosis that causes life-threatening disability and low quality of life.
Therefore, where steroids are required for the treatment of patients with COVID-19, these products should be administered in small doses and short courses.
Psychological stress: As described above, many patients suffer from unexpected severe stress in the background of the COVID-19 epidemic, as they often have to endure long quarantine periods, deal with high uncertainty and monitor the deaths of their relatives and other patients.
To relieve the stress of such patients and help them return to normal life, psychological advice and long-term support must be provided.
According to current demographic studies, the COVID-19 epidemic appears to be different from the SARS epidemic.
In addition to replication in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2, as well as other coronal viruses that cause common cold diseases, can successfully reproduce in the upper respiratory tract and cause weak symptoms or not at all cause early infection symptoms.
For this reason, patients who have an early stage of disease or who have not yet completed the incubation period may, in their normal lives, spread the virus to a significant extent, which significantly hinders epidemiological control.
However, the transmission of SARS-CoV was considered to occur when patients were severely ill, but in most cases the infection did not occur early.
Thus, the COVID-19 epidemic today is much more serious than the SARS epidemic, and it is more difficult to control.
China is currently carrying out a great deal of work, announcing a general quarantine in Uhan and neighboring cities, and extending the quarantine regime to virtually the entire population, introduced to break down the SARS-CoV-2 virus chain.
While these measures have enormous economic and other aspects of the country ' s life, the number of new patients is decreasing, which means that the epidemic is slowing down.
The most optimistic estimates are that the outbreak of the disease will end in March and the period of silence will be extended from 3 to 4 months.
However, some experts are not so optimistic.
Mr. Paul Hunter (Paul Hunter) and his colleagues calculated that the outbreak of COVID-19, which was much more contagious than SARS, would not end in 2020.
Researchers from the team headed by Ira Longini (Ira Longini) made up a model for predicting the end of the epidemic and assumed that the SARS-CoV-2 virus could impact two thirds of the world ' s population.
The Group of Canadian Experts reported that SARS-CoV-2 was found in nose and throat shells taken in patients who had recovered and been discharged from hospitals two weeks earlier, indicating that the new virus could become a cyclical disease similar to influenza.
However, the reduction in the number of new cases in China is encouraging, indicating that the current strategy may have had an effect.
According to the initial estimates, Ebola’s disease had to strike up to a million people and cause the loss of half a million patients.
But severe quarantine and disease isolation have finally been controlled.
There is a likelihood that, like SARS-CoV, the infectious capacity of SARS-CoV-2 may weaken and will eventually disappear or become less pathogenic to the human being.
The following is a comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with the SARS and MERS epidemics (Figure 55).
The SARS-CoV-2 virus is characterized by high-speed transmission through cough or hive, and possibly by direct contact with contaminated materials.
The virus has also been found in the cage, which means that it is also possible to transmit orally.
According to one recent study, 41 per cent of 138 patients may have been infected in the hospital, including 17 patients with other previously identified diseases and 40 people with medical personnel.
Serious precautions should therefore be taken to protect the population, especially health workers, social workers, their relatives, colleagues and even side-to-side contacts with patients or infected persons.
The first line of defense in combating the risk of infection is wearing masks for the person; and surgical masks, and N95 respirators (Series No. 1860s) help control the spread of viruses.
Surgical masks do not give microcapillates fluids from potentially infected to fly into the air and sit on surfaces from which they can be transmitted to the surrounding environment.
However, only N95 (Series No. 1860s) can protect against the inhalation of viruses of 10 to 80 nm, they only skip 5 per cent of the viruses; SARS-CoV-2 virus of the same size as SARS-CoV, both of which are approximately 85 nm.
Since particles can penetrate even through five surgical masks together, medical personnel who contact patients directly must wear N95 masks (Series No. 1860s) rather than surgical masks.
In addition to masks, medical personnel should wear a protective compartment with a figure in order to further reduce the possibility of contact with viruses.
Viruses can also fall into the body through the eyes.
On 22 January 2020, the doctor infected SARS-CoV-2 despite wearing a N95 mask; perhaps the virus fell into his body through his burning eyes.
Therefore, medical personnel should also wear transparent face shields or closed-type protective eyes.
All populations in affected or potentially threatened regions are urged to wash their hands more frequently with disinfectant detergents, to avoid self-insulation and to limit contact with potentially infected people.
An acceptable distance to the patient is considered to be approximately one metre.
These measures effectively reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although the SARS-CoV-2 virus was not previously known to mankind, its high level of similarity to SARS-CoV, as reported on 7 January 2020, should have been an alarming signal for China, taking into account the experience it gained during the outbreak of SARS in 2003.
However, only after 19 January 2020 did the Director of the Centre for Disease Control at Uhanan reassure the citizens that the new virus had low contagion and limited reproducibility in the transfer from human to human and that prevention and control of disease would not be a problem.
This statement significantly reduced social tension, especially when the whole country was preparing to celebrate the New Year of China, and a critical time was lost when the disease could be kept within the limits of Mr. Uhan with minimal losses.
China ' s health authorities can adopt this harsh lesson and make significant improvements in the future.
For example, health authorities should: (1) make more careful public statements, since each word is taken into account by citizens and may affect their attitude and decisions; (2) monitor and respond more closely to unusual information from the clinic rather than expect official reports from doctors and officials; (3) take more determined measures to prevent a potential epidemic in the early stages of its development and not to calm the public; and (4) conduct more targeted and effective training to raise awareness of epidemic diseases and regular verification and improvement of the response system.
The outbreak of COVID-19 caused by previously unexplored coronation of severe type 2 severe respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) began at the end of December 2019.
Less than two months later, the disease covered China as a whole and spread in 50 countries around the world.
Since the virus is very similar to the coronation of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) and the symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to symptoms of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), a rash of COVID-19 has resulted in a feeling of reciprocity of SARS.
However, there are some significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS with regard to the prevention of the epidemic and the treatment of patients.
COVID-19 affects older people to a greater extent than young people and men to a greater extent than women; the proportion of serious cases and the level of mortality among older people is also higher than among young people.
Mortality resulting from SARS is higher than in the case of COVID-19 (10.91 per cent compared to 1.44 per cent).
Patients with COVID-19 spread the virus even when the disease is unsymptomatic, while patients with SARS usually get infected only in severe cases, thus preventing the spread of COVID-19 more difficult than SARS.
This partly explains why SARS-CoV-2 is spread much faster and wider than SARS-CoV.
Some patients with COVID-19 may have negative normal samples of SARS-CoV-2 RNA.
On the other hand, the treated patients can once again show positive samples of the virus.
All of this increases the risk of the spread of the virus.
In the light of such rapid progress, COVID-19 studies have not yet addressed some of the key issues, namely:
What is the origin of SARS-CoV-2?
Despite the detection of 96 per cent homologous between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-like coronary mice, we still cannot claim that SARS-CoV-2 infection has occurred from flying mice.
What animal became an intermediate species that transmitted the virus from the original host, such as flying mice, to man?
Without knowing the answers to the first and second questions, we cannot safely interrupt the transfer path, and the epidemiological situation can get worse at any time.
Modelling at the molecular level and biochemical samples demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 is linked to ACE2, but how exactly is the virus introduced into the respiratory tract cells and produced subsequent pathological changes?
Is the virus also linked to other ACE2 cells in other organs?
Without a clear answer to these questions, we cannot ensure a rapid and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the virus evolve genetically in the process of human transmission to humans?
Will it be the cause of the world pandemic, will it also disappear as SARS or will it periodically re-emerge as a flu?
These aspects are of paramount importance, but it will take time to find answers to these and many other issues.
However, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and return to normal life.
Zoonological origin of human coronation viruses
Mutation and adaptation have stimulated coronation of coroner viruses (COV) and their carriers, including people, over thousands of years.
Until 2003, two human coronation viruses (HCoVs) were known to cause mild disease, such as common cold.
The outbreaks of severe severe respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have changed our perception of how catastrophic and life-threatening human coronary disease can be.
The occurrence of a severe type 2 severe respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) in central China in late 2019 has again attracted the attention of the coroner and surprised us with high transmissibility, but less pronounced by the pathogen of the virus compared to the family SARS-CoV virus.
Human coronation is a zoonotic infection, and understanding of its zoonotic origin will be very useful.
Most human coroner viruses are derived from flying mice for which they are not pathogens.
There are also known intermediate reservoirs of some human coronation viruses.
The definition of animals directly affects the prevention of the spread of human diseases.
A study of the interaction of coroner animals can also shed light on the human coroner’s pathogen.
In this review, we present the available data on the seven human coroners, focusing on the history of their detection and their zoonological origin and methods of cross-sectional transmission.
It is important to note that we are comparing and comparing various human coronation viruses in terms of viral evolution and genomic recombination.
In this context, the present disease epidemic caused by the coronation virus found in 2019 (COVID-19) is also being addressed.
In addition, the conditions necessary for the successful exchange of carriers and the impact of the virus on the severity of the disease have been noted.
Coronaviridae belong to the Coronaviridae family, which is a group of shell viruses with a positive-polar chain of RNAs.
These viruses, with the largest of the RNA-containing viruses with a genome ranging from 26 to 32,000 nucleotides, have been named because of their form that reminds the crown when viewed under an electronic microscope.
From a structural point of view, coronal viruses contain unsegmentated genomes with an identical organization.
Approximately two thirds of the genome contains two large open partially covered accounting frameworks (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are transmitted to polyproteins of replicas pp1a and pp1ab.
These polyproteins are further reprocessed to generate 16 unstructured proteins marked nsp1~16.
The rest of the genome contains an open frame of account for structured proteins, including squirting protein (S), cloudy protein (E), membrane protein (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
A number of line-specific accessory proteins are also coded in other lines of coroner.
Based on the differences in the protein sequences\, the coronation viruses are divided into four species (alpha, beta, gamma and deltacoronaviruses), including most of the human coronation viruses and divided into four lines (A, B, C and D).
There is phylogenetic evidence that most alpha- and beta-coronaviruses are flying mice and rodents, while birds are the main reservoir for gamma- and delta-coronaviruses.
Over the thousands of years, coroner viruses have been constantly overcoming cross-sectional barriers, and some of them have evolved to be dangerous to human pathogens.
To this day, seven human coroners are known.
These include HCoV-229E and HCOV-NL63 human alphacoronaviruses.
The other five beta-coronaviruses include HCV-OC43, HCV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome type 2 SARS-CoV-2.
Human coronation viruses HCoV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms such as cold and/or diarrhoea.
Unlike these, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the recently detected SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, causing severe infections of the lower respiratory tract in a relatively higher number of patients with a higher likelihood of acute respiratory disease (RAS) and emergency symptoms.
The first human coronary virus HCoV-229E, B814, was derived from a sample of patients who had a cold in the 1960s.
Since then, extensive studies have provided more detailed information on HCOV-229E and HCOV-OC43 viruses that cause local infection symptoms.
Indeed, prior to the outbreak of severe severe respiratory syndrome (SARS), there was a generally accepted concept that the human coronary infection was generally considered harmless.
The outbreak of SARS in 2003 was one of the most catastrophic epidemics in the current history; more than 8,000 people had died and the overall mortality rate was approximately 10%.
Ten years later the outbreak of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) led to a long epidemic in the Arabian peninsula, with the disease spreading sporadicly in the rest of the world.
The new human coronation virus found in 2019 (2019-nCoV), which was subsequently renamed SARS-CoV-2, is the cause of the current epidemic of coronation 2019 (COVID-19), which resulted in more than 3,120 lives as at 3 March 2020, and the number of people infected exceeds 91,000.
An alarming signal was received, and the world had to prepare for the upcoming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All seven human coroners have zoonose origin, and are sources of flies, mice, or pets.
Many data sets demonstrate the evolutional nature of all human coronation viruses from flying mice to which viruses have been well adapted and do not exhibit pathogens, but demonstrate a wide variety of genetics.
The COVID-19 epidemic has raised serious medical, scientific, social and moral challenges for China and the world.
A study of the zoonological mechanism of the origin of human coronation viruses will enable them to understand their natural history, the driving forces of their evolution, and the factors that limit their intermodal transfer.
It may also indicate or accelerate the search for a reservoir, an intermediate and amplification carrier SARS-CoV-2, which is very important to prevent the recurrence of the disease in the future.
This review contains general information on the zonomic origin, transmissibility and pathogens of human coronal viruses.
In particular, we refer to and consider the following general feature: baseline viruses, from which human coronation viruses have occurred, are not usually pathogens for their reservoir carriers, but acquire pathogens after the intermodal transfer to the new carrier.
We are also analysing the trend of the evolution of human coronation viruses, which is often accompanied by a weakening of pathogens.
In the same context, the current outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 is also being considered.
The animal coronaviruses have been known since the late 1930s.
Before the B814 strain of the HCoV-229E virus was first obtained from a sample of patients with cold disease, different coronal viruses were present in various infected animals, including Indians, mice, cows, pigs, cats and dogs.
Seven human coroners have been identified in recent decades.
Table 1 provides a brief history of the detection of human coronation viruses in chronological order.
The first strain of the HCoV-229E virus was obtained from samples taken from respiratory pathways of patients with infection of the upper respiratory pathways in 1966; the virus was then adapted to the reproduction of WI-38 leg cells.
Patients infected with HCV-229E experienced cold symptoms, including major pain, chills, general inability and throat pain, with high temperature and cough observed in 10-20% of cases.
Later, in 1967, the HCV-OC43 virus was removed from the organic culture and subsequent serial passage into the brain of mice.
The clinical signs of HCV-OC43 infection are similar to those of HCV-229E, whose symptoms are inseparable from those of other respiratory pathogens, such as influenza A and rhinoviruses.
Both the HCV-229E virus and the HCV-OC43 virus are widely distributed in the world and are usually transmitted in moderate ranges in winter.
The main incubation period of these two viruses takes less than a week and is followed by approximately two weeks of disease.
According to a study in volunteers, healthy people infected with HCoV-229E developed a simple easy-form cold.
Only a few patients with reduced immunity had severe infections of the lower respiratory tract.
The outbreak of SARS, also known as the Atypical Pneumonia epidemic, was the first in the history of humanity to be the well-documented pandemic caused by human coronation, and the cause of the disease was the SARS-CoV virus, a third of the human coronation virus detected.
The first case of SARS was detected at the end of 2002 in the Chinese province of Guandun.
During the SARS epidemic, 8,096 cases of disease and 774 deaths were documented and the disease spread in many countries and on different continents.
Regardless of the overactive agents, it was estimated that each patient could be infected by about two more people; the incubation period was 4 to 7 days and the virus load peak was 10 hours.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially experienced muscle pain, headache, high temperature, general insufficiency and swelling, and later symptoms include recovery, cough and respiratory failure.
Widespread laboratory deviations from SARS are lymphopenia, liver abnormalities and increased creatinine.
Patients with SARS also experience diffuse alveolar damage, epithelial cell proliferation and increased macrophages.
Approximately 20-30% of patients subsequently need intensive therapy and mechanical ventilation.
In such severe cases, in addition to the lower respiratory tract, other organs, including gastrointestinal tract organs, liver and faeces, may also be infected, which are usually accompanied by a cytokine storm, which may be fatal, especially for patients with impaired immunity.
For the first time, the virus was removed from the open biopsy of the sick relative who arrived in Hong Kong from Guanchou.
Since then, enormous efforts have been made to investigate human coronation viruses.
At the end of 2004, HCV-NL63 was allocated to a 7-month child from the Netherlands.
Initially, it was found that it mainly affects children of younger age, elderly people and patients with impaired immunity and respiratory disease.
For HCV-NL63-induced diseases, there are such manifestations as snorkel, conjunctivitis, high temperature and bronchiolitis.
Another independent study describes the elimination of the same virus from the sexual material taken by an 8-month-old male from the Netherlands who suffers from pneumonia.
The virus was found in the Netherlands, but it actually spreads everywhere.
It is estimated that HCoV-NL63 is the cause of approximately 4.7 per cent of widespread respiratory diseases, and the peaks of their diseases are due to early summer, spring and winter.
HCV-NL63 is linked to an obstructive laryngitis, which is also called a troupe.
HCOV-HKU1 was allocated to Hong Kong in the same year from a 71-year-old man hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolitis.
In addition to in-patient pneumonia and bronchiolitis, HCV-HKU1 is associated with aggravation of asthmatic diseases.
Similarly, HCV-NL63, HCV-229E and HCV-OC43, HCV-HKU1, which causes respiratory diseases in mild form, have been detected worldwide.
All four human coronation viruses that cause infective infections have been well adapted to people and their mutations, resulting in highly pathogenic diseases, are usually unlikely, although their causes were unknown, as in a rare case with a more virulent HCOV-NL63 subtype, which, according to recent reports, has caused a serious infection of the lower respiratory pathways in China.
Normally, by acquiring the ability to transmit and maintain effectively in the human body, these human coronary viruses become less virulent or pathogenic.
For the first time in 2012, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) was administered in Saudi Arabia from a mild 60-year-old patient with acute pneumonia and an unexpected deficiency.
Most of the confirmed cases occurred in the Middle East, but in various European countries and Tunisia there have been traffic accidents and outbreaks of second-hand infections in close contact.
Another second flash with 186 confirmed cases occurred in South Korea in 2015.
Clinical manifestations of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) remind of symptoms of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) — both infections are characterised by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS have also developed severe unexpected deficiencies, which still distinguishes MERS from other human coronary diseases.
More than 30 per cent of patients experience gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhoea and vomiting.
As of 14 February 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory confirmed cases of high mortality respiratory syndrome in the Middle East (34.4%) have been registered, and MERS-CoV is therefore considered one of the most known deadly viruses.
From mid to late December 2019, in the Chinese province of Uhan, Hubei, there have been patient clusters with pneumonia, which are now being examined in the past, related to the infection caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome type 2 coronary syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
The World Health Organization has announced that the continuing outbreak of respiratory infections caused by SARS-CoV-2 is a global public health emergency and that the disease itself has received the title “Kornavirus infection 19” (COVID-19).
As at 3 March 2020, 90,053 confirmed cases were registered worldwide, with mortality at approximately 3.4%.
It should be noted that death in the Chinese province of Hubei is 4.2 per cent and 1.2 per cent abroad.
SARS-CoV-2, such as SARS and MERS, causes severe respiratory infection, characterized by fever, cough and swelling.
Some patients also experience diarrhoea.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and is able to rapidly get into severe respiratory failure syndrome.
Despite the similarities between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, taking into account the high homology of the nucleotide sequences (82%), these viruses, however, form different branches of the phylogenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 is obviously less pathogenic but has greater transmission capacity compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Cases of unsymptomised SARS-CoV-2 have been reported, which shows the ability of the virus to spread rapidly worldwide.
The comparison and comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with the other six human coroner viruses reveal important similarities and differences.
First, the transmission of coronation viruses has a similar incubation period and the duration of the disease they cause.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 demonstrates the same trend as the other six human coroner viruses.
Secondly, according to the severity of COVID-19 symptoms, there are between SARS-CoV and four human coronation viruses causing infective infections (e.g. HCV-229E, HCV-OC43, HCV-HKU1 and HCV-NL63).
On the one hand, the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection is similar to that most frequently seen in human coronation viruses causing infective infections, including non-specific manifestations, mild symptoms or even lack of symptoms.
On the other hand, as with SARS-CoV infection, a small subset of the serious cases of COVID-19 can be allocated, although the ratio below is a little lower.
Thirdly, the SARS-CoV-2 transfer also notes interesting legislation for both human coronation viruses causing infective infections and for SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as human coronation viruses that cause infective infections.
On the other hand, it is still to be checked whether SARS-CoV-2 transmission is reduced with each subsequent virus transition (i.e. infection of each person), as in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, like other human coronation viruses that cause infective infections, SARS-CoV-2 can be found in the cervical samples.
We still have to answer the question of whether the faecal oral route of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is as important (at least in some circumstances) as in the case of SARS-CoV.
The question of the possible seasonality of SARS-CoV-2 is also of particular interest to human coronal viruses that cause infective infections.
However, the future development of the continuing outbreak of COVID-19 will depend on the features of SARS-CoV-2, including transmission, pathogen and sustainable distribution after the transition.
All four human coroners that cause in-patient infections with mild-forming symptoms have been well adapted to people.
On the other hand, these people may well have adapted to these four human coronations.
In other words, both those and others could be called the only survivors after the pandemics of human coronal viruses in the past.
Human coronation viruses that cause serious diseases in humans and people with human coronation that cause serious diseases simply did not survive.
In order to do so, human coroner viruses must be replicated in the human body to the extent necessary to ensure that adaptive mutations are collected that are contrary to the carrier ' s control factors.
In this sense, the longer the explosion of SARS-CoV-2 and the more people will be infected, the more likely the virus will be fully adapted to man.
If it is well adapted, its transmission to people will be difficult to stop with quarantine or other disease control activities.
For many years, four in-patient coronation viruses have been circulating among the population, causing a common cold in people with healthy immunity.
These viruses do not require an animal reservoir.
Highly qualified SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV coronation viruses have not been properly adapted to man and can not be transmitted to humans.
They need to maintain and reproduce in their zoonic reservoirs and seek to reach acceptable human targets, possibly through one or more intermediate or amplifying carriers.
SARS-CoV-2 has features similar to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four HCOV infective viruses.
It is very easy to pass on as a hospitalized HCV, at least at the present time.
But he's more pathogen than in-patient HCV and less pathogen than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether it is fully adapted to man and whether it will circulate in the human environment without a reservoir or with an intermediate animal carrier.
Before discussing the animal origin of HCoV viruses, we will be useful in discussing the definitions and characteristics of the evolutionary, natural, intermediate, strengthening and reservoir carriers of HCOV viruses.
The animal is the evolutionary carrier of HCoV if it carries a closely related ancestor with the same high homology at the order of the nucleotide.
The anterior virus is usually well-adapted and unpathogenic in this carrier.
Similarly, the tanker carries HCoV continuously for a long time.
In both cases, carriers are naturally infected and are natural carriers of HCoV or its parental virus.
Unlike that, if HCoV was only inserted into the intermediate carrier right before or about the time it was taken, it was not well adapted to the new carrier and was often pathogen.
This intermediate carrier may serve as a zoonotic source of human infection and play the role of an aggravator, allowing the virus to be replicated and then transmitted to humans, increasing the level of human infection.
HcoV may carry a batic infection if it is unable to hold the transfer within the intermediate carrier.
On the contrary, HCoV viruses can also adapt to the intermediate carrier and even establish long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate carrier shall become a natural reservoir carrier.
Epidemiological data have shown retrospectively that a zero SARS patient has had a history of contact with hunting and fishing animals.
Further seroprevalence studies have shown that animal traffickers have a higher prevalence of IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV than the population as a whole.
The Himalayans (Paguma larvata) and the one-sided dog in the live animal markets have become the first established vectors of viruses similar to and almost identical to SARS-CoV.
This was explicitly confirmed by the fact that, following the destruction of all civilians in markets, SARS cases were no longer reported.
At the same time, it was reported that the Himalayan civilians living in the wild or on farms and not entering the market had not been determined in most cases by SARS-CoV, which led to the conclusion that the Himalayan civilians could serve only as an intermediate carrier rather than as a natural reservoir of SARS-CoV.
Significantly, since 80 per cent of the various animals on the Guanchou markets have antibodies to SARS-CoV, it cannot be excluded that intermediate enhancers can also serve numerous types of small dairy producers.
They all seem to be stupid carriers of the SARS-CoV virus.
The next search for the natural animal carrier SARS-CoV identified a nearby CoV of flying mice, which has been called the Atypical Pneumonia Coronavirus of HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3) and which is present in Chinese flying mice.
These mice are positive for SARS-CoV antibodies and the genomic sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
These and other flying mice have the same homology of nucleotide sequences as SARS-CoV.
These studies have laid the foundation for a new concept that flyers have become carriers of new human pathogens.
Flying mice also detected several SARS-like coronal viruses (SL-CoVs), but none of them, except one, which denotes WIV1, cannot be isolated as a live virus.
It is known that SARS-CoV is a human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor.
It was shown that WIV1, obtained from the sample of flying mouse faecals, uses ACE2 flying mice, civilians and humans as a receptor for entering the cell.
It's curious that savories of healing patients with SARS could neutralize WIV1.
To date, WIV1 represents the closest relative of SARS-CoV in flying mice, dividing 95% of the homology of nucleotide sequences.
Despite the high homology between these two viruses, it is generally considered that WIV1 is not a direct parental SARS-CoV virus and that flying mice are not a direct reservoir carrier of SARS-CoV.
Philogenetic analysis refers to the same group as both CoV-HKU4 and CoV-HKU5.
CoV-HKU4 flies and MERS-CoV use the same receiver, dipeptil dipeptidedase-4 (DPP4), to penetrate viruses.
The sequence of the MERS-CoV-dependent MERS-CoV polymerase RNA is philosophically closer to the sequences of beta-coronaviruses detected in Europe and Africa.
So far, wild mice haven't found a live Mers-CoV virus.
The homologous nucleotide sequences of MERS-CoV and its closest relative CoV-HKU25 of flying mice are only 87%.
That is, flying mice could not be the direct reservoir carrier of the Mers-CoV virus.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that monomer camels are seropositive to neutralizing antibodies, specific to MERS-CoV, as well as those of Middle East origin in many African countries.
The live Mers-CoV, the same virus detected in humans, has been removed from the male male vertebrae, which further confirms the role of the vertebrae as the true reservoir carriers of Mers-CoV.
It should also be noted that vertebrates that have been experimentally infected with MERS-CoV have had minor symptoms, but massive virus distribution.
Significantly, infected females have not only given the virus a respiratory route but also a faecal oral route, which is also the main route of the virus in flying mice.
However, there are still issues as many confirmed cases of the Middle East respiratory syndrome have not been in the history of contact with camels before the onset of symptoms and are likely to relate to the transfer of human beings or the transfer of unknown channels, including unidentified species of animals that are carriers of MERS-CoV.
The SARS-CoV-2 nucleotide homology of 96.2% coincides with CoV RaTG13 flying mice assigned to the Asian subsoil Rhinolophus affinis.
As with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the differentiation of the sequences between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too large to attribute parental relationships to them.
That is, flying mice could or would not be the direct reservoir carrier of SARS-CoV-2 unless almost the same coronation of flying mice is found in the future.
The direct carriers of the SARS-CoV-2 virus are supposed to be among the wild species sold and killed on the arable arable land market, with many of the initial cases of COVID-19, which indicates the likely case of transmission from an animal.
A few recent studies based on metagenomie sequencing found that the group at risk of the destruction of small dairy animals known as pangoline (Manis javanica) was also able to carry the parent beta-coronavirus, a family member of SARS-CoV-2.
The homology of the sequences of these new pangoline coronavirus genes by 85-92% coincides with SARS-CoV-2.
But they are also closely related to RaTG13, with the identity of the nucleotide sequences being about 90 per cent.
They are classified in two sub-differences of viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 in a phylogenetic tree, one of which has a receptor bound domain (RSD) closer to SARS-CoV-2 with a 97.4% amino acid sequence.
On the contrary, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are more divergent, despite the higher degree of sequence homology throughout the genome.
The earlier study of pangolins also reported the identification of virus contaminants in light samples, which were similarly related to SARS-CoV-2.
Other methods of collection and manual treatment were used to obtain a sequence of genomics, which included about 86.3% of the full-sized viral genome.
It cannot be excluded that Pangoline has become one of the intermediate carriers of SARS-CoV-2.
However, due to the differentiation between SARS-CoV-2 and the pangoline beta-coronaviruses related to SARS-CoV-2, there is currently no evidence to support the direct origin of SARS-CoV-2 from pangoline.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even shorter than between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-coronavirus pangoline related to SARS-CoV-2.
The SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary path for flying mice, pangolins and other dairy producers has not yet been established.
While the highest sequential homology was found in RSD between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-coronavirus pangoline relatives SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 were the highest sequential homology throughout the genome.
Very theoretically, the high level of similarity between pangoline beta-corrosive viruses, relatives SARS-CoV-2, and SARS-CoV-2 is related to parallel evolution through selectivity.
The opposite proposal advocates the recombination between the Pangoline beta-kronavirus, the family SARS-CoV-2, and RaTG13 in the third species of wild animals.
As the driving force of evolution, the recombination is widely distributed among beta-coronaviruses.
There is still no final decision on the direct zootic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCV viruses, zoonotic origin of HCV-229E, HCV-OC43, HCV-NL63 and HCV-HKU1 viruses is also studied.
Philogenetic evidence shows that both HCoV-NL63 and HcoV-229E can be derived from the coronation viruses of flying mice, while parental viruses of HCOV-OC43 and HCOV-HKU1 strains are detected in rodents.
The ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) and the North American tricolor nebula were reported to be demonstrating a close relationship with HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E is genetically related to another flying mouse coronation called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was found in Ghana, although there was a suspicion that it could be an intermediate carrier.
For the sake of clarity, modern knowledge of the animal origin of known coroner viruses is summarised in Figure 1 and Table 2.
The phylogenetic analysis provided evidence of the events of HCoV transverse transmission in history.
When the HCOV-OC43 virus was interdependent and humans were infected with domestic animals in 1890, a pandemic of respiratory infection was registered.
The history of the cross-sectional transmission of HCV-229E is not so clear.
Flying mouse alpha-koronaviruses, HCoV-229E have been found.
Among them is the alpaca alphakronavirus.
Some data support direct transmission of the virus from flying mice to humans.
First, it was people, not alpines, who could contact flying mice in a common environmental niche.
At the same time, people are in close contact with the Alps.
Secondly, alpha-coronaviruses of flying mice, family HCoV-229E, are diverse and non-pathogenic in flying mice, while alpha-coronavirus alpaki has caused respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alpaconavirus has not been found in wild animals.
Thus, it cannot be excluded that the alpines have received alphacoronavirus, a family HCOV-229E, from humans.
Indeed, flies are a direct source of pathogen human viruses, including the virus of being, the Ebola virus, the Nipah virus and the Hendra virus.
It is not surprising, therefore, that flying mice could directly transmit HCoV-229E to humans.
On the other hand, while flying mouse alphacoronaviruses could serve with the HPov-229E gene pool, alpines and unicorns could become intermediate carriers that transmit viruses to humans, just as in the case of the MERS-CoV virus.
Mers-CoV is an excellent example of inter-viewal transmissions from flying mice to single-armed camels and from single-armed camels to man.
The evolutional origin of the Mers-CoV virus from flying mice is known by its initial identification and has been confirmed by subsequent studies.
It is evident that mice provide a rich pool of virus varieties for the cross-sectional exchange of gene fragments and cross-sectional transmissions.
Longevity, densely populated colonies, close social interaction and ability to fly make flying mice “ideal distributors”.
On the other hand, the Mers-CoV virus was introduced to single-armed camels decades ago.
He was well adapted to those camels that had become a stable and natural tanker from the intermediate carrier.
These animals have a very mild disease and have a relatively low frequency of mutations.
Its episodic transfer to man is a coincidence, and the person remains the silent carrier of MERS-CoV, since its transfer is not supported.
Unlike the role of camels in the transfer of MERS-CoV, the role of the Pangolins, if any, in the transfer of SARS-CoV-2 is different.
In particular, the pangoline beta-kronaviruses are highly pathogenic to pangolins.
They can be stupid carriers of beta-coronaviruses related to SARS-CoV-2, as well as civilians in the case of SARS-CoV.
Future studies should confirm or exclude several possibilities for the cross-sectional transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals.
First, flies can be a reservoir for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, almost identical SARS-CoV-2.
People can share an ecological niche with flying mice through the cultivator or the section of the pet’s toes.
Secondly, Pangolins may be one of the intermediate carriers in which the SARS-CoV-2 virus has recently been found.
People are infected with the virus through the passage of showers and the use of meat from wild animals.
Many animals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
The survey of domestic and wild animals on antibodies is justified.
Third, as indicated above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 could occur in a third form, which had been in contact with both flying mice and pangoline.
The search for animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 continues.
In addition to different types of animal carriers, three main factors from the viruses also contributed to cross-border barriers.
First of all, they are relatively high-speed mutations in RNA replication.
Compared to other viruses with a single RNA, the calculated frequency of coronary mutations can be considered “moderately high” with an average rate of about 10-4 replacements per year in one section 2 depending on the phase of adaptation of the coronary virus to new owners.
Coronaviruses have a correction of exoribonuclease, which removes it with an extremely high rate of mutation and weakness or even inability.
Interestingly, Remdesivir's nucleotide analogue exoribonuclease and RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase inhibit coronavirus replication.
Remdesiver is one of the most promising means against SARS-CoV-2 to be tested in clinical trials.
However, the frequency of coronary mutations almost a million times higher than their carriers.
In addition, the rate of mutation may often be even higher if coronation viruses are not well adapted to the carrier.
Compared to SARS-CoV with a high frequency of mutation, the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 mutations is shown below, which shows a higher level of adaptation to humans.
This virus is supposed to have been adapted to another carrier close to the human being.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to single-armed camels.
It is theoretically unlikely that vaccines and antivirals from SARS-CoV-2 will rapidly lose effectiveness as a result of genetic drift.
Secondly, the large gene of coronary RNAs increases the plasticity of genomic modification in mutations and recombination, thus increasing the likelihood of interstitial coexistence that is conducive to the emergence of new coronary viruses under appropriate conditions.
This is facilitated by numerous unique open frameworks and functions of proteins encoded in the direction of 3′-end of the genome.
Thirdly, thanks to the unique mechanism of choice of the matrix, coroner viruses randomly and frequently switch the matrix during RNA replication.
During the transcription of the coronary DNA in the carrier, which serves as a mixing vessel, a switch is often made.
High-genomic full-sized and sub-genomie RNAs can recombinate and create new coronary viruses.
Philogenetic evidence of natural recombination has been found in both HCV-HKU1 and HCV-OC43 and in animal coronation viruses, such as SL-COV and batCoV-HKU9 flying mice.
Reciprocal transmission virus interaction
In addition to the three virus factors mentioned above, the interaction of the virus with the carrier receptor is another key factor important for intermodal transmission.
In this article, as a typical example, which also shows evidence of positive selection in the event of an intermodal transfer, is the recombination of SARS-CoV.
Based on a comparative analysis between human SARS-CoV strains and civilians it is considered that SARS-CoV is being quickly adapted in different carriers, especially with regard to RSD protein mutations.
In general, the RSD protein S of the crown virus interacts with the cellular receptor and the carrier's antibody response is intensively picked up.
SARS-CoV RSD is the amino acids, with 318th to 510th, on the S1 segment, which binds to the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (APF2) and its receptors to the cell.
The SARS-CoV virus RSD is capable of identifying the APF2 receptors of different animals, including mice, shells, mice and enovisible dogs, making it possible to transmit the virus.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues were found in the RSD, which are different from human viral strains and civettes, 4 of which are in the receptor-binding motive for interaction with the APF2 receptor.
SARS-CoV civets have K479N and S487T mutations in the RSD, which may increase the affinity of the viscous protein interaction with the human APF2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acids may be particularly important for the adaptation of the virus to humans.
It should be noted that SARS-CoV-2 has the same cellular receptor as SARS-CoV.
The 30 per cent difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in S1 protein S segment suggests that the binding affinity of S protein to human APF2 may have changed.
Indeed, a study using a cryoelectronic microscope says that the affinity of this relationship is 10-20 times higher than between APF2 humans and SARS-CoV S protein.
It would also be interesting to determine whether any other receivers are required for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
It is surprising that HCV-NL63 is also associated with APF2, but with another segment of protein S.
There are many other HCV receptors, such as aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E and 9-O-acetylsylic acid for HCOV-OC43.
They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of these coronation viruses in humans after the intermodal transmission of animals.
In addition to cellular receptors, the outcome of the HCOV transverse transfer is also managed by other factors of the carrier ' s dependence and limitation.
The differentiation of these proteins between humans and the natural reservoirs of HCoVs, such as flying mice, vertebrates and rodents, may constitute a barrier to cross-sectional transmission.
For successful cross-sectional transmission to HCoV viruses, it is necessary to absorb dependency factors and to subject yourself to carrier restrictions.
In this regard, molecular determinants in this important area of interaction between the virus and the carrier still need to be identified and categorized.
Good results can result in an impartial full-faced screening of the dependency and restraint factors for SARS-CoV-2 with the latest CRISPR technology.
New HCV: Back to zero
The diversity of the coronation viruses of flying mice provides ample opportunities for the emergence of new HCVs.
In this sense, flying mouse coroners serve as a genetic pulse for HCoV.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination are also driven by the evolution of HCOV and serve as two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein-coding genes has the potential to radically modify virus phenotypes.
Among SARS-CoV accessory proteins, ORF8 is considered important for adaptation to humans, since the virus of flying mice, the family SARS-CoV, has been isolated, but it has been found that they encode ORF8 different proteins.
The strains isolated at the start of the human epidemic have found a 29-nucleotide derivative characteristic of SARS-CoV.
This branch divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is considered as an adaptive mutation that accelerates the exchange of carriers.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a history of possible recombinations with alpha- and gamma-coronavirus lines, where a large number of smaller recombinant sites were identified in the RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase.
Recombination localizations were also identified in non-structural proteins nsp9, most nsp10 and parts nsp14.
Similarly, it was shown that the epidemic MERS-CoV had undergone recombinant events between the various lines, which occurred in a number of camels in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombinant events were also observed in other HCVs where HCoV was recombined with other animal coronation viruses in their non-structural genes.
It is also necessary to warn that artificial selection can contribute to accidental changes in virus genomes, which is likely to result in the release of the virus from the selected pressures, for example by the immune carrier system.
An example of such effects is the loss of full-sized ORF4 in the prototype strain of HCoV-229E due to a biclotide effect.
While the ORF4 intactive open-ended framework can be observed in mice and camels related to HCoV-229E, alphacoronavirus alpaki demonstrates a single-nucleotide cartridge, which leads to a move in the frame.
Finally, the evolution of new HCV is also due to the pressure of selection on their reservoir carriers.
In case of coronation of flying mice, weak or absent symptoms have been reported, which suggests mutual adaptation between coronation and flying mice.
It turns out that flies are anatomically and physiologically well adapted to coronary viruses.
For example, failure to activate the inflammatory response in flying mice effectively reduces the pathology caused by the coronation virus.
In addition, the natural activity of bat cell killers is suppressed by the inhibitor receptor of NKG2/CD94 and the low level of expression of the major class I density complex.
Moreover, a high level of active forms of oxygen, which is provided by the metabolic activity of flying mice, can suppress the replication of the coronation virus, while affecting exeribonuclease, thus creating the selection pressure for the generation of strains of the virus that are highly pathogenic when entering the new carrier.
More pathogenic strains of the coroner may also evolve as a result of the recombination, resulting in the acquisition of new proteins or protein properties to adapt the carrier.
Thus, it is not a coincidence that in the last twenty years three new human coronation viruses have appeared.
Coronaviruses are non-pathogenic or cause mild symptoms in their reservoirs, such as flying mice or camels.
They must be replicated without causing a strong immune response to the carrier.
This is the secret why we see unsympathetic carriers and what causes serious cases of human infection.
Severe symptoms are mainly related to immune response hyperactivity and cytokine storm, where the stronger the immune response, the more severe the impact of mild.
On the contrary, unsymptomised carriers do not have an immune response associated with a coronavirus reaction.
The same immune response strategy may have beneficial effects on treatment against SARS-CoV-2.
Flying mice have a particularly strong interferon response.
Thus, the acceptance of type I interferon must have at least a positive effect on humans during the initial phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
In addition, the activation of NLRP3-inflammasomas has been disrupted by flying mice.
Based on this, inhibition of NLRP3-inflammatory drug using MCC950 may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 is followed by a common scheme that has led to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
While beta-coronavirus was found in flying mice, the 95% nucleotide homology of which coincides with SARS-CoV, the 96% nucleotide homology of which also coincides with SARS-CoV-2.
Although it was found that civilians and other animals on the market carried viruses, the same SARS-CoVs were not directly detected for SARS-CoV-2.
Pangoline beta-coronaviruses were detected, strikingly homological SARS-CoV-2, which says that pangolines could serve as one of the intermediate carriers, or that fragments of the pangoline beta-coronavirus genes could enter the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Despite the remaining issues, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was deliberately or accidentally created by man.
Coronaviruses have attracted general attention due to the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
The study of coronation viruses in flying mice and other animals has radically changed our perception of the importance of zoonological origin and HCOV animal reservoirs in human transmission.
Convinced evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 come from flying mice and have been transmitted to man through intermediate carriers.
If SARS-CoV infection occurred from contact between people and civilians in the markets, the closure of wild markets and the destruction of civilians could effectively put an end to the SARS epidemic.
For the same reason, in the light of the opening of the various lines of the Beneficial SARS-CoV-2 betacoronaviruses, pangoline should be removed in order to prevent the zootic transmission of infections from the product markets.
However, whether SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to a person through pangolins and other dairy products and how this can be done remains the task of future studies.
On the other hand, the Mers-CoV virus has existed for a long time in unicorns.
These camels serve as an important vehicle, as well as as the main source of meat, milk, hides and articles of shear for the local population.
They are widely distributed in the Middle East and in Africa.
It is therefore not possible to contribute all camels for control of MERS, as was done on Chinese wildlife markets to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
In order to stop periodic outbreaks of MERS, an integrated approach should be taken to develop an effective vaccine against MERS-CoV for camels in combination with other measures of infection control.
Since we cannot eliminate these viruses, new genotypes can occur that cause the outbreaks of the disease.
The world is surrounded by various zoonotic coronation viruses.
In particular, the coronation of flying mice with zoonological potential is extremely diverse.
There is a huge number of opportunities for the evolution and recombination of these zoonological coronation viruses, which will in the future lead to new coronation viruses that are more easily transmitted and/or more lethal to humans.
In order to reduce excessive contact between humans and animals, the culture of the use of wild animals in some areas of China should be discontinued.
After severe tests such as SARS, MERS and COVID-19, better preparedness and response plan are needed.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their natural reservoirs until new territories are seized.
While many features of flying mice are beneficial for the spread of viruses, if people are to be kept away from them, the likelihood of human contact with flying mice and other wild animals can be minimized.
In order to better understand the environment of coroner viruses and their natural carriers, continuous epidemiological surveillance of lactating organisms is needed, which will be useful to prevent the transmission of coroner viruses from animals and future outbreaks of diseases.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonoses is to keep people away from the natural habitats of zoonoses.
Some fragments are still missing in the head of the SARS-CoV-2 zoonose.
First of all, if the flies were transmitted to the previous SARS-CoV-2 pangoline virus, it is interesting to see under what circumstances the flies and pangoline divide the same environmental niche.
Secondly, if flying mice play a more direct role in human transmission, it is necessary to determine how people have come into contact with flying mice.
Thirdly, if the role of a true intermediate carrier is to be played by the third milk producer, it must be ascertained how it interacts with different species, including humans, flying mice and pangolins.
Finally, since many dairy animals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both epidemiological surveillance and experimental infection should be carried out.
Whether it is a flying mouse, pangoline or any other lactating creature, it is expected that in the future SARS-CoV-2 or its precursors will be identified by their natural carriers.
Further research in this area will shed light on the evolutionary path of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, which will have important consequences for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
It is necessary to update the diagnostic criteria for “sudden cases of disease” and “confirmed cases” COVID-19
On 6 February 2020, our group published a short background guide on the diagnosis and treatment of the new coronary infection 2019 (2019-nCoV), which contains information on our experiences and reliable recommendations to combat this pandemic worldwide.
However, coronary infection 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, so our understanding and knowledge have been gradually increased based on current results of studies and clinical experience; therefore, the diagnostic strategy and therapeutic practice have also been continuously updated.
In this letter, we responded to one comment on our recommendations and introduced the latest diagnostic criteria for “sudden cases of disease” and “confirmed cases” in accordance with the paper “Recommendations on Diagnostics and Therapy for COVID-19” (seventh version) issued by the National Committee on Health of the PRC.
In December 2019 there was a outbreak of the new coroner virus 2019 (2019-nCoV), which was now officially named coroner infection 2019 (COVID-19), and the virus itself was called “a severe acute respiratory syndrome 2” (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO qualified COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In order to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our group developed a short background guide and published it on the website of Military Medical Research on 6 February 2020.
This publication drew great attention to itself.
We note, however, that COVID-19 is a new disease, so our understanding and knowledge have gradually increased based on current research and clinical experience; thus, the diagnostic strategy and therapeutic practice have also been continuously updated.
For example, from 16 January to 3 March 2020, seven issues of the document “Diagnosis and Therapy Recommendations for COVID-19”, published by the National Committee on Health of the PRC (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), were published, and the content of some of its provisions changed significantly.
Recently, comments on our recommendations were made in the work of Zhou (Zhou), which contained simple diagnostic proposals based on existing clinical experience.
This work has added new practical evidence to our recommendations and has provided valuable background information on this global pandemic.
We reaffirm the importance of their work and express our gratitude.
However, according to the latest issue of “Recommendations on Diagnostics and Therapy for COVID-19” (test seventh version) and the results of ongoing studies, and their work needs to be updated.
In accordance with the seventh issue of this document (from 3 March 2020) for a comprehensive analysis of the case of suspected disease, one element of the epidemiological history must be combined with two clinical manifestations of the disease:
Epidemiological history: (1) the history of movements or locations in and around Uhan or other human settlements where cases of COVID-19 disease have been registered for 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (2) the history of contacts with patients with SARS-CoV-2 (with a positive test based on nucleic acid); (3) the history of contact with patients with high temperature or respiratory symptoms from Uhan and its surroundings or other human settlements where cases of COVID-19 have been registered during the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (4) the history of contact with groups of persons with confirmed diseases (≥ 2 cases with high temperature or respiratory symptoms from Mr. Uhan and other human settlements such as hospitals, non-respectors, or clinicians, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) high temperature and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) external manifestations of COVID-19 infection; (3) total leukocytes are normal or decreased with reduced lymphocytes at the early stage of symptoms.
The diagnosis for confirmed disease should be based on suspicion of disease with one of the following pathogenetic or serological evidence points, namely: (1) the real-time PCR test is positive for SARS-CoV-2; (2) the complete sequence of the virus shows high homogeneity for new coronary viruses; (3) the positive serotest results for SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies; or the change in the test result from a negative for the SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody, or the titre increase of at least 4 times in the recovery phase for the relevant acute phase indicator.
It can also be noted that in the second (18 January 2020) and the third (22 January 2020) issue of the document, a PCR test was added in real-time for nucleic acid in respiratory or blood tests.
The pathogenetic diagnosis of blood samples was added in the fourth (27 January 2020) and the fifth (8 February 2020) issues; then the seventh issue added the need for serological evidence.
These changes are based on the continuous work of researchers looking for the optimal set for the detection of nucleic acids at rapid diagnosis, as well as for the analysis of samples taken from respiratory pathways, including blood samples, which enhance the availability of various samples and contribute to the inclusion of positive results for specific antibodies in the disease confirmation criterion.
However, there is increasing evidence of the need to exercise caution in the treatment of patients with atypical symptoms and patients with no apparent symptoms.
Thus, the road map presented in the work of Zhou (Zhou), etc., should be updated as it classifies those with no clinical symptoms as a low risk group.
The evaluation system also requires clarification in further clinical practice and studies.
In conclusion, we hope for more direct evidence and call on readers to leave their comments.
With regard to the diagnosis of “sudden cases of disease” and “confirmed cases”, we invite readers to monitor and strictly follow up the latest recommendations made in the countries in which they live.
Our team will also update its recommendations in a timely manner to provide effective assistance.
Bangladesh reports on five new deaths as a result of COVID-19, a daily maximum
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths as a result of COVID-19 per day.
This is the largest number of deaths from the virus a day.
As of yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute of Epidemiology, Control and Disease Studies (IEDCR) reported that 114 cases of registered infections had been reported, as well as 33 hospitalized patients at home.
A total of 17 deaths were recorded.
In an online briefing, the director of IEDCR, Dr. Mirjaby Sabrina Flora, told us that four men and one woman had become victims.
According to Dr. Mirjabi, the two who were over 60 years of age, two aged 51 to 60, and one aged 41 to 50.
She also reported that two people killed were from Dhaka.
On 11 March, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the COVID-19 pandemic.
The clinic staff informed the local news agency Anadolu that one of the victims was Jaal Saifur Rahman, Director of the Bengal Anti-Corruption Commission, who was being treated at the Kuwaiti Maitri Clinic.
On Saturday, the Minister for Road Transport and Bridges of Bangladesh said that public transport would be stopped for a longer time than originally planned before the next Saturday.
Public transport was stopped on 26 March and had to resume on Saturday, 4 April.
The transport of first-time products — medicines, fuel and food products — was still permitted.
The first cases of COVID-19 infection were registered in Bangladesh on 8 March in two persons who returned from Italy, as well as in one of them.
As of 19 March, these three people have already recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 has surpassed the million cases of infection worldwide
According to the University of Jones Hopkins, on Thursday, the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 co-infection worldwide exceeded one million.
At least 52,000 people have been killed since the coronation of COVID-19.
The border occurred on the same day that the first case of infection was confirmed in Malawi and the first case of the death of the crown virus was recorded in Zambia.
North Korea claimed that as of Thursday, it was one of the few countries where there were no cases of coronary infection.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases of infection, including 79,332 cases in twenty-four hours prior to 10:00 Central European Time (0800 UTC) on 4 April.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of coronation were reported, of which 5,900 had a fatal outcome.
CBS News, referring to data from the University of Jones Hopkins, reported that more than 1,000 deaths caused by coronary infection were recorded in the United States on Wednesday.
Countries around the world have announced the strengthening of measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Mayor of Moscow, Sergei Sobianin extended the regime of self-insulation of the city ' s citizens until 1 May.
Former President Vladimir Putin said that Russians throughout the country, despite their self-insulation, would receive a salary until 30 April.
Parliament voted to extend the emergency for 15 days; results of the vote: 215 votes for, ten abstentions and one vote against.
Saudi Arabia extended the hours of command in the sacred cities of Mecca and Medina for a full day, while the hours of command only lasted from 3 hours to 6 a.m.
Thailand planned to introduce a commander's watch from 10 o'clock in the evening to 4 a.m.
The Governor of Ohio, Mike Dewain, announced that the regime of domestic self-insulation in the state was extended by order until 1 May.
Stores in Australia limit the number of packages of toilet paper that can be purchased once
On Sunday and Saturday evening, Australian networks of Woolworths and Coles stores have reduced the number of toilet paper packages, which can be purchased once in all of the country ' s stores, to two and one packages respectively.
On Monday, ALDI also imposed a restriction on one package.
These restrictions were reported in cash announcements as well as on the Facebook website.
It is reported that citizens have begun to make emergency supplies because of the insurance that COVID-19 may entail the introduction of a general self-insulation regime.
In the middle of the Woolworths network, the quantity of toilet paper purchased was also limited to one package.
Earlier, March 4 and 5 respectively, Woolworths and Coles had already limited this number to 4 packages.
In its press release of 8 March, the Coles Trade Network reported that, with the introduction of a restriction on four packages “in many shops the toilet paper is still too fast – one delivery per hour” and called such a demand “unprecedented”, while the ALDI in Facebook post, published on Tuesday, called the trend “unprecedented”.
According to the representative of Woolworths, there was a sharp increase in sales last week.
Costco's shop in Canberra last week also limited that number to two packages.
In order to meet the deficit, Coles started to order larger batches and increased the frequency of deliveries, Woolworths ordered additional batches, while ALDI made stocks for the special share of the early sale of the environment.
Russell Cimmerman, Executive Director of the Australian Rituals Association, reported that the Rituals were trying to fill up their supplies, but this was difficult because of local authorities ' limitations on the timetable for the carriage of goods vehicles.
He expected an increase in the value of the product, as suppliers were trying to meet the demand, but less and less profitable proposals were available.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that, due to stockpiles being depleted, some stores could not operate on the environment.
In the News.com.au report, Dr. Gary Mortimer, an expert on the diversity of trade at the University of Queensland technology, said that shops fill up stocks every night.
He noted that the toilet paper was a heavy goods item, so there was little stock, and after the sale of the goods, long lines remained empty, increasing the sense of lack of stocks.
“Coles and Woolworths believe that if the shelves could be filled and goods such as toilet paper rolls and hand disinfectants could be placed on the shelves in large quantities, buyers would probably not be so panicked,” says Russell Cimmerman.
Last Wednesday, the manufacturer of the processed toilet paper, Who Gives a Crap, reported on the closure of stocks.
According to News.com.au, Kimberly-Clark, a manufacturer of toilet paper, Kleinex and Solaris Paper, also producing Sorbent, reported that they are working round-the-clock to ensure sufficient quantity of goods.
Domain.com, a real estate sales website, reported that when the number of auctions in Melbourne had decreased due to the lack of buyers on the Sunday of the Workday, some real estate vendors began to offer the first bidders free toilet paper.
The fourth issue of the daily NT News, printed in Darwin, included an eight-page tab for cutting and using as a toilet paper.
According to the report of ABC Australia of 3 March, shops initially reluctantly imposed restrictions on the number of goods purchased, stating that they did not plan to do so.
Russell Cimmerman added that other products also benefit from increased demand, including medical masks, hand disinfectants, gallanteries, hand washers and painkillers.
Similarly, in addition to developments in Australia, it was noted on Sunday evening that the UK supermarket online store Ocado also limited the sale of toilet paper by Andres with two packs of 12 rolls.
The World Health Organization announces the COVID-19 pandemic
The World Health Organization (WHO) announced a pandemic of COVID-19 infection caused by SARS-CoV-2.
Although the term “pandemic” is limited to the extent of the disease and not to the danger of specific cases, WHO notes that Governments need to take measures:
“All countries are still in a position to influence the development of the pandemic”.
This is possible if countries are to identify, test, treat, isolate the sick, monitor the occurrence of the disease, and mobilize their citizens,” explained Mr. Tedros Adan Gebreisos, Director-General of WHO.
“We are deeply concerned about both the alarming level of spread and the seriousness of the disease and the alarming level of inactivity.”
According to Dr. Tom Friden, former Director of the United States Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, this pandemic is “unprecedented”.
He said in his interview, broadcast by CNN in February, that “no other respiratory virus other than influenza has been traceable since its emergence until continuous global proliferation”.
Mr. Gebreisus expressed a similar view, saying that “we have never seen a pandemic caused by the coroner.
We have never seen a pandemic that can be controlled before.”
First, in January, WHO announced the outbreak of the public health emergency and then granted it a new status as a pandemic.
The Director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauchi, responded by saying, “This is just the beginning, it will be worse.”
At least 126,000 cases of COVID-19, more than 4,600 people were reported to be registered on Thursday.
The 2019-2020 crown virus pandemic is currently taking place during the 2019-2019 crown virus pandemic (COVID-19) caused by severe severe respiratory syndrome-2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was detected in Uhana, China, in December 2019 and an international public health emergency was announced on 30 January 2020, which was subsequently recognized as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As at 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 were registered in 210 countries and regions, killing approximately 97,000 people.
Some 364,000 people recovered.
The mortality rate in China is 4 per cent, while in the world it ranges from 13.04 per cent in Algeria to 0.08 per cent in New Zealand.
The most common symptoms include nausea, cough, and difficulty breathing.
Possible complications include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time between the first onset of symptoms and the peak of the disease is usually about five days, but may also vary from two to fourteen days.
There is currently no vaccine or specific treatment.
The main treatment is symptomatic and supportive, and the recommended preventive measures include handwashing, cough-covering, human-distinguishing, detection and self-insulation of people suspected of infection.
Authorities around the world have responded to the situation by imposing restrictions on travel, quarantine measures, hours of command, job risk control and the closure of various facilities.
The pandemic has led to a serious global socio-economic impact, the transfer or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural activities, as well as a widespread lack of goods exacerbated by panic purchases.
Schools and universities were closed at the national or regional level in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4% of the world ' s students.
The Internet has begun to disseminate disinformation on the virus, there have been cases of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese citizens, other East and South-East Asian citizens, or people recalling them outside, as well as other groups of people living in areas where significant cases of the spread of the virus have been observed.
As a result of reduced travel and closure of heavy industries, air pollution and carbon emissions have decreased.
On 31 December 2019, the health authorities of the city of Uhan (the capital of the province of Hubei), China, reported the occurrence of pneumonia for an unknown reason and the situation was investigated in early January 2020.
In most cases, infections were related to the octopus market for Juanan marine products, which is why the virus is believed to have a zootic origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak of the disease is known as SARS-CoV-2. It is a recently opened virus that is very similar to mouse-flight coronary viruses, pangoline coronary viruses and SARS-CoV. Later it was discovered that the first case of the disease occurred on 1 December 2019 and that the infected person did not visit the market after that date.
Two thirds of the infections registered in December 2019 were relevant to this market.
On 13 March 2020, the publication of the Morning Post South China newspaper, which has not been verified, suggested that the first case of infection occurred with a 55-year-old resident of Hubei Province on 17 November 2019. On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that the number of new cases of infection in China had decreased, but that there had been an unexpected increase in Italy, Iran and South Korea, and the number of new cases of infection outside China had for the first time exceeded the number of new cases of infection in China itself.
The number of cases of disease may be significantly reduced, in particular due to the number of cases with poorly pronounced symptoms.
By 26 February, relatively few cases of infection were reported among young people, with patients under 19 years of age and under accounting for less than 2.4% of the world's population. The main scientific adviser to the United Kingdom, Patrick Wallace, calculated that 60 per cent of the British population would be infected until effective group immunity was established.
Statistics include cases of infection of persons who have been checked for COVID-19 and whose test has been positive under official protocols.
As of 23 March, no country had been able to check more than 3 per cent of its population, and in many countries, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland, an official policy had been adopted which required no testing in the event of only minor symptoms.
A study published on 16 March showed that 86 per cent of cases of COVID-19 infection were not detected in China until 23 January and that such unregistered patients were a source of infection for 79 per cent of cases recorded.
The statistical analysis published on 30 March showed that the number of cases of actual infection in Italy had significantly exceeded the number of cases recorded.
Initial estimates of the baseline reproductive number (R0) for COVID-19 ranged from 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the United States Centre for Disease Control and Prevention is expected to be 5.7.
Most patients with COVID-19 are well cured.
In other, more complex cases, the time from the onset of symptoms to the time of death was 6 to 41 days, the most common time being 14 days.
As at 10 April 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths were related to COVID-19.
As at 5 February, approximately 80 per cent of deaths occurred in persons over 60 years of age and 75 per cent of those killed had related diseases, including cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. Official data on mortality from the COVID-19 pandemic usually include information on the deaths of patients with positive results of the COVID test performed under official protocols.
The actual number of deaths from COVID-19 may be much higher, since official figures may not take into account dead people who have not been tested — for example, in the case of death at home, in the homes of the elderly, etc.
The incomplete data on Italy show that the actual number of deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official COVID 4-5 times.
The U.S. Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Press Secretary acknowledges: “We know that [the reported number of deaths] below is in fact confirmed by reports of some single cases in the U.S.. Such incomplete data are often found in pandemics such as swine flu epidemics of H1N1 2009. The first confirmed death was registered in Uhana on 9 January 2020.
The first death outside China was registered in the Philippines on 1 February and outside Asia on 14 February in France on 14 February.
By 28 February, more than ten deaths had been recorded outside China: in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
By 13 March, more than forty countries and regions on all continents, other than Antarctica, reported cases of death; several methods are usually used to quantify mortality.
All indicators differ depending on the region and the time of spread of the disease; they also affect the number of tests, the quality of health systems used in treatment, the time from the onset of outbreaks of the disease and the population parameters such as age, gender and overall health status.
According to statistics at John Hopkins University, as at 10 April 2020, the global number of deaths and infections is 6.0% (97 039/1,617,204).
Data vary from region to region.
In China, the mortality rate for the disease decreased from 17.3% (for those with symptoms from 1 to 10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for those with symptoms after 1 February 2020). Other methods include the definition of the percentage of mortality caused by the disease (CFR) — the percentage of the diagnosed patients who die from the disease and the percentage of mortality from the infection (IFR), which reflects the percentage of the infected (both diagnosed and non-diagnosed) who die from the disease.
These statistics are not linked to a specific time and reflect the indicators of certain groups from the time of infection to the end of the disease.
Some scientists have tried to calculate these indicators for specific groups of people.
According to the Oxford University Medical Evidence Centre, the overall mortality rate from this pandemic ranges from 0.1 to 0.39 per cent.
The upper figure of this range is consistent with the results of the first arbitrary COVID-19 test in Germany, as well as with a statistical study that analyzes the impact of the CFR assessment.
WHO claims that the current pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and the exact length of the flash shall not be defined and may vary depending on the location.
Mathey Bonnie, a staff member of the University of Pennsylvania State, claims that “uncontrolled infection outbreaks usually go out on pay and then, when the number of available carriers is over, they begin to quit.
However, in the current situation, it is virtually impossible to make any reasonable predictions as to when this will happen.”
The Senior Medical Adviser of the Chinese Government, Jun Nanishan, claims that “all can end in June” if all countries are able to mobilize and implement WHO recommendations on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On 17 March, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine stated that SARS-CoV-2 “will be circulating for perhaps a year or two”.
According to a study by the Imperial College under the leadership of Neil Ferguson, “until a vaccine is established (possible for 18 months or more)” compliance with physical distance and other measures will be required.
William Schaffner, a member of the University of Vanderbilt, believes: “I don’t think this coronation will ever disappear completely because it is transmitted so easily” and that it “can become a seasonal disease with a fall every year”.
The virulence of new outbreaks will depend on collective immunity and the degree of mutation.
Symptoms of COVID-19 may be relatively non-specific, and some infected people may experience disease-free symptoms.
Two of the most common symptoms are fever (88%) and cough dry (68%).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, wetting in the respiratory tract (spleen), loss of swallowing, urticaria, muscle and joint pain, throat pain, headache, swelling, vomiting, blood clotting, diarrhoea or cyanosis. WHO claims to be seriously ill with breathing problems about every six people.
The U.S. Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDCs) list emergency symptoms such as difficulty breathing, constant pain or feeling depressed in the chest, sudden feeling of confusion, difficulty in awakening and sweating of a person or mouth.
Some infected people may experience unsymptomism without any clinical manifestations, but the results of the analysis confirm the fact of the infection, so doctors recommend that people who are in close contact with patients whose diagnosis is confirmed be placed under strict control and examined for infection.
According to Chinese scientists, the number of cases of unsymptomatic disease fluctuations from several units to 44 per cent of all cases.
The usual incubation period (the time between infection and symptoms) ranges from one to 14 days; usually it is five days; until there is full clarity on the symptom of loss of dizziness: the initial estimate is that the percentage of patients with COVID-19 who developed this symptom was 30 per cent and then 15 per cent.
Some details on how disease spreads are still unknown are still unknown.
It is considered that the disease is transmitted mainly during close contact, as well as through small drops of air with a cough, cough or conversation; close contact means contact in a radius of 1 to 2 metres (3 to 6 feet).
According to some studies, the droplets may range from 4.5 metres (15 ft) to 8.2 metres (27 ft).
There are assumptions that the virus can also be transmitted through small droplets emitted into the air during a conversation that can remain in the air for longer periods of time. Respiratory droplets can also be formed when you breathe, including during a conversation, although the virus is not usually carried by air.
The drops can fall into the mouth or nose of a number of people, as well as into the easy.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiac rejuvenation (SDR), can lead to the spread of respiratory products and therefore to the spread of the virus in the air.
It can also penetrate the body if the person is affected by the contaminated surface, including the skin, with a subsequent eye, nose or lips.
There are also concerns that the virus can be transmitted through the faeces, but the risk of transmission is considered low.
The Government of China denies the possibility of faecal oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is the most infected within the first three days of the onset of symptoms, although its spread may occur both before the onset of symptoms and at later stages of the disease.
There were cases when tests were positive for three days prior to the onset of symptoms, and this indicated the possibility of transmission of the virus prior to an express onset of symptoms.
There are only a few reports of confirmed cases of unsymptomatic disease, but some countries have also found cases of disease transmission from unsymptomatic carriers.
Officials of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) claim that it is not quite clear how easily the virus is spread, yet it is known that one patient is usually infected by 2-3 other people.
In particular, it was found that on a plastic surface (polypropylene) and on a stainless steel (304) virus was capable of living for up to three days, on a cardboard surface — for one day, and on a copper surface — for up to 4 hours.
These data vary, however, depending on the humidity and temperature; domestic and other animals had a positive outcome for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit a virus to humans, although the British authorities recommend washing their hands after contact with animals, just as they do after contact with other surfaces that could be affected by infected people.
Severe acute respiratory coronary syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus that was first detected in three people with pneumonia from the acute respiratory disease group registered in Uhana.
All the signs of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in nature by family coroners. Outside the human body, the virus can be destroyed with domestic soap that dissolves its protective shell. SARS-CoV-2 is very similar to the original SARS-CoV virus.
He's supposed to have a zootic origin.
The genetic analysis of the coronation virus showed that it is genetically clustered with the genus Betacoronavirus, the genus Sarbecovirus (cell line B) together with two other strains of flies.
At the overall genetic level, it is 96% identical to other samples of batCov RaTG13.
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there was only one difference in amino acids in certain parts of the sequences of Pangoline and human viruses.
The overall genomic comparison to date has shown that the highest rate of similarity (92%) is between the pangoline coronation virus and SARS-CoV-2, but this is not enough to prove that pangolins are intermediate masters of the virus.
The virus infection may be pre-diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, although this should ultimately be confirmed by analyzing the polymerous chain reaction with the reverse transcription (RT-PCD) of the infected secret or computer tomography.
The results of a study comparing PCR and CT methods applied in Uhana showed that the CT is significantly more sensitive than the PCR, although less specific, as many of its visualization functions coincide with other pneumonias and disease flow processes.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology has published a recommendation “not to use CT for boxing or as a method of testing the first line in the COVID-19 diagnostics”.
WHO published several RNA test protocols on SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was published on 17 January.
A real-time polymeric reaction (RT-PCR) test is being carried out.
It can be carried out on respiratory samples and blood samples.
The results are usually prepared for a few hours to a few days.
A number of laboratories and companies develop serological tests to detect antibodies.
As at 6 April 2020, none of them proved to be accurate enough to obtain universal approval.
In the United States, the Cellex serological test was approved for emergency use only by certified laboratories.
The characteristics of visualization of the symptoms on X-rays and computer tomography (CT) include asymmetric peripheral blurs of the type of matte glass and the absence of pleural discharges.
The Italian Radiological Society is responsible for establishing the international imagery base of confirmed cases of infection.
Because of similar infections, such as adenvirus, with the identification of COVID-19 images not confirmed by PCR tests, there is a limited clinical specification.
A major study was conducted in China comparing the results of the CTC of the breast and PCD testing and found that, although the images were less specific in the case of infection, they could be decrypted more quickly; they were also more sensitive, and therefore the method of diagnosis could be considered as a boxing tool in infected areas.
X-rays and computer tomography have been used to diagnose the virus.
Prevention strategies include the maintenance of general personal hygiene, washing of hands, avoiding eye contact, nose or lips dirty hands, use in coughing or peeling of napkins, which should be discarded immediately after use.
Those who may already be infected should wear a medical mask in human places.
In order to prevent the transmission of the disease, it is also recommended that people should be physically separated, many Governments recommend refraining from any short-term travel to countries and areas affected by the outbreak and restricting the movement of citizens.
Nevertheless, the virus could spread in most regions of the world.
This means that the virus is spread to the population, some of which do not know where and how they have been infected. Medical personnel who are in charge of patients who may be infected are advised to use standard precautions and precautions when contacting other people and means of eye protection. Tracking contacts is also an important method used by health authorities to determine the source of infection and prevent its further spread.
The use by Governments of data on the location of citizens using their mobile phones to that end has raised concerns about the confidentiality of their data, and organizations such as Amnesty International (International Amnesty), as well as over 100 other organizations, have made statements requiring that this kind of monitoring be limited to people.
Various mobile applications for voluntary use have been developed and proposed; as at 7 April 2020, more than ten expert groups have been working on the development of personal data privacy solutions, such as the user ' s proximity to other mobile phones through Bluetooth technology.
If the mobile phone user has been in close contact with the person whose COVID-19 test has been positive, he will receive the relevant notification. There are also unsubstantiated versions of how to prevent infection, such as nose and mouth peeling, which is actually ineffective.
There is currently no vaccine from COVID-19, although many organizations are working on its establishment.
To prevent the spread of the disease, it is recommended to wash your hands.
The CDC (the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention) also recommends more frequent washing hands with salt and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after toilet visits or when hands are severely contaminated, as well as before meals, after snoring, coughing or chewing.
This is necessary because, while outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by domestic migraine, which conceals its protective shell.
In addition, if salt and water are not available, the CDC recommends the use of disinfectants to treat alcohol-based hands with at least 60% alcohol content.
WHO recommends avoiding eye, nose, or nose contact with dirty hands.
The surfaces can be disinfected by a number of solutions (on the surface of the stainless steel disinfectant starts to work one minute after application) with 62-71% ethanol, 50-100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen overacid and 0.2-7.5% iodine.
Other components, such as benzene chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
CDC recommends that in the event of suspicion of or confirmation of COVID in an establishment, such as an office or a daily station, all spaces of such premises, including cabinets, toilets, common facilities, electronic equipment, such as tablets, sensor screens, keyboards, remote controls and ATMs used by sick people, be disinfected.
Medical organizations recommend covering the mouth and nose of the back of the elbow or valve while coughing or chewing and immediately removing the hygiene items used.
Those who may have been infected are recommended to use medical masks, since the use of masks may limit the volume and extent of the spread of exhaust products that spread in the air when talking, chewing and coughing.
WHO issued instructions on when and how to use medical masks.
According to Steven Griffin, a virusologist at the University of Lids, “the use of a medical mask can reduce the tendency of people to touch their faces and to touch their faces with dirty hands is the main way of infection”. Masks are also recommended for the use of those who care for people who can be infected.
WHO recommends that healthy people wear medical masks only if they are at high risk, for example, for people who are stalking a person with COVID-19, although it also recognizes that the use of the mask actually reduces the number of people affected.
Several countries began calling for medical masks in public places.
The CDC, U.S.A., recommends wearing tight face masks for non-medical purposes. China has emphasized separately the importance of using one-time medical masks for healthy people, especially if they are in close contact with others (1 meter (3 ft) or less).
In Hong Kong, it is recommended to wear a medical mask in public transport or in public places.
Health officials in Thailand call on people to prepare and remove personal textile masks at home.
In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, citizens are prohibited from going out without masks covering their nose and mouth.
On 16 March, the Government of Vietnam requested all citizens to wear masks in public places to protect themselves and others.
The Government of Austria has committed all visitors to the product stores to wear medical masks.
The Government of Israel also requested citizens to wear masks in public places.
On 1 April, in Taiwan, where 10 million medical masks are held since mid-March, medical masks were prescribed for all passengers on trains and interurban buses.
In Panama, residents are required to wear a medical mask on the street; those who cannot buy masks were recommended to sew them on their own at home.
Medical masks are also widely used by the inhabitants of Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distance (also known as physical distance) is a measure to combat infection aimed at slowing the spread of the disease by minimizing close contacts among people.
Protection measures include quarantine, travel restrictions, school closures, workplaces, stadiums, theatres and shopping centres.
People can use social distance measures while staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding public places, using contactless greeting and physical distance from others.
Many Governments of the regions, particularly those affected by the outbreak, are currently prescribing or recommending social distance.
The maximum number of people who could be gathered in one location according to the recommendations of the United States government and health organizations was rapidly reduced from 250 people (in regions where no COVID-19 was available) to 50 and later to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany prohibited the gathering of more than two people into groups: elderly people and persons suffering from diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension and a weakened immune system. The CDC recommends that they stay at home as long as possible if the disease occurs in the region. At the end of March 2020, WHO and other health authorities began to replace the term “social distance” with “physical distance”, thus clarifying the objective of reducing physical contact within the framework of social links, whether through virtual communication or physical distance.
The use of the term “social distance” was understood to mean that people should be completely socially isolated, instead of staying in touch with other people in alternative ways. Some agencies published guidelines on sexual health that should be used during the pandemic.
Among other things, it has been recommended to have sexual relations only with your permanent partners with whom you live, and to whom you are sure that you do not have the virus and its symptoms.
Individuals with a COVID-19 diagnosis and those suspected of being infected are recommended for self-insulation at home.
Health institutions have issued detailed instructions on proper self-insulation, and many Governments have also made mandatory or recommended that the entire population of affected areas be placed on quarantine.
Those in high-risk groups were required to have a stronger quarantine.
Persons who may have contacted the infected COVID-19 or have recently visited a country or region significantly affected by the epidemic were recommended to find quarantine within 14 days of the last possible contact.
Exploitation strategies include preventing, suppressing or mitigating the spread of the disease.
The prevention of the spread of the disease is carried out at an early stage and aims to track and isolate the infected, as well as other measures of infection control and vaccination to prevent the spread of the disease among the rest of the population.
At a stage where the spread of the disease is no longer possible, efforts are being made to mitigate the effects: measures are being taken to slow down the spread and mitigate the impact of the epidemic on the health system and society.
Measures to prevent and mitigate the effects of the spread of the disease can be taken at the same time.
The suppression of infection requires more extreme measures to reverse the pandemic by reducing the baseline number of infections to levels 1 below. Part of the infection management effort is aimed at reducing the peak of the epidemic known as the epidemic curve.
Such efforts reduce the risk of overload of health services and provide more time for the development of vaccines and treatments.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can help cope with the outbreak include personal prevention measures such as hand hygiene, use of medical masks and self-insulation; public measures aimed at physical distance, such as closing schools and eliminating mass activities; involving the community in promoting and participating in such measures; and measures to protect the environment, such as surface cleaning.
Other countries have also taken a number of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
Mass screening and localized quarantine have been introduced in South Korea and a system of alerting the movements of infected persons has been established.
In Singapore, financial support was provided to those who were infected with isolation and imposed large fines on those who had not done so.
In Taiwan, the production of medical masks has been increased and there has been a fine for the accumulation of surplus stocks of medicines, and the modeling of Britain and the United States has shown that there are serious problems with mitigation (a delay but not a halt to the spread of the epidemic) and suppression (a halt to the growth of the epidemic).
The optimal policy to mitigate the spread of the disease can reduce the peak burden on the health system by 2/3 and mortality is double, but it still leads to hundreds of thousands of deaths and the collapse of health systems.
Pressure may be a preferred method, but it must be used until the virus circulates among the population (or until the vaccine has been developed if this occurs earlier), as otherwise the disease spread will resume rapidly when the measures are weakened.
Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic leads to social and economic costs.
Antivirals approved for the treatment of COVID-19 do not currently exist, but they are being developed, including the testing of existing medicinal products.
Taking prescription medicines from the cold, drinking sufficient fluid and rest can help relieve symptoms.
Depending on the severity of the disease, the patient may need oxygen therapy, internal fluidization and respiratory support.
The use of steroids can only be harmful.
Several compounds previously approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are also considered for the treatment of COVID-19.
WHO also reported that some “traditional and domestic” means could alleviate the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
WHO considers capacity-building and adaptation of health to the needs of patients with COVID-19 as a major response to disease outbreaks.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the WHO Regional Office have issued guidelines for primary health care clinics and services to facilitate the redeployment of resources at several levels, including the focus of laboratory services on COVID-19 testing, the abolition of emergency procedures, where possible, the detection of virus and isolation of patients with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, as well as the enhancement of the capacity for intensive therapy through staff training and increased availability of available devices and chickens.
There are various theories about where the first case of infection could have occurred, the so-called “zero patient”.
The first known case of a new coronary infection occurred on 1 December 2019 in the city of Uhan Province of Hubei, China.
During the month, the number of cases of coronation in the province of Hubei increased gradually.
They were mainly related to the octopus market of the Juanan marine products, on which live animals were also sold, and one of the theories is that the virus enters the human body from one of these animals; in other words, the virus has a zoonotic origin. On 26 December, the clinic in Hubei was registered for the mass disease of Pneumonia of unknown origin, with which Dr. Zhang Tianzin, who reported the case at the Zianjan Center for Disease Control and Prevention in the city of Uhan.
On 30 December, a group of doctors at the Uhan Central Clinic warned their colleagues about “Koronavirus similar to SARS”.
Eight of these doctors, including Lee Wenlan, had been warned by the police about the responsibility for spreading false rumors, and the doctor, Ay Fen, had received an excuse from her superiors for panicking.
Later, on 31 December, the Municipal Health Commission of Uganda published a public notice and informed WHO of the situation.
The Ugandan health authorities reported the number of cases of unknown pneumonia, which was large enough to initiate an investigation in early January. At the early stages, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus also spread to other Chinese provinces, which were facilitated by the Chinese New Year's holidays and the fact that Uhan is a transport and main railway network.
China reported 140 new infections in one day on 20 January, including two people who were infected in Beijing and one in Schengen.
As of 26 March, the United States seized China and Italy with the highest number of confirmed worldwide infections. On 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 million cases were reported worldwide, more than 97,000 people were killed, and more than 364,000 were recovered.
Some 200 countries and territories have recorded at least one recorded case of infection.
Because of the pandemic, many European countries in the Schengen area have restricted free movement and established border controls.
National response measures included measures to prevent the spread of the disease, such as quarantine (known as compulsory residence, mandatory shelter or isolation) and a commandant hour. As at 2 April, about 300 million people, or about 90 per cent of the United States population, were in some form quarantine, more than 50 million people were in isolation from the Philippines, about 59 million were in isolation in South Africa, and 1.3 billion people were in India.
On 26 March, 1.7 billion people around the world were in some form of isolation, and two days later that figure rose to 2.6 billion people — about a third of the world’s population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 disease was registered in Uhana on 1 December 2019; according to the second report, which was not verified, that date was 17 November.
On 26 December, Dr. Xian Xian Zianj worked with an unknown type of lung disease, as reported by the Centre for the Control and Prevention of Xianjan Disease in the city of Uhan on 27 December.
Initial genetic testing of patient samples on 27 December 2019 showed the presence of SARS-like coronation virus.
On 31 December, the Municipal Health Commission of Uganda published the relevant public notice.
WHO was notified that same day.
In connection with such notifications, the police warned doctors in Uhana about the responsibility for “the spread of rumors” about the outbreak.
Initially, the Chinese National Health Commission stated that there was no “clear evidence” of the ability of the newly detected virus to be transmitted from human to human.
At the end of January, the Chinese Government launched a radical campaign to prevent the spread of the virus, which was later called the Secretary-General of the Chinese Communist Party of China by the “National War”.
The events of “a large-scale quarantine in the history of humanity” began on 23 January to be announced as a sanitary border and a ban on entry into and return to Uhan, and later spread to 15 cities in the province of Hubei and affected a total of about 57 million people.
The use of personal transport was prohibited in the city.
Celebrations on the occasion of the New Year of China were cancelled in many places (25 January).
The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital in Hušechenšan, which was completed within 10 days.
Later, another hospital, Lowershan, was built, which had received other receiving patients.
In addition to the restored hospitals, China has also redesigned 14 other institutions in Uhana, such as conference centres and stadiums, in temporary hospitals. On 26 January, the Government adopted additional measures to prevent the outbreak of COVID-19, including the issuance of health reports for travellers and the extension of the Chinese New Year's celebration period.
Universities and schools were closed all over the country.
The Hong Kong and Macao regions have introduced a number of measures, in particular with regard to schools and universities.
In several regions, the Chinese authorities have introduced a remote system of work.
Travel restrictions were imposed in the province of Hubei and beyond.
The timetable for public transport has been changed and museums throughout China have been temporarily closed.
In many cities, a traffic control regime had been introduced, and it was estimated that some 760 million people (over half the population) had faced some form of restrictions on the movement in open air, and after the outbreak had entered the global phase in March, the Chinese authorities had taken strict measures to prevent the import of the virus from other countries.
For example, a 14-day mandatory quarantine was introduced in Beijing for all international travellers entering the city. As of 23 March, only one case of transmission of infection within the country, which occurred five days before, was registered in the case of a person returning to Guangzhou from Istanbul.
On 24 March 2020, Chinese Prime Minister Li Ketzan reported that the spread of intra-country transmitted diseases had been largely halted and the outbreak in China had been monitored.
On the same day, restrictions on travel to Hubaya, other than Uhanya, were lifted two months after the closure of the province for quarantine. On 26 March 2020, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China announced that entry for persons with a visa or a residence permit would be suspended from 28 March.
Those wishing to come to China will have to make applications for visas in Chinese embassies or consulates.
On 30 March, the Chinese Government urged enterprises and factories to resume work and provide companies with a package of monetary incentives. On 4 April at 10:00 a national “minute of silence” was held, which opened the day of mourning over the victims of the Crown Virus, announced by the State Council of the country and who had slept with the Feast of Quinmin, but the Central Government requested citizens to pay tribute to the deceased online, respecting physical distance to avoid a resurgence of COVID-19.
It was confirmed that COVID-19 had spread to the territory of South Korea on 20 January 2020 from China.
On 20 February, the National Ministry of Health reported a significant increase in the number of confirmed cases of disease, which occurred in many cases because of the high number of followers of the new religious movement, known as the Church of Jesus Shinchongji.
The followers of Shinchhungji came to Teg from Uhan, which is probably a source of excitement.
As of 22 February, out of 9,336 church followers 1,261 (approximately 13 per cent) reported disease symptoms. On 23 February 2020, the highest level of anxiety was announced in South Korea.
More than 2,000 confirmed cases of infection were registered in Korea on 28 February, with an increase of up to 3,150 on 29 February.
All South Korean military bases were quarantined after the three soldiers had confirmed the presence of the virus.
The explosion affected the number of travels, and therefore the flight schedule of the airlines was changed. South Korea has launched a programme on the screening of the population for the availability of the virus, the tracking of contacts and the organization of quarantine measures for contact persons, which is considered to be the largest and best organization in the world.
Boxing methods included mandatory information on their symptoms through mobile application to all foreign arrivals, a master virus test, which had already been prepared for the next day, and an increased testing capacity that allowed up to 20,000 people to be tested daily.
The South Korean programme is considered successful in combating the outbreak of the disease, despite the fact that the entire city was not isolated.
Many Koreans have signed petitions that either endorsed the President ' s actions or called upon Mr. Mun to give an impression that the Government ' s response to the outbreak of the disease was inadequate.
On 23 March, it was reported that the lowest total number of infections in South Korea was recorded within four weeks.

The Shiite shrines in Kume remained open to palm trees until 16 March 2020, and Iran became the centre for the spread of the virus after China in February.
In the light of the allegations of hiding outbreaks in Iran, by 28 February, more than ten countries have linked their outbreaks to Iran, indicating that there may be more serious outbreaks than 388 cases registered by the Iranian Government by that date.
The Iranian Parliament was closed and 23 of its 290 members, as reported on 3 March, had positive results of the virus testing.
On 12 March, Human Rights Wotch (“Intention of Human Rights”) called upon the Iranian prison management to unconditionally release human rights defenders detained for peacelessness and temporarily release all prisoners of this category.
The Organization claims that there is an increased risk of the spread of the virus in closed institutions, such as prisons, where adequate medical care is lacking.
On 15 March, the Iranian Government reported 100 deaths in one day, the largest number of deaths recorded in the country since the outbreak.
By 17 March, at least 12 Iranian or former Iranian politicians and government officials had died from this disease.
By 23 March, 50 new cases of coronary disease had been reported in Iran every hour and every ten minutes was one new death from the coronary disease.
According to the WHO representative, the level of disease in Iran may be five times higher than that reported at the official level.
U.S. sanctions against Iran are also expected to affect the country ' s financial capabilities to protect against the spread of the virus.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights called for the mitigation of economic sanctions against the countries most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
On 31 January, it was confirmed that the disease had hit the territory of Italy when two Chinese tourists tested the SARS-CoV-2 performed in Rome.
The number of cases of infection has grown sharply, causing the Italian Government to suspend all flights to and from China and to declare an emergency.
A non-associated cluster of cases of COVID-19 infection was later found. It all started with the registration of 16 confirmed cases in Lombardy on 21 February. On 22 February, the Council of Ministers issued a new decree on the prevention of outbreaks, whereby more than 50,000 persons from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy were quarantined.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said: "The entry and exit of the disease will be covered.
" On 4 March, the Italian Government ordered that all schools and universities throughout the country should be suspended and sports activities discontinued." The Italian Government was ordered to close all schools and universities, since at that time 100 people had been killed in Italy.

As at 5 April, Italy had 128,948 confirmed cases of coroner infection, 15,887 deaths and 21,815 cases of healing, most of which were concentrated in the Lombardy region.
One CNN report notes that such a high level of mortality in Italy can contribute to the combination of two factors — the large number of elderly people in that country and the lack of access to all those who are now more than the coroner.
The United Kingdom responded to the virus in the calmest way possible from all affected countries, and by 18 March 2020 the British Government had not required citizens to comply with any form of social distance or quarantine measures.
As a result, the Government has been criticised for a lack of rapid and serious response to the danger of the country ' s population. On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson made a statement recommending refraining from all visits and social contacts that are not of primary importance, offering people the opportunity to work from home and avoid public places such as pubs, restaurants and theatres.
On 20 March, the Government announced that all entertainment facilities, such as pubs and sports clubs, should be closed as soon as possible and promised workers to pay up to 80 per cent of their salary, but not more than £2,500 per month as a means of supporting the population during the crisis. On 23 March, the Prime Minister announced more stringent measures on social distance, prohibiting more than two people from gathering together and limiting travel and active rest in the fresh air only in cases of extreme need.

Nevertheless, the United States population was not tested immediately, and the true outbreaks of the disease were hidden during that period.
The test was difficult because of the marriage of the test sets issued by the Federal Government in February, without the federal Government ' s permission to use non-State test sets developed by scientific organizations, companies and clinics, and by the beginning of March, which would allow citizens to undergo testing (this could only have been done by the appointment of a physician).

On the other hand, China ' s assistance was well received in some parts of Latin America and Africa. On 2 April, the World Bank began relief operations for developing countries.
WHO appreciated the efforts of the Chinese authorities to combat the epidemic and prevent the spread of infection.
WHO noted clear differences between the outbreak of atypical pneumonia occurring in 2002-2004, during which allegations against the Chinese authorities were made of the fact that the prevention of disease and the prevention of its spread on the one hand, and the current crisis, when the Central Government “provided regularly updated information on the situation in order to avoid panic before the New Year”.
On 23 January, in response to a decision by the central authorities to ban transport in Uhana, WHO representative of the year of Galea noted that, although “this measure was certainly not recommended by WHO”, it was also “an extremely important confirmation of the commitment to prevent the epidemic in the most common place”, and called it “unprecedented in public health history”. 30 January, after confirmation of the ability to transmit infection from humans outside China and the increase in the number of infected in other countries, WHO announced an emergency situation in the public health system of international importance (PHEIC); this situation has become the sixth since 2009, when such a measure was first applied during the outbreak of swine flu.
The Director-General of WHO, Mr. Tedros Adan, said that the announcement of PHEC was due to “the risk of global proliferation, especially in low and medium-income countries with no reliable health systems.
Commenting on the restrictions on travel, Mr. Tedros said that “there is no reason for measures that excessively impede international movements and trade”, and that “WHO does not recommend restricting trade and movement”.
On 5 February, WHO requested the world community to allocate $675 million to ensure strategic preparedness for the low-income epidemic, reporting on the need to provide urgent assistance to countries that do not have systems to identify people infected with the virus, although the epidemic has not yet reached those countries.
Mr. Tedros also said that “the measure of our readiness is the degree of readiness for the epidemic of our weakest zone”, and called upon the international community to “make a choice: to invest today or to pay in the future”. At a press conference held on 11 February, WHO established the official name of the disease, COVID-19.
On the same day, Tedros said that UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterrish agreed to provide “the potential of the entire UN system in response to the problem”.
As a result, a United Nations Crisis Management Unit was established, coordinating all United Nations response measures; these steps, WHO states, will enable “to focus on health response, while other agencies can use their experience to combat disease outbreaks in a broader social and economic context”.
On 14 February, WHO and China initiated a joint ad hoc group to provide international expertise and WHO field staff in China to assist with the resolution of the situation within China and to assess “serious disease and its infection”, organized seminars and meetings with leading national institutions, as well as field visits to assess “the effectiveness of provincial and district response measures, including urban and rural areas”. On 25 February, WHO stated that “the world must do more to prepare for the possible pandemic of the crown virus, noting that “it is too early to call it a pandemic, but countries must be ready to do so”.
When the outbreak broke out in Iran, WHO sent a joint group to assess the situation there. On 28 February, WHO officials stated that the likelihood of global spread of the crown virus would be increased from “high” to “high” is the highest level of preparedness and risk.
Mike Ryan, Executive Director of the WHO Health Emergency Programme, warned in his statement: “This is a verification of every government on the planet to be ready for the real situation: time to act.
This virus may already be on its way to your country, and you need to be ready," and stressed that the right response can help the world avoid “the worst scenario of developments”.
Ryan also stated that the current data did not serve as a basis for declaring a global pandemic to official public health officials, and added that the proclamation of a pandemic would mean that “we essentially recognize the fact that everyone on the planet will be at risk of being infected with this virus”.
On 11 March, WHO announced the outbreak of the coronary plague.
The Director-General of WHO stated that WHO “is deeply concerned about both the alarming high level of spread and the severity of the disease and at least the alarming level of inactivity in connection with the problem”. WHO was severely criticized for a considered inadequate approach to the notion of pandemic, including a later announcement of a public health emergency and the classification of the virus as pandemic.
As a response to the situation, Mr. Tedros Adanomam, the Director-General of WHO, was requested to resign, which had been signed by 733,000 as at 6 April.
On 26 March 2020, ten United Nations human rights experts emphasized the importance of respect for the rights of each person during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Expert Group stated that everyone had the right to apply to him life-saving measures and that the Government was responsible for the organization of such measures.
The Group stressed that the lack of resources or health insurance should not at all justify discrimination against any particular group of people.
Experts stressed that everyone has the right to health care, including persons with limited capacity, minority groups, elderly citizens, internally displaced persons, homeless persons, civilians living in extremely poor conditions, prisoners, as well as refugees and other inaccurate groups in need of public support.
International government organizations are considering the economic and social consequences of the crisis related to COVID-19.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has established a platform to provide timely and comprehensive information on policy responses in countries around the world, as well as to familiarize itself with opinions and recommendations.
The digital network contains information on country policy trackers for strengthening health and world economies, removing the impact of quarantine and travel restrictions to help countries learn from each other and to promote coordinated global responses to the fight against coronation.
The Government of China has been criticised by the United States, British Prime Minister Michael Gowa and Eduardo Bolsonar, the son of President of Brazil Jair Bolsonar, for the action taken to combat the pandemic that began with the Chinese province of Hubei.
A number of heads of the Chinese Communist Party (CPC) level of provinces were released for the quarantine measures they had taken in the central part of China, and these dismissals were evidenced by the dissatisfaction of the political building in these regions.
Some commentators believe that this step was aimed at protecting the Secretary-General of the Chinese Communist Party of China from public wrath of the outbreak of the Crown Virus.
Some Chinese officials, such as Xhao Lizzian, expressed disagreement with the earlier statement that the outbreak of the crown virus had begun in Uhana, but took the side of the conspiracy theory that COVID-19 had occurred in the United States or Italy.
The U.S. President Donald Trump's administration called the coronation “Chinese Virus” or “Uhanya Virus”, stating that “Censorship in China only exacerbates the situation with the virus that has now become a global pandemic”, and this statement in turn has been criticized by some commentators who claim that such an approach is racist and “detracts from the inability of the U.S. President's administration to prevent the spread of the disease”.
The Daily Beast has received access to a US government telegram containing communication strategic cunning, apparently thought by the National Security Council, with the following references to the strategy: “It is all in China.
We are asked to disseminate this information in any way possible, including press conferences and television presentations." The organizations such as Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg said that China ' s efforts to help countries with the virus are part of the “propagandist effort” to gain global influence.
The head of the EU Foreign Policy Office, Joseph Borrell, warned of the presence of a “geopolitical component that includes the fight against influence through the pillar and so-called generosity policy”.
Borrell also stated that “China is pushing forward the idea of its role as a responsible and reliable partner, unlike the United States”.
China also called upon the United States to abolish sanctions against Syria, Venezuela and Iran, with some reports of assistance being sent to the last two countries.
The donation by Jack Ma of Cuba of 100,000 medical masks was prohibited under United States sanctions imposed on 3 April.
The U.S. authorities are also accused of redirecting assistance to other countries in their own country.
Other countries such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland, the Czech Republic and Italy have also been involved in medical masks.
In addition, Turkey has allocated hundreds of IPR equipment for Spain.
At the beginning of March, the Italian Government criticised the lack of support from the European Union for the Italian coronation virus.
Mauricio Massari, the Italian Ambassador to the EU, said that “China has only reacted bilaterally.
This certainly does not show European solidarity.”
On 22 March, following a telephone conversation with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, organized a mission to Italy to Russian military sanitaries, specialized disinfection and other medical equipment.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa cites an anonymous “high-level political source”, claiming that 80 per cent of Russian aid was “useless or not useful for Italy”.
The source accused Russia of trying to make a favourable impression on the world public at the “geopolitical and diplomatic” level.
The President of Lombardy Attilio Fontan and the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Italy, Luigi Di Mayo, rejected the media attacks and expressed appreciation for the assistance provided.
Russia has also sent a cargo plane with medical assistance to the United States.
Dr. Kremla Dmitry Peskov said that “by offering assistance to American colleagues, [Putin] suggests that when American manufacturers of medical equipment and materials increase production rates, they will also be able to respond if necessary”.
The NATO Defence Force 2020 military exercises planned in Germany, Poland and the Baltic countries, the largest NATO military exercises after the end of the Cold War, will be carried out in a reduced format.
The Secretary-General of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, Kate Hudson, criticised the Defence 2020 (Protector-2020) doctrine: “In a crisis situation that has arisen today in public health, the conduct of these teachings endangers not only the military and many European participating countries, but also the inhabitants of the countries where such activities are to be carried out.” The Government of Iran was severely affected by the virus, infected by about two dozen members of Parliament, as well as by fifteen other current or former political actors.
On 14 March 2020, President Hassan Ruhani addressed the world leaders with a request for assistance, stating that his country was experiencing difficulties in combating the epidemic due to the lack of access to international markets in connection with United States sanctions against Iran. The epidemic called on the United States to adopt social policies common to other states, including the establishment of a single health system and care for children, paid family leave and increased public health funding.
Politologists expected that this could have a negative impact on the prospects of Donald Trump for the re-election of the 2020 presidential elections, and that the pandemic had aggravated the diplomatic relationship between Japan and South Korea.
South Korea has criticized Japan ' s “distinct and passive quarantine measures” after Japan has announced that any citizen who has come from South Korea will be placed on a two-week quarantine site in a special location by the Government.
South Korean society was initially divided by the reaction of President Mun Xhe-in to the crisis.
Many Koreans have signed petitions that either endorsed the President ' s actions or called upon Mr. Mun to give an impression that the Government ' s response to the outbreak of the disease was inadequate; the pandemic has forced countries to adopt emergency legislation as a response.
Some commentators are concerned that this step will enable Governments to strengthen their powers.
In Hungary, Parliament voted to grant Prime Minister Victor Orban the indefinite right to rule by order, to suspend Parliament's work, and to conduct elections and to punish those accused of spreading fictitious information about the virus and government measures to combat the crisis.
The outbreak of the coroner was called the cause of several cases of supply shortages due to the global increase in the use of epidemic control equipment, the accumulation of goods in panic and the breakdown of production and logistics operations.
The U.S. Administration of Food and Drug Quality Control has issued warnings about the lack of medicines and medical equipment, resulting from increased consumer demand and supplier failures.
In a number of settlements, panic shopping also took place; this resulted in a situation where half of the stores had lost their first needs, such as food products, toilet paper and bottled water, which, in turn, had led to a shortage of stocks.
In particular, the technology industry is warning of delays in the delivery of electronic goods.
According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adananom, the demand for individual protection increased by 100 times.
This jump has resulted in a twenty-fold increase in prices compared to normal prices, as well as delays in delivery of medical supplies for four to six months.
It also caused a lack of individual protection throughout the world, and WHO warned that health workers would therefore be hit.
In Australia, buyers of the Daigou system were given a new opportunity to sell Australian goods in China.
These activities have led to a lack of child food in some supermarkets and have subsequently been banned by the Government of Australia. Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 in northern Italy and the Uhan region, as well as the high demand for food, food shortages have been avoided in both areas.
The measures taken by China and Italy against the accumulation of stocks and illicit trade in highly successful products have helped to avoid the severe food shortages expected in Europe as well as in North America.
Northern Italy, whose agricultural production is small, had not experienced significant declines, but, according to industry, prices for agricultural products could increase.
Poles of food shops remained empty only temporarily, even in the city of Uhan, while government officials in China provided access to pig stocks to ensure full food for the population.
Similarly, the laws requiring food producers to maintain food stocks in the event of emergencies exist in Italy.
The injury suffered by the world economy had affected China: according to the media of 16 March, China ' s economy had been severely affected in the first two months of 2020 due to measures to combat the spread of the virus adopted by the Government, resulting in a 20.5 per cent decrease in the volume of various sales.
Material China is a major economic and productive centre; therefore, it is considered that the outbreak of the virus poses a serious destabilizing threat to the world economy.
Agate Demarai, a member of the Economist Intelligence Unit, predicted that the volatility on the markets would continue until a clearer picture of potential outcomes appeared.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic impact of the current global growth epidemic could be greater than the effects of the 2002-2004 atypical pneumonia epidemic.
According to one estimate made by an expert at the University of Washington, St. Louis, the damage to the world supply chain could exceed $300 billion and could have a negative effect of up to two years.
It is reported that the Organization of Oil Exporters (OECD) began to undertake “emergency measures” after a sharp decline in oil prices due to China's demand for oil.
On 24 February, world fund markets fell due to a significant increase in the number of people infected with COVID-19 outside China.
On 27 February, due to growing concerns about the outbreak of the Crown Virus, various US fund indices, including NASDAQ-100, the S&P 500 and the Doo-Johns Index for Industrial Companies, showed the sharpest decline since 2008, while the Doo Index fell by 1191, the largest one-day drop since the 2007-2008 financial crisis.
At the end of the week, all three indices showed more than 10 per cent decline.
On 28 February, Scope Ratings GmbH confirmed China's sovereign credit rating but maintained a negative forecast.
The shares fell again due to the dangers of the spread of the coronary virus, and the biggest fall occurred on 16 March.
Many believe that there is a likelihood of an economic recession.
The economist Mohammed El-Erian commended the timely emergency measures taken by central banks and States.
Central banks are reacting faster than during the financial crisis of 2008.
Tourism is one of the most affected sectors with regard to traffic bans, the closure of public places, including tourist attractions, and the recommendations of Governments not to make any travel.
As a result of all these measures, numerous airlines cancelled flights due to a sharp drop in airline demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, and the British regional airline Flybe ceased to exist.
The impact on the cross-line industry was as strong as ever.
Several railway stations and ferry ports were also closed.
The epidemic coincided with Chung-jun, the main tourist season of Chinese New Year's celebrations.
A number of activities involving a large number of people were cancelled by national and regional Governments, including annual New Year's festivals; private companies also closed their shops and tourist attractions, such as Hong Kong and Shanghai.
Many new-year activities have been cancelled and tourist attractions have been closed in order to prevent mass accumulations of people; for example, the Ban City has been closed in Beijing and traditional temple fairs have been removed.
In 24 of the 31 provinces, municipalities and areas of China, the authorities extended the new year ' s cannicula until 10 February, indicating that most enterprises would not open until that date.
These regions accounted for 80 per cent of the country's GDP and 90 per cent of exports.
The Hong Kong authorities have raised the level of response to infectious diseases to the highest level and have announced an emergency by closing schools before March and canceling the New Year's celebration. The retail sector has suffered globally: the working hours of shops have been reduced and some shops have been temporarily closed.
The number of points of retail trade in Europe and Latin America declined by 40 per cent.
Diversification enterprises in North America and the Middle East have reduced sales by between 50 and 60 per cent.
As a result, the number of commercial centres in March fell from 33 to 43 per cent compared to February.
Trade centre operators around the world have introduced additional measures, such as improved sanitation, the installation of equipment to check the temperature of visitors and the cancellation of activities. According to the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, a recession in Latin America caused by the pandemic may leave more than 14-22 million people across the poverty line than it would have been in a similar situation, but without the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, about 5 million people lost their jobs in China during the Uhan epidemic.
Many of the 300 million Chinese migrant rural workers were found at home in their country's provinces or in the province of Hubei. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and turned to the Government for assistance.
According to the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank, in the United States, the rise in the crowning of the kroner can rob 47 million people of their jobs and the unemployment rate can reach 32 per cent. Self-insulation measures introduced in India will leave tens of millions of Indian migrant workers unemployed. A study conducted by the Angus Reid Institute has shown that 44 per cent of Canadian households have faced unemployment anyway. Nearly 900,000 Spanish workers have also lost their jobs since the introduction of severe isolation in Spain in mid-March 2020.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for a temporary unemployment benefit and 1 million British workers applied for a single social payment.
The German part-time wage scheme was also introduced in France and the United Kingdom.
The fields of art and cultural heritage have also been severely affected by the pandemic that has affected the activities of organizations, as well as individuals, whether officially employed or independent, worldwide.
Culture and art organizations have tried to support their (often funded by the State) mission to ensure access to cultural heritage for society, ensuring the security of their staff and the public, as well as, if possible, supporting the people of art.
By March 2020, museums, libraries, concert halls and other cultural institutions had been closed for an indefinite period worldwide or had access to them been limited to varying degrees and exhibitions, events and presentations had been cancelled or transferred to other dates.
Active efforts have been made to provide alternative services through digital platforms; yet another recent and emerging shift from the spread of the virus to the abolition of religious services, major sporting events and other public events, such as music festivals and concerts, technological conferences and fashion shows.
The Vatican announced the cancellation of the Easter Week in Rome, which has been held in the last week of the Christian Repentant period — the Great Post.
Many epariahs recommend that older Christians stay at home and not attend Sunday services; in some churches church services began to be broadcast on radio, in the live world, or on television, while some church leaders offered to perform outdoor services.
The Roman Catholic era of Rome closed its churches, the clocks and the square of St. Peter, where Christian pilgrims were no longer appearing, and later other religious organizations also abolished the services and restricted access to public services in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and synagogues.
The Ministry of Health of Iran announced the abolition of Friday's prayers in areas affected by the outbreak of the Crown Virus, and the shrines were later closed; Saudi Arabia prohibited the access of foreign pilgrims and their own residents to the holy places of Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has led to the most significant changes in the calendar of world sporting events since World War II.
Most major sports events were cancelled or transferred, including the UEFA 2019-20 Championships League, the 2019-20 Premier League, the Euro-20 UEFA, the 2019-20 NBA season and the 2019-20 NHL season.
The outbreak of the crown virus also destroyed plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were due to begin at the end of July; on 24 March, the International Olympic Committee announced that the event would be “transmitted beyond 2020, but not later than the 2021 summer”. Casinos and other casinos around the world were closed and poker tournaments, which are usually broadcast in the direct atmosphere, were also either transferred or cancelled.
This has resulted in many games going online, and many gambling sites report a significant increase in the number of new subscribers. The entertainment industry has also suffered as different music groups have suspended or cancelled concert tours.
Many major theatres, such as the Broadway, also cancelled all their performances.
As an alternative to traditional offline events, some artists and musicians began to explore options for continuing their activities and sharing their results online, organizing direct broadcasts of online concerts or web festivals; this helped people in creative professions to continue to perform, release or publish their works.
The network has seen a number of Internet users on the subject of the coronation virus, many of which are humorous and reflect anxiety over periods of uncertainty.
Since the advent of COVID-19, there has been an increase in entrepreneurship, xenophobia and racism with respect to Chinese and people of East Asian origin, as well as to the people of Europe, the United States and other countries.
There were cases of fear, suspicions and hostility in many countries, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
The February briefings (when most cases of infection were still limited by China) included racist attitudes expressed in different groups around the world against Chinese citizens who allegedly deserved the virus or received a fair compensation for anything.
In some African countries, there has also been an increase in anti-China attitudes.
Many of the inhabitants of Uganda and Hubei reported discrimination on the basis of their regional origin.
China's citizens, as well as those living in the affected areas of the virus, were supported both online and online.
The epidemic has begun to spread in new countries, in particular in Italy, the first country in Europe to face a serious outbreak of COVID-19; therefore, citizens of such regions may also begin to feel the influence of suspicion and xenophobia; citizens of such countries as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea have signed an early-stage petition to ban Chinese citizens from entering their countries in order to prevent the epidemic.
In Japan, the #ChineseDontComeToJapan (#ChinesesNoEnterJapan) held leading positions on Twitter.
China's citizens, as well as other Asians living in the United Kingdom and the United States of America, report an increasing level of racist attitudes and even attacks.
The President of the United States, Donald Trump, was criticized for calling the coronation “Chinese virus”; critics consider it racist and anti-Chinese.
In Ukraine, protestors attacked buses carrying Ukrainian and foreign nationals evacuated from Ukraine to New Shanghai.
Students arriving from the border with China north-east India and training in the major cities of India reported cases of the outbreak of the coroner.
Dilip Ghosh, president of the State Department of the Bharatia Janata Party, West Bengal, said that the Chinese had destroyed nature and “God has therefore avenged them”.
Later, these statements were condemned by the Chinese Consulate in Calcutta, which called them “misleading”. In China, xenophobia and racism were reinvigorated because of the pandemic against non-Chinan citizens: foreigners were called “foreign waste” and objects to be “use”.
Many newspapers with paid access to information have eliminated such restrictions for some or all of the areas affected by the coroner ' s virus.
Many scientific publishers have made their scientific articles about the outbreak of the coroner ' s virus available to the public.
Some scientists have decided to give short-term access to results of their studies on print publishing servers, such as bioRxiv.

The trafficking of wild animals and animal diseases is a health risk associated with the trade in exotic animals.
Respiratory coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and associated SARS-CoV-2 laboratory tests include methods of detecting the presence of the virus and methods of detection of antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of viruses in samples is confirmed by the OT-PCR, which recognises the coronary RNA.
This test is specific and is intended only for detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA.
It is used to confirm enough recent or active infections.
The detection of antibodies (serology) can be used both for diagnosis and for the purpose of population control.
Anti-cancer analyses indicate the number of people who have had a disease, including those whose symptoms were too small to contact them in the hospital or were absent.
The exact level of mortality from this disease and the level of collective immunity can be determined from the results of such a test.
As of March 2020, due to the limited testing capacity, no reliable data were available in any country on the prevalence of the virus among the population.
By 23 March, no country had been able to verify more than 3 per cent of its population, and information on the number of tests carried out in different countries was very contradictory.
Such differences in data are likely to have a significant impact on the recorded mortality rates that may be significantly exaggerated in some countries.
By means of a polymeric chain reaction of real-time transcription (rRT-PCR), a test can be carried out on samples of respiratory pathways obtained in different ways, including nosebones or wet specimens.
Results are usually available for a period of several hours to 2 days.
The OT-PCR test carried out on the cervix taken from the throat is valid only during the first week of the disease.
Later, the virus may disappear from the throat, yet it continues to reproduce easily.
In infected patients tested for the second week of the disease, material may be taken as an alternative from the lower respiratory tract using a dry catheter, or may be used as a reindeer.
One of the early PCR tests was developed at the Sharite, Berlin, in January 2020, using a polymeric chain reaction with real-time transcription (rRT-PCR) and a base of 250,000 sets, which was subsequently distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
By 23 January 2020, the United Kingdom also developed its test. On 28 January 2020, the South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a set for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 based on the PCD of the clinical level (PowerCheck Coronavirus).
It identifies the “E” gene, common to all beta-coronaviruses, and the “RdRp” gene, specific to SARS-CoV-2. The Chinese company BGI Group has become one of the first companies authorised by the National Drug Administration of China to use the emergency kit for detection of SARS-CoV-2 based on PCD. In the United States, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) distributes its diagnostic panel for real-time RT-PCR (2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel) in public health laboratories.
One of three genetic tests from older versions of the test kits produced incomplete results due to the lack of reagents and the narrow testing area of the CDC in Atlanta, resulting in an average of less than 100 samples per day during February 2020.
Tests using two components were not considered reliable until 28 February 2020, and only after that date public and local laboratories were allowed to start testing.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Control Office under an emergency authorisation. The US Commercial Laboratories began testing in early March 2020.
On 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced the possibility of testing for COVID-19 infection on the basis of RT-PCD across the country.
Quest Diagnostics started testing on COVID-19 throughout the country from 9 March 2020.
No quantitative restrictions were declared; the collection and processing of analyses should be carried out in accordance with the requirements of the CDC.
In Russia a COVID-19 test was developed and carried out by the State Research Centre for Virusology and Biotechnology “VEKTOR”.
On 11 February 2020, it was reported that on 12 March 2020, the Mayo Clinic developed a test to detect COVID-19 infection. On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for the use of a test that can be carried out for 3.5 hours on a large sample, allowing one machine to process approximately 4128 tests within 24 hours.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA issued an emergency permit (USA) to Abbott laboratories for the Abbott m2000 system tests; earlier, the FDA issued a similar permit to Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Cepheid also received USA from FDA for a test of approximately 45 minutes.
The FDA also approved a test using the technology for amplification of isothermal nucleic acid instead of PCR.
Since this test does not require a series of fluctuating temperatures, this method can detect positive results in just five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 such machines in the United States, and Abbott is planning to increase production to 50,000 tests a day. Taiwan is currently developing a test using a monoclonal antibody, which is specifically linked to a new nucleocapid protein (N-belt) virus, and there is hope for results within 15-20 minutes, such as a flu test.
The March 2020 review of the specialized literature concludes that “ chest X-rays have little diagnostic value at the early stages, while the results of CTs [computer tomography] may have such value even before symptoms occur”.
The typical signs identified during the CT include bilateral multi-long sub-pleural fluctuation focusses on the type of “mother glass” with peripheral, asymmetric and posterior distribution.
Sub-leural domination, the symptoms of the bulge bridge and consolidation are developing as the disease progresses.
The results of a study comparing PCR and CT methods applied in Uhana at the time of the current pandemic showed that CT is much more sensitive than the PCR, although less specific, as many of its visualization functions coincide with other pneumonia and other diseases.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology has published a recommendation “not to use CT for boxing or as a method of testing the first line in the COVID-19 diagnostics”. As of March 2020, the original CDC recommends using the PCR method.
The partial immune response to the infection is expressed in the preparation of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
These antibodies can be used to detect infections in people after the 7th day of symptoms, to determine immunity and to carry out population control. Analysis may be carried out in central laboratories (CLTs) or through on-site diagnostics (PCTs)
In many clinical laboratories, these tests will be able to perform high-production automated systems, but their availability will depend on the speed of production of each system.
A peripheral blood sample is usually used in the CLT, although serial samples may also be used to monitor the immune response.
In the POCT one blood sample is usually obtained through the passage of each cover.
Unlike PCR methods, there is no need for a blood sampling phase. On 26 March 2020, the FDA called 29 organizations that have undergone all necessary registration procedures and can now distribute their tests to the antibody.
At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European authorisations for the use of their test kits, which can be detected in samples of IgG and IgA antibodies capable of combating the virus.
The test yield is several hundred samples over a period of several hours and therefore this method works much faster than the usual PCR-analysis of the viral RNA.
The antibody can usually be detected 14 days after the infection. In early April, Britain found that none of the kits it acquired for the antibody analysis were satisfactory.
In Hong Kong, a schedule was developed to allow patients with a suspected virus to stay at home: “In case of emergency assistance, the patient is transferred to the patient’s sample,” the patient spits in, returns and receives the results of the test. British NHS announced the launch of its pilot case testing scheme in domestic conditions, which eliminates the risk of infection by other clinical visitors, or the need to disinfect the patient’s early care machine if it was used for the patient’s transport.
The expression centres helped South Korea to organize one of the fastest and most extensive testing procedures in another country. On 2 March, Germany, the National Medical Association for Compulsory Health Insurance stated that it was ready to carry out approximately 12,000 tests per day under ambulatory conditions and that only 10,700 tests per week were available.
If the survey is appointed by a doctor, the costs are covered by medical insurance.
According to President Robert Koha Institute, Germany ' s overall test productivity is 160,000 tests per week.
As of 19 March, it was proposed that an express test be conducted in several major cities.
As at 26 March 2020, the total number of tests carried out in Germany was unknown because only positive results were recorded.
The first laboratory study showed that, as of the 12/2020 SARS-CoV-2 calendar week, a total of at least 483,295 analyses were taken, including by week 12/2020, and 33,491 samples (6.9%) were positive. The researchers at the Israeli Clinics Technion and Rambam Hospital developed and tested a method of simultaneous testing of samples taken by 64 patients, combining samples and carrying out further analyses only if the combined sample showed a positive result. In Uhana, on February 5, 2020, BGI opened a temporary laboratory 2000 sq.m. for the detection of emergency cases called "Huo-Jan" (a Chinese-based sample to show a positive result.
The construction of the laboratory was organized by the founder of BGI Van Xianum and completed within five days; the modelling showed that if the laboratory had not been put into operation at such an accelerated rate, cases of disease in Hubee would have been 47 per cent higher and, accordingly, quarantine costs would also have been twice as high.
After the opening of the Uhana laboratory, the Huo-Jan laboratories were immediately opened in Shanghai, China, Beijing, and Shanghai — a total of 12 cities in China.
By 4 March 2020, the total capacity per day was 50,000 tests per day. Open multiplex Origami Assays schemes were issued, which could test up to 1,122 patient analyses on COVID19 with only 93 samples. Such balanced designs can work in small laboratories, except for the use of robotized fluid manipulators.
In March, due to the lack and insufficient number of reagents, mass testing in the EU, Britain and the United States became a problem.
As a result, some authors referred to the test sample processing protocols, which provide for the heating of samples at 98°C (208°F) for 5 minutes in order to release the RNA genes for further testing. On 31 March, it was announced that the extent of the test for coronation carried out by the United Arab Emirates per capita at present exceeded the rates of any other country, and the majority of the population would soon be tested.
This was due to the possibility of an express test, as well as the acquisition of Group 42 and BGI of a mass testing laboratory for the population (based on their laboratory for the detection of Huo-Jan emergencies in China).
This 14-day laboratory is capable of carrying out tens of thousands of RT-PCD tests a day and is the world's first laboratory of such a scale working outside China.
Various testing options for various parts of the genetic profile of the coroner were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization adopted a German version of the production of test kits that are being sent to low-income countries with no resources to develop their own sets.
The German version was published on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the United States health and epidemiological centres was not available until 28 January, leading to the lack of testing kits in the United States. At the beginning of the explosion in China and the United States, there were problems with the reliability of testing kits, and these countries, as well as Australia, were unable to provide the sufficient number of kits recommended by health experts.
And here in South Korea, according to experts, the widespread availability of testing has helped to reduce the spread of the new coronation virus.
For several years, the Government of South Korea has been working on the provision of testing facilities, mainly in private laboratories.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization called for the development of testing programmes to be developed as a better way to slow down the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of the increase in the demand for rapid virus spread, many private laboratories in the United States, which received hundreds of thousands of samples of analysis, were overloaded and stockpiles of brain and chemical reagents were rapidly depleted.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of its test kits.
The American test kits developed by the CDC had “deficit” and therefore the Government removed bureaucratic barriers that prevented private testing. Spain acquired test kits from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the results of these kits were incorrect.
The company explained that the lack of results could result in failure to collect samples or improper use of sets.
The Spanish Ministry stated that it would respond to miscalculations and replace them with other sets of Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the test kits that the Czech Republic had acquired in China had produced incorrect results. 1.2 million of the test kits acquired by Slovakia in China had also been found to be inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matovic suggested that they be dropped in Danube. Atesh Kara, a Turkish Ministry of Health, claimed that the tests purchased in China had “high error” and the Ministry “did not use them”. Britain bought 3.5 million test kits in China, but in early April 2020 it was announced that these sets were not suitable for use.
Quarantine measures for those whose analyses had produced positive results for SARS-CoV-2, as well as positive results for those who had been contacted by such patients.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Bó, where for the first time in Italy, a person died from COVID-19, conducted two cycles of testing for the entire population of some 3,400 people, with a period of about ten days.
About half of the people with positive results had no symptoms, and all patients with confirmed disease cases were quarantined.
The entry into the territory of the human settlements was closed, and this measure completely stopped the spread of the infection.
Under intensive contact monitoring, restrictions on entry, testing and quarantine measures of the 2020 Crown Virus pandemic in Singapore, much less tensioned than in other developed countries, and there was no need to impose such extreme restrictions as the forced closure of restaurants and shops.
Many activities were cancelled there, and Singapore began on 28 March to urge residents to stay at home, but schools where the cannicles had ended on 23 March were open on schedule.
Several other countries, such as Iceland and South Korea, also coped with the pandemic through intensive contact tracking, restrictions on entry, testing and quarantine, but were less aggressive.
The statistical study showed that in countries where more tests were carried out than the number of deaths, mortality rates were much lower, probably because more patients with weak symptoms or lack of symptoms were identified.
WHO recommends that countries with no resources for mass testing, as well as national laboratories with limited experience with COVID-19, send their first five positive and first ten negative results to COVID-19 in one of the 16 WHO control laboratories for confirmatory testing.
7 of these 16 control laboratories are located in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
The next graph of the " positive results " column depends on the country-specific testing policy.
The country where only hospitalized patients are tested will have a higher positive result in percentages compared to the country where all citizens are tested, regardless of the presence of virus symptoms, under other equal conditions.
Handwashing, also known as hand hygiene, is a process of cleaning hands to remove pollution, fats, micro-organisms or other harmful substances.
Regular washing of hands with soap at certain “critical moments” during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhoea and cholera, which are transmitted orally.
A person may also be infected with respiratory diseases, such as flu or normal cold, such as unwashed hands when touched by the eyes, nose or mouth (i.e., sliding clouds).
Five critical points during the day after which hands should be washed with soap: before and after disinfection, after washing the child’s jockeys or change of pancakes, before feeding the child, before eating, and before and after cooking or processing raw meat, fish and poultry.
If water and soap are not available, hands can be cleaned with gold. The World Health Organization recommends washing hands:
Before, during and after cooking.
Before and after treatment for a sick person.
After changing the towels or washing the child in the toilet.
After snorkeling, coughing or chichinia.
After contact with animals, feed or waste of animal origin.
Hand medical care is related to medical procedures.
Wash hands before taking medicines or medical procedures will prevent or minimize the spread of the disease.
The main medical purpose of hand washing is to clean hands from pathogens (bacterials, viruses or other microorganisms capable of causing diseases), as well as from chemicals that may be harmful or cause certain diseases.
This procedure is particularly important for people who are preparing food or working in the medical field, but it is also important for all others.
Handwashing is very useful for health: for example, it minimizes the spread of influenza, coronation and other infectious diseases, prevents infectious diarrhoea, reduces the spread of respiratory infections,
as well as lowering infant mortality among households.
The 2013 study showed that more quality washing of hands could lead to a slight increase in the growth of children under the age of five.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates associated with respiratory and diarrheal diseases may be reduced by adopting simple habits, such as washing hands with soap.
This basic procedure can reduce the mortality rate from these diseases by almost 50 per cent.
Regular reminder of the benefit of hand washing may reduce the number of cases of diarrhoea to about a third, and this should be compared with the benefit of providing low-income regions with clean water.
The 48 per cent reduction in diarrhoea cases can be related to washing hands with soap. Washing hands with soap is the only most effective and inexpensive way to prevent diarrhoea and acute respiratory diseases (LDIs), provided that appropriate habits are developed in each house, in schools and other public places around the world.
Pneumonia, one of the major complications of ORI, is the major cause of death among children under the age of five, who have a lifetime of about 1.8 million children a year.
Diarrhoea and pneumonia in general kill nearly 3.5 million children annually.
The United Nations Children ' s Fund reports that washing hands with soap before and after meals and after toilets that become a solid habit can save more lives than any individual vaccine or medical intervention, and reduce the mortality rate from diarrhoea almost twice and the mortality rate from acute respiratory infections to a quarter.
Handwashing is usually combined with other sanitation activities carried out under water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) programmes.
Handwash also prevents the emergence of immunosuppression, which is transmitted by direct physical contact.
The small negative effect of frequent washing of hands is that it can lead to drying of the skin and is likely to lead to damage.
The 2012 Danish study showed that too often hand washing can lead to tingling and tingling of the skin – a disease known as eczema or dermatitis, which is especially common among health workers.
Excessive hand washing may also be considered one of the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five so-called “critical moments” during the day when washing hands with soap is important to reduce the risk of faecal or oral transmission of the disease: after emptying (sweeping, disinfection), after washing the child’s jockeys (change of pancreas), before feeding the child, before eating and before and/or after cooking raw meat, fish or birds.
Some other cases where hands should be washed in order to prevent transmission of the disease: before or after the treatment of the cut or wounds, after chewing, coughing or smearing, after touching the waste of animal origin or animals, after touching the trash.
In many countries the procedure for washing hands with soap has not been widely used.
A study on hand washing in 54 countries in 2015 showed that on average 38.7% of households wash hands with soap is a generally accepted practice. The study in 2014 showed that the highest rate, 97%, was recorded in Saudi Arabia; the United States was close to the middle, 77%; the lowest rate was recorded in China – 23%. Currently, there are several methodologies for changing behaviour and developing hand washing in critical situations. In developing countries, group washing of hands is one of the methods used to help children learn how to do this.
The Emergency Medical Assistance Programme, implemented by the Ministry of Education of the Philippines, is an example of large-scale activities to strengthen child health and raise the level of education of children.
The national programme is based on degelminization, which takes place twice a year, as well as daily washing of hands with soap and daily brushing.
The same programme has been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The removal of micro-organisms from each cover is more effective if the washing process is accompanied by soap or detergents.
The main effect of soap and molybdenum is to remove the barriers to solubility and increase its level.
Water itself is not considered an effective means of cleaning the skin, as fats and proteins, which are components of organic contamination, are poorly dissolved in water.
A sufficient amount of water, however, contributes to the cleaning process.
Solid honey may also contain bacteria that may fall on it when used before use.
A small number of studies on the fall in each layer of bacteria from a contaminated piece of solid honey indicate the low probability of such fall, since the bacteria are laughing at the penis.
The CPC still argues that “sweet soap with a hand doctor is a preferred option for hand washing”.
Antibacterial soap is actively promoted in communities that are concerned with their health.
There is no evidence to date that the use of recommended contraceptives or disinfectants has had a selective effect on organisms that are resistant to antibiotics by their nature.
However, antibacterial myeloma contains common antibacterial agents, such as triclosane, to which many resistant strains of organisms are resistant.
Thus, even if strains resistant to antibiotics are not selective in relation to antibacterial soap, their effectiveness may not correspond to the advertising.
In addition to surface-active substances and skin protection agents, complex compounds may contain acids (axious, ascorbine, milky) as regulators of RN, as well as antimicrobial active benzoic acid and other residues (aloe faith, vitamins, mentol, plant extracts). The complex analysis by the University of Oregon School of Public Health showed that in order to prevent diseases and remove bacteria from the skin, simple varieties of soap are as effective as conventional antibacterial soap containing triclozane.
Hot water that is comfortable for human skin is still not hot enough to kill bacteria.
The bacteria reproduce much faster at the body temperature of 37°C.
However, for the removal of natural fats that contain pollution and bacteria, warm salt water is more effective than cold.
In contrast to popular opinion, research has shown that the use of hot water does not affect the reduction of the micro load on the hands.
The hand disinfectant (sanitiser) or hand antiseptic is a hand hygiene tool that does not contain water.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, alcohol-free hand hygiene tools (also known as alcohol-based hand disinfectants, hand disinfectants or sanitizers) became popular.
Most of these are made from isopropyl alcohol or ethanol with additives such as carbomer (acrylic acid polymer) in the form of gel, or moisturizers, such as glycerine in a liquid or foam form, which facilitate the use of these substances and reduce the effects of alcohol drying.
Adding diluted hydrochloric acid further increases antimicrobial activity; disinfectants containing at least 60 to 95 per cent of alcohol effectively destroy microbes.
Alcohol-based disinfectants kill bacteria, including multi-drug-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis, as well as some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccination, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi.
Disinfectants containing 70 per cent of alcohol kill 99.97 per cent of bacteria (a 35 decibel reduction log) in the hands after 30 seconds of use and 99.99 per cent to 99.99 per cent of bacteria (a 4-5 reduction log) in the hands after 1 minute of use.
Alcohol disinfectants are practically ineffective against the type of norovirus (or Norwalk) virus, the most common cause of the infection gastroenteritis. A sufficient number of antiseptics or alcohol-containing agents should be used to treat and treat the skin thoroughly on both sides.
The face and back surface of the two bearings, as well as the space between the fingers throughout the length of time, shall be grown for about 30 seconds until the fluid, penis or gel are completely questioned.
The U.S. Centre for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that the use of disinfectants be selected for the benefit of hand washing rather than for the use of disinfectants, especially if the hands are heavily contaminated.
The increase in the popularity of such disinfectants is due to the simplicity of their use and the rapid destruction of micro-organisms, but they should not be a substitute for full washing of hands if water and soap are available.
The frequent use of disinfectants for alcohol-based hands may cause dry skin if their composition does not contain softening agents and/or moisturizers.
The effect of alcohol drying can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerine and/or other softening substances.
In clinical trials, hand disinfectants containing attenuating components caused significantly less irritation and dryness of the skin than soap or antimicrobials.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact point syndrome or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives present in disinfectants are practically non-existent.
The lower likelihood of contact dermatitis was a factor in the choice of disinfectants compared to salt and water.
Despite their effectiveness, non-water resources do not wash their hands from organic substances but simply disinfect them.
That is why hand disinfectants are less effective in preventing the spread of many pathogens, such as conventional soap and water, as pathogens are still on hand when they are used.
The effectiveness of the disinfectant for non-alcoholic hands depends largely on components and composition and has historically been significantly lower than alcohol or alcoholic beverages.
Recently, it has been demonstrated that benzene chloride products have persistent and cumulative antimicrobial activity in contrast to alcohol, which has been shown to lose efficacy after multiple use, probably due to progressive side effects.
Many people in low-income communities cannot afford salt and replace it with gold or clay.
Gold or clay can be more effective than just water, but they will always be less effective than soap.
One problem with this method is that if clay or gold is contaminated by microorganisms, it may, on the contrary, increase the spread of the disease.
Like honey, gold is a disinfectant, since it is a small solution when it comes to water.
If honey is not available, it is recommended that gold or sand be used as an alternative to WHO.
To prevent infection, the U.S. Centre for Disease Control recommends the use of hand washing techniques, including the following steps:
Wash your hands under warm or cold running water.
It is recommended that running water be used because standing water can be contaminated and the water temperature does not necessarily matter.
Help your hands to spread them with a large amount of honey, including the back of the lawns, as well as the area between fingers and nails.
Honey removes the microbes from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more closely when using soap (not just one water).
Three hands at least 20 seconds.
The strain helps remove the microbes from the skin, and the longer you get the third hand, the more the microbes are removed.
Carefully wash your hands under running water.
Swallowing your hands in standing water can cause re-infection.
Wash your hands with clean water or let them dry up on their own.
Wet hands and wet hands are more likely to be contaminated. Most often, people leave such areas as large fingers, fingers, fingers, and nails unattainable.
The artificial nails and shimmering elbows for nails may contain a number of microorganisms.
It is often recommended to use a moisturizing loon to prevent the drying of hands that may cause skin damage and increase the risk of infection.
If running water and soap are not available, there are many different ways of washing hands: pouring water out of the hanging canister or bottled tissue with opened openings and/or using gold, if necessary, for example in developing countries. In places with limited water supply (e.g. in schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are water conservation solutions such as foot-and-mouth cranes and other non- expensive options.
A foot - pedaled crane is a simple structure made up of a rope - hung structure and a foot nut that should be pressed to pour water into the hands, and a piece of soap should be used.
The effective drying of hands is an integral part of the hygiene process, but there are some disputes about the most effective form of drying in public toilets.
The increasing amount of research shows that paper drawers are much more hygienic than hand-held electric dryers installed in many toilets.
In 2008, the University of Westminster in London conducted a study sponsored by the European Symposium on Paper Solips and Pockets; this study compared the hygiene of paper pouchs, hand-held dryers and more modern hand-held flow dryers.
It was found that after washing and drying hands in a hot air dryer, the total amount of bacteria in the fingernails increased by 194 per cent on average and 254 per cent on landings.
It was also found that after washing and drying hands in the air-flow dryer, the total amount of bacteria in the thumbs increased by 42 per cent and 15 per cent in the pans.
After washing and drying, the total number of bacteria in the fingertips is reduced to 76 per cent on average and in the laundromats to 77 per cent. Researchers have also conducted tests to determine the possibility of cross-contamination of several visitors to the toilet room and the toilet environment in each type of drying.
Air-dryer, which emits air at declared speeds of 180 m/s (650 km/h, 400 m/h), is capable of evaporating micro-organisms from the hand and from its own block and potentially infecting other users of the toilet room and sanustium within a radius of up to 2 metres.
The use of hand dryers with warm air spreads micro-organisms in the radius up to 0.25 metres from the dryer.
In 2005, TÜV Product und Umwelt conducted a study on various dry hand methods.
The following changes in the number of bacteria are observed according to the dry hand method:
There are many different producers of hand dryers, and hand dryers are compared to dry paper sinks.
Cleaning hands with disinfectant valves may be an alternative during trips when there is no salt and water.
The hand disinfectant must contain at least 60 per cent of the alcohol.
The medical method of washing hands became mandatory long after Hungarian physician Ignatz Zemmelweis found it to be highly effective (in 1846) in preventing disease in stationary conditions.
There are electronic devices that remind hospital staff of the need to wash their hands if they forget about it.
According to one study, the use of such devices actually helps to reduce the level of infection.
Medical hands wash takes at least 15 seconds, using a large amount of soap, water or gel to wash and remove each part of the hands.
Your hands should be gently drawn to each other by shaking your fingers.
If there is dirt under the nails, damage can be used to remove it.
Since microbes can remain in the water on their hands, it is important to wash them thoroughly and drain them with clean water.
After drying the hands, closing the tap and, if necessary, closing and opening any doors, use a paper drawer.
This prevents the repeated contamination of hands from these surfaces.
The purpose of washing hands in medical facilities is to remove and prevent the spread of pathogens (microbs).
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the routine of hand washing remains unacceptable in most medical institutions: a large number of doctors and nurses regularly forget to wash their hands before contacting patients, thus spreading microorganisms.
As a result of one study, proper washing of hands and other basic procedures may reduce the level of catheter-related blood infections by 66 per cent. The World Health Organization has published a leaflet in the form of a standard washing and hand treatment procedure to be applied in the health sector.
The WHO Manual on Hand Healing is also available on its website and is open for public discussion.
The relevant review was conducted by Whitby in co-authorship.
If compliance with the normative requirements is required, commercial devices may be used to measure the indicators and check the hygiene.
The World Health Organization means “five moments” when hands are washed:
after contact with blood or biological fluids,
prior to use of antiseptics, as well as
Adding antiseptic chemicals to the myeloma by washing hands (medicine or antimicrobial myeloma) helps destroy bacteria.
Such antibacterial properties may be necessary prior to surgery or in the environment with high levels of antibiotic-resistant organisms. To “clean” hands before surgery, a crane can be included and excluded without affecting its hands; a little chlorhexidine or iodine should also be used to wash hands, a sterile wiper to dry hands after washing, a sterile wound to exercise and another sterile tool to clean under the nails.
All decorations must be removed.
This procedure requires the washing of hands and forearms to the elbow normally within 2-6 minutes.
There's no need to shake hands too long, for example, 10 minutes.
At the time of application, the water should not fall back on the wrists.
After the wash is finished, the hands dry with sterile tissue and put on a surgical coat.
To reduce the spread of microbes, wash your hands better or use an antiseptic for your hands before and after treatment.
In order to combat staphylococcus infections in hospitals, it was found that the highest benefit of handwashing was the first 20 per cent of the wash and that very few additional benefits were obtained when the handwashing rate was increased by more than 35 per cent.
Compared to the antibacterial soap wash, the usual soap wash results in more than three times the frequency of bacterial infections transmitted through food. The comparison of the handwashing solution and the handwashing of antibacterial soap, on average, 30 seconds per procedure, showed that handwashing reduced bacterial contamination by 26 per cent compared to antibacterial soap.
However, honey and water are still more effective than hand alcohol solutions, in order to reduce the number of influenza A H1N1 virus and the dispute of Clostridium difficile. Hand hygiene activities in medical facilities may include training of hand washing personnel, increasing the availability of hand alcohol-containing solutions, as well as written and oral reminders of the need to wash hands.
Further research is needed on the most effective types of measures in various medical institutions.
In developing countries, hand washing has been recognized as an economically effective and important tool for improving health and even food.
However, the lack of stable water supply, soap or washing facilities in homes, schools and workplaces makes it difficult to develop routine hand washing habits.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, not every private or public toilet has taps to wash hands, although there are cheap ways to wash hands in such places.
However, inadequate hand hygiene can also be caused by inherited habits, not by lack of salt or water.
The promotion and promotion of handwashing can affect political decisions, raise awareness of the benefit of handwashing and bring about long-term changes in the behaviour of the population.
In order to ensure the effectiveness of such measures, results should be monitored and evaluated.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that, to improve the health situation in low-income countries, effective community-level health and epidemiary surveillance is being carried out, while public marketing campaigns are less effective. One example of this is the United Nations Three Star Approach Children ' s Fund ' s Approach: it promotes simple economic measures in schools that encourage the washing of hands with soap and other hygiene requirements.
By ensuring compliance with minimum standards, schools can increase their level from one to three stars.
The establishment of handicrafts is one of the possible steps being taken in the context of hand hygiene campaigns to reduce the level of disease and child mortality.
The Global Hand Washing Day is another example of an information campaign aimed at changing behaviour. As a result of the 2019-20 Crown Virus pandemic, the United Nations Children's Fund promotes the use of gestures that symbolize washing hands.
Some studies considered the overall effectiveness of hand washing in developing countries compared with DALYS (reserved years of life without disabilities).
However, one study suggests that stimulating the washing of hands with soap is a much more economical solution than other sanitary measures.
The importance of washing hands for human health — especially for vulnerable categories of people, such as young mothers or wounded soldiers in hospitals — was first recognized in the middle of the 19th century by two people in the field of hygiene: the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis, working in Vienna (Austria), and Florence Nightingale, the English nurse and “the founder of modern care for the sick”.
At that time, most people still believed that the infections were caused by the smells of filth called myasms.
In the 1980s, due to outbreaks of diseases spread through the food treaty and infections related to medical care, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States had become more active in promoting hand hygiene as an important measure to prevent the spread of infection.
As a result of the outbreak of swine flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, people in many countries have become better aware of the importance of washing hands with soap to protect the body from such infectious diseases.
For example, in Germany there were posters with “right hand washing techniques” in public toilets, as well as in office buildings and airports.
The phrase “to wash hands” means the expression of an unwillingness to accept responsibility for or to be a participant.
It comes from the Bible, Matthew’s Gospel: Pontius Pilate “washed his hands ” when he made a decision about the enthronement of Jesus Christ; then this phrase was used more widely in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's play, Lady McBeet begins to wash her hands unprovokedly in an attempt to cleanse herself of the imagined Friday, symbolizing an unclean conscience, in connection with the crimes she committed herself and motivated her husband to commit.
It was also found that people who recalled or observed some non-ethical conduct tend to wash their hands more often than others, and that handicrafts were more important to them.
Also, it is less likely that people who have the opportunity to wash their hands after seeing them will participate in any other “cleaning” compensatory activities, such as voluntary activities.
In religions the washing of hands has both a hygienic purpose and a symbolic meaning. The symbolic washing of hands with water, but without mercy, is part of the ritual prescribed in many religions, including Bahaism, Induism, Tevilah and netilat yadayim in Judaism, Lavabo in Christianity and Wudhu in Islam. Religions also prescribe the hygienic washing of hands, especially after certain acts.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam require mandatory washing of hands after a toilet visit.
In Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism and Islam, it is considered necessary to wash hands before and after each meal.
Control of production factors for COVID-19
Control of production factors in connection with COVID-19 involves the application of safety and health methodologies to control the risks and fight against the 2019 crown virus (COVID-19).
Appropriate monitoring of risks at work depends on the place and job, based on risk assessment, the seriousness of the community epidemic and the risk factors for individual workers who may be vulnerable to COVID-19.
The U.S. Office for Labour and Industrial Hygiene (OSHA) reported that low-risk posts had minimal professional contacts with the public and colleagues, and in such cases basic measures were required to combat infection, including hand washing, encourage workers to stay at home on the signs of the disease, respect for the respiratory label, and daily cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
The average risk responsibilities require frequent or close contact with persons with no confirmed or suspected diagnosis of COVID-19, but there is a likelihood of infection due to the current spread of the disease in society or during international travel.
Such a category may include workers who contact the public, for example in schools, high-density work environments and some large retail stores.
Risk control measures for such a group, in addition to basic measures to prevent infection, include ventilation using high-efficiency air filters, use of protective screens and available personal protective equipment in case of contact with a person infected with COVID-19.
OSHA believes that medical personnel and morgues who contact a person with a confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19 infection are in the high risk category; this increases the risk to a very high level in the conduct of aerosol education procedures or in the collection/processing of samples from a person with a confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19.
The risk control measures applicable to such staff include the use of engineering and safety equipment, such as negative pressure ventilation rooms, as well as personal protective equipment suitable for the purpose.
The bursting of COVID-19 can have different types of effects on the workplace.
Workers may be absent from work because of their own illness, the need to care for others, or the fear of possible infection.
Commercial patterns may change with respect to both the types of goods on which demand is made and the ways in which such goods are acquired (e.g. purchases during periods of nepic delivery or service without leaving the car).
Finally, it is possible to break the supply of goods from geographical regions affected by COVID-19. The plan for preparedness and response can be used to provide protection.
The plans address risks related to various workplaces and tasks, including sources of infection, risk factors for households and communities, as well as risk factors for individual workers, such as age or chronic diseases.
The plans also indicate the means of monitoring necessary to address such risks, as well as emergency plans for situations that may result from the epidemic.
Plans to prepare for the epidemic and to implement response measures may be made subject to national or state recommendations.
Some of the objectives of responding to the epidemic are to reduce the spread of the virus among staff, to protect people at higher risk of serious health complications, to maintain business operations and to minimize negative impacts for other organizations in their supply chains.
Responses affect the severity of the disease in the community where there is a business.
The risk-control hierarchy is a structure widely used in safety and health care to group such funds according to efficiency.
If it is not possible to eliminate the risk of COVID-19, the most effective engineering and safety tools, then administrative measures and, finally, personal protective equipment.
Safety engineering means that staff are isolated from workplace-related risks and are not dependent on the behaviour of the employee, which may be the most economically advantageous solution.
Administrative measures involve changes in working policies or procedures requiring action by an employee or an employee.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than engineering or administrative measures, but may help to eliminate some risks.
All types of personal protective equipment should be selected depending on the risk to the worker, approach the size (e.g. respirators), use regularly and properly, regularly, check, maintain, and replace, as necessary, and properly remove, clean and maintain or be used to avoid infection.
The U.S. Office for Labour and Industrial Hygiene (OSHA) believes that the least-risk posts have minimal contact with the public and their colleagues.
Basic measures to combat the epidemic recommended for all workplaces include frequent and thorough washing of hands, recommendations for sick workers to stay at home, compliance with the respiratory label, including closing of the mouth by coughing and chewing, providing waste bins and containers, ready for removal or replacement, where necessary, recommendations for workers to avoid the use of other tools and equipment, as well as daily cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
The rapid detection and isolation of persons who could potentially be infected is a critical step in protecting workers, clients, visitors and others at work.
The U.S. Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that staff with symptoms of acute respiratory diseases remain at home until the end of the fever, lack of an increased body temperature and many other symptoms for at least 24 hours without the use of fire-fighting agents or other anti-symptoms, as well as provide for the flexibility of hospital policies, allow staff members to stay at home to care for the sick family member and to raise awareness of such policies.
According to OSHA, high-risk posts require frequent and close contact at a distance of not more than six feet (1.8 m) with persons with no confirmed data or suspicions of COVID-19 infection, but there is a likelihood of SARS-COV-2 infection due to the spread of the disease in the territory of the business or the recent travel of such a person to COVID-19.
Such categories include personnel who are in contact with the public, such as schools, high density working environments and some large retail shops. These include engineering and safety tools for such groups and groups with higher risk include the installation of high-efficiency air filters, increased ventilation intensity, installation of physical barriers, installation of transparent plastic protection screens, and installation of spare parts for customer service without leaving the car. Administrative measures for such groups and higher risk groups include the recommendations for sick workers to stay at home, the replacement of personal meetings for communication with virtual means, the establishment of shifting schedules, the termination of non-critical travel to repair sites, the installation of emergency procedures for repairing of computers, the development of emergency equipment, the development of emergency equipment and the development of emergency equipment for the development of emergency equipment, the development of emergency personnel, the development of emergency equipment and the development of emergency equipment for investigation and the development of emergency equipment.
In rare cases, staff members of such a group may need to carry breathing equipment.
If a person is ill on a plane, such measures as the isolation of the sick person from other persons at a distance of 6 feet, the appointment of a member of the crew for the care of the sick person, the provision of a sick mask or the treatment of such a person with the request to cover his nose and mouth with a helmet or a cap.
The second-degree crew members must wear one-time medical gloves when approaching the sick traveller or when contacting the physiological fluids or potentially contaminated surfaces and possibly additional personal protective equipment if the patient has a fever, regular cough or difficulty breathing.
The gloves and other items used should be placed in a biologically safe bag and the infected surfaces should subsequently be cleaned and disinfected. In cases of commercial navigation, including cruise liners and other passenger ships, safety measures include the delay of a trip in the event of a disease, isolation and immediate information of the medical centre on board a ship when hot or other symptoms are present on board.
Ideally, the medical examination should be carried out in an isolated cabin of such a person; in the case of schools and childcare facilities, the CDC recommends that a short-term closure be made for cleaning or disinfection if the infected person is in a school building, regardless of the prevalence of the disease in the community.
In the presence of a minimum or average level of spread of infection in the community, social distance strategies may be introduced, such as the cancellation of visits to personal meetings, meetings and other mass activities, such as exercise of physicoculture or cow pen, the reception of food in cafes, increased distance between parties, the adjustment of time of arrival and care, the limitation of non-essential visits, the use of a separate location of health institutions for children with influenza symptoms.
In addition to strategies for social exclusion, large-scale school attendance may be considered at a significant rate in the local community; for law enforcement officials carrying out daily duties, direct health risks are considered to be low, according to the CDC.
Law enforcement officials who are required to contact persons with a confirmed diagnosis or suspicion of COVID-19 infection are recommended to follow the same instructions as those prescribed by the quick aid boxes, including the use of appropriate personal protective equipment.
In the event of close contact during detention, workers must clean and disinfect their formal straps and equipment before re-use by domestic cleaning aerosols or by distancing, comply with standard operating procedures for preventing the spread of the disease and the use of personal protective equipment, as well as for the use and use of clothing.
OSHA believes that some categories of health institutions and morgues are at high or very high risk.
High-risk posts include medical assistance, support, laboratory and transport personnel contacting patients with confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19 infection.
They have a very high risk of infection in the course of aerosol education procedures or in the collection/processing of samples from persons with confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19 infection.
Procedures accompanying aerosol education include screening, coughing, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and surveys or sampling using invasive methods.
High-risk Mortgage staff include staff dealing with persons with confirmed disease or suspected COVID-19 infection at the time of their death; if such staff are exposed, they fall under a very high risk category; additional engineering and safety equipment for such risk groups include the use of isolated facilities for patients with confirmed disease or suspected COVID-19, including in aerosol education procedures.
In some health institutions and morgues, special ventilation with negative pressure may be an effective measure.
Tests should be carried out in accordance with the precautions provided for the level of biological safety 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients be allocated to separate waiting areas depending on the suspicion of COVID-19 infection. In addition to other personal protective equipment, OSHA recommends that workers who work up to 6 feet in collaboration with patients with confirmed disease or suspicion of SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as those who conduct aerosol education procedures, be used.
In the United States, approved NIOSH respirators for N95 or higher-grade filter should be used in an integrated respiratory protection written programme, which specifies requirements for individual selection of funds and medical examinations.
Other types of respirators can provide more effective protection and comfort for the staff member. WHO does not recommend the use of spices because COVID-19 is a respiratory disease, not through physiological fluids.
WHO recommends that only surgical masks be used for patient screening staff.
WHO recommends wearing a surgical mask, protective eyes or a protective screen for the person, helmets and gloves for persons who collect breathing samples from patients with COVID-19 or carriers of this disease without procedures associated with aerosol education.
In conducting aerosol education procedures, a breather N95 or FFP2 should be worn instead of a surgical mask.
Given the lack of individual remedies around the world, WHO recommends that such remedies be minimized by the use of remote medical facilities, physical barriers, such transparent eyelashes, access to a patient infected with COVID-19, only those who provide direct care, the use of only the personal remedies necessary for a specific purpose, the long-term use of the same respirator, without taking away, while working with several patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordination of the supply chain of personal remedies and the recommendation not to use masks for persons with no symptoms.

Theme: [Covid-19] Relief and preparation for the future
DATE/ TIME OF REVISION: 14 March 2020, 00:24 UTC
DECISIONS: CC0: No rights protected
This month we live in unusual circumstances.
The COVID-19 epidemic is a phenomenon that sheds light on the relationships between people of the world and our responsibility to each other.
We did not have precedents for such problems, but we know that the effectiveness of our actions depends on the capacity of compassion, cooperation and development of communities around the world, which is at the heart of such an organization.
We have seen friendly and caring relationships among all our colleagues, as reflected in electronic subscriptions, phone calls, and chats — a remarkable confirmation of the fact that, fortunately, we are working with strange people.
I am very grateful and proud to speak of you as colleagues.
Last week, I was informed of the high value of our work.
I was reminded of how important it is for the world to have the opportunity to visit Wikipedia right now and how useful it is for every person to have online access to this key resource.
And this is possible because of your work, whether it is to ensure the ability of websites, to pay our colleagues or to protect the safety of communities.
The world needs information from Wikipedia, and today it is even more important than ever.
In order to achieve significant results for peace, it is not only what we do but also how we do it.
In view of the importance of such a mission and your role in this process, we will make important changes in the order in which we work together, starting with the coming week.
Correction of our work and schedules
As Robin had said earlier, the "c-team" team met last night to discuss our approach and schedule for the coming days and months.
During the communication, we considered our ideas on the most effective measures in the current situation and the best ways to ensure the sustainability of the organization during that period.
The overwhelming majority of us wanted to remove tension and support our long-term mission.
If you want to step back, let it be.
For all staff, contractors and out-of-work staff:
In our expectations, it will take about 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week before the next orders are made.
We do not announce the departure days: if you can work normally for more hours, this is permitted for the purposes of our mission.
However, the world is now unpredictable; no matter what your needs are, whether you care for your family, buy food, or go to the doctor’s office, your well - being is our priority number one.
We're not following your working hours.
If you're sick, you shouldn't work.
It's understandable and undisputed, but we're talking about it.
There is no need to make a hospital letter or note: simply inform your manager and help the team to review the calendar and schedule to ensure the coverage of key areas.
(If you have a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, report to Brian from T&C Ops so that T&C can provide support and proper attention from the guidance to your situation).
The hourly rates will be paid in full.
We have already announced and reaffirm our intention to comply with our obligations to our contractors and hourly staff.
Each person will be paid according to normal hourly rates applicable under normal circumstances.
This includes periods of illness when you cannot work.
If you want to work, we'll support you.
Many people use their jobs as a way to put their efforts into the world around us.
What we do can bring wonderful results, especially at such times.
And again, it's about self-help.
We ask you to contact our leader so that we know what to expect and can adjust our actions accordingly.
Some types of work are considered essential.
We must always support such activities.
The SRE, HR Ops, Trust&Safety and Fundraising (including others) teams are doing critical work that may require additional support.
We are initiating a process for all units to assess the current objectives and focus on providing support, which is extremely important to our mission.
There are many challenges for each of us, and we are just focusing on the most important projects.
The delay today does not mean a negative impact in the future.
We do not intend to work “two more to turn the missing” after the end of the pandemic.
You will not have to work overtime to meet unrealistic deadlines for the current time.
We recognize that circumstances have changed and that we will work on setting new goals and deadlines, if possible.
What is happening to APP (annual plans)?
In order to build on the new reality and expectations of daily working time, we intend to adjust the deadlines for the implementation of our annual plan for 2020-2021.
We intend to propose an extension of deadlines for our 2019-2020 plan, thus providing more time for budgeting, which will allow staff members to give priority to critical work, self-help and care for their loved ones, while ensuring a reduced schedule for the next few weeks for all who need or want to work.
This extension of time limits greatly reduces the current planning burden and tension across the organization.
The following week, we will present our proposal to the Council, to inform representatives and teams of relevant information on the next steps immediately after receipt of the relevant confirmation.
Thank you to the APP team for their leadership.
Status of office, risks and cleaning
Last week, we learned that one of our colleagues in San Francisco could be infected with a COVID-19 virus.
However, in addition to many precautions, we have hired a anti-virus cleaning team to disinfect all surfaces in the office in San Francisco.
They used anti-virus solutions of the medical class to disinfect all surfaces, as well as reception and elevator halls through which access to our floor can be made possible.
The building has its own rules that require caution, using products that ensure the safety of its tenants.
We feel that the office will be well prepared for the period when we decide to return.
Our office in the District of Colombia (DC) is in the WeWork network, which shared with us and all the staff in DC with its rules related to COVID-19.
Last week, our office in the district of Colombia moved completely to remote work in accordance with the instructions received in San Francisco.
As some of our colleagues from New York know, we also discussed the rental of premises in Brooklyn.
Such discussions continue but can be postponed.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
Our old colleagues who work far away are aware of the possibility of adjusting the situation and would like to give you some advice:
It is recommended to limit meetings to one or two hours.
If necessary, consider the possibility of dividing them into a course of several days.
Please clearly define the purpose of the meeting, the agenda and disseminate the information in advance.
By default, use video communication to facilitate interaction and communication using tools such as Google Docs and Zoom.
For convenience, appoint a coordinator, a person who will monitor the entry and control the list of speakers, as well as the person responsible for taking notes (or sharing views).
If necessary, contact the technical support service via e-mail.
Take advantage of the Wellness Remuneration program when you buy breakfast.
Join the #remotes channel in Slack to talk to your colleagues about the distributed work.
The HR Operations team is studying the Ergonomics Guides available in web form to promote the effectiveness of distributed work across the organization.
Last week, we asked all community grant recipients to cancel the mass activities funded by Wikimedia, such as “editathons”, until WHO announced the end of the pandemic.
We understand and report that our requests for such cancellations and other restrictions may lead to the impossibility of carrying out concerted activities on grants, and no one will be punished for the delays or changes in such objectives.
Next week, we will conduct follow-up activities with additional instructions on Wikimania, as well as other regional and thematic conferences of the community.
The overall spirit of the global community is not only a feeling of regret over the interruption of work, but also a sense of relief from understanding and the opportunity to focus on their own communities, Wikimedia and not only.
With regard to prospects, CRT is working on a Meta-Wiki page, which will provide space for the community to monitor the impact and society.
We remain in contact with issues related to COVID-19
We will send an invitation to your calendar for a special staff meeting to be held on Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07/00 PT.
This time we take advantage of the opportunity to share more relevant information, answer your questions, and spend time together with each other.
We are together in this situation and are ready to help everyone we can.
You can continue to receive information from such an electronic census and other important information about COVID-19 from the Office Wiki.
CRT will update such pages and all information will be collected in one place.
We are also working on maintaining regular communication with staff living in countries that have had a significant impact on the current situation.
If you have travel issues, activities, key workflows, information awareness issues or other assistance if necessary, contact CRT.
We are ready to support and communicate as necessary.
In case of confidential issues, please contact Brian Juden (Bryan Judah), director of HR International Operations.
No such change should be seen as a rejection of our work and our obligations.
Rather, it is a recognition of the current need for the heart-to-heart adaptation of our work and our commitments.
We believe that such steps are necessary to support one another and to enable us to continue to work, to provide the necessary support to our movement and to the whole world through the necessary service.
Our planning work will wait until the time is right.
Today is the time to support one another and to create space for important work in the coming weeks and perhaps months.
To do this, we will need help from each and every one of you; and we will need you to be able to take care of yourself and your families, and to work with the maximum effect as soon as that need arises.
Now, please, help your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, Tony S) and other Leadership Team members (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme attached to the outer surface (cell membranes) of cells in light, arteries, heart, pancreas and bladder.
ACE2 counteracts the activity of the corresponding angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), reducing the levels of angiotensin II and increasing Ang (1-7), making it a promising solution for treating cardiovascular diseases. AC2 also serves as an entry point for some coronary viruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 is a zinc-containing metal ester, located on the surface of endothelial and other cells.
The ACE2 protein contains the N-concealed peptide domain M2 and the C-concealed transport domain of the renal amino acid collection.
ACE2 is a single-step membrane type I protein, and its fermentingly active domain falls on the surface of the cells of light and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of ACE2 is secreted from the transmemrated domain by another enzyme known as cheedase, and the soluble protein obtained is released into the bloodstream and eventually released with urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 is attached to the cell membrane of most light type II alveolar cells, thin tissue enterocytes, arterial and venous endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells of most organs.
Biosynthesis ACE2 IRNA is also found in the brain core, striatum, hypothalamus and the brain stem.
The main function of ACE2 is to act as an antidote to ACE.
ACE spreads angiotensin I hormone into co-administered angiotensin II.
ACE2, in turn, removes the carboxylic acid phenylaniline amino acid from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyses it into a vasodilating angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also secrete a number of other peptides, including [des-Arg9]-bradykinin, appellate, neurotensin, dinorphine A and greekin.
ACE2 also regulates the membrane transport of the transporter of neutral amino acids SLC6A19 and is present in Hartnup.
As a transmembed protein, ACE2 serves as the main entry point for some coronary viruses, including HCV-NL63; SARS-CoV (SARS-induced virus); and SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19-induced virus).
In short, the binding of the S1 protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 to the fermenting domain of ACE2 on the surface of the cells leads to endocitosis and translocations, both of the virus and of enzymes in endosomes located within the cells.
This induction process also requires the adoption of S-proteasone serum TMPRSS2, which is currently being studied as a potential therapeutic agent, which has led some to the idea that reducing ACE2 levels in cells can help in the fight against infection.
However, many professional communities and regulators recommend continuing standard treatment with AFP and BRA inhibitors.
According to the systematic review and meta-analysis published on 11 July 2012, “the use of AFP inhibitors was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of pneumonia by 34 per cent compared to the control group”.
Moreover, “pneumonia risk was also reduced in patients who received AFP inhibitors who were at higher risk of pneumonia, especially in patients with stroke and heart failure.
The use of AFP inhibitors was also associated with a reduction in pneumonia mortality, although the results were less reliable than those of patients with a general risk of pneumonia.”
Recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is expected to be a novelty in treatment with severe mild injuries and appears to improve legid hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in patients with severe respiratory failure syndrome caused by lipopolysaccharides.
The period of half-life of rhACE2 in humans is approximately 10 hours and the onset of action is 30 minutes in addition to the duration of exposure at 24 hours.
Some data indicate that rhACE2 may be a promising tool for people with a hypersensitivity to the classic renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or with diseases with increased circulating angiotensin II. The rhACE2 was evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Annexes COVID-19 are applications for mobile phones intended to assist in the epidemiological investigation into the pandemic of the Crown Virus 2019-20, i.e. identifying persons (“contacts”) who could contact the infected person.
In some regions, a number of annexes have been developed or proposed, officially supported by the authorities.
Several options have been developed to track contacts.
This led to a discussion on confidentiality issues, particularly those based on the geographical location of the application users.
More flexible options in this regard include the use of Bluetooth signals to register the user ' s proximity to other mobile phones.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple announced that they would combine their efforts to integrate functional support for such applications through Bluetooth directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Government, together with Alipay, has deployed an annex that enables citizens to check whether they have had contact with people infected with COVID-19.
It is used in more than 200 Chinese cities, and an application called TraceTogether is used in Singapore.
The annex has been developed by local IT companies, has an open source code and will be transmitted to the Government. North Macedonia has launched the StopKorona Annex, which works on Bluetooth, which helps track contacts with potentially infected people and ensures an operational link with health authorities.
The annex was jointly developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As at 14 April 2020, the application was expected to register in the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the Government stated that the contact tracking application was at the final stage of development and would be available for deployment for several weeks. Similar applications are planned to be launched in Ireland and France (StopCovid).
Australia and New Zealand are considering applications based on Singapore TraceTogether and the BlueTrace Protocol. Russia intends to use an application with a geosonation function to ensure that patients with a COVID-19 diagnosis in Moscow do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, professor of security, University of Cambridge, identifies a number of potential practical problems that may arise with applications-based systems, including false formulations and potential inefficiency in the use of only a small part of the population.
Given the concern about the proliferation of misleading or harmful “coronavirus” applications, Apple has limited the list of types of organizations that may offer their applications related to the kronavirus to the App Store, including only “official” or other reliable organizations.
Google and Amazon have also introduced similar restrictions.
Participants in the Privacy Campaign expressed concern about the impact of mass surveillance on the population through the applications related to the coronary virus; in particular, the question was raised whether the monitoring infrastructure created to combat the coronary pandemic would be dismantled when the threat was gone.
The International Amnesty and over 100 other organizations have issued a statement calling for such a restriction.
The organizations have announced eight conditions for their public projects:
Monitoring should be “legal, necessary and proportionate”;
Increased monitoring and monitoring should be accompanied by restrictions on the limitation of time;
The use of data should be limited to the objectives of combating the spread of COVID-19;
The security and anonymity of the data must be protected and evidence of such protection must be provided;
Digital surveillance should exclude cases of exacerbation of discrimination and marginalization;
Any exchange of data with third parties shall be defined at the legislative level;
Protection against abuse must be guaranteed and the right of citizens to respond to abuses;
The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter Without Borders) (RSF) also published their list of conditions.
Google and Apple offer their joint plan to address the problem of permanent monitoring, which is to remove the tracking mechanism from their operating systems as soon as necessary.
In some countries, network tracking is used instead of applications, which excludes the need to load the application and the possibility to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network tracking was approved.
Network decisions that have access to baseline location data also have major potential issues of confidentiality.
However, not all central server systems should have access to location personal data; a number of confidentiality systems have been developed that use central servers only for communications (see section below).
In South Korea, a non-application system was used as a basis for tracking contacts.
Instead of using the special annex, the system collected tracking information from various sources, including data on tracking mobile devices and card transactions, and then merged them to create notifications in the form of text messages sent to potentially infected persons.
The Government has not only used this information to warn citizens about potential contacts with infected persons, but has also made it available to the public, as a result of significant changes in the information protection legislation that were introduced after the outbreak of the MERS in that country.
Access to such information can be obtained through a number of applications and websites; countries, including Germany, are considering the possibility of using both centralized and confidential systems.
As at 6 April 2020, details had not yet been published.
The tracking of contacts with confidentiality is a consistent concept, a significant amount of research literature dated at least in 2013. As of 7 April 2020, more than ten expert groups have been working on confidentiality decisions, such as the use of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to register the user ' s proximity to other mobile phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a product of coordination efforts, which include both centralized and decentralised approaches and are not a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include a decentralized confidentiality trace (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, fka Contact EventNumbers, CEN), confidentiality protocols, mobile contact tracking mechanisms (PACT) and others.
These protocols are responsible for ensuring that the identified personal data never leave the device and that all comparisons occur on it.
The Privacy Group, MIT Media Lab, is developing SafePaths, a platform that ensures confidentiality in the collection and use of location or cross-sectional data to track the spread of COVID-19.
The work of this platform is based on the research published in Apps Gone Rogue: Managing Personal Privacy in an Epidemic, published in March 2020. Another similar project is the SafeTrace platform developed by Enigma MPC, a company that developed confidentiality technology, which was also originally based on MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses reliable hardware to allow users to exchange confidential data on location and health with other users and officials without risking the confidentiality of these data.
On 5 April 2020, groups sharing the same approach and using similar protocols were based on a global coalition of TCNs aimed at reducing fragmentation and ensuring the global compatibility of monitoring and reporting applications, which was a key factor in their widespread dissemination.
On 9 April 2020, the Government of Singapore announced that it had opened the BlueTrace source code used in its official annex.
On 10 April 2020 Google and Apple, companies that control the operation of mobile Android and iOS have announced a contact tracking initiative, which they have claimed will ensure confidentiality, and which is based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy and cryptography technology that allows confidentiality.
They also published the technical characteristics of the main technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system must be deployed in three stages:
the deployment of tools to enable Governments to establish official annexes to monitor the movement of people infected with the coronation virus, but to maintain the confidentiality of data
By integrating this function directly into iOS and Android, Google and Apple plan to solve problems with constant monitoring, first by installing the system through the update of the operating system and then removing it the same way after the threat is gone.
Reposition of the medicinal product (also known as re-profile, redirection, change of tasks or therapeutic redirection) is a re-procession of an approved medicinal product to treat a disease or medical condition that is different from the disease originally intended for development.
This is one of the sciences that is currently being used to develop safe and effective COVID-19 treatment methods.
Other studies include the development of a vaccine from COVID-19 and the transfer of cheap plasma. SARS-CoV-2 contains about 66 proteins that are affected by medicinal products, each of which has several Ligand binding sites.
Analysis of these binding sites serves as an appropriate basis for the development of an effective anti-virus drug against COVID-19 proteins.
The most important targets for SARS-CoV-2 are papayain-like protease, RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase, helixase, S protein and ADF-ribophosphate.
Hussein AA and co-authors in their clinical study have studied several candidate compounds, which were then optimized, and analysed their similarity to the structure of the most approved medicinal products in order to accelerate the development of a highly effective anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug, which will be recommended for clinical trials.
Chloroquine is an antimalarial medicine that is also used to treat some autoimmune diseases.
On 18 March, WHO announced that chloroquine and its associated hydroxychloroquine would be included in the four medicinal products studied in the Solidarity clinical trial.
The Governor of New York, Andrew Kuomo, announced that chloroquin and hydroxychloroquine tests would begin in the state of New York on 24 March. On 28 March, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquin sulfate and phosphate chloroquine in accordance with the U.S. Emergency Authorisation.
The treatment regimen was not approved during the FDA clinical trial process and was only authorised under the USA as an emergency treatment for patients who have been hospitalized but cannot receive treatment under clinical trial regimens.
CDC stated that “the use, dosage or duration of administration of hydroxychloroquine for the prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection” has not yet been established.
Doctors say they use the medicine when there is no other way out.
The Turkish research group in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc and vitamins A, C and D.
Large-scale research is being carried out at Duke University and Oxford University.
The University of New York Medical School in Langone is studying the safety and effectiveness of the prevention of the use of hydroxychloroquine.
China's clinical trials in Uhan and Schengen have shown that favipyrvir is “highly effective”.
35 patients in Schengen who took this medicine had a negative result on average after 4 days, while 45 patients who did not take it had a disease duration of 11 days.
A study was conducted in Uhana, where 240 patients with pneumonia were monitored, one half of whom received favipiride and the other half received humifenevir.
The Italian Agency for Pharmaceuticals reminded the public that the results of the product effectiveness were low and should not be considered final.
On 2 April, Germany announced that it would purchase a drug in Japan to fill its stocks and that it would be delivered to university hospitals, where it would be used to treat patients with COVID-19, with military resources.
According to South China Morning Post, Sindzo Abe has reported to the Thramp Administration that it can buy a medicine, which may be less effective in the event of an outbreak.
It may be dangerous for pregnant patients or patients who are trying to become pregnant.
A study on the combination of lopinavir and ritonavir (Caletra) antiviral medicinal products concluded that “the efficacy of the use of the medicinal products has not been established”.
Medicinal products have been developed to inhibit the replication of HIV by linking it to protease.
A group of researchers from the University of Colorado is trying to modify medicinal products to find a combination that will be associated with SARS-CoV-2 protease. In the scientific community, they are criticizing the re-profiling of medicinal products that have been developed specifically for HIV and AIDS therapy.
WHO included the combination of lopinavir and ritonavir in the international solidarity test.
Remdesiver was created and developed by Gilead Sciences for the treatment of Ebola virus and Marburg virus infections. Later, Gilead Sciences staff discovered that remdesiver has antiviral activity in vitro with respect to the number of filo-, pneumo-, paramix- and coronaviruses.
One of the problems associated with anti-virus treatment is the development of resistance through mutations that may lead to more serious diseases and their transmission.
Some early preliminary studies show that remedesiver may have a high genetic barrier to resistance; several clinical trials are currently being carried out, including two university clinics in Cleveland; one is carried out in patients with moderate disease and the other in patients with more severe disease.
Three clinical trials are currently being conducted for the internal introduction of vitamin C for people who have been hospitalized with a serious form of COVID-19: two placebo-controlled studies (China, Canada) and one without placebo (Italy).
On 24 March 2020, an azithromycin antibiotic test was started in New York State.
The Japanese National Centre for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) plans to conduct a clinical study of Alvesco (cyclosonide) Tejina, an inhaled corticosteroid for asthma treatment, for its use in the treatment of pre-symptom patients infected with new coronary disease.
Phase II test, the form of angiotensin converting enzyme 2, is conducted with the participation of 200 patients from Denmark, Germany and Austria hospitalized with severe disease to determine treatment effectiveness.
Researchers from the Montreal Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases, Canada, are currently studying the role of colchicine in reducing burnout and mild complications in patients with low-expressed COVID-19 symptoms.
For a study called COLCORONA, 6000 adults aged 40 years and over were diagnosed with COVID-19 with mild symptoms that did not require hospitalization.
Women who are pregnant, breast-feeding and who do not use effective contraceptives cannot participate in the study.
In Italy, there are several coagulants on the test.
Low molecular heparin is widely used for the treatment of patients, which has prompted the Italian Medicines Agency to make recommendations on the use of this medicine.
A multicentre study involving 300 patients on the use of enoxaparin sodium in prevention and therapeutic doses was announced in Italy on 14 April.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, significant scientific focus has been placed on the re-profiling of approved anti-virus products that have been developed for previous epidemics, such as MERS, SARS and the West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: ribavirin was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of the Chinese recommendations.
Umifenovir: Umifenovir was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th edition of Chinese recommendations
Some antibiotics have been found to be potentially suitable for use as COVID-19 treatment:
Tocilizumab (anti-IL-6 receptor): approved in China.
Tests also in Italy and China, see Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against coronation virus 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has undergone clinical trials, numerous attempts have been made to develop such a vaccine.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that it was not expected that the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine could be obtained earlier than 18 months later.
Five vaccine candidates conducted phase I safety studies in April.
COVID-19 virus was detected in December 2019.
In 2020, the outbreak of this disease spread worldwide, leading to significant investments in the development of vaccines and research activities in its context.
Many organizations use published genomes to develop possible vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
As announced in April, the key objectives of the CEPI Vaccine Development Initiative are to ensure the necessary speed, production capacity, wide deployment and global access.
In April, scientists reported that in early 2020 there were 10 different technology platforms at the research and development stage to establish an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
Some of the main objectives of the Platform included in Phase I security studies are:
Nucleic Acid (DNA and RNA) (Designer of Phase I and Vaccine Candidate: Moderna, IRNA-1273)
virus vector (stage I developer and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologicals, adenvirus type 5)
As reported by CEPI in April, 115 potential vaccines are in early stages of development, 78 of which are used in approved active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute); in addition, another 37 candidates were reported, but there is little common information available (probably at the planning or development stage).
Phase I-II pre-tests for safety and immunogenicity are usually randomized, placebo-controlled and several sites with more accurate and effective doses at the same time.
Phase III tests usually involve more participants, including the control group; at this stage, the medicinal products are tested for disease prevention and side effects at optimal doses are monitored at the same time.
Of the 79 candidates in active development (as confirmed at the beginning of April 2020), 74 have not yet been tested per person (are still in the phase of doclinical studies).
On 24 January 2020, the University of Queensland, Australia, announced that it is investigating the potential of a molecular vaccine that genetically modifies viral proteins to stimulate immune response.
On 24 January 2020, the International Centre for Vaccines (VIDO-InterVac) of the University of Saskatchewan, Canada, announced the launch of its own vaccine to begin human testing in 2021.
Vaccine development projects were also launched at the China Centre for Disease Control and Prevention on 26 January 2020 and at the University of Hong Kong on 28 January.
On 29 January 2020, the pharmaceutical companies Jansen and Hanneke Schuitmucker, in their head, announced the start of work on their vaccine.
Janssen is developing an oral vaccine with his partner in Vaxart's biotechnology.
On 18 March 2020, the Emergency BioSolutions announced a productive partnership with Vaxart for the development of a vaccine.
On February 8, 2020, the OncoGen Laboratory in Romania published a document on the development of a technology vaccine similar to that used for cancer vaccination.
On 25 March, the Head of the Research Institute announced the completion of the vaccine synthesis and the initiation of tests.
On 27 February 2020, the subsidiary Generex, NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology, announced that the Peptide Ii Key against COVID-19 was starting a project.
Their goal was to develop a vaccine candidate that could be protested in people in 90 days.
On 5 March 2020, the University of Washington, St. Louis, announced its vaccination projects.
On 5 March 2020, the United States Army Command on Medical Research and Materials, Fort Detrick, and the Walter Reid Research Army Institute, Silver Spring, located in western Maryland, announced that they were developing their vaccine.
On 10 March 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced that it had entered into partnership with Novavax Inc.
for the development and production of the vaccine.
Partners also announced plans for phase I clinical trials and clinical trials by July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, the Ministry of Health of India announced that they were studying 11 isolated patients, and that even in an accelerated course of vaccine development, it would take at least two and a half years.
On 12 March 2020, Medicago, a biotechnological company in Quebec, reported that they had been created by the Canadian Institute of Health Research with partial funding.
The potential vaccine is being conducted by laboratory studies and human testing is planned for July or August 2020.
Earlier this week, The Guardian reported that President Donald Trump had proposed CureVac for exclusive access to the Covid-19 vaccine, against which the Government of Germany protested.
On 17 March 2020, the American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced the conclusion of a partnership with the German company BioNTech for the joint development of an IRNA-based vaccine.
BNT162 is a candidate for an IRNA-based vaccine; the product is currently undergoing clinical trials and clinical trials will begin in April 2020.
On 17 March 2020, the Italian biotech company Takis Biotech announced that in April 2020 it would receive clinical trials and their final vaccine candidate could start testing in the fall.
On 19 March 2020, the Epidemiology Innovation Coalition (CEPI), France, announced an investment of $4.9 million in a COVID-19 vaccine consortium involving Pasteur Institute, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh.
Other CEPI investment partners in the development of a vaccine from COVID-19 are Moderna, Curevac, Inovo, Novavax, University of Hong Kong, Oxford and Queensland.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists began testing six different animal vaccines.
Researchers at Imperial College, London, announced on 20 March 2020 that they are developing a self-amplified RNA vaccine from COVID-19.
The vaccine candidate product was developed within 14 days of obtaining a sequence from China.
At the end of March, the Government of Canada announced the allocation of $275 million to 96 research projects on medical countermeasures against COVID-19, including the development of numerous vaccine candidates in Canadian companies and universities, such as Medicago and University of Saskatchewan.
At the same time, the Government of Canada announced the allocation of 192 million Canadian dollars specifically for the development of a vaccine against COVID-19, as well as plans for the establishment of a national “Vaccine Bank”, where several new vaccines could be used in the event of a new outbreak of the coronary disease.
On 2 April 2020, researchers from the University of Pittsburgh Medical School reported on PittCoVacc, a possible vaccine against COVID-19 in mice, saying that “MNA introduced subunital vaccines SARS-CoV-2 S1, causing strong responses to an antigen-specific antibody [in mice] that occurred 2 weeks after immunization”.
On 16 April 2020, the Canadian School of Pharmaceuticals of the University of Waterloo announced the development of a potential vaccine based on DNA, which may be released in the form of a social spray.
DNA bacteria will reproduce within human bacteria and produce harmless virus-like particles that can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.
In March 2020, the Government, industry and three U.S. universities pooled IBM supercomputers in combination with Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google cloud computing.
Some vaccines have heterological effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means that they may have other advantages than disease prevention.
Another randomized study in Australia covers 4170 health workers.
The vaccine may prove to be dangerous or ineffective.
Early studies on the efficacy of animal models with COVID-19, such as ACE2-transmitted mice, other laboratory animals and lower primates, indicate the need for measures to prevent biosafety 3 infections in the treatment of live viruses, as well as international coordination of standardised safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested in animal models.
As of 2020, there are no medicinal products or protective vaccines for the treatment of SARS that would be safe and effective for humans.
According to research work published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and medicinal products for the treatment of atypical pneumonia was a priority for Governments and public health institutions around the world.
When the spread of MERS was begun, it was considered that the SARS study, which was carried out at that time, could be a standard for the development of vaccines and therapeutic agents against the infection of MERS-CoV.
As of March 2020, there was one (DNA-based) MERS vaccine, which took place in phase I clinical trials in humans, and three other vaccines, all of which were virus-based vaccines and were under development, two adenviruses (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one MVA vector (MVA-MERS-S).
The theory of the conspiracy was spread on social networks, claiming that the COVID-19 virus was not new at all and that the vaccine already existed.
Social media publications quoted the words of some patients who claimed that there were patents on the genetic sequence of other strains of the coronary virus, such as SARS, as well as vaccines for these strains.
Coronavirus is a disease detected in 2019 (COVID-19) which is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome of coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The most common symptoms include nausea, cough and difficulty breathing.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhoea, throat pain, loss of appetite, and pain in life.
The time between the first onset of symptoms and the peak of the disease is usually about five days, but may also vary from two to fourteen days.
Most cases have mild symptoms, but in some cases, the disease has become viral pneumonia and polyorganic deficiency.
As at 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases of infection were reported in 210 countries and regions, with more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have recovered. The virus is mainly spread when people are in close contact with each other, often through microscopic drops of air in the cough, coughing or conversation.
Although these droplets are formed when they are released, they usually pose a threat, falling to the ground or to the surface, but are not transmitted through long-range air.
People are also infected with contaminated surfaces and then their eyes, nose or mouth.
The virus can live on the surface for 72 hours.
It is the most infected within the first three days of the onset of symptoms, although its spread may be possible both before and at later stages. The standard diagnostic method is a polymeric chain reaction with real-time transcription (RT-PCR) on the sample taken as a nutshell.
The use of medical masks is recommended for patients with suspected disease and for those who follow them.
Recommendations on the use of medical masks vary among the population: some agencies recommend not using them at all, some recommend using them, and others require them.
There is currently no vaccine or specific treatment for COVID-19.
Local spread of the disease has been registered in most countries in all six WHO regions.
Infected persons may not have symptoms or have flu symptoms, such as nausea, cough, fatigue and swelling.
Extreme symptoms include difficulty in breathing, constant pain or feeling tightness in the chest, confusion in consciousness, difficulty in awakening, sweating of the face or lips; if the symptoms mentioned above are present, medical attention should be sought immediately.
Restrictive symptoms of upper respiratory tract diseases such as itching, itching or sore throat may occur.
Also, different percentages of gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea, are observed.
Some cases of diseases registered in China were initially only associated with breast depression and congestive heart beats.
In some cases, the disease may progress by developing pneumonia, a polyorganic deficiency, and eventually death.
This is called the incubation period.
The incubation period of COVID-19 usually consists of five to six days, but may vary from two to 14 days.
In 97.5% of people, symptoms begin to appear for 11.5 days after infection; according to the available data, symptoms are not present in all infected people.
The role of such unsymptomised carriers in the transmission of the disease is still unknown, but the preliminary data indicate that they may contribute to the spread of the infection.
The percentage of people infected with an unsymptomatic disease is currently unknown and is only being studied, while the Korean disease control and prevention centres (KCDC) reported that 20 per cent of all confirmed cases and hospitalizations related to the disease were unsymptomatic.
The National Health Commission of China began to include unsymptom cases in its daily summary as of 1 April; of the 166 cases of infections registered on that day, 130 (78%) were rejected as unsymptomatic at the time of testing.
Both wet and mucous membranes can have a higher concentration of the virus.
There are more hats in the air than there are in the normal noise.
A study conducted in Singapore showed that open castle droplets can reach a distance of up to 4.5 metres (15 ft).
The virus is usually not transmitted by air, but the National Academy of Science has suggested that the transfer of the particles of the virus to bioaerosols is possible, and the air testing of air collected by air collectors located in corridors outside the human room has shown the presence of the virus RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiac rejuvenation (SDR), can lead to the spread of respiratory products and therefore to the spread of the virus in the air.
There are also concerns that the virus may spread through the faeces, but this risk is considered low. The virus is the most contagious when people have symptoms; the spread of the virus may be possible even before symptoms occur, but this risk is small.
Officials of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) claim that it is not quite clear how easily the virus is spread, yet it is known that one patient is usually infected by 2-3 other people.
In particular, it was found that on the cardboard surface the virus was able to live for one day, on the plastic surface (polypropylene) and on the stainless steel (AISI 304) up to three days, and on 99% of the copper surfaces up to 4 hours.
These indicators vary, however, depending on the humidity and temperature.
Mild and malleable agents, when properly used, have a good effect on the fight against infection: hemorrhage destroys the fatty protective layer of the virus, thus deactivating it, and is able to remove it from the surfaces of the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as Benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (surgical disinfectant), were less effective against this virus. During a study conducted in Hong Kong, samples were taken on average two days after hospitalization.
In five out of six patients, the first test showed the highest concentration of the virus in the blood, and in the sixth patient the highest level of the virus in the blood was detected on the second day of the test.
Severe acute respiratory coronary syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new severe severe coronary respiratory syndrome, the first finding in three people with pneumonia from a group of acute respiratory diseases registered in Uhana.
All signs of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are also found in coroner families.
While outside of the human body, the virus is destroyed by domestic soap, which secretes its protective shell. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
Light is the body most affected by COVID-19 because the virus penetrates the host cell through angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is the most common in light type II alveolar cells.
The virus is combined with ACE2 and penetrates the host cell using a typical surface glycoprotein, a “ship” (peplomer).
12 per cent of people infected with Uhana had severe myocardial infarction, which was more frequent in severe disease.
The incidence of cardiovascular symptoms is high due to systemic inflammatory response and immune system violations during disease progression, but acute myocardial damage may also be associated with the presence of ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are present in the heart in large quantities as they participate in this body.
High incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) were observed in patients with COVID-19 IOTs and may indicate adverse forecasts.
Although SARS-COV-2 has a tropic to ACE2-expressive epithelial pathways, symptoms of systemic hyper-inflammation are observed in patients with severe COVID-19 duration.
In particular, it was found that pathogens of GM-CSF T-cells were correlated with the recruitment of inflammatory monocytes that were distributing IL-6 and a severe pathology for patients with COVID-19.
Lymphocytic infiltrates have also been detected during opening.
WHO has also published several test protocols on this disease.
The real-time polymeric chain reaction (RT-PCR) is a standard method of testing.
The test is usually carried out on breathable samples obtained with a nostril moss, but may also be used with a nose or wet moss.
The results are usually prepared for a period of several hours to two days.
Blood tests can also be taken, but they require two blood samples taken within two weeks and their results do not have direct relevance.
Chinese scientists have been able to identify the strain of the coroner and publish its genetic sequence so that scientists in laboratories around the world can develop tests on their own by means of a polymerous chain reaction (PCD) to detect the presence of the virus.
As at 4 April 2020, antibodies tests that could detect infection at the current time, as well as the possibility of infection in the past, were under development, but had not yet been widely disseminated.
China's experience in examining the results of the tests showed that their accuracy was between 60 and 70 per cent.
On 21 March 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Quality Control Office (FDA) approved the first on-the-spot diagnostic test, authorized its application at the end of this month. The diagnostic instructions issued by the University of Žjunnan University of Uhani showed methods for detecting infections based on clinical characteristics and epidemiological risk.
Bilaterally long-lasting subspecies of the “mother glass” with peripheral, asymmetrical and posterior distribution are common symptoms detected at the early stages of the disease.
Sub-leural domination, the symptom of the bulge bridge (depleted fatigue with variable alveolar filling) and consolidation are developing as the disease progresses.
There are few data on microscopic defeats and pathophysiology of COVID-19.
Main results of the pathological study conducted in the opening:
Macroscopy: pleuritis, pericarditis, swelling and swelling of light
Four types of viral pneumonia can be observed:
light form of pneumonia: swelling of light, hyperplasia of pneumocytes, large atypical pneumocytes, interstitial sleep with lymphocyte infiltration and multi-nuclear giant cells
severe form of pneumonia: diffuse alveolar injury (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudation.
DAD is the cause of severe respiratory distress syndrome (ORDS) and severe hypoxaemia.
Pneumonia: the organization of alveolar exhumations and leguminous interstitial fibrosis.
Blood: Diffuse intradystrial reflux (DVS) syndrome; leukoerythroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the risk of infection include housekeeping, avoidance of human sites, frequent washing of hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, compliance with respiratory hygiene rules, and avoiding eye contact, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a sofa during cough or chewing, or, in the absence of a sofa, covering the mouth and nose on the inside of the elbow zone.
After coughing or chewing, it is recommended to perform a quality hand hygiene procedure.
The Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the use of tissue masks in public places, in particular with a view to limiting the transmission of infections to people with an unsymptomatic disease; social distance strategies are aimed at reducing the contact of infected patients with large groups of people; these measures have closed schools and businesses, restricted the movement of citizens and abolished large public activities.
The distance recommendations also imply that people should be at least 6 feet (1.8 m) apart.
There is no proven effectiveness against COVID-19; as the completion of the vaccine is expected not earlier than 2021, the main part of the measures against COVID-19 spread is to reduce the peak of the epidemic, known as “platinum exit”.
The CDC also recommends more frequent washing of hands with salt and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after the toilet or when the hands are thoroughly contaminated, as well as before and after eating, coughing or chewing.
The CDC also recommends using a disinfectant containing alcohol (containment of at least 60 per cent of alcohol) for hand processing, but only where salt and water are not available.
These compounds use ethanol or isopropanol with antimicrobial activity.
Aquifers are used to eliminate bacterial alcohol disputes and are not an appropriate means of antiseptic treatment.
Glycerol is added as a damper.
Patients have been shown to be supportive of therapy, which may include infusion therapy, oxygen support, and support for other life-threatening organs.
The CDC recommends that those suspected of being infected with the virus wear a regular medical mask.
Extracorporative membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to solve the problem of respiratory failure, but its benefits are still being studied.
To strengthen immunity, compliance with personal hygiene, healthy lifestyle and diet are recommended.
Maintenance methods can be shown to patients with mild symptoms at early stages of the disease. WHO and the National Health Commission of China have published recommendations for the care of patients hospitalized with COVID-19.
In the United States, doctors for intensive therapy and pulmonaries have summarized the therapeutic recommendations of various institutions in the free resource, IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific COVID-19 treatment.
For the treatment of symptoms as a first-line medicinal product, some medical professionals recommend choosing paracetamol (acetaminophen) as compared to ibuprofen.
In the implementation of procedures in which air drip emissions, such as intubation or hand-drying, may occur, caution should be taken to minimise the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in medical facilities.
Medical staff caring for people with COVID-19 recommend that the CDC be placed in an AIR — an additional measure in addition to standard contact and air precautions. The CDC issued recommendations on the use of individual protective equipment (SIZ) during the pandemic.
Recommended means of individual protection: protective helmet, respiratory or medical mask, eye protection and medical gloves. Of the above, it is preferable to use breathing masks rather than medical masks.
The N95 respirators are approved for industrial use, but the FDA has authorized the use of these respirators in accordance with the U.S. Emergency Respirator.
They are designed to protect from particles in the air, such as dust, but the effectiveness of a specific biological agent is not guaranteed when not used as instruction.
If medical masks are not available, CDC recommends using protective facial screens or, in the end, making masks on their own in domestic settings.
In most cases, the flow form of COVID-19 is not difficult enough to require artificial ventilation of the light or its alternatives, but there is also a certain percentage of cases where this is necessary.
The type of respiratory support for hospitalized patients with respiratory impairment associated with COVID-19 is currently being actively studied, with some evidence that intubations can be avoided by means of an inhaled air stream or two-level positive airway pressure.
It is not yet known whether any of these two ways for patients in critical conditions are as effective as the HIV.
Some doctors choose to use invasive mechanical ventilation as it is readily available because this method significantly restricts the spread of particles in the air compared to the nose ducts with an intense air flow. The risk of a severe form of disease for older people (those over 60 years of age, and especially those over 80 years of age) is much higher.
In many developed countries, there is insufficient hospitalization per capita, and health systems are too limited to deal with a sharp increase in the number of cases of COVID-19 infection in a severe form of hospitalization.
As a result of a study conducted in China, 5% of patients were hospitalized in intensive care facilities, 2.3% needed mechanical support for light ventilation and 1.4% completed.
In China, about 30 per cent of people hospitalized with COVID-19 eventually recover.
The challenge of artificial ventilation is complicated, as the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that develops with COVID-19 and oxygenation is becoming more and more problematic.
Inhaled IVL and PDKC support is needed to deliver the maximum amount of oxygen into the light and to ensure minimal ventilation damage to the air, which can lead to pneumothorax.
In earlier models, high VDCs may not be available.
Potential treatment studies began in January 2020 and several antivirals are currently in clinical trials.
Remedesivir is the most promising.
The development of new medicinal products may take up to 2021, but some of the products tested have already been approved for other purposes or are in the final stages of the tests.
Antivirals may be tested in patients with severe disease.
The recommended WHO volunteers participate in the efficacy and safety tests of potential treatment methods. The FDA has provided temporary authorisation for the use of the recombinant plasma as experimental treatment in cases where life is at risk of serious or immediate danger.
Its application was not subject to clinical trials to be conducted to prove the safety and efficacy of the treatment.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile application to combat disease outbreaks.
To enter, users must enter their name and identification number.
The Annex can detect “close contact” through monitoring data and therefore identify the potential risk of infection.
Each user may also check the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is identified, the annex not only recommends self-insulation, but also provides a notification to local health authorities. The analysis of large data collected from mobile phones, identifying technology, tracking of mobile phones and artificial intelligence is used to track infected people and persons they have contacted in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Government of Israel authorized security authorities to track data on mobile phones of people suspected of being infected with the coronary disease.
Measures have been taken to ensure quarantine and protection for persons who can contact infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, in order to investigate and prevent the spread of Deutsche Telekom virus, the Federal Public Institutions of Germany and Robert Koha Institute provided aggregate data on the location of hundreds of subscribers.
In Russia, identification technology was introduced to identify quarantine offenders.
The Regional Health Commissioner for Italy, Julio Gallera, said that hundreds of network operators reported that “40 per cent of people are still moving on the territory”.
The Government of Germany has conducted a 48-hour departure-day programming marathon with more than 42,000 participants.
The President of Estonia, Kersty Calloulyd, also called for creative solutions against the spread of the crown virus.
People may experience stress due to quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment or fear of infection.
BBC quotes Rory O'Connor as saying: “Strengthened social isolation, loneliness, concern about health, stress and economic downturn — ideal conditions for harming mental health and well-being”.
The disease can flow easily with minor or absent symptoms that remind other common upper respiratory diseases, such as common cold.
Patients with mild disease usually recover within two weeks, while patients with severe or critical forms may need three to six weeks to be treated.
Pregnancy women may be at a higher risk of developing a severe form of COVID-19 on the basis of data on other such viruses, such as SARS and MERS, although such data on COVID-19 are missing.
In those with the most severe disease, COVID-19 can rapidly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which causes respiratory failure, septic shock or polyorgan failure.
Complications of COVID-19 include sepsis, anomalous thrombosis, and problems with the heart, throat and liver.
Thrombotic anomalies, especially the increase in prothrombin time, were reported in 6 per cent of patients entering the hospital with COVID-19, while 4 per cent of the patient was expected to have a waiting period.
Approximately 20-30% of patients with COVID-19 have increased liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the average time between symptoms and death was 10 days, five of which were hospitalized.
However, the average time between hospitalization and death in patients transferred to intensive therapy was seven days.
Early-stage disease studies indicate that the mean time between the onset of symptoms and the day of death was 14 days with a full range of six to 41 days.
According to a study by the National Health Commission of China (NHC), the mortality rate among men was 2.8 per cent and among women was 1.7 per cent.
Histopathological studies of post-mortem samples show that there is a diffuse alveolar injury with cell fibromyxoid exudates in both milds.
Pneumocytes have seen viral cytostatic changes.
The appearance of the skin was a reminder of a severe respiratory distress syndrome (ORDS).
In 11.8 per cent of the deaths recorded by the National Health Commission of China, heart problems were related to increased troponin levels or cardiac arrest.
According to data provided by the United States in March, 89 per cent of hospitalized patients had previous health problems; access to medical resources and the socio-economic situation in the region could also affect mortality.
Mortality assessments vary depending on the situation because of such regional differences and due to methodological difficulties.
A poorly effective case calculation can lead to an increase in mortality.
However, the fact that death occurs as a result of the diseases acquired in the past may mean that the current level of mortality is underestimated.
In smokers, severe symptoms of COVID-19 were generally more common than 1.4 times, and some 2.4 times more often needed intensive therapy or died compared to non-smokers, and concerns were expressed about the long-term effects of the disease.
The administration of a Hong Kong clinic found that some patients who recovered from this disease had reduced their volumes by 20-30 per cent and that their scans had been damaged.
After recovery, this may also lead to “After intensive therapy”.
As of March 2020, it was not known whether patients who had recovered from the virus developed permanent immunity against it.
According to the findings of other coronaviruses, this was considered likely, but also reported cases where, after recovery from COVID-19, coronavirus tests were still positive.
In these cases, it is believed that there has been an exacerbation of the disease rather than a re-infection.
The virus is believed to be natural, has animal origin and is an infectious disease.
The actual origin of the virus is unknown, but by December 2019 the spread of the infection was almost entirely due to human transmission.
The study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, refers to 1 December 2019 as the earliest date of the first case of the disease.
According to official data published by WHO, this date is 8 December 2019.
Several methods are usually used to quantify mortality.
All figures vary depending on the region and the time of spread of the disease, and are also affected by the tests, the quality of the health systems used in treatment schemes, the time since the outbreak of the disease and the population parameters, such as age, gender and overall health status.
At the end of 2019, WHO allocated emergency aid codes for ICB-10: U07.1 — for deaths from laboratoryly confirmed SARS-CoV-2 and U07.2 — for deaths from clinical or epidemiologically diagnosed COVID-19 without laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The ratio of deaths and infections is the number of deaths divided by the number of diagnosed cases over a certain period of time.
According to statistics at John Hopkins University, as at 17 April 2020, the global number of deaths and infections is 6.9% (153 822/2 240 191).
This figure varies depending on the region; some other methods include the definition of the mortality rate as a result of the disease (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed patients who have died from the disease, and the definition of the mortality rate as a result of the communicable infection (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected patients (both diagnosed and non-diagnosed cases) who have died from the disease.
These statistics are not linked to a specific time and reflect indicators of a specific population from the time of infection to the end of the disease.
Although antibodies are not developed in all patients who have had an infection, the number of people who have been infected may be understood in the presence of such antibodies.
In the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, Castile de Adda, a small village with a population of 4,600, 80 (1.7%) are no longer alive.
In the city of Gangelt, the disease spread to young people during the carnival celebration, causing relatively lower mortality and not all cases of death from COVID-19 could be officially classified as such.
Moreover, the German health system was not overloaded.
In the Netherlands, about 3 per cent of the population may have antibodies, according to donor blood.
COVID-19 is the official cause of 69 deaths (0.004 per cent of the population).
The impact of pandemics and levels of mortality are different for men and women.
According to studies conducted in China and Italy, the mortality rate is higher than that of men.
The highest risk group is men over 50 years of age; the gap between men and women is only reduced from 90 years of age.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 per cent for men and 1.7 per cent for women.
The exact causes of this difference are unknown but may be genetic and behavioural factors.
Genderal immunological differences, lower prevalence of smoking among women associated with men ' s diseases (e.g. hypertension in men younger than women) may lead to higher mortality among men.
In Europe, 57% of the infected were men, and 72% of the deaths of COVID-19 were men.
As of April 2020, the United States Government is not conducting gender statistics on COVID-19.
Scientific research has shown that viral diseases, such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and ORIA, have different gender statistics.
Most health workers, especially nurses, are women and thus have more chances of getting infected.
On 11 February 2020, the World Health Organization announced the official name of the disease, COVID-19.
WHO leader Tedros Adano Gebreisus explains: “CO” means “koran”, “VI” means “virus”, “D” means “disease”, and 19 when the first outbreak was detected: 31 December 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid reference to a specific geographical location (e.g. China), animal species or groups of people, as required by international recommendations for the prevention of stigmatization. The virus, which causes COVID-19, is called a severe acute coronary respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
In the WHO public communications, the terms “COVID-19 virus” and “COVID-19 virus” are used in addition.
And the disease, and the virus itself is usually called koravavirus.
During the initial outbreak in Uhana, China, the virus and the disease were commonly referred to as the kornavirus and the kornavirus.
In January 2020, according to the 2015 recommendations on geographical locations in the name of diseases and viruses, WHO recommended using the terms “severe respiratory disease 2019-nCov” and “2019-nCov” as temporary names of the virus and disease.
Official names COVID-19 and SARS-COV-2 were published on 11 February 2020.
Due to the limitations of the standard supply chains, some digital service manufacturers have printed medical materials, such as nose masks, as well as details of IVL devices.
In one such case, the Italian clinic urgently needed a ventilation valve and the supplier was unable to deliver it within the required time limits, then one of the local productions was redesigned and was able to print the necessary 100 valves per night.
After the first outbreak of COVID-19, various theories of conspiracy, disinformation and fictitious information about the origin of the virus, its scale, prevention, treatment and other aspects became widely available on the Internet.
People may be infected with the virus of other animals.
The results of the studies did not confirm the spread of the virus among pigs, ducks and turkeys.
There is currently no approved vaccine from the virus or medicinal products for its treatment.
Vaccines and medicinal products from COVID-19 are currently being conducted by government organizations, academic groups and industry researchers.
In March, WHO initiated the SOLIDARITY Trial (SOLIDARITY Test) programme, which aims to assess the healing effect of the four existing compounds considered most effective to date.
There is no vaccine yet, but various organizations are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Both SARS-COV and SARS-COV-2 penetrates human cells using an ACE2 receptor, and scientific development uses the results of previous studies on SARS-COV.
There are three vaccination strategies.
First of all, researchers are trying to develop a complete viral vaccine.
The use of such a virus, whether inactive or dead, is intended to trigger a rapid immune response of the human body to a new COVID-19 infection.
The second strategy, the establishment of a subunit vaccine, is aimed at establishing a vaccine that enhances the sensitivity of the immune system to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, these studies are intended to destroy S-chip protein, which helps the virus penetrate the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
The third strategy is the development of a vaccine based on nucleic acid (DNA or RNA vaccine, a new method of vaccine establishment).
Experimental vaccines developed under any of these strategies should be checked for safety and effectiveness. The first clinical trial of the vaccine in four volunteers started in Seattle on 16 March 2020.
The vaccine contains a non-injurious genetic code copied from the virus that causes the disease, and the anti-tellosable reinforcement has been identified as one of the potential problems in the development of SARS-COV-2 vaccines, but the assumption is controversial.
As of April 2020, more than 300 active clinical trials are being conducted.
Medicinal products approved for malaria treatment were evaluated during seven tests, four of which were hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Rehabilitation of antiviral products is a major part of Chinese studies; nine phase III studies have been conducted in several countries by the end of April.
As of April 2020, a dynamic review of the clinical development of vaccines and candidates for COVID-19 treatment was conducted. For the same purpose, several other existing antiviral medicinal products for COVID-19 treatment, including ramdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, as well as lopinavir/ritonavir in combination with interferon beta, were also considered.
As of March 2020, preliminary data are available on the effectiveness of the use of remdesivir.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients receiving remdesiver as an exception.
Phase III of clinical trials are already taking place in the United States, China and Italy. The use of chloroquine previously used to treat malaria has been examined in China in February 2020 and preliminary results are available.
However, there is a need for an expert assessment of the study.
The health authorities of Korea and China recommend the use of chloroquine.
The Ukhan Institute of Virology recommends a daily dose of one gram, but notes that this dose is very dangerous and can lead to fatal outcome.
On 28 March 2020, FDA issued an emergency authorisation for the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine in the treatment of doctors treating patients with COVID-19. The Chinese 7th edition also lists interferon, ribavirin or humifenevir as an antidote to COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are required to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanid was recommended for in vivo detailed study, demonstrating inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 at low concentrations.
Studies on the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have serious limitations that do not allow the medical community to use these treatments without a more detailed study. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and its role in the treatment of COVID-19 is unclear.
Hypercytokinaemia may occur as a complication in the late stages of a severe form of COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have hypercytokinaemia, and a small study conducted by the National Health Commission of China has included tocilizumab in the recommendations for the treatment of coronation.
This medicinal product came to a phase 2 of an unrestrained test conducted at the national level in Italy after positive results were obtained from its use in patients with severe disease.
In combination with the analysis of blood clotting on ferritin to detect cytokine storms, it is intended to counteract factors that are thought to cause death in some patients.
In 2017, FDA was approved as an interleukin-6 receptor antagonist based on retrospective thematic studies to treat steroid refractory cytokines release syndrome caused by another T-cell CAR therapy.
There is no randomized and controlled evidence to date that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for cytokine release syndrome.
Transfers of purified and concentrated antibodies produced by immune systems of patients recovering from COVID-19 are currently considered as a non-vaccinated method of passive immunization.
This strategy was tested in the treatment of SARS patients, but its results were not convincing.
The neutralization of the virus is a expected effect that allows passive anti-inflammatory therapy to protect against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms, such as anti-tetralogous cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis, may also be used.
Other forms of passive anti-inflammatory therapy, such as monoclonal anti-inflammatory agents, are at the development stage.
The extent of the use of a recombinant blood clot may be increased, which consists of a liquid part of the blood of the healed patients and contains antibodies to the virus.
Coronaviruses, high-level syndrome
