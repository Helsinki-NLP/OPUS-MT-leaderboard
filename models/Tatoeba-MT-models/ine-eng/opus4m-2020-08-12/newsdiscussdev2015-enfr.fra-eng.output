It seems to me like a typical rugby club.
In an English university, maybe...
Nothing to do with the rugby clubs I know in NZ.
But it doesn't justify anything, does it?
Of course not, but the premise that it's common in the rugby is big whatever...
Yes, we do not interrupt the prayers of Muslims and we do not break a person's nose during drinking games (at last, unless it is part of the game), but we have actually painted in black for some delicious evenings.
I've never played a drinking game based on the Nazi theme saying that.
Yeeha and Ride the Bus are enough.
I left a similar comment on the previous article because the language and feeling expressed in the prospectus of first year students seemed quite typical.
That says, this new information leaves no doubt to me that they go far further than myogynous jokes and jokes on alcohol that are often associated with college rugby teams.
The incident with Muslim students shows particularly well that they are trying to achieve maximum.
You probably don't know anything about rugby clubs.
But let's go, why let your prejudices and stereotypes stop the facts?
I imagine that the rugby LSE team is populated by former students of these schools for whom the rugby competition is a tradition.
In other words, ex-boyfriends of the private.
Out of very different environments from those playing rugby in NZ, very different attitudes.
So are “misogynous jokes” acceptable?
It would be like my university rugby club, I've never seen racist behavior, but naked races through campus, flight, property damage and misogynia were all part of the game.
Absolutely not.
I'm sorry I didn't make it clear in my last comment.
You can see it differently: do you say that your own body itself is part of this ancestral water.
I'm gonna win in senerty.
ancestral also this interstellar cloud (or, not traditional:)
@lux You haven't read the article: a small half of the water of your pasta is over 4.6 billion years old...
Yes, well we can all of a sudden consider that the fleet of pasta has on average easily more than 2.3 billion years, which is not already so bad.
A sacred foot of nose to the catastrophists and reheaters of any hair that predicts the end of the oceans and water resources, while this water always exists.
An irrefutable evidence that heating stopped 20 years ago (see the remarkable work of Serge Ferry funded by Total and Areva).
@manon toopo: What evidence is there that the heating has stopped?
I don't see the connection.
I believe Manon Troppo's comment is ironic.
Hey, and for the second degree and irony, what do you have as a signal?
So you don't understand much about ecological problems.
It is not a question for the "catastropists" as you say to worry about the disappearance of oceans but rather about the reduction of human-consumable water reserves (you know the soft water that represents less than 1% of total water reserves on our planet).
And then more generally, climate warming is not the most threatening for our species, but especially the reduction of scarce or non-renewable resources (gas, oil, rare metals) that support our increasingly greedy lifestyles.
As for the study you quote and which you make the generous effort to quote the source, there is of course little doubt about the truth of the conclusion.
Regarding the problems of fresh water, I assure you that the French are far from being concerned with xD Then we need to stop viewing the ecology as an unfavorable dogma, the hole in the ozone layer is being referred quietly (estimation 100% for 2050 at the current rate).
The ecology, yes, the religiously dogmatic and unreasonable ecology, not thanks.
"Then we have to stop viewing ecology as a dogma without failure, the hole in the ozone layer is being referred quietly" Yes, it is not as if it was a spontaneous movement that would come from nothing.
@martin: I just want to say that climate warming is a necessity because if we emit too much CO2 our land will look like Venus.
A seal that by oxygen action will capture the heat without releasing it and that in a vicious circle will accelerate the process of closing exponentially.
Has anyone seen any direct actions so far?
Or the slightest sign indicating that 10,000 dolls would have come on the ground to plant trees and do what a green army is supposed to do, what could it be?
I certainly don't!
In the small brain of Abbott, perhaps sending RAAF to the Middle East is its version of direct action.
We're moving forward, that's for sure.
When are they gonna get rid of this idiot from the village?
The latest findings that vegetation would consume 16% of CO2 more than any climate model allows for priority to be given to replanting.
It is logical not, since CO2 is the food of plants that is most abundant in nature, and it is necessary to preserve the flower throughout the world.
It would be said that this scientific fact has never been established.
Have you seen the green army somewhere?
Don't do anything, dear government.
The CO2 levels increase from 280 ppm to 400 ppm and the rate is rising, your argument about plant food is only a fallacious distraction.
And before you throw your glass against the Dooms Wall, the most abundant fertilizer is not CO2 but nitrogen and sulphur.
The most abundant material generated biologically is perhaps carbon, but this does not mean that it is the most abundant fertilizer, so Silverhead's argument is false and deserves to be ridiculed.
Direct Action is a farce, because nothing can happen again.
LandCare's budget has been severely reduced and this money is now spent by the Green Army.
The problem is that instead of investing money where it was most profitable, it is now investing where it will receive the most publicity to bring the Liberals back to the marginal electors.
Your contribution, on the other hand, deserves the price of ignorance, good champion.
SilverHead, when there is too much CO2 in the air, plants produce less photosynthesis and contain less nutrients.
This means that animals and people need to eat them in much greater quantities to enjoy their nutritional benefits.
The fact that this Member is capable is an evidence.
So far, he has not presented a certificate of academic rigidity which prevents him from deviating from the rules of XVII.
However, to punish him and not Thevenoud, it is incomprehensible for the evil of the world, even if the regulation of the AN is not a tax treaty.
That this lady does all the business is not to her honor, it seems especially as a hysteria.
If Mitterrand had put an end to all those who spoke Mitran...
I remember that during the discussion on the feminization of names, the "Academie" had become confused: "let's say to Mrs. Scheaux's guardian or guardianship" (a post that had never been occupied by a woman before).
For machining!
"The political arena" ...!
The sand basin, the backyard of the Republic fills, the marigo of the operat guilants, the picture of the illusions, etc.
But the arena assumes gladiators, people who take real risks, good will, bad will.
Qd the Phalocrate Umpire sits on the label and parliamentary regulation by twisting to the + elemental civility under the false paralysis of good ways, the penalty applies to him "quality" for his partisan mind and his muse of the political arena.
The conduct of this Member is neither normal nor worthy of his position.
He's making a provocation to talk about him.
Until now he was unknown, now he may be proud to be known as any cancer of a primary class.
The Academy on the back and we can see that the Members are sensitive to the pocket...
The UMP will have to resolve its internal problems and stop causing couacs and scandals.
The Academy has a good back, especially when you tell her what she doesn't say.
This Member is acting as a college in the middle of the teenage crisis, which provokes and whose partners go,delegated,to see the Chief to cancel the hours of the rally.
And defending it on the basis of a text they have not even read!
Women do not even represent 15% of the signatories of the UMP MPs.
Mr. Judge, I appeal to two expert witnesses to separate a few thousand years.
That's why I like spending time with animals.
The joy they feel when they play is so obvious and appealing.
Dogs, dolphins, otaries, horses, they do all the stupid things for the simple pleasure that this gives them.
On the contrary, it would seem that we spend most of our 80s working, moving and making stores.
What a strange phase we have reached - we are able to multiply by two our lifetime, but we spend most of it in the boredom.
How did we get here?
Thanks to the illusion that it is anthropomorphism.
The game is a meta-communication.
Try again.
It's always an illusion.
Moreover, the "communication" necessarily involves a shared symbol system.
A difficult concept for you, perhaps?
I imagine that the concept of inter-species communication is not compatible with your beliefs.
That's right.
I can see when a dog wants to play and I can communicate to the dog that I would like to play – basic body language.
After that, there is a variation that indicates whether the game will be a race, an object to go for, etc.
It is not difficult and there is no anthropomorphism – although I agree with the idea that there are many conneries on animals that are "playing" while they are simply communicating.
Perhaps the game is not only "useful" (it may or may not be), it is just something that exists.
For example, David Graeber is of the opinion that "there is a principle of play based on any physical reality."
"If he had learned at school that a woman is not an object, he might not have violated it." Perhaps, hope makes him live...
Thank you for the hope of giving you the opportunity to live, to be healthy, and to be able to respond today to an article when you had to drink the information without being able to respond 15 years ago.
In general, I am not against ideas, and I would even tend to be quite enthusiastic about those who seem to be crazy first.
But when we see what many have kept from their teaching at school, especially among the most likely audience to commit to aggression against women, my enthusiasm does not find the least start of anchor.
"the most likely public to give themselves to attacks on women" We would like to know a little more.
Or rather, no, it's good, we got it.
And yes, reality doesn't always feel pink, even though it doesn't necessarily match your thinking patterns.
It's true that the golden youth of Neuilly and other beautiful neighborhoods don't listen much in class.
She prefers to play on her iPhone6.
Evry's disappointed youth too!
If the Rex were no longer responding, Twitter would no longer propose to follow Le Pen and Sarko in the first choice.
I didn't learn anything from all this at school and I never raped anyone (and it's not in my intentions).
Do I have to love my luck?
Unless I had parents to teach me some values....
The family micro-society is the learning of social life.
How do you start reading life when you don't know how to read?
And is it that the young socialists go to the banlieu schools to teach gender equality?
It would be more effective than doing morals editing on Twitter, but you should get out of beautiful neighborhoods...
Great this campaign.
They are null everywhere but to teach moral lessons, it remains the best.
Everything looks photogenic, but I still want to see the bread in a hat.
There's a joke about using his bread.
This week's article doesn't go soft.
It's not time to make jokes around the bread, my boy!
A little sensitivity!
You have made a double meaning word game with the word "naan" to refer to a grandmother.
60 pounds for that?
It wouldn't even fill the stomach of a 90-year-old in a retirement home.
How is it that the more we pay, the less there is in the seat?
Because the quality of the experience does not necessarily measure the weight or number of calories, as well as the quality of a film or a piece is not determined by its length.
Yes, I agree with you.
But why should the good food be served in portions that would not even satisfy a monk?
It doesn't make any sense, and it's just a deliberate policy to make you buy more dishes.
Of course he doesn't have to be like that.
The Sportsman in Seasalter is at least a very good restaurant where the portions and prices are both reasonably high.
You pay more because you are still hungry after several mini dishes.
The more expensive you pay, the more likely you are to receive a child's share arranged with art in your desk.
At least they've made an effort to put on nappes.
So when I want to go to a decent restaurant in York, you tell me I should go to a restaurant in London...
Maybe you should try one of the many other (excellent) restaurants in York before deciding that London is the only place on Earth where you can enjoy good dishes?
Is the Manif for everyone just a Catholic and Muslim movement?
Yes, it is: a sort of homophobic collection.
But it's not just that.
There are also atheists and humanists who do not want modern systems of "child manufacturing".
A child must not be raised in a battery lift or manufactured by a technological device.
Battery lifting?
Where do you come from?
And if you challenge any technical intervention in the "manufacturing", you must demand the ban on PMA for heterosexual couples, it would be worth the consistency.
I am also surprised that the alleged "for all" manif did not yet have this logical claim to its attractive catalogue.
it is true that it is not only the cathos that demonstrate: the other religions too, Jews, Muslims, Protestants.
It is still useful to remember that these different churches have been opposed to all developments in society: in 1865 (and I join G.
Kauffmann) a bishop, Mr. Dupanloup was violently opposed to the intention of gvt to admit girls to school in the name of "the defence of the family".
We're still on the same schedule.
And, more recently, the same currents hulled at the collapse of civilization and the destruction of the family when the school became mixed.
That is to say, the credit that can be granted to the positions of these people.
There's no need to be catho to get angry with the marketing of the stomachs and children...
All this is in the right line of the decadence of Western civilization, increasingly challenged by others!
For me, freedom stops from the other: yes to the recognition of homosexual couples who have both the right to love each other and the others.
But it is not a question of allowing the child to be a furniture object.
And this is also valid for the heteros seeking GPA.
I just can't love this guy or recognize his results.
If he had better control of the balloon and could avoid moments of fussy stupidity, he could have been a more popular player.
In addition, I am sure that any other attacker, other than Heskey, who plays so many games for England, will accumulate a respectable number of goals.
Imagine how many goals Peter Crouch would have noticed if he had been given more than 42 selections on the national team...
I cannot disagree, at least not categorically :) Since this article talks about the goals it has set out, I will not talk about the other things it brings, especially in ManUtd (where RvP, Mata, Kagawa don't or didn't bring anything), but perhaps that would be another reason why it was much more often selected than, say, Peter Crouch.
Bothham77 hoddle1 07 October 2014 12:48 Recommendation 119 It's the way to criticize Rooney at this time so you can forgive yourself for doing it too.
It is good to take this into account that since signing with Manchester City in August 2011, Agüero has scored 56 goals and takes 23 decisive steps in 93 matches.
At the same time, Wayne Rooney scored 59 goals and made 32 decisive steps in 96 matches.
So many people will have to find another excuse to take it to our Wazza because its land states are excellent.
In addition, "Wazza" is rather a good reason to ridicule it.
I have to ask myself if you really look at the foot or if you think Peter Crouch A) would deserve as many selections as Rooney and B) would have so many goals if he had so many selections.
I really don't understand where the criticism of Rooney's ability as a football player comes from.
The hardest thing is to be selected regularly in his country's team for 13 years, and to continue...
Are you seriously comparing Wayne Rooney's football qualities (even not attacking) to Peter Crouch's?
You're doing this without a joke?
There really are people in the crowd.
Please also note for your government that Rooney has not always been the leading machine center for England during his career as a team in England.
Instead, he played the previous retreat, the role of Beardsley/Sheringham.
He played behind players like Michael Owen, Mr. Crouch mentioned above, Jermain Defoe, and more recently Daniel Sturridge.
You must have written that by slandering.
In a country where the port of arms is tolerated and in a country where 71 per cent of people have a weapon, I find it totally schizophrenic and paradoxical as a way of doing it.
And even those in this school are not exactly in agreement with the U.S. arms port authorization!
The use of the skull is still suicide.
Stop at the corner: the girl is 5 years old.
How many guys play with real guns at this age in our home?
Is this actually a powerful killer?
Even though the port of arms is in the US constitution and this has a strong influence on the culture of the country, I do not believe that the cracks are significantly different from ours.
A little sense and reason saved svp.
It's a disarming process!
Make yourself clear!
Information on this fact is insufficient to assess whether this little girl actually has or does not have premises at the taste of morbidity.
Could we start with the principle that a serial killer can't already have a weird behavior at the age of 5 years?
If people need a psy follow-up, it's more the mobs of this school than the students!
Let the parents take their kid away from there: she's in danger!
I totally agree.
Those who manage this school are obviously completely ill.
Your reaction is much more relevant.
Alabama is not the most representative state in the United States, but it is part of it.
What an incomprehensible country!
Your relative youth?
These bright blue bastards that men wear have nothing to do with an entrepreneur!
What did Alan Sugar or Richard Branson carry at the start of their career?
In their first photos, Lord Sugar wore a long leather coat and Sir Richard Branson wore a rolled-up pulley.
I can't comment too much because I've never looked at this, but it all seemed so boring and soulless.
I don't think that's what he meant.
Contrarier, maybe?
But what's it look like?
You've been ahead of me.
I would have thought that a poor knowledge of English would be an asset to business.
I wonder what Mr. Bjayou is doing these days.
Maybe by saying "ostracize", he meant "stranger."
That would make sense.
No, I thought that was what he might have meant, but ostracizing still doesn't make sense.
Unfortunately, if all the candidates were dressed like Carmen Miranda and Sugar was wearing a grey suit, we could move on with their intention of ostracizing it.
But here, no.
It would be said that this has been corrected – odd. Perhaps the whole sentence has been invented!
It's not weird.
Huh, who knows what he could have said?
Surely nothing, but someone absolutely wanted to quote something...
So, yes, the word used in the article was well "ostracize", which meant absolutely nothing.
The unemployment rate in the United States has still dropped by about 6%.
Ever seen since 2001.
Fuel prices are falling in all states.
The American economy, with Obama, is constantly growing.
Who says better?
You have a very short view...
Their economy becomes "sustainable"?
In order to live there right now, I would say that the United States is slowly approaching the explosion as inequalities become crazy.
The political system is literally corrupted by the state of the financing of electoral campaigns.
Racial tensions, police violence, mass incarceration have a scale that we can't imagine in Europe, but Americans keep an incredible optimism in the future of their country and theirs!
How long?
That's the main question.
A few days ago, the English financial environment said that France was lost.
Now, it's America that's at the end of his roll.
Fortunately, there will always be the UK to save the world.
Another one of these articles simply forgets the essence.
The level of consumption of the US economy is no longer sustainable...
Titges and billboards could not give the change for a long time...
Because of the exhaustion of land resources and the growing needs of the rest of the planet.
And necessarily the weakest and the poorest, a very large majority of the citizens, will "drink" or rather hump.
I can't blush this Farrage.
Will the Labour Party finally understand that its cynical and deliberate policy of importing foreign-sponsored voters makes it lose even more support at home?
I probably don't think so.
Multiculturalism and diversity must continue to advance at any price.
LOL It was to please our American masters and their cold war continues with Russia.
Shame performance of the Labour, Ed Milliband is in the museum, this is played by 617 votes.
About Clacton 11% for Labour – shocking, really shocking.
Everyone is more or less aware that Blair government's massive immigration policy was designed "to provide the right nose in diversity"
The Labour wins the partial election, the Tories lose the partial election in a safe seat against ukip = Labour in crisis Have you talked about your fight against reality with a therapist?
I imagine it's the same multiculturalism that leads to this return of the jaw, the pendulum has expanded very far since the end of the war, and I imagine that now it's going to split into the other way.
Have you talked about your fight against reality with a therapist?
Lol - Secure Labour Headquarters, a difference of 617 votes.
It's depressing Jack, you know, I know, anyone who's not in denial knows.
Of course, the Tories have seen much worse, but for Labour it is a victory at Pyrrhus.
Look for the word "victory" in any context, and you will see that when it is used in an argumentative way against the word "failure", it wins the battle!
I agree, Jack, it's a victory, but it's bad.
The Labour Party should have won at least a few thousand votes.
If they record a performance like that in a safe seat, can you honestly imagine them winning the majority?
Personally, I am indifferent little to what I earn in 2015 as long as the Lib Dems are not there.
You obviously don't understand how our parliamentary democracy works, do you?
Yes, I know the ice from Canada, Greenland and northern Russia are hard.
On the other hand, I wonder if the alignment of Venus and March etc should not be considered as well?
In general, we need to see the earth more “painted ” or malleable than we can imagine.
Is that right?
A few little perplexities.
On the other hand, Wylie tells us of a "a fairly simple mechanism: with the disappearance of the ice that weighs on the ground floor, the pressure on the blanket relaxes, which gives/would give a) a blow to magma production b) while facilitating its access to the surface?????
In any case, either the "shooting" or the facilitation of access to the serene surface (more or less) located.
It is difficult to distinguish the cause of the effect and vice versa With regard to climate warming, I think it is prudent to focus on its effects on our environment, which is already quite complex.
Very friendly, patriotic, does this volcanicism have any effect on our environment?
Has it not affected our climate warming, the future or the past?
Isn't Prudence no longer heating?
When complexity cannot be resolved by simplification, let us apply this simplicity and observe it.
Yes, but also, when he's at night, we see less.
Good morning, the end of the last ice period was also accompanied by a stronger seismic activity, especially in the "active" mountain ranges where on the highly-glazed continents of Canada, Scandinavia).
Cordially CB
It is too often ignored that the earth’s crust floats on the magma and that the only passage of the moon makes it mount or descend from about 30 to 60 cm, in a different way, according to its passage to the zenith, as it does for the waters of the oceans.
This gives the smoothing of tectonic plates, as well as seams, more or less facilitated by this moving pocket, as much as polar cauldrons are lashed by the source of ice, thus causing a change in the balance of land to the equator, as the volume of the land remains constant.
I am delighted with this "human", saying the Supreme Commander of Nature and his self-proclaimed commander, to ridicule himself for his stupid action on the environment that created it and for which he has been so separated that it has become harmful, and to himself and to this environment.
And all this to remain the supreme commander of this kind who surpasses it in the organization of his own visceres, by an invention that consists of finding all possible ways to dominate his fellow, each other, laughing at the collaboration, the money.
The earth’s crust is not based on the magma, but on the earth’s surface, which is made up of solid rock.
I personally find it impossible to look at it.
Pretentious and arrogant.
It reminds me of Ascent of Man de Bronowski.
Live the next part.
Beautiful story Wild1
Rather, it reminds me of a completely brilliant series of 2002 called "Ape-man".
One of the best documentary series I've ever seen.
Strangely, almost no one remembers it now.
It's a pity you've never gone beyond the first impression.
Your loss...
“The ice creams, our distant ancestors” You should look again at this passage.
Or read about evolution.
Super program thanks Brian
I am almost sure that the documentary "History of Humanity" has already been realized several times, they are still going to Ethiopia (of course)
Oh here I don't support this guy, Brian "air miles" Cox, who's going to Ethiopia to pretend to be staring at a brain in a mouth.
And his story...
It must be hard for you, forced to look at Coxy.
Maybe there's a support group for you, that's what I'm saying.
I agree, everything is presented in a way that I can understand.
I loved the program, wonderfully well filmed.
Is Marcel Gauchet a Marxist compass?
Indeed, it is the individualist identity that prevails today.
So she needs to be herself, of course, so she doesn't.
Yes, but Descartes is also at the time of the advent of individualism, and his intellectual question expresses this warning.
But at this time it is just the assumptions that appear, today individualism structured society as a whole, educated or not, cultivated or not, rich or poor...
We are well in the individualism of "mass"!!
Without making it an inexhaustible horizon, is there no relative with the Cartesian approach to examine what one receives to believe, what one believes itself.
More than rebellion, suspicion is ferocious.
Facing Foucault a revolutionary is absurd.
Many xxx-liberals refer to it and claim it.
His work on psychiatry has produced a counter-reform!
While the problem was at the level of his paranoid numbrel, he blocked any progress and reflection on the reality of madness.
And bring the most reducing and reactive vision that follows: behavioralism.
Gauchet is absolutely right on this point and being an anti-conformist, it is to fight this distortion.
Marcel Gauchet is accused of being a defender of the order.
That's an excellent idea.
Be beautiful and rebellious, ask some...
Black and white, to the others.
Bees and robots, they include the most followers of those who look beautiful in their mirror.
In any event, thanks to his controversial controversy about putting Marcel Gauchett, this humanist patient and persistent, and so pedagogically enlightening, into the light of the news.
David Cameron supports the increase in inheritance tax threshold
How many other budget cuts will be necessary to pay the social benefits of this rich person?
Dave the robot will greatly increase its net value once it is no longer in power.
Business councils, speeches, consultation costs, a series of best sellers written by a nigger on "serious policy" – it will cost £100 once he has passed the gun to the left.
Obviously, he doesn't want any inheritance tax.
Wouldn't that be the same lie as in the last election?
And the richest are those who will certainly pay the very least of the inheritance tax due to super well-paid accountants and tax evasion programs.
This has all the signs of a declining Empire where heritage kills innovation.
it will cost £100 once it has passed the gun to the left.
Anything.
He'll probably promise to raise the threshold to £1 million, which is well beyond what you say it's worth.
What was your position when Labour doubled the threshold to 650,000 for couples?
Did you also think that Brown thought only of his own heiress, or are you just a brainless tribalist?
We haven't picked her last time. We've had a coalition in place.
You could not afford to accuse him of lying only if he was actually elected to power.
Like the rest of us, "Dave" will not die "normal".
Climate change and collapse will bring it to an end, he and the others of his end.
His "richness" will be as useless as that of others and will not save him or his children.
Non-taxable income is a social advantage, especially in a country where government debt has exceeded £1,000,000.
We must all be imposed to pay the essential services and repay the debt.
I agree with you Exdionys.
I am not saying that the teaching of discipline is unnecessary, of course, I am just saying that it is insufficient to compensate for certain natural "inadequacies".
Poorly rational statement for the math professor she was!
Like what...
Better recruitment and training for teachers is a qualitative approach.
However, the French political class does not know any other than quantitative approaches.
There are 2 possible answers, the 1st would be to select teachers according to their ability to transmit knowledge => reform recruitment modalities.
From +, she hates children because she doesn't understand them.
Not understanding them, she does not know how to act or react to work well => it is reduced to establish a relationship of trust that causes everyone to suffer a pure loss => it would take 1 training to teach.
A profession that learns, of course.
But teaching is primarily an art, a natural disposition and a vocation before being a technique.
Working on and with human beings is not making car parts.
It doesn't make an equation even when we're a math teacher!
"Education sciences" cannot compensate for a lack of natural skills.
What is currently lacking, precisely, is a true vocation in the bcp of those who embrace the professor
If gifts exist, teaching (I prefer discipline teaching) allows those who have less comfort to make no mistakes.
There are ways to address a more effective issue.
The true unknown today are the students whose 1/3 tell us: learning does not serve at all I already know what I think.
An article by Slate well describes the chaotic situation of this entry.
Let's regret the old Normal Schools of Institutes..
She ends at 3:00 in the morning from this week, but she starts at midnight.
If that is the case, it is appropriate to use time in any way.
Oh, I didn't know that, thank you.
That's not good for me!
It's been years since his show started at midnight.
We have this thing that's called ipplayer and that allows us to listen to the demand when we want it!
The Internet, it's pretty incredible, isn't it?
I don't have iPlayer on my phone and with a maximum download speed of 4 MB in my home, I can't really listen to radio broadcasts anymore.
I have a type of usb adapter behind my SKY box and which is connected to the Internet but listening to the radio on my TV seemed too complicated.
Yeah, I think I was wrong in the schedules. I had to hear Richard Lester at about 3 o'clock.
Whether it's men on Radio Day 2, they could at least put a woman in their antenna when one of the men is on vacation or sick, at least that would make people happy.
They should start by getting rid of Jeremy Vine.
Its broadcast is from any sensational conducted in the debate, and it would be much better on a chain like LBC.
The lack of DJ women in the day, where none of Chris Evans' regular animators in the morning to Simon May's show on the night of the return to work, is not a woman
It's five shows.
So which (of these five) is most likely to be modified.
Shennan knows very well, but doesn't say anything at the moment.
Steve Wright is the most semi-delayed of these times.
Jeremy Vine may be sent back to the offices as a real journalist, but lunch keeps all the ice-cream of a Daily Mail radio.
I imagine he's calm, waiting for the current team to get away with it or she to turn around.
I was born in Soissons in 1950!
Too late?
It's normal for these people to vote for the UN.
For 40 years we have had the same two parties that alter power and make the keys of the country to each other in less good condition than they did.
The campaigns are very poor, much poorer than the bannies with more and more isolation.
It takes miles to find a cinema, a bar, a gym, a theater.
But since they don't burn cars, they don't attack, they don't deal, they don't care about political men...
But thank you for not talking about a department where you haven't lived.
Yes, Doclocal, they're under men, sociology is good to think about them.
They have the very high rate of absence and early alcoholism as well...
The UN thrives on human beastlyness, inculcation and ignorance so much that it still has an enormous potential for growth, it really has to be bad because it didn't do better...
Today, the UN thrives mainly on poverty, the fear of the day, the fear of the other and the feeling of having no perspective.
But yes, you're right!
What a pitiful humanity.
Fortunately, there are a handful of people like you, intelligent, cultivated and educated to save the honor.
They've been looking for him.
To take the voters for c...
Here's what happens.
Who are they?
"forgettable" is actually less than a resource =>low of resources.
Here's my comment on twitter (@priya963) Listen, you can't just "add and mix", women must be integrated into the development process.
What I mean here is that in many developing countries, existing standards are being questioned, such as childcare and socio-reproductive roles.
This allows us to recognize that women can work in the economic sphere and that it is super - it is necessary.
But it is not possible without recognizing that women will then have a double scourge, that is to say they will be expected to go to work while continuing to play their socio-reproductive role.
I'm not convinced of my sister.
The economy and profit do not recognize the roles of the sexes.
The money is talking, and if a sex isn't high, next!
The profits mock the life you eat.
What do you do, what is the advantage and what do you have to offer?
The benefits are ridiculed by the heroism and education of children.
If it was a crime, companies would listen.
Employers' friends will never employ women from 20 to 45 years of age.
That's right, my sister.
It is very problematic that no one speaks of unremunerated social work in this article.
In some countries, the value of unpaid social work (most of which is done by women) must be more than 50% of GDP.
Unremunerated social work does not receive enough support and is undervalued (not to mention that men do not do it enough), but it enables our companies to operate and preserve our work.
Unremunerated social work is also an important reason why many women are unable to find a real "economic emancipation" outside the home...
Thank you for all your comments - to come back to the point of Mskayadee, how can we take into account the disproportionate responsibilities of women when carrying out gender integration projects?
A very practical article.
I'm sure it'll help a lot people who have to "crowd a box."
The tiger is not Russian. It's only Western propaganda.
The Chinese are the only ones responsible for the current situation and would do better to sit at the negotiating table.
The right-to-self-determination tiger and Russian soldiers are just in exercise near the border, long-term exercises ahead of the current situation.
In addition, the tiger has no anti-aircraft missiles in its possession.
Release the Tiger!
You made my day!
Oh, yeah, hold on.
I just got the same idea right away.
Here is a pretext all found to arm a few separatists to annex China.
If Siberian tiger is in China, China is in Siberia.
It's only time to repair this anomaly.
Why does an article on a tiger, magnificent feline, and in real danger of extinction, eventually turn into an article that's benignly directed against Putin?
What's he doing in there?
So this is not a sheet on the Siberian tiger, but a sheet on the follow-up of a Putin com operation.
When we expose ourselves to so much media, we also expose ourselves to irony or criticism.
The eternal victimization of the soviet-poutian sympathisers.
Holland had also taken the pear full of his chamomile without shouting at the anti-French plot.
There our apprentice Alain Bougrain-Dubourg, the Holy Protector of the Great Russia, was personally and physically involved in the reintroduction of this tiger.
In any case, the tiger has understood everything, he's just...
That Holland gets bashed, that's one thing.
At first glance, it seemed to be a horribly condescending idea.
But on the basis of the article, it would be said that it is both a response to a real problem - the emergency dental subsidies - and effective.
So it's hard to find something to rediscover.
And if only 53% of this sample brushed their teeth before, and 73% after, it's a little empty sense to complain about paternism.
After all, there's no harm in brushing your teeth!
In fact, in the end, complaints seem to be related to the fact that they are targeted towards the unemployed and that this confirms a negative stereotype.
But if that is true, then it is not a justified criticism.
Belinda Smith, of the Canterbury Regional Health Committee, said that the Department was concerned about the number of emergency dental grants provided by the Department of Labour and Revenue of the Department of Social Development for young unemployed adults.
On a media level, there would be better ways to implement it, I imagine.
But he seems to think reasonably well.
There's a problem with brushing your teeth.
If you brush them after drinking wine, it can damage the enamel layer.
If your toothbrush is old and stiff, it can bite the gum and cause inflammation.
And I remember a show on the Guinness book of memories where someone had tried to brush the longest teeth and the Guinness judges at the time had strongly advised him to do so because of the adverse effects of frequent and prolonged brushing.
'At first view' - very funny.
It seems to me to be an experimental design.
The simple fact of volunteering for this study would have changed the habits of participants who knew that brushing teeth would be studied.
This is why most behavioral studies include things like double blind, witness groups, etc.
There is no way to reject these results on the programme itself.
Assuming that these texts are sent to each young person with social benefits, there are two things that distinguish this from the test: 1) They are not volunteers, and 2) they do not return information on the times when they brush or brush their teeth (lightly missed results by people who give their results according to perceived expectations).
Are there any consequences at the epigenetic level?
Studies (Pr Lyonnet) have shown that the maternal environment (including the uterus) could have an effect on genetic heritage, not in the genome, but in the expression of genes, and that these inherited traits could be transmitted to the next generation.
Does the uterine strike affect this phenomenon?
The nesting itself looks like a kind of graffiti.
There are probably consequences, but as long as we do not want to have a perfect clone of ourselves, is this a priority problem?
I think it's going beyond the limit of reasonable.
The desire for motherhood and paternity should not lead to any further progress, without the question of ethics, taking risks, for the mother and for her baby.
Not medicine is all powerful, not limitless, and yes it is unhappy and painful to accept that all women will not have it, or children they wish to have.
This has absolutely nothing to do with the tran

of their "conference" this magic bag so they have this wonderful moment of pregnancy.
Why would I keep it sterile in my safe if he could still give love?
The current harsh circumstances make PR FRYDMAN cautious about its communication, but if "we" agreed to think, "we" would admit that it is only the bag and not the genetic material involved.
What's not going to be as an anti argument: cf here all these men's reactions curiously....
Marjane, any organ donation has nothing to do with it.
I've been a plasma donor for years, it's not completely aloof.
I was registered as a donor of spinach (I have never been selected because the selection is very strict and this is understood both for the recipient and for the donor), that is a real operation.
Now as a man, I would not be able to judge in any way or in any other way or to take part in this gift, but I will listen to women talking about it.
@Margane: Indeed, it has nothing to do with anodin, and it reinforces the act of love that this implies.
Giving a kidney to a member of his family who needs it has nothing more to adodin, and that's what happens!
Please, no Messi v Ronaldo combinations.
It's low.
I agree, we don't need that.
Especially that there's really no competition anymore...
Ronaldo is the best athlete.
Messi is the best footballer.
The Sportivo became a yoyo club.
They're too good for Monday, but they don't have the League standard.
Rivaldo was not part of the title winning team.
Thank you for correcting me.
But Rivaldo played well for the Sportivo before going to Barcelona.
Ronaldo continues to do everything he can to beat all the real Madrid goals records this season so that he can then return to Old Trafford this summer with a calm conscience...
I can't believe it.
I think Ronaldo will put an end to his career in Santiago Bernebeu.
I think you want to talk about the stage of the international oil investment company?
I was looking at a fucking connection, so I can't tell you much if it's just that Valencia defended and without counting the property, they deserved to win.
I was afraid the ground environment didn't get too fast, but they played well.
Parejo's game as a whole gets better.
An affress penalty fired but just saved by Diego.
A mestalla of chaotic ambiance and it shouldn't have been funny for the Atletico bus to bomb.
That's interesting.
A complete article, signed by the young researcher Amandine Marshall, "On the Origins of Momification", well illustrated, appeared in the magazine Archéologia 524 of September last.
It is good to have arguments to confirm and date what we find intuitively.
Not surprisingly, before it's complicated, we've made it simple.
All science progresses by small steps.
What about the "The Organ" of the woman who was so preserved?
Passionate!
Hello and thank you for your tickets.
It seemed to me to read a few times ago that a black-child mom had been discovered in the current Libya and that this discovery had opened new horizons, including geographical and temporal (I think I remember that the mom was 1,000 years old to the first known African mummies).
Do you have any information on this?
Thank you in advance.
She's a little embarrassed about reading.
These may not be contaminants of modern times.
Was the desert at that time not less distant than it is now?
Why don't you imagine plants like cannabis pushing to the place where there's only sand right now?
We knew the song.
And it is enough for a knowledgeable European to say it, even without any proof, that it is a scientific truth: the Egyptians and so Africans of yesterday and today have never invented anything even at home.
But the song does not tell us who are the inventors of African inventions in Africa.
If it's not always "of his poorly-known predecessors".
You should read the article.
This is an article written by neoliberal free market cocks that preaches against the mobility of people and the mobility of property.
I think there are other people who are affected by Ebola and who the Spanish government is lying to us, not to give themselves a bad image and protect tourism.
Today, I would like to believe that tourism is the last of their concerns.
But they may remain silent to avoid a general panic.
I would like to believe the same thing about tourism, but the rule of law governments in particular (i.e. those in Spain and the United Kingdom) tend to protect the interests of businesses rather than those of people.
Stop, don't hesitate to call your local MP and complain about the lack of transparency.
Even though I think the government here is just a bunch of assholes, good at nothing and corrupt, like Madrid is not a very touristic place, I doubt it is their greatest concern.
What are you waiting for?"
(with all the respect and compassion I have for the nurse and her colleagues), since tourism is one of the only things that enable millions of people in this country to keep their heads out of the water, I would say that yes, it is important.
If they were to repatriate the missionaries, I don't see why they couldn't have sent them to an air force base and cared for them there in a field hospital, rather than in the capital, for example.
Rajoy had a mission to dismantle the Spanish health service, privatizing nationalized hospitals, especially in Madrid, which is the basis of his power, until the courts intervened.
It's nothing but a right label for public relations like Cameron, and like Cameron, I think it's wrong in the next elections.
To be fair to Cameron (I know it is not easy here) socially he is far from his right and would well find his place to the religious madnesss of right in America.
Now he must sing the praises of the hospitals he had come down to try to achieve his goal of protecting Spanish tourism.
I apologize, but you cannot really compare the Tories or any other European party right to the Spanish right.
It's cases apart, believe me.
The Spanish Government is talking about almost everything about it.
It's not as if someone could accuse you of spreading unfounded rumors.
So you have tangible evidence to support this idea?
This section of the Guardian is called Comments are free.
Thank you, Mr. Supiot.
Without putting work at the centre of production and the economy with its rights and guarantees, we will not get away with it.
Excellent article but especially fascinating reactions to the forum.
Many TPE - SMEs seem to read The World to take the time to condemn the words of Pr.
Let's take a look at the anti-intellectualism of the environmental era.
A law professor at the College of France seems unable to know the labour market unless it is the Nobel Prize for Economics and proposes to liberalise it fully.
It was so much better before, it was true when Dr. Villermé observed the work of children aged 8-10 a.m., when the Canuts were being drawn for the purpose of a collective agreement signed.
Ah the good old time...
Your reaction is also fascinating because of your ignorance of the TPE bossing profession!
His profession is not to know the right in all his ways, but to manage and produce.
Four handwritten amounts on my youth salary bulletin, more than 100 information today!
Here is an example, one could quote a lot more, which illustrates the constant flow of pressures, imposed without any measurement of the consequences, and which undermines the small business.
Your paper would have been very useful if you had written it as an expert and not as a Sorbon client.
To upset the archival-restrained argument of the French Labour Code's thickness compared to the helvette, a serious university student would have dived into Swiss texts and compared the number of official texts, then the comments (the absence of the latter which may mean that Swiss laws are more understandable than ours).
Comments in a Code, whether of work or not, refer to case-law in particular...
And yes, in France, there is still a judge who is responsible for applying the laws when a employee is licensed, for example....
Who's that complicated?
Do you find that the rules of law (laws, jurisprudence, conventions, contracts) in the field of labour and trade are unbearable obstacles?
What's he doing?
How long does that take?
Pullmann "Art has practically become immunized against the critic Mrs.
Is this guy still in the mood?
It is certainly time for new revolutionary absurdities to make criticism...
For each article on Ai Weiwei that I have read recently, you are part of the first three comments that complain about its popularity.
Go to something else!
Go elsewhere, the choice is not lacking in the world of art.
If China can produce new artists who are not spokespersons of the Communist Party, the world will be interested.
Yes, GenisCan is probably a troll from the Chinese government.
I think China has produced a lot of good contemporary artists.
Those who are spokespersons of the Communist government are not appreciated in the West, and those who are not spokespersons are not as well connected as Ai Weiwei.
For those of you who think Ai Weiwei's art is a kind of fraud, here's what you miss.
Thanks for that, you just ruined my little breakfast.
I'm sorry, but I had to explain it at all costs (without making a bad word game).
It's the guy who breaks out of the old irreplaceable ceramics and calls it art, right?
There is art, and then there is vandalism seeking to draw attention.
True artists make the difference.
A great artist.
His father is also a bad poet.
His father was a well-known poet in China.

CARSENTY DEMISSION This gentleman is unworthy of an election mandate for extremists on any board (including Zionists) to be removed
Philippe Karsenty and his ridiculous theories of the plot, which were worth several judicial convictions, shame Israel and the mayor of Neuilly.
It doesn't represent either one or the other.
Philippe Karsenty is fighting the truth alone, marginally.
REPRESENTATIVES
What do you want to do with the Mairie de Neuilly against Philipe Karsenty, who is insulting a journalist and his family, and who calls publicly to attack this urbanist?
Crime apology?
Can't I find Neuilly on my card?
Is it a new administration that holds these new privileges????
This type needs care, like Ulcan Chelli, both in the theory of anti-Jewish/anti-Israel conspiracy and whose strains are perfectly identical to those of their most angry detractors.
As many people believe in any political decision to see the hand of the "sionists" (the term of which tends to disappear because of its abuse), these two here, as well as the LDJ or the CRIF, believe to see in any criticism, even banal, an antisemitism subject "that is not without recalling the darkest hours of our history because it is still ferocious the belly of my good lady we would have believed in Russia of the 19th century!"
Note that Karsenty's incredibly stupid theories about Charles Enderlin's report are even more stupid than those on September 11.
And God knows that the theories of the plot on September 11 are a very fragile beast.
And this guy has political responsibilities, it's extremely worrying.
To clarify my analogy with the conspiracy theory of 11 September, we are talking about cognitive dissonance on how to deal with the subject.
Totally blinded by a completely far-fetched truth, having spent too much time, spending too much money to support it, it is unbearable in this theory of detachment (as in the case of extreme religious).
If then a logical and ineligible escape ahead, the end justifies all means, even lies, which is a complete, but complete does not seem to disrupt the mission of the individual.
You advise to be careful and not to put everyone in the same basket, but this is what you do for September 11.
There is still a multitude of unanswered questions for this event, and Bush/Cheney/Saudiens/Consorts do not seem to be in a hurry to respond.
There are actually very far-reaching theories, but the official theory is also, at least on a few points.
Oh, nothing's funny right now...
Health NGOs and public health spokespersons found that the results of the study were widely in favour of their awareness-raising efforts.
And, of course, they will need more subsidies to follow!!
As smoking was socially accepted 50 years ago and is now recognized for what it really is, alcohol will also know its time of judgment where the real damage it causes in our society will be exposed.
More than waiting for everyone to attack me now...
Well, it's easy to just say things like "excessive alcohol consumption is rising", but what demands (a little) more effort is to give real facts.
Sorry if you consider this an attack - will you drink a glass and relax?
It's better to risk it than to put my mental health at risk by refraining from me.
The Government is pleased when it costs money.
Here are other alarmist advice based on unreliable statistics.
Two average glasses a day is at least a low level of alcohol consumption, and the first quote seems to indicate that it increases the risk of many cancers, but the second implies that it is a more or less harmless amount.
Perhaps the Cancer Council and the National Health and Medical Research Council should agree (about one or two glasses, but especially not three) and give us a figure on which they agree - whether justified or not.
Now, we're going to tax them deep, like the smokers!
They're already doing it - soon it'll be the grass!
My father didn't drink and smoke, and cancer took him to 64.
So I'm going to keep drinking my two red bottles on Friday and Saturday night (and the other night when my wife is not there).
Why does the Cancer Council encourage children to go to places where alcohol is used?It is an old news that the Cancer Council has deliberately ignored.
What is not linked to the risk of cancer today????
sharks don't catch cancer - they eat anything but they're not a good company.
The sharks can catch the cancer of the skin.
Charlie Whiting's incompetence has been a recurring topic for many years.
Refusal to run when you could run and reciprocate.
I totally agree.
Whiting is Bernie's blessing.
Both of them destroyed the F1 under the pretext of security.
Let's hope that he gets better off Schumi or even worse off Wendlinger by his accident in 1994.
Absolutely agree with you, but focus on point 1: it's not the F1, but the circuits that have refused to advance the departure so as not to run the TV broadcasting channels.
In fact, +1
I would just like a quick and fast recovery in Jules Bianchi!
Brazil 2003, Europe 2007, the incidents that failed to take place between landfills and f1 were free of charge warnings.
We knew that one day this would happen, and Jacques Laffite, among other things, had been saying it for years.
How the hell did the race organization and the FIA allow these maneuvers without getting out of safety because?
I cannot accept that we call for the risks of the profession or the mistake of chance when we have not prevented the foreseeable.
It was an accident.
However, it must also be said that there was a yellow flag, which means not only "banning to go beyond the area" but is primarily intended to indicate a danger.
It's not embarrassing, it's happy for the family who had to be in front of the TV.
Even under the yellow flag, the pilots just take off their feet.
Under changing conditions, the turn can be much more dangerous the next turn and the pilot, believing to arrive with enough margin, can even be "reduced" at a normal rate.
But, well, we're caused in the void here, as long as we haven't seen the images, we can't issue a notice.
I don't see much of what this changes.
Are there any wounded?
According to the CBC, no injuries have been reported.
The CBC showed the information this morning before it happened, which makes me wonder what caused the derailment.
It's hard to believe there's still work to be kept 24 hours away.
I don't think there's any injured people since Canada's almost empty.
There may be injured animals such as bears, mice, etc.
I hope it's ironic.
Some parts of Vancouver have the strongest population density in North America, and Toronto has at least six million inhabitants.
In the Saskatchewan campaign, trains do not derail as by enchanting, and these types of trains often cross urban areas.
Almost every Canadian city is crossed by a railway line, and trains show very, very often in a day.
In addition, as roads often follow watercourses in areas where there are lakes, rivers or oceans, they also pass through densely populated areas, because people always want to live near the water.
Thus, all the railway traffic across the centre of a city as it was a central element of the original construction of the railway lines here.
You may have tried to be funny, but there is a huge potential for railway disasters in Canada.
Mansbridge made a report about it last night, really shocking.
Have you obviously not read the article on the derailment and explosion of a train in a city in Quebec that killed 47 people?
In fact, you're partly right.
The city of Vancouver was a port city long before the railway.
That is to say, when the railways were built, they passed through the centre of the established communities because it was the most direct and central road.
Perhaps employees of the National Canadian Railways Society should go to the next Conference on Dangerous Products in Calgary, Canada, on 2 and 3 December 2014.
CN employees are trained in the transport of dangerous products for a long time.
This article, like many comments, has an impact on the fundamental religious issue: a religion is a revealed truth and for its believers there could be no other truths.
The whole problem is here and the demands of the theologians only reinforce this fact, otherwise what is good to talk about the sex of the angels?
"God said: it is good - it is bad" > it is not compatible with democracy, it is called the dictatorship (variant: theocracy).
The word of a leader (Muslim but not important country): "But without religion, how do you want to keep the people?"
In other words, obey the priest priest rabbin imm and pray, it will be better!

Yes, that is what Voltaire and others thought, in some way Robespierre by trying to establish a cult of the Supreme Being.
But our oligarchy also has its cults : that of the Euro fort ( instead of the moment ) or that of the free market ( disproportionately supported by the state when it is necessary to rewind ) , etc .
Great ideas from religious resurrections.
Yes, but especially where there was no distinction between religious and profane.
Where the rational emerges, the religious is on the move and expresses himself in the schism.
Religion was born as the ideological support of the State, and the gods served ambitions even though it also carried forms of protest.
The theology of faithfulness to the form of revelation and adaptation to the air of time was unknown.
Fanatism is often described as a misinterpretation of "sacred texts".
This does not resist the examination of these texts that are filled with explicit appeal to the hatred of the blasphemer.
Rather, it is the moderate religious (and fortunately the most numerous) who "read the texts badly" and hold back only what is inherent in humanism and common values throughout humanity, atheists and believers.
For me, fanaticism is the beastly and evil application of passages of sacred texts coming out of their context.
Thus, some verses of the Koran calling for the killing of "believers", "infidels", "hypocrits", "Jewish" or "Christians" are incomprehensible and therefore unacceptable if some verses are not read above or below stating that these executions are justified only in cases where Muslims are attacked, killed and in a situation of legitimate defense.
on Yves Petit:" on the "foulard", it is a religious prescription that makes today almost unanimous in the "savans".
There are idiots everywhere.
The only positive point to get out of this is that it has led to a general condemnation.
Especially in Australia.
Aren't you guilty of the same damage that it shows in the clip?
Band of overpaid and hypersexual Neanderthalians.
They've condemned humanity enough!
What have they brought us apart from the neighbors, for life, Summer Bay, Paul Hogan, Crocodile Dundee, Einstein Junior, Angry Anderson - Suddenly, Mental as Anything - Live It Up, Danni Minogue, Razorback, Baz Lurman, Nicole Kidman, Russell Crowe, Bee Gees, Shane Warne, Yahoo Serious, Ian Thorpe, Kylie Minogue, Men at Work, Hugh Jackman, the Tasmanie Devil and this Satan Skippy!
An insult to our intelligence, that's what he gave us!
If you take your eyes off the TV for a moment, you will see that Australia has a rich cultural heritage, starting with paintings in caves and on stone made by its indigenous peoples and which are still a source of inspiration for modern artists today.
And then there's the Sydney Opera and a national opera company that has produced wonderful singers like Joan Sutherland and Nellie Melba.
The Australian film produced films such as The Story of the Kelly Gang, Mad Max and Gallipoli.
Australia's notables include Errol Flynn, Nicole Kidman, Hugh Jackman, Heath Ledger, Geoffrey Rush and Cate Blancett.
The only thing that insults your intelligence is you and your ignorance.
Russell Crowe is New Zealand, and Bee Gees were English.
Your intelligence really needs to be insulted!
Let me be of another opinion.
Sox does not need any help in this section.
How did I guess it would be a "small white"!
Another fan of George Lazenby.
Delighted!

The largest foreign journalist based in Moscow.
The most brilliant.
Her articles are terribly missing.

Nice work, Savantcosi!
But you don't know it can't be yet that Kastals is just a little Moscow telegrapher who has nothing to do with his days.
We leave him for a month and when we get back, he's on his way down the same salads.
The almost total of the 331 dead since the ceasefire are civilians of the Donbass who have been bombed by the army, due to uncontrollable elements according to Kiev.
The presentation of the responsibilities hypocritically suggested in the article without dare to go to explicitly designate separatists is in the Otane line of the World that does not hesitate to reverse facts and responsibilities to maintain the fragility of the pro-European neo-Nazi nations bravely facing the Russian wicked
@SavantCosinus: change browser.
I open this page very well on firefox and mac.
If I understood your saying the wicked are the Ukrainian ss and the nice Russian Stalinists you wouldn't be a bit communist by chance.
Extract from the (very long) document you quote about MH17: "This ticket is absolutely not meant to say that the pro-Donetsk resistances are innocent".
The Minister of Defence of the Russian Federation says he is responsible for Ukraine.
From propaganda?
In Alexandre Kastals: where do you keep these details about the discounted macabre?
From the Ukrainian army (she unfortunately loses soldiers almost every day, according to her)?
Uncontrolled elements (allowable to say anything)?
ALLEEEEE THE ROMANIA!
Alleeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
And I say this as a Romanian citizen.
From Transylvania, with a Hungarian woman, on the other hand.
I mean, I can't stand the Piturca team, they don't represent me.
Piturca is a member of the power in place who has not stopped denouncing Romanian football to the pathetic level he has now reached.
They formed a network that produced the "Coperativo", which decided before the start of the season which team would win the championship, which teams would go to Europe, which would be relegated, and which would whitewash the money at its own expense, mainly by selling players who were highly underrated.
Gica Popescu, the former captain of Barcelona, was doing business with the above-mentioned agents, and tried to avoid paying taxes (about one million euros), then paid them, but apparently he was ill advised by his lawyers, refused to admit his mistakes to the court (which would have cost him a fine without a penalty), and was therefore taken 3 and a half years in prison.
The trial is also worth the prison to the Becali brothers, four club owners, the Steua manager Mihai Stoica, and Popescu, for crimes related to football.
George Becali also provides him with a punishment for trying to sweat (and then dissimulate the facts) a team to beat us (CFR Cluj) in the last game of the championship, to win the title and win the jackpot of the League of Champions.
The team he tried to weave were our neighbors from Cluj, University.
We won 1-0 in their stage, a result that allowed us to be Cluj's first champions, while they were relegated.
I still smell so much at this moment.
In the dissimulation of this attempted corruption was involved, among other things, Piturca, who signed as a witness a false document that implied that the money that the police had seized in Cluj was related to a sale of land.
So this uneducated poor man, an idiot, a liar and a liar doesn't represent me, and he will never do it.
Hungarians are just a bunch of nationalist assholes today.
You might think that after the last time they broke stadium drawers and store windows, and where they burned racist banners in the streets they couldn't have tickets this time, but no.
I thought Neil Lennon was getting ready to take the reindeer back to Al-Ittihad.
Wherever he ends up, it'll be a disappointment, after Stockport County has turned him down.
It's a great article.
If it were Sarkozy who had done this, we would have heard the left yell like a big sick one.
But as it is the gentle Dutch, friends of the unions and small people, we understand a little bit of protest, but everything down.
This is why economic environments sometimes prefer that a party claiming to be left is placed in power.
They are the bankers who have financed Obama's victory, and they have not been responsible for their investment!
"The absurd idea that most jobseekers do not seek employment" LOL (no comment)
Employment Paul should generalize unemployment control in early 2015?
I hope that in the poll, fiscal pole, will also generalize the absolute control of the gougnafiers commonly called plutocrats, banksters, kleptocrats, tax evasions, thieves, and other Malandrins.
Do you know how to make a phrase without banksters or plutocrats?
You look very proud of your jargon every time
It's true that when we have a class, we treat the population with no teeth and no teeth
At every new period of unemployment, there are dozens and dozens of applications that I address to employers who are most often not even offered a reception claim, it was automated.
It is also the total lack of monitoring or support from the Employment Pole.
To conclude, I will add that the "socialist" patronage of this government appears to me as an insult to the memory of Jaurès or Mendès France.
Did we read an article about the chained candard here?
It is learned that a unemployed person can remain without news from his agency for several months, but that he must continue to seek employment through his own means.
It is learned that controls have enabled people who for more than half had no unemployment allowance.
We wonder, then, how to control people that we never see.
It is asked what punishment is a radiation for someone who does not have access to employment and unemployment services.
And if we can admit that this reform will allow for more radiation, we wonder what it will help recruits.
"It is learned that a unemployed person can stay for several months without news from his agency, but that he must continue to seek employment through his own means" Indeed, it is shameful.
The question must be asked, why are these countries in the EU while the authorities are clearly unable to defend Europe's equal ideals?
Is it not as if the Spanish or Italian authorities had done a great deal about racism in the foot?
Should we chase them out of the EU?
The EU was originally only economic and should remain.
The aim is not to be a "Police of Thought".
The EU is a peaceful project.
It doesn't make any sense on an economic level.
That is probably why Britain will soon leave the EU: it is the most unequal society in Europe.
What equality?
The Eastern European teams are constantly being held by the Arbitrators of the corrupt mafia that is UEFA.
The best solution would be for the whole East to leave this corrupt profit organization and create its own.
At least we'll finally look at football.
This crossroads of antiracism is only a screen to cover injustice and corruption!
No, that's not true.
Money and trade, rather.
The European ideals of equality?
What is Europe's mistake in allowing the UK to enter?
Uefa should applaud them for playing the comedy of Blatter and his men.
It's been going on for a few years, and I'm not exaggerating.
Pulled from the Guardian two or three days ago:
Would he expect to see himself retorting small symmetrical phrases, just history of maintaining controversy?
Whatever it is, it is a fact that at every small event towards peace, there was, there will be, and there will be people using to pour oil on the fire.
The decoding would mean that Western States are against a "Palestinian State", that they are pro-Israeli and that this alone explains that these States have never done anything against the Israeli State.
The decoding would mean that in order to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian issue, action should be taken against the armed Israeli state-occupied occupying colonialist destroyer
In 1945, rather than creating a Jewish state in Palestine to the detriment of an Arab population who was for nothing in the Shoah, it was more reasonable to empty the Bavarian German inhabitants (who were guilty of the Shoah) to replace them by the surviving Jews.
That would have been justice, Germans had nothing to claim, and Europe would have kept millions of educated, entrepreneurial and dynamic people.
Sir, let's take the example of Western Sahara colonization...
The fact that Morocco is the colonialist is evidence!
But as for Israel, we also need to question history, its allies and its support for questioning truths.
In any case, colonialism has never been altruistic, we agree.
Then stop your pirouettes to support Israel as a colonizer.
The Gaule was colonized by the Romans, but currently there is no discrimination between the descendants of the Romans, Gaulois or others.
In Palestine, discrimination is well on the basis of origin.
Furthermore, the State of Israel is defined as one of the "Jewish people" whose non-Jewish people will not be included.
The State of Israel discriminates against non-Jewish people, from which I am pleased.
Conclusion: To resolve the conflict, it is necessary to break with Zionism that opposes Jews and non-Jews.
In Maghreb, some peoples were even baptized in the name of their first status by this saving civilization!
Two realities to stop ignoring.
Primo, the European Zionist project (colonise-appropriate Palestine) involved deposing the Palestinians, so it was an intrinsically anti-Palestinian project, the solution needed to break up with Zionism.
Second, Zionism is a political ideology.
Uruguay has been missing a bit from the start.
Their outcome will give them what bites their fingers.
It should begin its rehabilitation with small holes.
I hope he didn't lose his appetite for the game.
So many things are tolerated, including racial injuries and physically hard heels in football, but Suarez has been punished too hard.
I'd like to see him come back to England, no matter what the Purists say.
Yeah, I hate all these molars.
Football is a contact sport where the keyboards exist and therefore players will get hurt.
The fact that you get your teeth into the flesh of an opponent for having the advantage certainly doesn't have its place in the game.
A rugbyman was suspended for 80 matches for performing a similar gesture.
This is the third time Suarez has done this.
If you bite someone at work.
What would be the consequences for you?
I knew someone was going to bite.
If you're dyslexic, I forgive you.
I'm actually slightly dyslexic.
I forgive this sarcasm to two bullets.
I bet he was eager to come back to play full teeth.
All these word games on Suarez are losing their bite.
I've had my butt bite.
A prerequisite for a good school course is respect by students of their teachers and the school institution.
This works if parents instill that respect for their children.
Parents convey this respect more easily if they also feel respected by teachers and their children's school.
In good institutions, those who make their students progress, parents are considered partners, not em..
Who can believe that it is the pro who should do all the work (teaching, educating, learning respect, limits, living together briefly) It is for parents to do at least 50% of the tax.
But it's no doubt easier to go to school.
Putting on parents is not operational.
No one really took care of them.
The action will then remain limited.
On the other hand, the school institution could do a lot of things.
Operational solutions reside there.
Actors (professionals, hierarchys and departments) should play their role and not always get away with it.
We can disband a group that sets off to relaunch it, not the families.
How to not talk about teaching.
It is true that communication courses allow for change.
It seems like we're training teachers, but we forget the first part of school.
Transfer of knowledge.
And if there is a demand for parents, it is that the school ensures the instruction of their children.
What is the minister who will dare to restore what was called the Public Education.
Disappointment article: little information, partial and destructive reflections.
Did you really expect an intelligent comment about this beautification of the East Banelieus?
It's a beauty, it's clear, but I think it's Willoughby's, and so on the North Coast...
Sloppy Joe doesn't understand the numbers.
He refuses to accept the facts.
Not surprisingly, we have a budgetary emergency.
Leave it down and the economy will wake up immediately.
Hunters Hill, actually.
I'm sure you're right.
That's it.
A little one of Aloysius.
His election is the seat of Sydney Nord.
Indeed a beaut of the North coast !!!
Well, if British BBC television viewers wanted to compare the neo-conservative governments of our two countries, they would of course come to the conclusion that both are led by the Monster Raving Tory Wang-Bangers party.
It passes for a scratch, of our days. :(
Yeah, but it's good to let him go on a regular basis.
You would rather be shy too if you woke up one morning and realized that you would never have the role of Prime Minister and that all these legitimate and illegal benefits in life will never remain out of your reach.
Poor Joe.
It's really pathetic.
He tried to present a budget in half and then left.
At least he's not threatening to hit anyone.
Brittany Ferries needs a new ship.
She will be well able to command it, without gas turbines - in a distant country and claim State aid.
And as she knows how to lobby, don't be afraid of the result.
And so much for the job in France that it has nothing to do, it comes out of legumes always ready to break when their corporation has losses on the markets, outside, among other things...
It's just because their lobbying didn't work that the order was cancelled.
If the company had got the time or preparation for marble, there is no doubt that the project would have been completed.
Then, to know whether it's good or not and how BF will comply with the law in spite of everything, it would be nice for "the world" to think about!
Brittany Ferries is held by British legumes.
Those who burn the tax and dry centers.
They want State aid.
That they don't seem to be normal at least.
And to the extent that an army ship under a Metropolitan French flag is 30% more expensive than any other civilized flag, it is normal to expect a coup d'état.
Or we are condemned to tolerate the British monopolies of the market.
It's the choice.
Eternal French problem that considers its maritime facades as tourist destinations, not as areas of activity, where sometimes people are different from the average Parisian.
This difference is paid every day, lack of investment, of short-sightedness.
One of the reasons why Britain must regain its sovereignty.
This and then they will create the Breton Pavilion with equipment composed exclusively of pure-bred Bretons.
Of course, they're going to reduce costs significantly...
Of course.
Unfortunately, that's what we expect from the BBC now.
They have always hated everything about prog, so it is not surprising that they have chosen to go beyond Hackett's solo career, which has always been closer to the Genesis spirit of the 1970s than those of the other members of the group.
Hackett was for Genesis what Malcolm Young was for AC/DC.
If you don't understand how important it was to the sound, you don't really understand their music.
To tell the truth, they hardly mention Gabriel's solo work either.
I do not think that the BBC can be accused of "despite everything about prog," as they have just broadcast an hour and a half documentary on one of the largest prog groups that ever existed.
I haven't seen the documentary yet, but it's a film about the Genesis group, not about the solo projects of its members.
As for Hackett's solo career, which would be "closer to Genesis's 70s", I disagree.
Hackett no longer has the right to take the road, play a bunch of Genesis songs on which he had various degrees of participation and pretend to have an affinity with Genesis that David Gilmour has the right to assemble a bunch of semi-fine demos and call it a Pink Floyd album.
Oh, wait...
I think Steve Hackett's asking for nothing more than a fair representation, but he didn't get it.
A curious feeling, the first solo album of Bank, is absolutely great, and in the spirit of Genesis of the 70s.
They went beyond Hackett's solo career because, let's be honest, she's afraid.
Yes, it is one of the best prog groups, but would the documentary have been realized if they had not had their pop commercial success in the 1980s?
I have not always seen the BBC broadcast a long documentary on groups like King Crimson and Gentle Giant who have a story as interesting but lacks the popular attraction that Genesis has.
Good remarks.
I would say, however, that the BBC has "always" hated the fact that it loves progressive music over time.
A person with a personal interest cries "prejudice": of course.
A little more interview with Jonathan King on the DVD version?
It's absolutely beautiful.
If the death penalty is an attempt to double a terrible act by another terrible act (including sometimes against innocents), then it is an exciting success.
There will always be a difference in size between a criminal sentenced to death and those who kill him.
The criminal has committed his act since his false understanding of society and its rules.
Those who kill him do so from the vision and reflection of the most just and wise of a society.
I mean, they don't have an excuse.
They're defenseless.
Yes, we had understood your point of view for the first time.
That's exactly where the difference lies, Mr. LeClos.
There must be a very different spirit in the community of mortals to enjoy violence.
That's what the criminal has done since his wrong understanding of things.
But it is also what causes pain, hatred, revenge among the innocent victim's relatives: a false understanding that will never prevail among those who wisely decide the death of another since the sound and just reasoning of their paedastal.
However, in order to try to balance the analysis, it could still be argued that the death penalty has often committed a savage violence, which he has been able to enjoy, against people who are very friendly, who have done so for free.
The relatives of these unfortunate victims will eventually see their pain softened with the disappearance of the one who was the bull, sometimes the tortoise, from being loved and who spends their nights.
Let's not disregard their relief.
Thank you, Emilio, for this reflection I find very fair.
Strong and moving article.
Asin, as far as Marc Asnin is concerned, he has great intelligence.
The one in the heart.
That's no doubt what I've read more just for a long time.
It would be believed, however, to read stories of another era, ancient things, that the barbarity of the past would excuse, and then here are the dates that fade, 2009, 2011, 2012...
I really don't think Philip Roth is that great.
Same for the other two "American Excellent Romanciers" cited here.
Roth, Pinchon and De Lillo are all surfaces.
I thought you stopped white, man.
What's left of it?
Roth is great, much better than De Lillo or Pinchon.
And Roth is immeasurably better than this wicked Bellow, who received his prize.
Perhaps this year's Nobel judges decided that if we should have an American winner, we could still have a [light] racist.
Munro's very good, too.
They all produce "genie novels" as if it were a literary genre.
His homonymous Joseph against...
Which one did you read?
How many books from DeLillo did they read?
I never finished Underworld but a few years later I started reading his other books.
Have you read The Body Artist?
News like "Human Moments in World War III"?
White Noise?
The first lightest, craziest, smaller novels, and their dialogues, are also great.
I don't know if I'll ever end Underworld.
I just know that if I meet someone who claims to live in the same world as me and have read enough books from DeLillo to reject his writer's talent, I can only fear that his favorite novelist is Tony Parsons.
Why would there be a conflict??
It's of simple interest.
It was a treaty of humor, "the law", not a definition request.
Between the text and the spirit, it seems so obvious here that the lady acted in the SON only interest, and absolutely not in the institution she represented, that we wonder what the term "conflict" comes to be.
For her, there was no conflict.
I hope she'll take very expensive!
Yes, State services are very practical: either they prevent a dynamic entrepreneur from creating value, or they have not prevented it from harming him.
After we hear that French employees are not dynamic and are only seeking peace.
The floody areas that become constructive the next day when a large construction program will start, it is classic, and not just on a low coast.
Look at the alluvial plains near the rivers.
We were told that "of our day, there are no more floods due to regulatory barriers."
Now, we need to expand the lakes of retention up and cross the fingers.
But it'll be because of state services, of course...
The profit on the ground, on the whole of the promotion?
Couple of fields.
So 6 million euros.
Is that where the interest is?
Exit the computer and you will dream of the life you could have in being in place of Ms. Babin, 1st Deputy UMP of La Faute on the Sea and former President of the Urbanism Commission, who gives you permission to build!
The 2 mothers of Triomphant Sarkozysm are the old and the real estate.
I'm left and not at all sympathetic with Sarko, but svp, not from political lows or lows all of the Azimuths, we're not in there in a battle of puzzling balls.
I wonder if the cops involved in these recent shootings were also involved in these incidents.
The U.S. cops are tough criminals.
The U.S. is a fucking hole.
So what the fuck are you looking at?
The U.S. is not a fucking hole.
Yes, U.S. cops are hardened because of the cracks they've been dealing with every day.
Of course none of them ever do anything, but the cops "come to trouble them because they're racist."
There's a good excuse.
Racism is endemic in the U.S., it is unfortunate that an incident such as this is going to make people see the problem as close as possible.
Your generalization reveals a deep ignorance of the US...
You're ignoring her here.
The good guys must denounce the corrupt racist cops.
Sell it!
Make sure they're calculated.
This kind of open racism doesn't exist here.
Is this the first time you've been involved in a conversation?
It's not a conversation, you accuse someone of being ignorant while in fact it's clearly you who take nothing - many sources (US sources) have noticed the perpetuity problem that racism is in the United States (it's not from offensive speculation).
It is very likely that you are underestimating the extent of the problem and not appreciating the extent of the tension in this regard at this time.
As a result, the border between public service and private security for power and privileges, which has never been very robust, is becoming even more insignificant.
Wall Street finances NYPD in various ways, from where the treatment received by Occupy there.
What surprises me is the naivety of some and I am shocked by the false naivety of VA and others.
And where do you think investigative journalists find their information?
On the Internet?
They're going to interrogate the responsible, make them talk, raise confidence.
That Lhomme goes to Elysée has nothing really surprising.
Next, what counts is the cut-off, the verification, the analysis.
And that's where it's understood that sarcoles care about what they do.
@Munstead, our current president has been elected on a wave of anti-archosyism based on business mounted from all parts (a place and no condemnation) that seem to have been concocted by magistrates (2 references to correction), two Dutch friends.
If this confusion that is revealed between justice, politics, executive and the press that is not supposed to be a power organ does not shock you, it is your partisan spirit that blinds you!
RV with Holland ...
And of course all this is only coincidence and not remote!!! ...
If you think only Sarkozy's support is angry!
From the extract I was able to read, the VA article only draws the dragnet.
I even laughed so hard.
For the rest, the world's complaint has little chance of arriving because journalists aren't "stretched" in the secret of sources, is it?
In contrast, there does not seem to be a consensus between VA and power, while there seems to be a consensus between the world's power and journalists for an operation against an opponent.
I must not be the only one waiting for an explanation from the World on the bottom and on its dangerous relations.
We are well in the face of a state scandal that in any other democracy would cause the fall of the government involved.
From this editorial to the obese, which says a long time ago about complicity with the current government.
It's not a question of left or right, it's more serious.
I'd have thought the bird would go well with the smoked harenger!
It is simply for the figures and to reduce wages and create housing problems, I am sure that if I were an immigrant of the second generation whose life was pleasant because my parents had come here I would have my doubts about immigration but that is not a reason to oppose controls.
One of the most sensible people in a BBC immigration issue was a second-generation Sikh who said she was comfortable with the number of people coming in and the changes they made with them, she was associated with a Muslim man who was not at all co-operating, even refusing to give soup cakes simply because of the lady's religion, she also refused to enter her place of worship, although she claimed that she was not obliged to pray.
** "who said she wasn't PAS at ease"
As we all know, if we let it happen, the United Kingdom will continue to go right - whoever imposes limits and contests it must be admired even if it is a director of the pub :) So much better for you!
More to the right?
Where do you live?
If this country were left to the left, it would be communist.
What do you think New Labour did, especially to the left?
The liberalization of a country, the NHS this NHS repeatedly, the massive immigration of immigrants (according to their own terms to provide a good nose for the right inside), the culture of social benefits, the age of all-est-permit, the correct policy that kills freedom of expression.
I understand that Labour is a left-wing and non-communist centre, and I have said this to slander, which I mean is that they have socially manipulated a very high percentage of the population to make them dependent on the State.
It's typical of the left, if you want my opinion.
Leave your prepared arguments as much as you want, but what I have asked you are specific examples of Gaussian policy, or a left-wing program advocated by the New Labour Government.
Can you do that?
With all due respect, that's not what you asked, you asked Daniel Johnson what he thought New Labour had done that was particularly right.
He gave you his opinion, and then you refused to accept it and changed what you asked for.
Yeah, it's more Tim Bell's territory.
So Martin Sorrell, the most powerful UK advertising director, associates the situation of his parents with that of economic migrants who are now coming to Britain?
What an insult to their memory!
He was absolutely right to do so.
France to the French!
We were beaten in 40 45 to fall into another distatura, that of the money.
We'll make nice savings by turning these technocrats...
We should renegotiate the treaties.
So, negotiations and if the word "democracy" still has a meaning in Europe, should that not do so?
Curiously, the Commission does not look at unfair tax competition between companies.
That must be a negligible amount.
Europe is not the solution, it is the problem...
The EU has only one objective: to make the rail sector fully marketable.
In short, this means that whole breads in French territory will no longer be served by the rail.
The abandonment of many territories will only strengthen.
Every sacrifice, including the advance of a country, in the name of the liberal doxa, did not seem to me to be a good idea.
The EU is a real problem that one day we will have to deal with.
Not at all.
Europe is the first institution to have both the will and the means to clarify the accounts of the SNCF.
The French state has long since resigned.
Regions have the impression of paying for nothing, but not the means to force the sncf to comply with its commitments.
However, using public money without waste is essential in our day when public resources are forced.
And the enormous needs.
I don't see very well what the TER competition could be!
Does he still have a problem with alcohol?
If that's the case, shouldn't he be the chief of praise?
It seems to me that you have not really managed to distinguish the problems that existed during marriage and that you are, of course, still in the process of ending the pain and anger now that more than five years have passed.
Of course, having an ex-alcoholic living so close to you and having what seems to be a daily impact on your life is annoying and very difficult.
That said, it would seem to me to start the separation process between your life and the complications that you have inherited.
We'd say that's what they're doing, but it looks hostile to me.
Since you all live so close to each other and the complications seem likely to persist while new ones are on the surface, have you thought of a "run-off plan" so that you can make a break between your life and your future?
Financial problems have a negative effect, but with a sympathetic real estate credit company, a good lawyer and a little pressure from the court, they can be resolved.
He looks vindictive and persists.
Why not go to a family advisory group to say things openly and provide support to help him to resume his work and pay the food pension.
I think that's the key.
Your life is made of much more things than the time you spent with your ex.
Very good advice.
My advice, ask the children what they would like to do, even if it involves meeting the new woman.
Tell them that you will support their choice whatever it is.
Warn them that he will not necessarily keep his promises regarding contact and ask them to consider how this would make them feel and how they will manage disappointment if he does not keep his appointment.
Try to keep in touch with their father.
If they see you doing this for their own good, despite your own feelings because of the way he treated you, they will respect you.
They will never cease to love you and if you do everything you can to facilitate a continued relationship between father and child, they will know who will thank you when they are older.
I am of the opinion that children end up understanding who is wrong if we let them see things for themselves.
Go a little bit further you are close to the Godwin point.
It is too strong for short-term economic interests to have disappeared in 30 to 40 years, it is the soil pot against the iron pot.
In addition to globalization, the country that does in the least social, fiscal, but also environmental, has a competitive advantage, and others are forced to follow.
All policies are looking for is growth, growth.
There would be international coordination, but from here...
It's not the climatosceptics that produce from the C02.
It's everyone who warms up, those who use the climate, those who take the plane or the car, those who live in homes that had to be built well, those who buy industrial products that had to be produced and transported.
It's not the weather-sceptics that showed up against the ecotax, but the truckers.
No policy is climate-sensitive and Arnold S consumes much more than I do.
But no one says that climate-sceptics emit more CO2 than others.
Environmental defenders also move to conferences.
Individual actions, even if they count, will not suffice.
Political action is also needed (other sources of energy, reducing dependence on cars, etc.).
And politicians act in part according to the sensibilities of their electorate.
"I'll be back" is actually a famous promise by McArtur made on March 11, 1942 at his departure from the Philippines.

Don't use the word immigration, you're going to scare the horses!
The United Kingdom depends on immigration to pay for all our retirements, to take care of our old ones, to empty their hygienic pools, to bury 30,000 people who die every year of hypothermia or hunger, (do not forget your wool and bonnet, which allow you to warm up, to spread the heat and eat this sandwich to cheese).
Don't be like that.
Uncontrolled and untested immigration will take Ebola to Europe and the rest of the world.
Is it a (bad) joke or is it not explicitly made?
It's more comfortable...
This is how the public money is spent to allow a small minority of individuals to spend some time in space to make fun of and go around while playing clowns in front of television cameras.
The reality television has therefore nothing invented, and the authorities are sure to expect a baby to be designed there to inflame the world and to delight the media coverage of Western kings who are used to the mothering of tabloids.
They may have to come back to the earth to find that we're fighting here!
Unlike what you seem to believe, you don't send men or women into space to make poppies or clowns, but to work.
And this work is very useful to humanity in general.
And that, in all areas.
Many things that improve our daily life are the result of space research.
So, yes, it's money spent usefully.
You can quote one thing that improves our daily life and results from space research.
It's just a freaking frenzy.
the ball style that works the point in the air (to write to the ceiling for example)
To pay for his trades?
To participate in the manufacture of an 11th useless product?
Or suggest how to make more money for investors?
In short, working to work doesn't mean anything and it represents the vacuum itself.
Ah, if you've played high tech last time.
Behind the small minority of individuals going into space, there are dozens of thousands of others working to make this possible.
You know, people who fight what, including more and more private companies, especially to get the cargo to the station.
If you're going to buy a plastic gun...
But what about those who don't want to buy plastic guns now but who have the potential to buy them in the future?
Maybe they're the most dangerous of all.
Not because the plastic sword was a decoration in a private residence.
A plastic gun in a bank is used to try to mislead people to believe that it is a real gun used to commit a crime.
Plastic swords may be kitsch decorations, but nothing else.
A very dishonest article would have hurt the author/editor rather than put a picture of the "sword" in question instead of generic photos of "swords in plastic"?
Or even be curious enough to wonder what the inscription (if any) meant?
Bad typical report, it is delayed by the fact that "it is only a plastic sword" and not by the inspired jihadi text that is written above.
The sword, a Zulfiqar or Dhu al-Fiqar, is one of the main symbols of Shiite Islam.
The Diran family, on the other hand, is a Shiite Muslim born in Afghanistan, the terrorist groups seeking to overthrow the governments in Syria and Iraq are almost exclusively Sunni Muslims.
If only people would stop scratching the fact that plastic knives are harmless.
In capable hands, they can be deadly.
Even the small envelopes we give in the fast remnants can hunt the flesh.
Thank you very much for this information, so if it is a common decorative object, it justifies the ridicule the author gives it.
It's not worth trying to make a "ha, ha, a sword in plastic," the facts you've told them actually support his argument.
I've seen these decorative objects in Muslim houses, or painted on the walls, on the occasion, they never seemed threatening, just another version of a "cross".
Soft Jesus, you're right.
And that makes all the sense now...
I saw this guy who seemed to be from the Middle East in Kebab Stop and who distributed plastic knives to anyone all night!
I like the conclusion very much.
All the wonderful innovations, often technologically, give thought to many people that it is a right and a need to benefit, but they have an immediate and worst cost, a cost that is set (subscription, electricity consumption) that weighs on the budgets.
And the impossibility of taking advantage of new technologies stems from frustration.
For example, use the Energy Solidarity Pact, which allows you to isolate the cables of a house for 1€ symbolic when it is inhabited by a modest household (work costs are supported by energy providers in fact!).
Simple effective but unknown even though more than 3000 houses have been thus isolated this year!
Interesting about this PES.
But I've never heard of it.
Who can call and how does it work?
for information 60 million consumers, water-saving shower test and recommends the placing of water-saving equipment on taps and toilets.
The study shows that a family of 4 people can reduce its water bill by 30% (from 150 m3 /year to 100 m3) or 50 m3 of water economy per year, while keeping the same comfort.
This is not a crisis of demand, it is a crisis of the system that can no longer produce enough surpluses (which would then have been redistributiond in the form of real income increases) so that these surpluses pay the increase in expenditures that you classify in the category "forced expenditures".
In other words, energy precariousness is "just" to the reverse of the medal because the economy can no longer grow as quickly as it would like.
Note that the (neo-)classic) theory of the economy is totally unable to answer such a question, because for it, there is no intrinsic limit to economic growth, and there is no element that can force the pace of economic growth, more and more decades after the decade.
From its definition (physically) energy is what enables any physical transformation.
Since production is fundamentally transformable, energy is the means to achieve the smallest economic output (good or service).
And the more we want to produce, the more energy we need.
This means that any increase in energy efficiency (inaccurately referred to as "energy production"), even in the form of an increase in its price, is forced to increase production (except to improve energy efficiency, but improving energy efficiency still requires heavy investments, which are not profitable if energy is not expensive enough).
In short, there is a very strong link between energy precariousness and whether or not we can make the "production" of cheap energy grow.
And the data published very officially, for example by the International Energy Agency, shows that the situation will only worsen in the years and decades to come (the IAEA, in recent reports, clearly indicates that the peak of conventional oil production was reached in 2008 and that oil was not expensive.
But oil is the most universal form of energy, due to its very strong energy density, its ease of transport and handling and storage, its variety of possible uses, etc.)
Three points, good work whatever the performance.
It was a good performance in Germany and nothing was brought back, so it equals things.
Take this from France!
Vote No. 18.
Are you a webmaster of the Guardian?
As previously noted: It's good to win.
It's good to win.
It's really nice work for the guys.
Although many English people like to laugh at the Scottish when they do nothing but lose, there is nothing to say, they bring a little color to the tournaments when they get to qualify, at least until they have to be eliminated in the first round.
It's even more rigolo if we play against them;)
England is starting to worry me.
Because, now that the "golden Shige generation" withdraws, they may have a decent team with all these young people.
; Ferdinand, D.
Betty, Joe Cole and David Seamen back in the 11th, why change a winning team?
The only English footballer who, in my humble opinion, has really been an "international class," is David Beckham, a bit of an effeminate, perhaps, but I think if he had bitten a potato in excess like me, he would have completely crushed me.
People forget their athletic constitution, by the way, talking about athletic constitution in sports, Wayne Rooney...?
I never mock the Scottishs.
I tend to be surprised to observe their warm colors with nostalgia at the end of the evening...
The only English footballer who, in my humble opinion, has truly been an "international class", is David Beckham
Yes, people often seem to forget that he was, at his best hours, a very good player.
It is true that Juppe would have had trouble asking for 100000 euros for a conference in South Korea.
And not sure he'd get them if he asked them...
Are you saying people come to get a good kick?
For the rest, I'd be surprised to learn that B Debre, for example, only lives on his MPs' allowances...
I ask myself, above all, the question of what he can tell in his conferences.
How to reduce its deficit?
How to get back to full employment?
I would say that no serious speaker of scientific discipline, whatever his scientific level, even if he is the holder of a Nobel Prize, will think of asking for the lowest amount.
Conferences with content are most of the time free or almost free.
And I can assure you that these young people are working really and that the results presented in their free conferences are real.
At the time of restrictions on the research budget, the reporting of these two figures is upbuilding.
Researchers' conferences are even paid by the lab!!!
That's to say...
It all lights up for me.
They're looking at the sun.
So N Sarkozy is a worthy representative of the ethics of the UMP
I have the impression that he is being accused of making money?????
I am far from being one of his fans, but he is accused of being ill (or fraudulently) managing his OK campaign.
But making conferences seems to me to be a legitimate activity.
To add to Nina's comment, let us remember that her travels are supported by taxpayers.
Regulation No.1 of epidemiology: isolation.
All U.S. and British flights to or from Africa should have been suspended weeks ago.
Human lives are more important than right politics.
It is present in Spain, in GB, in Texas and elsewhere.
What density of infection of the population will politicians resolve to make the right decision?
So if I want to go from Africa to the United Kingdom, I take the plane for Spain, and then I take a plane from Spain to the United Kingdom.
If Ebola reigns in West Africa, I see them banning all flights and boats in the direction of the United Kingdom.
We'd always need to send goods that says...
What a pity that the international media panic about Ebola is no longer being used to talk about less spectacular but more deadly health crises affecting West Africans.
We're all threatened.
In every corner of the world, men and women. It's such a sad journalistic article, such a big title.
I could read each paragraph and replace the word Men in other contexts (all relevant): Women are the first caregivers - read - Men travel from one community to another, etc.
Such smarter comments could have been made on ways, reasons and places where we can all contribute to better understanding and interpretation of cultural and sociological approaches, and the differences in the role of the sexes that could help combat Ebola in West Africa.
Come on, let's go, let's think and write, we don't just make noise.
There's a time for everything.
If you are not able to offer a good analysis and an intelligent opinion, perhaps you should just think before writing?
Although I would put female genital mutilation on the same level as decapitation - a form of terrorism as barbaric - its survival rate is only a different form of torture - saying that its temporary suspension is a "light of hope" beyond understanding.
In fact, I see that the contributor is from Sierra Leone, which may give a certain degree of "validity" to his opinion, but in this case obviously it does not give a better perspective than that of an average activist on the street.
And I who believed that the Guardian was being "motivated" as a global resource of journalism - moving forward in the 21st century, leaving its Founding Precepts.
Who in the editorial team would let this appear?
There is no money for a territorial election or any other election.
I constantly read that the territorial public service is increasing its staff, and I have never seen an article giving them the floor or trying to explain why.
It would be legitimate, indeed.
There will certainly be lies and truths to separate us from the good seed of the Hebrews.
The court of accounts costs so much to tell you about economic nuisances.
It is true that they never had anything to manage the people on Cambon Street.
CTs are not in deficit, they have funding needs that can only concern and only investments they make.
It has the power to use too thin concepts the press like the World makes the game of all the obscurants.
Debt is beneficial because it funds investment, collective property
Unfortunately, the financial debt is mainly operating costs...
And as staff redundancy (for example to make beautiful rounds-points) leads to a growing and incompressible burden (compulsory burden to their death, as life-time work + retirement), these communities cut down on investment.
The status of a staff member must therefore be abolished, before the staffing is reduced.
And also responsible for the mayors financially.
It is fabulous that the intercommunals should be accompanied by a decrease in the number of Community staff and that it is the opposite that is happening, proof that adding a step is not effective without the removal of others.
How do you want to manage large territories as well as cacahuettes at the time of the TGV and the car?
The time of the horse in which these territories were created is revolutionized, perhaps it would be time to react.
They wouldn't rather be imprisoned, worse incarcerated, in the administrative scene, would it look like it!
Let's try even garrotated, It's not too strong to explain the blocking situation to which the Väme state has led with its providential men.
That really started with Peter.
Then he went on to finish the "end of breath" series coming very close.
Why don't they live in an apartment at $250 million in Monaco over a movie to leave all this suffering behind?
Europe is also built on a cemetery, it will be a long and difficult process.
When will these people learn to take care of themselves?
Don't even try the answers of the kind "it's the fault of the whites."
"answers" not "answers"
I sincerely hope it's sarcasm.
That was in my previous post, in case it wasn't obvious enough.
That's what happens when we hurry to be the first.
Whether it's sarcasm or not, there's an argument.
It is now agreed that the modern Homo Sapiens evolved in North-East Africa about 200 thousand years ago, and for a particularly wet period about 150 thousand years ago they managed to travel to the North to the Middle East, and the rest (or at least eight thousand years) is part of history.
The current Minister of Defence had stated a few months ago that no military hospital would be closed.
So he lied.
It was certainly the only government that seemed to keep the road.
Now we know we can't trust him anymore.
Get out of here!
in 2017:Transformation in a comfortable private hotel of golden posters for future retirements of the Republic?
Moving the floor dedicated to Bercy?
Very good decision: the Val-de-Grace was a symbol of the past, a medicine for the Nantes and their families, the "Grand V" care of a 3-speed medicine.
We're going to save money, and the soldiers are going to take care of the flu of the last one elsewhere...
Do you know that 70% of patients are civilians, from all horizons?
The London Wasps?
I pity their fans who are based in Wycombe/London.
Like London Irish and London Welsh?
They left the "London" last season.
It's just the "wasps" now.
A franchise of any other name...
At least they're going to Los Angeles, right?
It changes that a football team uses the ground of a rugby club instead of the reverse.
In addition, travel abroad for the Tigers and the Saints will be much easier.
No, it doesn't change anything.
At Stockport County, we had the misfortune to be bought by the Sale Sharks, and we ended up renting our own stadium with them once we found our independence.
I was gonna say the same thing.
The way they insisted on training in the field, although they had access to other places, did not do us any favors.
I love supporting Coventry City.
The good news doesn't stop.
There's always the possibility of a Coventry United now.
It must be frustrating for a team that is ill with supporters and that has been at the top for more than 30 years, to see its stage taken over by a rugby club.
I'm aware of the recent CCFC problems, but this must be a good trap.
For my part, I'm not the rugby of the club, and to be honest, I don't know anyone who doesn't do it except a few fans of the Wasps at work.
Are they and some thousands of other people in the South East going to follow them far away or will they now have to support another team?
Beautiful pro-domo article and good vulgarization.
But who cares?
But then why aren't all computer systems based on these concepts????
+Because a giant mass of pre-existing programs (cobol, java), +because all systems do not need them, +because there is no magic baguette ++....
And because for most computer systems, bugs don't really matter, what counts is being the first on the segment.

But they don't sell.
Real-time IT has become a key sector in many areas, and few are those who know the intimate details of these processes.
I haven't been to an Olive Garden in 15 years.
The quality price ratio has fallen.
I'm sorry for those who are going to lose their jobs, but it's better than closing the box.
I would recommend a simpler menu with choices that are popular.
Reduce costs and prices.
There is already too much salt in our food regimes.
Don't ask Olive Garden not to put salt in the future.
It would be said that they are based on more profit-making, rather than healthier meals and the best quality-price ratio.
They're taking us for chickens.
Oh, yeah, make sure people don't have too much grass.
And then let's make our soup by someone else, it's better when it's industrial.
Make sure there's salt in there, it replaces the real ingredients.
We should also add some sodium glutamate.
The amount of salt you have to add to the water of pasta is negligible, but this greatly enhances the taste of the finished product.
It is not only the taste of salt, it also affects the way pasta are cooked.
The finished product is so much better.
Without salt, there's no food.
Everyone should try alternatives to business cooking.
Are there family restaurants and offer them tasty meals at reasonable prices?
What is happening in the United States is very sad.
An accident at work that turned badly.
A young promiseor, a learned thief, followed his father’s career in prison for murder.
A man has hurt everything and has brutally interrupted this vocation of birth.
To be sentenced to 10 years in prison seems to be the minimum.
Where else are we going?
All right!
What a humour!
The desire to discover it is obvious and difficult to excuse and blame at the same time...
Indeed, the desire to discover it is difficult to excuse it.
That's what makes me have some sympathy for a 15-year-old.
During the trial, the boy's father complained that he would never see his son again, but without apologizing to the relatives of the guy he killed himself.
Who's really the victim of this story?
What is it that you come to mix everything!!!?
The boy's father was convicted of what he did.
With regard to the concierge of lost balls, the accused and guilty, he knew that the bullets were dangerous.
The guy didn't do anything to the defendant!
So let him pay for the crime he is responsible for!
10 years, that's a little much in my opinion.
For having the intelligence to shoot this young man to make a noise?
Actually, it made a noise!
If the opportunity arises, go on vacation in the Mosule Valley and sleep in the B&B of one of the small wine growers.
It's been twice that I do it, wine, landscape and food are great.
Moreover, if you are there during one of the many wine festivals held in each municipality, it is even better.
I'm sorry, Moselle Valley, I've been hiding too fast.
It's nice to see that German wine is recognized.
It is rather important that German winemakers traditionally use only one variety of grapes, which means that they must really drill hard to maintain a certain quality.
Of course, some young generations are experimenting with different grapes, such as in France, Italy, etc.
There is no such thing as the Moselle region to be recommended - France, the Palatinate Rhenan (Pfalz), Baden deserve to be visited.
A French region of interest is Alsace, which is like a mixture between Germany and France.
The wines are German-style (or perhaps the reverse, short).
The Germans prefer beer.
Traditionally, they drink wine after the meal.
Knowing the popularity of dry whites during the meal, they are now offering a lot of them, and with a much higher alcohol content than their favorite 9 degrees.
But their traditional wines put in bottle at the property are so complex, the sweetness is super balanced.
Try Schloss Vollrad's spatle with a thermodor homer next time you go to the rest.
Search Hallgarten online for a good selection.
I used them when I had my restaurant.
Hugh Johnston's World Atlas of Wine is a good guide, superbly illustrated.
I understand that there will be new readers of the Guardian who discover the wine, but this is a record of each newspaper article on German wine since the night of the time.
From time to time, there is an article on the German wines that are coming, the new drys of Baden that are now going to accompany the dishes, the reds that are surprisingly strong, but above all, are not these disgusting Liebfraumilch that people drank when they were young (well, I don't really think it's always true or evocative, unless I address myself to more than 40 years - who, as I say, will have already seen all this).
Closing the Val de Grace would be a huge mistake and an illustration of the sad state in which the Administration of France is.
A crime against Louis XIV and a thorn in my grandfather's back and uncle's back that did their studies.
In democracy, public health management should be submitted to the vote of the House of Deputies: these departmental chambers held by the barbarian, and those decisions made at home, have become unsustainable.
Sorbogreen's right.
It should be done as in Soleil Green: euthanasia at 70 years of age.
Furthermore, we could sell back the meat that will feed our poor active poor (sic) as they can no longer go to the market.
In fact, find work for our unemployed, for real work, and you will have no more deficit problems!
For older people, the time has come to pay a little more because national solidarity is no longer able to provide...
Assets, in the process of disappearance, will not be able to hold only this demographic transition...
So of the hierarchy, sure, but to think otherwise than a hospital model of the 30 glories.
Now, the maximum growth to 1.5% (this has been the case for 30 years) for the next 50 years will force us to rethink the whole model defined after the war!
Val de Grace is the symbol of excellence in medical matters in France: a certain rigour and discipline that we know more about in public hospitals.
If this symbol falls, we're really wrong.
First of all, we're fucked because the rest of the hospitals aren't at the height.
The scandal is that the presidents and other elites are being cared for elsewhere than in the public hospital.
The solution is more likely to increase public service in hospitals than to maintain a two-speed medicine.
The Val is a pole of French medical excellence, and of course a symbol.
The closure would be a mistake, a sign more of the march towards France's mediocrit.
Without talking about military status, which must be kept absolutely.
"The Hospitalization Day Price", a Hospital Management Unit, is decided by the Department with local supervision of the Regional Hospitalization Agencies.
The horror of our nation continues.
Finally, I mean, of course, the baby is only one of these economic refugees, he came to Australia to have a better paid job than he had at home.
In almost all countries of the world, a child born in that country of two non-citizen parents is almost always non-citizen.
Australia goes further than most countries with children born to Australian citizens.
But it is Australia that is criticized because it does not meet some remarkably high standards, with obvious difficult consequences.
Why?
It seems to me that two weights are two measures.
Send Abbott to the Middle East, Pakistan, Sri Lanka to put an end to all the persecutions and mistreatment and war that make people flee their countries and force them to come for help in Australia.
If he doesn't want people to come by ship, then we need to solve the problem that generates this traffic.
I have nothing to complain about life in Sri Lanka today.
The civil war lasted 26 years, tens of thousands of people died on both sides.
This is what happens during civil wars.
However, the war ended 6 years ago and the country returned to normal.
Everything makes sense now, nimrod!
It's strange that British Prime Minister David Cameron didn't believe this little superhero when he was in Sri Lanka with Mr. Abbott...
Cameron denounced the war crimes and abuse that were still taking place.
Several European countries have since suspended Tamil deportations with links to LTTEs, thinking that they would be at risk of torture at their return.
UNHCR revised its asylum applications assessment guidelines in December 2012 and recommended that persons with links to LTTEs be considered at risk of their return.
The year [2013] saw a number of attacks by Buddhist militant groups against Hindus and Muslims.
The elections for three provincial councils were held in September.
Too late, guys!
Mr. Nowak, you've gone to the coconut so periodically.
In fact, this guy could not get a chance to make it.
He didn't have a health insurance in the States?
So he would have been given any treatment.
I would like to know who is going to pay for the medical expenses during his stay in the hospital.
The city of Dallas perhaps, unless some lab pay for the purchase of the body?
In the US, the rule is cash first, help come later.
Specially in Texas
Ah ah ah ah!!!!!!!!!
There was little more, we were told that the Ebola killed so quickly that a large-scale epidemic was impossible (there is all scientific literature on the issue, with models and everything).
Then we were told that the risk of contagion of the returned persons was zero.
It's funny the more we get back, the more I'm afraid.
You need to read funny newspapers to believe that a risk can be zero.
Low or three low but not none.
Finally, c is a scientific reality, more a virus is fatal quickly (generally) less likely to spread because the host's death signifies his own death.
The combination of the 2 (high transmission and fast death) sometimes occurs ex-Spanish flu.
After that, it's the quarantine general to save humanity. . .
There is nothing obscenity about putting forward Western media certain good and virtuous, but at the expense of thousands of other African patients who were not familiar with the profession, the bravery, and the virtues?
This, of course, highlights the action of NGOs and encourages them to help, but the repetition of the announcements is a terrible partisanity.
Freedom of expression, so beloved of the Conservatives.
The suspension was to keep the doctors under control.
I wonder how many doctors voted for Newman and Abbott, brothers of weapons that attack freedom of expression and the right to privacy of the Australians.
I bet they had never imagined that their conservative pensioners would have demolished them from their right to freedom of expression.
I wonder how many doctors voted for Newman and Abbott,
I bet there's someone who won't do it next time.
Yes, that is exactly what we need at the moment, fewer health professionals available during a potential health crisis.
A heat tower for when the problem really gets out of control.
There are already not enough doctors working in the regions around Australia like this.
Tony Abbott's refusal to take part in the "war" against Ebola illustrates his philosophy of medical challenges.
Joe Hockey's plan for a new Term Markets Fund for Medical Research, which should reach $20 billion by 2020, is likely to be just a black emergency fund for the budget.
Using the pretext of noble medical research, it will raise $20 billion and, at a later date, transfer these funds as general income.
I hope that Australian voters come to see this excellent Russian for what it is.
Tony Abbott is much smarter than we want to believe.
He explained that the sale of Private Mediabank is compensated by the Terminator Markets Fund for Medical Research.
However, it is a loss for the sick, a loss for the elderly and a loss for people with low income.
Maybe it's very smart, but it's not fair.
Finally, Telstra's "false rodent" and its end-of-market fund were excellent guardians.
If that's not fair, then let's show Abbott who's smart.
Send him to hell in the next election.
The most terrible thing for Nadine is still the "old personality", tasty....
I also noticed it, quite corrosive as a remark.
If only she could deter her from keeping a buzz on it all the time.
The worst destination for a policy at the end of a career: not to be recognized in the street.
Hello She has not been recognized in her city of Toul as being high enough to administer it.
How good is the sense of "provincial"!
We are living in an era of hatred, Mrs. Morano.
I'm sure I'm against the port of Burqa, but that's not the question.
What this anecdotes relates is sarcosm to the pure state: of mediocre minorities with a status of ministers, a confusion between the function of government and the function of execution (if Sarkozy could come with his tonfa on each stroke of the road to show that he is a well-guarded public order), the rudeness and miscarriage that led to their maximum degree.
I propose that the right to Morano, Sarkozy and all those "former personalities" who have become desperate to carry a firearm and a sign should thus have all the fun to exercise their self-proclaimed role as judges.
But who's Nadine Romano?
This is indeed the main teaching of the case: even the police have turned the Sarkozy page, perhaps they do not regret it.
He really needs to stop before it gets embarrassing for him.
I'm sending this agent who ignored Nadine Morano's existence, if only I could do the same...
Like Bob, for the shot
You don't agree, thanks to her we're going well ...!
Nadine, if she didn't exist, we'd have to make it up!
It's easy, though, it looks like Christine Boutin with a blonde wig.
Suddenly, N.
Morano obviously did indeed in contempt, in contempt of the police officer she had in front of her, and who would certainly have had to multiply the curves and the "Yes Madame, of course, Madame, at once, tell me, Madam, in which direction I must run to seize myself without waiting for this veiled woman."
"In one case, the Australian Super Hornets have abandoned an air attack on an Isis target when the risk of killing civilians has become too important..."
The Americans are not bad at this, but I think that even though Isis is going to go beyond them or they have already done so, in Iraq at least someone was counting the bodies here.
As for civil deaths on an industrial scale, nothing competes with the Western war machine.
I do not agree that the sanctions imposed by the United Nations (including non-Western) between Iraq's two wars would have cost lives to millions of Iraqis, especially children, older people and vulnerable adults.
Most of the anti-war demonstrators I knew would prefer sanctions to defer the "war machine".
Were you also the kind of man who would prefer sanctions on the order and men on the ground?
Very good remark - the United Nations has acted incredibly hard and unconcerned in recent years.
Sanctions are generally ineffective and fail to reach the elite - no doubt one reason why they have the so-called Security Council's occasional approval.
You may remember that the insurgents did not waste time marking their main enemy when they saw him in the recent war in Iraq.
It was the attack on the United Nations Mission's QG that they had raised just five days earlier in Baghdad in 2003.
They hit this place with force and twice and I imagine it with satisfaction and cold blood.
So brutal and severe is this bombing, I was surprised by the shock of people to know that a United Nations mission has been targeted like this.
Well, I actually forgot about that.
Therefore, add one half million people to the total number of deaths of Western nations (at least with recent disturbances in Ukraine, economic activity was directed directly to the people they intended to hurt).
This only helps your argument to exacerbate notoriously unreliable statistics.
The only even vaguely reliable figures on sanctions-related deaths are those of children under 5 years of age, and they are even very suspicious as Saddam Hussein refused to allow objective inspectors to detect the facts.
Obviously, it was in his interest to exacerbate the negative effects of sanctions.
The most reliable believe that the number of additional deaths for this age group is between 200,000 and 400,000, but no one really knows.
As for additional deaths in other age groups, estimates are no better than assumptions.
Since the number of pre-sanctioned deaths in at least five years was about 10 times worse than in the United Kingdom, for example, it is possible that the number of post-sanctioned deaths is largely partial to this age group.
Of course you need to be afraid of her, but also the gift of gametes in general.
We must stop doing as if people were pure spirits, that love was all that children needed, and that we could do it with strangers that neither parents nor children would ever know, without consequences for them.
One of our founding myths is Oedipe, 60% of the French make genealogy.
It is an essential and despised thing to know its origins.
Instead of making it clear and using fantasist arguments, we should explain what serious problems might arise for a child who is adopted or designed with the gift of toys.
If you learned that the parents who raised you didn't provide the games you came out of, you could give it back to me, because they wouldn't have committed any crime.
The latest progress of the WFP (e.g. uterus grip) is at least as controversial as a reasonably framed GPA.
The real question seems to me to be: does the frustration of the desire for children justify these acrobatics and this has nothing to do with marriage for everyone?
Very fair as a point.
Clearly, we need to fear the GPA, which is what this stupid question is.
Of course, it's sad not to be able to have children when we want them.
It's a problem I've had with my wife.
However, it is less serious than being born with or becoming a very disabled person, hiring a serious disease, losing all his children in an accident, etc.
Of all the concerns of life, this is not the most serious.
It's a frustration among many others.
That doesn't stop you from living.
And we can always take care of the children of others!
In a society that no longer supports any form of frustration, where the child becomes well consumed, the GPA is unacceptable to me.
The desire for a child is not a snare in which one can use the other according to his or her wishes.
Sterility requires reflection and acceptance.
