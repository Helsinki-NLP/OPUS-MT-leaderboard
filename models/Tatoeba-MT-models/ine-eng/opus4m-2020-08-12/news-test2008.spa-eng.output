European inflation dropped in food
Accelerated inflation, recorded in the euro area, is primarily due to the sharp rise in the price of food products.
The increase in prices in November has been higher than expected in the 13 euro area countries, recording - after 2.6 per cent of October - an annual inflation of 3.1 per cent - the Office for Statistics of the Union based in Luxembourg announced.
Official forecasts were only probably 3 percent - Bloomberg announced.
The European Central Bank (ECB), unlike the US, British and Canadian emission banks, did not cut the basic interest, its assumption that the decline, together with the rising prices of raw materials and the reduction of forced unemployment, would cause a spiral of inflation.
The ECB wants to maintain the inflation rate below, but at least about two per cent.
According to an analyst, the ECB is in trap 22: "there is a need to negotiate" on inflation so that it does not later have to intervene on this issue.
Inflation of 3.3 per cent, recorded in Germany, hit the 12-year record, while in Spain it increased from 3.6 to 4.1 per cent.
Inflation was fired in the euro area as a result of rising food and energy prices.
Wheat quotas increased by 88 per cent, and soybean quotas reached their maximum level since 1973.
Similarly, much more had to be paid in 2007 for vegetable oil and dairy products.
The price of crude oil on the world market increased by 52 per cent this year, reaching almost $100 per barrel last month.
According to the ECB, inflation in 2008 will jump from 2.1 per cent to 2.5 per cent, in exchange for 2009 will already fall to 1.9.
According to analysts, annual inflation will be maintained in the next 3 or 4 months about 3 per cent, but the average annual rate will be 2.1 per cent.
At the same time, the ECB is expected to reduce interest rates twice during 2008.
Gallup for a Government Crisis
After a long stagnation, by early December, the support of the Democratic Youth Alliance had increased significantly, reaching its maximum level since 2002, while Gallup had never experienced such a low level - 13 per cent - in the case of the Socialists.
The difference in the case of the party's secure voters - due to the strongest strength of the opposition voters - would mean support of more than two thirds (71 per cent) compared to support of one fifth for the Socialists (20 per cent).
According to the survey, the Democratic Forum and the Free Democrats Alliance would not reach even the necessary threshold for a parliamentary scenario: their support within the entire population is two percent.
Among the safe voters are one percent more supporters on both sides.
The economic environment continued to deteriorate even in comparison with the lowest point in the past - it has never been so high, 41 per cent the proportion of those who judged the country's economic situation particularly poor, while 46 per cent believe that the situation is quite bad.
Families, after the most hopeful expectations of spring and summer, are now more pessimistic about changing their own economic situation.
With regard to the coming year, the majority of the population is experiencing a deterioration in the situation and only one tenth is expected to improve.
In December, 71 per cent of the consultants, higher than any previous Gallup survey, believed that the President of the Government was doing better than his duties.
13 per cent of the consultants rely heavily on or rely on Ferenc Gyurcsány, while Viktor Orbán has 38 per cent of the consultants' support.
54 per cent of the population did not trust the Chief of Government at all, and 27 per cent did not trust the President of the Democratic Youth Alliance.
One indicator of the political situation configuration is that, what proportion of society thinks it is possible to control the discontent experienced against the person of the Head of Government without a change of government.
While, after the October riots last year, 35 per cent believed it would be desirable to maintain power in the Government and the Chief of Government, at present this proportion is only 20 per cent, while the relative majority (33 per cent) believe that the only solution is the holding of new elections.
The interest in the referendum is characterized by the fact that 60 per cent of respondents to the participation question replied that they would certainly participate and another 20 per cent said that they were likely to participate.
Comparatively, in "a general election to be held this Sunday", only 55 per cent of the population and another 15 per cent believe that they are likely to participate. Based on the current intentions of the voters, there is no doubt about the outcome of the popular consultation.
74 per cent of the population would decline the payment of study rights, 79 per cent of the medical consultation service and 84 per cent of hospital care.
If we only observed these proportions among the safe participants in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89 per cent of voters would reject the introduction of study rights, medical consultations and hospital care.
The most expensive is Auchan, Tesco has five times its prices
The average price increase of around 16 per cent of Budaörs' trade triangle supermarkets was maintained, with the difference that this year there was no increase in VAT.
Article of Napi Hörság
This year also increased by an average of 16 per cent in the Budaörs gold trade triangle the usual Christmas basket of the Napi newspaper, but in all hypermarkets there was a much higher growth than the thousands of HUFs.
As prices had already been "disarmed" in food supermarkets in December of last year, a percentage drastic reduction was not experienced compared to the high starting point.
However, it is obvious to consumers that what they were able to buy at a price much below the nine thousand HUF last year can not be done today, even ten thousand.
Napi's basket in the studied hypermarkets exceeded by a minimum of 91 HUF the psychological limit of ten thousand HUF.
And the highest-value basket was 10,573 HUF.
(in 2003 that canada cost 6800 HUF.)
The price of Unicum liquor and fish was kept almost at the level of the previous year, but there was a strong increase in the strawberry, nuts and amapola seed.
The price of wheat flour and bread followed the data from the Central Statistical Office, although in Auchan we also found one kilo of bread at the price of 139 HUF.
Competition did not reduce the price of the product to less than 200 HUF.
It was also surprising in this shop that the price of Coca-Cola with two litres was less than 200 HUF, so this product, even with the price of the bottle, cost only 257 HUF.
However, in Napi Auchan's basket it was the most expensive, while Cora was the cheapest.
According to our calculations, with respect to last year's Christmas prices, Cora increased by 15, while Tesco and Auchan increased by about 18 percent the prices in Napi's basket.
Comparing the values of last year's most expensive basket with that of this year's cheapest basket, the difference has been 12 percent, whereas the growth between the cheapest last year and the most expensive year's face has been 21 percent.
The average growth was 1480 HUF.
Last year's average price growth was 1206 HUF, so last year's Christmas in prices felt the increase in VAT.
It was precisely this process that destroyed trade, the supermarkets were apparently unable to decide on the price margin to apply for each product and to calculate the effect of price change on consumption.
(If the trader misplans the speed of movement of a product, he may lose a significant benefit in the margin adjusted to the volume of sales.)
The increase in the price of Napi’s canada reached such extremes as a result of the increase in VAT, which was the most expensive with 1720 HUF higher than the value recorded in 2006, while in the cheapest the difference was only 844 HUF.
This year these extremes did not occur, since the highest price from now has been 1630 HUF more than last year and the cheapest also increased by 1284 HUF.
Compared with the two Christmas seasons, catastrophic growth was recorded in prices in less than 20 months, in hypermarkets more than 30 per cent increased the price of first-time consumer goods.
(However, this does not necessarily confirm the figures of the Central Bureau of Statistics: this office, in the case of some essential foods, recorded an increase of more than 30 per cent in the 12-month period.
For example, in addition to wheat, also in the case of eggs.)
According to Napi's basket, in this last case this seems almost impossible, because in the price of this product that was quite expensive already last year compared to the base, it was recorded, in the worst case, only 10 percent price increase.
According to all indices, flour suppliers have a stronger position than eggs, and may impose the drastic increase in prices even to multinationals.
Hypermarkets do not complain in the gold trade triangle, they keep talking about positive results.
According to our experience, most of the consumers of the three shops visited are no longer interested in prices.
Out of all the products they buy large quantities, taking the preserved food by pallets.
In the morning of Wednesday, the three shops formed large queues in front of the boxes because it suddenly increased the number of customers.
However, we have information that within the country sales volumes are lower, many multinationals complain to polling institutes because income remains below their plans, not only in the case of food, but also in the case of household appliances.
Many hospitals save themselves with disinfectants
This year several thousand infections have been reported in hospitals primarily due to the misuse of antibiotics.
Health conditions prevailing in hospitals, bedkeeping and overloading of staff do not favour the control of infections - says the medical-chief department of the National Centre for Epidemiology.
In many hospitals it even saves itself with disinfectants.
Not long ago, a infection with MRSA has been diagnosed in the traumatology department of the János Hospital.
In a man hospitalized after a serious accident, the presence of the bacteria resistant to antibiotics was detected.
The patient was isolated.
The same type of infection occurred in this same hospital at the beginning of the year.
An injury to a serious car accident was brought to his attention from the hospital and the same patient soon thereafter had to return to the hospital due to MRSA infection and since then has not been able to perform an important surgical intervention due to the presence of the bacteria in his body.
Until 10 December of this year, the National System Nosocomialis Surveillance 1094 cases of hospital infection produced by multi-resistant agents have been registered - said Karolina Böröcz, head of the Department of National Centre for Epidemiology.
This means that hospitals have safely recorded this number of infections caused by multi-resistant agents, and there is no information.
About two thirds of infections (683 cases) are due to MRSA, i.e. Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-oxicillin-resistant.
One third of human beings carry in their nose the staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria without causing any disease.
SA infections (e.g., inflammation of the throat, amigdalitis, skin infections, infections of wounds) respond well to antibiotics and are easy to treat.
However, once excessive or inappropriate application is made to antibiotics, bacteria that usually respond well to antibiotics, turn into very resistant bacteria to antibiotics and rapidly become infected in inadequate hospital conditions.
Serious hospital infections, such as infections of wounds or septicaemia, may be caused primarily in patients with transient or chronic immunodeficiency, in patients with impaired body, in elderly or in persons with low weight.
In the opinion of the medical director of the János Hospital there is nothing special about MRSA infection, these infections are everyday in hospitals.
The infection should not be confused with the epidemic, MRSA is only absent - said Tibor Nyulasi - where its presence is not examined.
Antibiotics resistant
"These patients are isolated, the nursing staff take care of them in rubber and mask gloves and there are appropriate antibiotics for their treatment," said Tibor Nyulasi.
Hospitalized patients are previously examined to verify the presence of MRSA in their body, but it is not possible to avoid infection in all cases.
It's not fashionable to take samples
It would be possible to prevent MRSA hospital infections in most cases, but the current national hospital circumstances do not favour the prevention of training and infection with multi-resistant pathogens - says Karolina Böröcz.
As this infection occurs primarily in hospitals and homes of elders, hospitals should examine hospitalized patients and immediately isolate patients who carry MRSA in their body.
However, the use of microbiological samples is not fashionable in Hungarian hospitals.
This is also due to the fact that the National Health Fund does not finance these medical examinations.
So most of the cases come out in public light when the MRSA infections are already visible in the patient - said the departmental doctor of the epidemiological center.
The European Union makes strict recommendations for the implementation of antibiotics in human medicine and there are also national directives to treat pathological infections and diseases.
Antibiotic therapy should be directed, i.e. microbiological examinations should be made to prevent drug resistance, but hospitals do not always meet this requirement.
Microbiological sampling is even less frequent in the case of pregnant patients or in basic care - said Karolina Böröcz.
Saving with disinfectants
Scientific experiments have shown that in most cases MRSA is infected from one patient to another through health care.
Therefore, they play a very important role in washing hands, using rubber gloves and masks, but also in this sense there are significant deficiencies in hospitals.
MRSA was infected by casting and direct contact between individuals, but it was not always possible to isolate the infected patient under national hospital conditions.
Furthermore, hospital rooms are often crowded, beds are often very attached, although to prevent the epidemic, patients should be separated at least 1.5 metres away.
Unfortunately, it can also be experienced - added Karolina Böröcz - that in hospitals with less favourable economic situation saves with disinfectants, there are few nurses and many patients, and that is why there is a greater likelihood of infection.
In Karolina Böröcz's view, where appropriate preventive measures are being taken, fewer infections of this type are reported or pathogen contamination can be stopped.
Government programme against MRSA
Treatment of contamination with MRSA is a huge cost to the National Fund for Disease Insurance, so in all countries it is fighting against it.
In England, for example, there is a government programme to prevent and reduce cases of MRSA.
The programme appears to be successful, according to the data provided, MRSA infections show a downward trend in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has among its priorities the prevention of multi-resistant agents (including MRSA) and hospital infections due to these pathogens.
Negative control of the police commander's alcoholism caused by a fatal accident
The official expert report on the case of the fatal accident caused by the police commander of District XXII has been made.
The possibility that he was driving drunk or in a troubled state had since been dismissed by the police commander of District XXII, who on Tuesday had stumbled and caused the death of a transitor - Attila Morvai, spokesman for the General Prosecutor of the Capital, reported on Friday after preparing the expert report on the case.
The expert report confirmed the result of the primary control of alcoholism that had already been observed that the former police commander had not consumed alcohol before putting himself behind the wheel.
The chief of the police station of District XXII, on Tuesday with his private vehicle when he doubled the Kossuth Lajos street in District XXII, hit a 55-year-old man who was trying to cross the street, but not in the pedestrian area.
(This last fact, i.e. that the pedestrian did not use the zebra to cross the street, according to the rules of the Transit Code are not attenuating circumstances, the driver must always give up the step by bending.)
The transitor lost his life after he had been hospitalized.
As a result, the district police leader resigned and applied for his retirement, according to the police report, because he was deeply moved by the case.
The case investigation is under the supervision of the Budapest Investigation Prosecutor.
Attila Morvai also said that the former police commander from the outset cooperated with the prosecutors responsible for the investigation.
EUR 400 million more for infrastructure
Hungarian Finance Minister János Veres and Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB) Marta Gajecka signed three credit-limit agreements in Budapest on Friday at a total value of EUR 400 million to finance education, transport and environmental infrastructure, as well as the energy sector.
The European Investment Bank (EIB) approved in 2006 a budget of EUR 300 million to finance the Hungarian budget for transport and environmental protection projects, which will be carried out by the Cohesion Fund grant, of which the parties had previously signed a credit agreement of EUR 100 million, the contract they have just signed with respect to the use of the remaining EUR 200 million.
The EUR 150 million credit agreement is also intended to finance the budget of educational projects.
The EIB approved a total of EUR 300 million for this objective of Hungary, on the use of the remaining EUR 150 million, the decision will be taken at a later date by extending the credit agreement.
The parties signed a contract for €50 million for innovation, which the budget will use mainly for the project of innovation and research at the University of Debrecen.
During the talks, they also covered the theme of the construction of the 4th line of the Metro.
It was agreed that by the time Hungary lasts with the EU the details of Metro financing, they would re-examine the subject whether or not it was necessary to amend the original contract and how to do so.
According to János Veres, this may take place earlier in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990 the EIB has financed a total of 113 projects in Hungary worth EUR 8.4 billion.
The interest of the loans is in line with EURIBOR and the EIB offers an 8-year grace period, without charging a commission to keep the credit at the disposal of the debtor.
Bulgaria, EU real estate paradise
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is remarkable - the attention of all Europe is directed to that Balkan country just mentioned.
What, where and who buy even cheaper in the EU market, will quickly get in the way?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
The preferred goal for real estate purchases in Eastern Europe is undoubtedly some Bulgaria, with its cheap apartments on ski slopes and beach chalets.
The mountainous regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pampropo and Vitosa are the most popular, while on the Albena beaches, the "Costa Dorada", the "Costa del Sol", the old Sozopol and Nesebar, but more and more people are looking for real estate around Kavarna and Balchik.
According to Re/Max analysts in Bulgaria, the country's central area - such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - will also be able to awaken the interest of real estate promoters and more and more people will buy real estate in the especially cheap area of Russia.
The capital of Sofia can also be attractive, commercial spaces and offices promise a rapid recovery of investment.
Bulgaria is on the best way to become one of Europe's most attractive golf courses, thus being a prominent destination also during the other two seasons, in addition to summer and winter.
Therefore, prudent investors are already making their purchases, for example in the surrounding Bansko.
In the opinion of analysts, who buy real estate in Bulgaria, they also strive to change their life and their way of life.
Most of the customers are English, but they also come from France, Belgium, Spain and more and more from Romania.
Maltese and Cypriot promoters are also present and there are traditionally many Russian customers on the Black Sea beaches and in ski resorts.
Foreign clients can be classified into three groups - says Georgi Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max in Bulgaria.
Those who want to install here buy new or renovated buildings at a price between EUR 50 and 100 000 or old houses in bad condition between EUR 5 and 15,000, to renew them later.
They require good communication and access, and for them it is important to close to a large city, shops and generally a local doctor.
The second category consists of chalets buyers (Bulgaria was included in the first 10 holiday destinations of the Germans in December).
The third group consists of real estate investors who make their purchases with the hope of benefiting in the medium to long term.
The price of capital property is constantly growing, as demand is increasing.
Although in the European Union Bulgaria has the lowest real estate prices, in the last five years they have suffered an annual increase of 21%
The increase in the price of real estate exceeds significantly the increase in wages.
Fodor and the six by hundreds of Hungarians
According to the Minister of Environment and Hydrology Gabor Fodor, the meetings at the expert level will be concluded on Tuesday and Wednesday after the official opening will continue the ministerial negotiations on the international climate regime beyond 2012.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries around the world are discussing the Balí Road Sheet, which is available on post-emission reduction efforts, established in the Kyoto Protocol, which is in force until 2012.
There are lively discussions on the particular nature of developing countries and industrialized countries.
The United States has already indicated that it does not wish to negotiate precise figures for the moment, although it tends to agree that, compared to the 1990 situation, greenhouse gas emissions will decline by 25 to 40 per cent by 2020.
Another major theme of the conference is whether industrialized countries, in addition to reducing emissions, are or are not willing to provide material and technological assistance to countries in need.
In addition, an agreement was reached on aid to developing countries.
The support fund, provided for in the Kyoto Protocol, will be directed by a 16-member management board, probably within the UN Global Environment Facility (GEF) - writes "Piac es Profit".
The six per cent of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, the Minister for Environment and Hydrology Gabor Fodor supports the EU's efforts to preserve its avant-garde role in global climate protection and to promote the signing of the new international agreement until 2009.
The Minister stated that the EU is committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per cent by 2020 compared to 1990, whether or not the "after-2012 agreement" will be signed, and is willing to commit to a decline of 30 per cent if the other major developed regions of the world and developing countries are also willing to make commitments in line with their responsibilities and capacities.
Gábor Fodor pointed out that the signatory countries of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol committed to decrease by 5.2 per cent, within which the 15 EU Member States committed to achieve 8 per cent decrease.
Hungary's commitment is to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases by 6 percent over the period 1985-87, which our country will fulfil - it notes the press release from the Ministry of the Environment.
It is a great deal at stake in Balí, since in two years the international agreement on long-term climate policy will have to be signed, because if not, its entry into force would be delayed by 2012. In this case, the reduction commitments entered into in the Kyoto Protocol would not be followed immediately by a new international emission reduction system, the need of which was warned in its most recent report by the IPCC, the United Nations' international scientific association dealing with climate change, which obtained the Nobel Peace Prize.
Thus, the reduction of emissions would be delayed and an increase of more than 2° C of the earth's average temperature could not be prevented, since scientists believe it would have irreversible and irreversible consequences.
British Army Recruited on YouTube
The units of the British army in a video distributor publish recordings of actions filmed in Iraq and Afghanistan to popularize themselves.
First, the British Air Force (RAD) was the one who took advantage of YouTube services: special units moving to Afghanistan since March 2006 are uploading videos about their actions against the Taliban - the BBC reported.
These tapes made with mini cameras mounted on helmets are controlled in the general body of Kandahar operations, then sent to London to be loaded on the Internet.
The political message is inevitable
There are 139 recordings from air force soldiers who have been loaded in this way on the Internet and their "channel" has already been seen by more than 75,000 people.
The British Ministry of Defence registered in the spring of 2007 under the name "defence headquarters" and publishes videos of both actions carried out in Iraq and Afghanistan, while both the British Commonwealth Office and the multinational forces in Iraq (MNFI) have their own YouTube channel.
Operation in Afghanistan
Originally the Air Force had loaded the videos with recruitment goals, but in the opinion of the Ministry of Defence they also served to present to the public the true objective of the presence of the British army abroad.
This kind of propaganda almost costs nothing compared to conventional recruitment television spots - the expert in defence Gordon Mackenzie told the BBC - in return, inevitably have some political message, since in a specific way they justify the reason for the military actions decided by the government.
Americans prepared a video game
The army is also concerned about the fact that, in addition to the reticulously edited and censored recordings, there are also popular videos in the distributor, such as about the death of soldiers: in the "official" advertising films, a bit of hypocrites, officials speak as much of loss, but not as much as the bloody part of the fight.
In addition, many videos have already been uploaded on the Internet from the battle camps of Iraq and Afghanistan, but the British army is only recently taking advantage of this opportunity.
Americans use a slightly different form for recruiting with video games of shooting, free downloadable, called America's Army, in which in the midst of a more or less real situation the player can directly replace the soldiers.
Tombol and pastel salad at the Christmas party of the ministries
It does not seem very sentimental to the Minister of Labour Monika Lamperth: instead of the Christmas party, he will hold a working meeting for his colleagues who will be able to fire in 2007 with salad and coffee pastel.
There is a ministry that will celebrate its festival with live music, in another they will create the Christmas atmosphere in the hearts of public officials with a tombol and a toast.
Party, Christmas environment, concerts and buffets - so enjoy the power.
State offices are also preparing for Christmas.
The biggest Christmas party will be held in the Ministry of Defence, but not for the workers of the Ministry.
In the Christmas of the Orphans the children of the fallen soldiers will receive gifts and for the Christmas of the Missionaries are invited to the family of the soldiers who are currently carrying out missions abroad. A reception will also be offered for the press.
This portfolio will be dedicated to the holiday environment of the end of the year.
The National Agency for Promotion (ANF) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (MET) will hold a luxurious party with respect to the parties of the other portfolios
The MET festival will be held in the House of the Future, with a total budget of 4,320,000 HUF and of the sixty ministry workers expected the presence of approximately three hundred and fifty.
At the portfolio party you will have a Christmas atmosphere, perform artists as well, and there will be tombol luck.
The NAF's Christmas cost 4 700 000 HUF and was held on Wednesday in the building of the National Council of Justice (CNAJ) with musical concerts and dinner.
The room rental cost one million HUF, the rest of the budget was spent for the more than four hundred guests.
We have information that workers from one of the ANF departments are also invited to another Christmas party that will hold a competition management company called the Hungarian Centre for the Economic Development of Community Funds.
To this end, they rented the whole building of the Comedy Theatre.
The information has not been confirmed by CHDE SA as we have not been able to communicate with the competent person.
You can watch without a suit
The CNAJ building not only hosted the ANF festival, but also the Ministry of Justice and Police, which instead celebrated the dance of the day of Lucía on 7 December.
The CNAJ of them did not cover anything for the use of their facilities.
Fifty people took part in the dance.
The party began with the Minister's greeting words and after the dinner there was dancing music in live.
Responding to the [origin] question they reported: to attend the dance it was not obligatory to wear a suit or night dress.
Health, work and local administration portfolios are being prepared for modest celebrations.
The Ministry of Public Health will organize a program and party for its employees in its own building with a budget of HUF 400 000.
On the other hand, the Minister of Labour, Monika Lamperth, does not wait for his colleagues for an official Christmas party, but for an end-of-year work meeting.
It is with the participation of a hundred and eighty guests who - as the press department reports - will only take coffee and salad pastel, so the party will not cost more than 350 000 HUF.
The Minister for Local Governments, Gordon Bajnai, on the other hand, will simply provide with his colleagues in the Ministry for Local Governments and Territorial Development classroom.
The Ministry of Finance (MF) will celebrate a Christmas party in its own action room with the participation of 436 workers.
The Christmas party will have a budget of 2500 HUF per guest - this budget will pay the reception with buffet and a toast.
Since János Veres is the minister, MF workers each year celebrate Christmas in the same way.
On the other hand, there will be no festive atmosphere, the official character will be given not only by ministerial speech, but also by the afternoon of its celebration.
The portfolio of agriculture will offer a New Year reception on January 20, the Ministry will not celebrate Christmas.
The reception will be held at the Vajdahunyad Castle of the Municipal Park and as the portfolio has been announced, there will be a budget of 1000 HUF per person for the hundred guests.
This - according to the press department - is going to be a very simple footing reception, which will only be invited to the specialized diplomats, accredited in Hungary.
These receptions, which are held every year, begin with a brief greeting speech from the minister and conclude with a modest meal.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Education and Culture will not celebrate any Christmas party - this is what the respective press departments have communicated to [origin].
The Department of the Press of the Environmental Portal was unable to report on the budget of the ministry's Christmas celebrations.
What is known is that for the party to be held at the Museum of Applied Arts more than four hundred people were invited.
The forces of the giant strike met
The League Unions and the National Federation of Workers Commissions will be a strike commission on Friday to coordinate the strike of the moon that will last indefinitely.
Saturday will be held a half-day of protest, while Monday - the day on which the final vote on the public health law will be held - will begin the work stop.
This action will certainly cause great difficulties in transport, as railway traffic will be stopped completely and up to 13 hours will also strike workers from the Budapest Collective Transport Company.
On Friday afternoon, the League Unions will report on the details of their strike on Monday, which will be held jointly with the National Federation of Working Commissions.
The Liga strike commission and the National Machine Union will also be set up to coordinate Monday's actions.
Saturday will be held a myth of protest, while on Monday the participating trade unions will speak in a strike for an indefinite time, unless agreement is reached with the government.
This means that - on the day of the parliamentary vote on the public health law - they did not report on the date of the strike.
If the National Assembly rejects the public health law, the unions will immediately withdraw their call for strike.
On the other hand, if the law is passed, the strike commissions will meet and decide on the future.
On the basis of the agenda of Monday of the National Assembly, it is also possible to vote only on the public health law at very early hours of the night, or at best near midnight.
As a result of the strike to be launched on Monday, there will be significant difficulties in transport: railways will stop working for an indefinite period, in the morning a part of the collective transport of Budapest and more than half of the interurban transport of buses from Volan companies may appear.
At the same time, in many parts of the country there will be a closure of half the roads.
Many unions and civil organizations have joined the strike, and their names are constantly updated on the League's website.
Some unions announced their strike for an indefinite time, others for a fixed time.
By the afternoon of Thursday, the State Railway and the Free Trade Union of Railway Workers (SLTF) could not reach an agreement, not even on the minimum services, but, as Christmas parties are approaching, more and more people are traveling on trains.
According to the information received so far, from the beginning of the day to the 13-hour strike will strike workers from the Budapest Collective Transport Company, Budapest Airports from 7 to 9 in the morning, will hold a four-hour strike from the LIGA Trade Unions of the Electric Industry and Thermal Energy, the Educational Trade Unions called for a 2-hour strike and the Democratic Trade Union of the Educators from 2 to 8 hours.
The Hungarian Medical Association will make a national strike at alternative times and the Democratic Union of Health and Social Workers (SDTSSS), which are part of the Trade Union Cooperation Forum, will hold a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four demands made by the League is that the government withdraw its proposal for public health reform and submit a new concept to a social debate.
The second demand is that they gradually introduce the new form of calculation of pensions that will enter into force next year.
The third is that they ensure, even before 2010, in the case of advanced pensions, that occupations that deserve them can enter the system.
The fourth reason for the strike is that the Free Union of Railway Workers (SLTF), which is part of the League Unions, does not accept the proposal of the Ministry of Economics and Transport on the railway lines and expect another different proposal.
Political Capital[b1]: In the country the risk is increased by the Hungarian Guard
According to the Risk Analysis Division of the Political Capital Division, the activities of the Hungarian Guard, formed in August of this year with the support of the Movement for a Better Hungary, have increased from a number of points of view the political risk of Hungary and the region.
The company's "risk warning" is written: in relation to the activities of the Hungarian Guard, the greatest political risk is that "with the worsening of the ethnic tensions between the Roma and non-Gypsies of Hungary, even in the short term, violent ethnic confrontations can occur".
The main reason for this is that the political strategy of the Hungarian Guard is probably the provocation of such an event - added the representative of the research institute.
They said that all of this was due to one of the main flaws of Hungarian political life's protagonists: "The public life protagonists gave the public debate of the Gypsy problem to representatives of the radical and extremist political groups, who were able to base their political strategy on the existing differences between Roma and Hungarians."
This exacerbates the problem, makes normal dialogue impossible, strengthens extremists and increases the likelihood of the outbreak of violent conflicts - they estimate.
Moreover, according to the National Guard's research institute, as a result of the high attention of the national and international media, "the image of Hungary abroad has deteriorated significantly, especially with regard to the stability and democratic development of the country".
They remind us that: since the fall of 2006, it has received increasing publicity and impetus to the reorganization of the radical and extremely right-wing groups of Hungary and that since the summer of 2007, numerous organizations have been formed in the country that are self-defined by “national self-defence associations”.
"The common feature of these groups is that they are self-defined as civil organizations, while openly proclaiming the training of their members for defence - even armed - (civil defence, national defence, public order defence), alluding to the ineptities of the police, the army, i.e. the state" - add.
They said that all this was done in accordance with the method that attempts to give a civil presentation to different political aspirations, based on the discontent of society with politics and political parties.
It is also a political strategy to highlight the civil and the form of partnership in the case of these partnerships not only to avoid legal problems of legal registration.
According to the analysis, the activities of the Hungarian Guard are also a risk factor from the point of view of neighbourhood relations.
"In recent months, many neighbouring States have referred to the Hungarian Guard as a potential danger, while the ultra-nationalist political figures of certain neighbouring countries want to justify their own anti-Hungarian policy with the creation of the Hungarian Guard.
All of this affects the political stability of the region" - they added.
According to the Institute of Research, the formation of the Hungarian Guard is not an isolated phenomenon in Central and Eastern Europe, so that political risks have increased throughout the region.
They wrote that the Hungarian Guard functioned in a similar way as the Bulgarian National Guard, whose constitution was announced in August 2007 by the Bulgarian National Union (UNB) on the far right.
The constitution of the Bulgarian guard is due to the massive disturbances of the Roma who took place in one of the neighborhoods of Sofia (Krasna Poliana).
Taking advantage of this situation, UNB decided to form the guard, arguing that the organization's objective is "the national self-defence".
In his opinion, in the last 17 years there has been "gyptic terror" in Bulgaria, however, the state remained powerless and indifferent to the facts - recalls Political Capital.
They added: this initiative has sparked lively discussion in the Bulgarian public opinion.
As it was written, the increase in the risk of ethnic confrontations announced by certain Roma organisations in Bulgaria to resist will be their own guard.
Since the functioning of the Hungarian Guard has so far shown similarities with that of the Bulgarian National Guard, it cannot be excluded that the Hungarian gypsies also react to the threat in a similar way, organizing their own self-defense - it can be read in the warning on the risks of the Political Capital.
Political Capital Research Director Attila Juház at the news agency's question said: Risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, each year they publish their risk analysis and when they experience something that may influence the change of risk, they inform the public opinion, as in this case, by publishing their warning about the risks.
The party is not always written with red numbers
In Hungary the law precisely defines the days that are written with red numbers in the calendar and has already become a generalized practice that around the holidays - that next year will be less - the working days are reorganized.
Not even in the EU or in North America, parties are unitary.
Hungarian laws make a difference between national party, state party and holidays.
Festive holidays are primarily related to religious festivals and historical efemerides.
We also celebrate the New Year: both the last day of the old year, and the first day of the new year is festive - the last one above all so that those who have spent the old year can rest.
Throughout the year we have eleven parties written with red numbers in the calendar.
It is a national festival on 15 March in memory of the 1848 revolution and on 23 October, a commemorative day of the 1956 revolution.
On 20 August we celebrated the founding of the State, on 1 May the work party, on 1 and 2 November we reminded our relatives and friends who had died.
In addition, in our country there are two days of Easter, Pentecost and Christmas.
According to the calendar, our state, national or religious parties rarely coincide with a weekend, so it is often bridged when there is one working day before or after the festival.
In exchange for the extended weekends thus, work or school cannot be absent during the previous Saturdays.
It is the Minister of Labour who regulates in his specific decree when it is necessary to work exactly in exchange for the day directly before or after the party.
This legal standard is mandatory for all employers and their employees, as well as for employees and public officials.
It is not mandatory in exchange for companies and service institutions which, because of their function, work continuously even during holidays.
This year the order of work can only be changed around the holidays of the end of the year: from 24 December, life in the country is practically stopped, because according to experience, most people "make bridge" during the holidays between Christmas and the end of the year or take their vacations during these days.
The next year several of our parties will coincide with half or end of the week, so there will be less changes in working days than this year.
The agenda will first be changed around the work party so that the workers can rest for four days later.
Saturday, April 26, will be a working day, so that Friday, May 2, will be a festive day.
The other change relates to the festival of 23 October: Saturday, 18 October, we will have to work instead of Friday 24.
On the other hand, the year that comes at the end of the year may rest, as from 24 December there will be no part of work, even if the last day of the year is a Wednesday.
Six little dissatisfactions to make your colleagues' lives bitter
E-mails that we forget to send, audio messages that we never received, innocent lies that happen to us without realizing: they are all part of our Folklore" daily at work.
It is up to you to decide whether to adapt to the minor problems or to avoid deliberately the confusing situations that may irritate others.
Tips.
I'm sorry, I forgot to warn you that they've been looking for you from the marketing department" - says one of your colleagues."
Which is why you weren't on a date?
In the best of cases you feel it and try to repair the matter, you call the marketing department to tell them that you forgot to deliver the message (this is the most common solution).
In most cases, the matter is resolved by apologizing.
Before you do a lot of gossip, you deserve to meditate on the things with which you can make your colleagues' lives bitter and try your best to avoid them.
Do you borrow something that's not yours?
There is nothing more annoying than when you want to grab a document, a useful office or your phone and you don't find them.
Do you remember that you put the stapler on the table yesterday, but this morning it disappeared?
Do you find your missing butterfly on the table of one of your colleagues?
Don't take anything away from your colleagues without asking them, because they'll just get mad at you for pulling away their things.
Don't pick up over or post-it from the office because it may be unpleasant when you need it immediately and get exhausted before time.
Are you talking about your colleagues' private life?
There is no good solution to stop rumors that are already running.
Who, what are you doing and with whom?
Where and why?
Don't pass on to everyone the information you have about your colleagues' private life!
Don't abuse your colleague's trust when he shares his most intimate secrets with you!
You know what you've heard and don't gossip about your colleague in his absence, although others also know about him.
Are you out of your license for an unwarranted disease?
When you call the office by phone and say you're sick and you're unbearable, you feel bad or well, you feel like you'd rather rest that day; you think that others should do your job, your untiring tasks, your work by the way.
Don't insult your colleague!
If you already know in advance that the next day you won't go to the office or something can happen to you, so you have to stay at home, communicate, so that your colleagues or your boss don't have to confront you the next day.
Tarareos, laughs, phone calls
Are you involved in your work, but do you suddenly get rid of him by the footsteps of your colleagues?
Have you ever heard inadvertently a phone conversation that would have been better not to listen to?
Don't bother your colleagues with your tarares, songs, loud voice conversations (less when you do them above your head), potatoes, constant blasphemy, expressing your discontent with your loud voice.
All of these can be annoying, although they are not currently deepening in a project (writing, planning, organization).
Are you blaming others for a mistake?
You don't blame others if you haven't finished something in time, you've forgotten to send an important letter or a message!
Don't pay any attention to the chaos that may arise in the office, or the noise that your colleagues make!
You must recognize if you have made a mistake that harms others and you must repair the fault!
Ask how you can repair your fault!
You feel too at home in the office?
Jogging and shoes: very comfortable habit for the house, but not suitable for the office!
You don't see a comfortable jogging even though your occupation allows it!
Don't be upset, respect your colleagues and yourself by wearing everyday clothes, elegant and beautiful when your occupation demands it!
Loss of interest if you want to meet the expectations of the public
The car moves slowly in the usual morning.
Sounds a strange compass on the radio: violin with electronic effects.
I'm up the volume.
Change the rhythm of music and the previous tones add the low and then the voice of a female choir as a true jewel intervenes.
The channel mr2 reproduces the song Wings of Love from Zagar.
National music life didn't hurt us much with quality electronic pop.
But now it looks completely different when you're listening to Zagar's new record.
Yonderboi appears. Some new and interesting songs from the underground [b2]digital [b3]national little by little will change the image and although the new fashion the rock style garage, break guitars, the national pop electro has shown: there are news under the Sun.
Balázs Zságer started his career in the city of Pécs, played in the Yonderboi set until he started his independent career perhaps because both cannot be protagonists of the same set.
With his project (Zagar) and his music, a mixture of jazz, danceable electronic music and pop, he tried to triumph when he was asked for soundtracks [b4]films (pl.
Ferenc Török Season).
The wider audience was aware of the whole group that in principle acted only in small clubs when the wan2 magazine selected its first album published in 2002 among the 50 most important national records, classifying Zagar, along with Yonderboi as almost the only national trend maker, able to sell in Western markets as well.
There is no doubt that Zagar and his set are fashionable, but no one has asked you whether they wear this label or not.
The set reacted how it should react: it prepared a new and even better disc.
The newly released disc, entitled Cannot Walk Fly Instead, can open new paths for them, although the title itself aims to establish continuity with the initial years in the city of Pécs.
Because this title was one of the lines of the old set of Balázs Zságer.
The reference to the airy, on the flight, but in addition to the airy music, now appeared - according to the spirit and trend of the time - the guitar that sounds stronger, the effect of rock and roll.
With these songs he presented the album at the Millenáris György Ligeti, the singer currently working in England with the set The Puzzle.
The record includes a true success of the channel mr2 Petõfi which last broadcast from morning to evening popular music. This station led to the ears of radio stations the high-fly music of Wings of Love, recorded with six Hungarian singers (Divas Underground).
Because everything is in order (?).
Hvg.hu asked Balázs Zságer.
hvg.hu: After this new success the question arises: Is the one you are interpreting, to what extent is a music dedicated to a selected audience?
Balázs Zságer: The definition of public selected for me means little.
In my opinion there are two types of caste in light music; not mainstream and underground[b5], not alternative and pop, but commercial and sincere.
The so-called underground alternative music can also be boring, meaningless and can also be composed only for sale, which makes it commercial.
But also a good pop song can come from a sincere inspiration.
The attitude of the listeners also works with this spirit, regardless of national languages and borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see any difference between the reception of your music by the Hungarian and foreign public?
B. Zs: In the foreign world, especially in the western part of us, light music has larger traditions.
There not only the 15- and 20-year-old generations attend the concerts, but also the oldest.
They pay much more attention to the changes that are taking place around them in light music, because they consider it part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role does the public play in your work?
Do you care who they are, where they are and how many people listen to your music?
B.Zs: Of course I feel good seeing more and more people attending our concerts.
But we've never composed music for the market.
We do not compose music for any purpose, but for some reason.
The role of the public is rather felt in concerts where there is a reciprocal influence, but this is only in the inconceivable changes of the moment.
And yet I realize that if you want to meet the expectations of the public, you lose your interest.
hvg.hu: To what extent do you want to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He works alone and made his career better west of us.
B.Zs: We do not follow his way, even though sometimes they try to compare our music with his.
Instead, we work on equipment, trust in the musical presence of the other and let it unfold.
At first it was inevitable to compare our work with Yonderboy's music, as many of us started our career in their group and there we started another way.
hvg.hu: In the list of success of mr2 Petõfi Wings of Love is in the first place.
Many people first heard the name Zagar in connection with this song.
Did you deliberately open this style towards a wider layer?
Zs.B.: We didn't intend to make big successes and sell our record with these successes.
This song is more than that.
We add it at the end of the disc, trying to relax after the sound of the disc and the heavier themes.
hvg.hu: How did you select the six singers?
Why exactly to them - what was the main reason?
B.Zs: The idea was to create a gospel-style choir.
Then came the idea of creating this choir of soloists with a good voice from our own national musical scene.
That is how this choir of six women was created - namely Sena, Kutzora Edina, Judie Jay, Bori Peterfy, Enikõ Hodosi [Neo] and Juci Németh - who was then baptized as the Divas of Underground.
hvg.hu: Have you composed exactly that song or girls changed some things?
Zs.B.: This song was in instrumental version a long time ago and when we had all the material on the disk, we thought something was still missing.
The accord attracted the song.
Even that night I recorded the song that the girls later learned.
Everything came to almost the first attempt and in an incredibly spontaneous way.
I remember, I was very excited back then, but of course I also needed the gods.
With my voice, it wouldn't have worked so hard.
hvg.hu: Both on the concert and on the disc it seems as if the girls were in the background.
There are no soloists (except for Judy Jay's short only), they don't have their own role, they sing all together and not more strongly than music, so music doesn't just accompany their songs.
They are also on the stage at the bottom.
Intentionally?
B.Zs: They are in the background simply because of technical problems.
In return, we deliberately did not want to distribute soloist roles.
The song also pours out on it, on which we forget a moment of our ego, who comes from where and where to go, so let those wings, the wings of love raise us.
I would have liked to have others feel that euphoric mood that we felt when this song was born.
hvg.hu: What more work have you dedicated?
Zs.B.: In the musical composition in fact no one, rather at the time of mixing there were more difficult pieces.
For example, the Dorian Gray's Dilemma that I'm playing on a concert piano or the Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where for a long time I didn't want to work the groove and then, little by little, everything became like a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite song on the new disc?
Zs.B.: This constantly changes with the concerts and because I've already "released" the disc.
Now the Prophet is A Fool, the Escape From The Earth and the Never The Same.
A stockbroker risks billions of millions for its inferiority complex
A wicked and disloyal one.
This is how former employee Jerome Kerviel, the giant French banker of Société Generale, also owns the Czech Trade Bank.
He lost about five billion euros for him.
However, it seems rather that Kerviel was a great player who wanted to be compared to his colleagues and, no doubt, with good abilities.
Intuited long ago, unlike all the large Czech banks, the crisis in the US mortgage market.
"He's a fragile character" was left to hear from his superiors, the same ones who sent him to the police.
But what emerges from Kerviel's responses to the French media, such as the Le Monde newspaper, is that it was a man who at the end of last year had a profit of more than EUR 1.6 billion thanks to his business.
Crisis not only in America
"All I wanted to do was make money for my bank," he assures in his answers.
Precisely, in summer, he was able to win during the US crisis, EUR 500 million.
This opportunity has already seen it come early in the year.
In February they began to hear some news about the so-called sub-prime mortgages offered to low-income customers or those who in the past had problems with payments and that these customers would start having problems.
However, this crisis should not affect the whole economy.
Kerviel did not believe it and bet correctly.
And then, at the end of the year, their profits exceeded EUR 1.6 billion.
"When I already won my first 500 million I don't know how to report it," Kerviel confesses and adds, that nothing has been left for himself, at all.
Throughout the interrogation, he stated that he had forged the records in such a way that they were not discovered.
He even got fooled by the bosses, even when the Eurex bag began to take an interest in his business.
Risk became a benefit
Was he afraid he'd find out?
Rather, no.
"I thought that I had won $1,600 million for the bank and that from that simple fact, that would make you happy."
Where did he get so much willpower to risk himself that way?
In my position, I had to work gradually.
He joined the Société Generale in 2000, just after he finished studying in Lyon.
Their annual salary was between $51,000.
Two years later, he was already a Bolsa runner and in 2005 he became a scholarship runner with an annual salary of $90,000.
I still knew I was never going to win as much as the others.
"In my first interview in 2005, I noticed that they were watching me carefully.
Because of my training and also my professional and personal progress," Kerviel described to the researchers.
But in the short time I entered the company, the first great success came.
Thanks to Allianz's actions, he won, during the attacks with bombs in London, playing at the bottom a €500 million title.
And this assumed a start-up mechanism, and I wanted more.
If you want to, let's leave you.
"This is like a snowball," said the police.
But it is said that the bosses knew of all this or that they were rather suspicious of it.
"As I made money, my eyes were closed."
Only then came the blow at the beginning of this year.
One day he lost billions of euros.
After the weekend of mid-January, he wanted to erase all traces.
When Monday came to work, he was no longer working at the bank.
And two days later, the bank announced that it had lost EUR 5 billion for its fault.
And how did they get him to locate him?
He's been suspicious since his vacation.
"I've only chosen four days for the past year.
The runner who doesn't have a vacation is a runner who doesn't want anyone to take a look at his file," Kerviel finished.
The Czech Republic has the possibility to reach 365 billion
The Czech Government's ministers signed yesterday with representatives of the European Commission a total of nine operational programmes from which the Czech Republic can reach EUR 14 billion (approximately SEK 365 billion).
This is almost half of the total amount that the Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels for the years 2007 to 2013.
Of seven operational programmes, approximately 125 billion crowns will be issued for the regions.
Czech companies can get about 100 billion crowns from the Company and Innovation Programme.
Most of the money will be spent on transport, up to 150 billion.
The Transport Programme is the largest of the operational programmes and represents up to 22 per cent of the resources the Czech Republic can obtain from the fund.
This money increases the budget of the State transport infrastructure fund, which will amount to $90,800 million next year.
The Company and Innovation programme should serve entrepreneurs and businesses to obtain resources for business innovation.
Businesses should receive funding for the acquisition of new technologies, industrial research and the implementation of more effective organisational methods.
With regard to the current use of EU funds, the Czech Republic is among the recent countries that use them less.
Twenty-year penalty for Nicaraguan former president, court ruled
The Nicaragua Appeals Court on Thursday decreed the 20-year penalty for the country's predecessor, Arnaldo Alemán, who was sentenced in 2003 for a $100 billion fine (almost $1,800 million).
Despite this, a while later, he was released from prison for house arrest in his farm near the Nicaraguan metropolis.
There is nothing clear at this point, according to the AP agency that, then the head of the Central American state between 1197 and 2002, is again among the ranks.
According to the President of the Court of Appeal, Ileana Pérez, he will depend more on the prison officials if they let Germany finish their sentence at home or if they send him back to prison.
Four years ago, the court demonstrated that Germany was constantly transferring government money to a company in Panama.
This society was fiction, and the account actually belonged to its closest relatives and supporters.
Part of this money ended up in the fund that Germany created to fund its campaign in the 2001 elections.
This is how the budget was approved.
That's right.
The State budget was adopted.
Why is this budget special?
It is the first developed by this government and accepted by most of the coalition without the support of the opposition.
The budget for this year was already approved with the support of ČSSD, because it was prepared by Minister Sobotka and ČSSD that it could not be allowed to accept it.
Apart from different debates before the vote on the government's confidence vote, nothing dramatic has happened this time.
The parliamentary assembly, in this traditional view, although the most influential, peacefully passed the new law.
It's a great paradox.
Each government begins and ends with each chapter and budget departure, whether they like it or not.
The budget is an important part of the policy, but it hides the rivalry of power between government and opposition.
It is important for the media and is therefore given special attention to it.
Political discussions are much more interesting than simple numbers.
The State budgets of the last social democrat governments have suffered from three defects that it is not possible to solve so easily for this year of 2008:
The first of these is the high participation of the mandatory laws, called as expenditures of officials who are not only pensioners but also social benefits that were already approved last year before the elections by the "silent" coalition of ČSSD and KSCM.
The second is the economic deficit as a result of the first defect.
The third limit is the deficit of public funding, such as the municipal and Community budget deficit.
Nevertheless, the greatest risk is not in the deficit of the State budget.
This is public and relatively under control.
The time bomb, however, is in the municipal and community budget deficit.
Many mayors in order to obtain other sources of investment, apart from the money from taxes, taxes and bank credits, have often issued, without meaning, obligations with which they have disproportionately owed to their municipalities.
In recent years they have managed to pay these debts through the massive sale of energy shares and other development networks received from the state and privatization.
They do not currently have this resource.
If we heed only the official and verified facts, we find that:
Our economy, a few years ago, has been going through growth phases in the same way as the rest of the world, what is called ČSSD.
This was an ideal opportunity for his government to order the state's finances.
Instead, however, the state continued to owe.
The rest of the countries, with the exception of some such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have saved much more reasonably than our republic.
It is a great shame that falls, above all, into the previous government.
We belong to nations that are less threatened by poverty within the framework of global measures.
That is why there is no need for massive social programmes which have unfortunately become immeasurable in recent years.
And although they managed to eliminate some of the incomprehensible populist expenditures approved this year before the elections, if they do not soon change the retirement age and pension reform then it will really be the end of any policy in this country and, the government who governs it will only be a simple bureaucracy.
Exaggerating a little, we can say that the politicians who govern will become officials, mechanical distributors of most of the money on retirement taxes and social benefits.
Therefore, this year's budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can stop the pressure on normal expenditures of officials.
The planned deficit of over 70 billion for 2008 would have been absolutely unnecessary, if the past government had not spent the last ten years on what they could.
We would not want politicians who rule to become officials only, so we should be patient and grant this weak coalition of government, which is realized that the state can only spend what it is able to obtain from taxes and taxes, the quietness for the preparation of other reforms of the laws.
Only this will enable the gradual achievement of a balanced State budget.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The Bank of the United States Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the British, Swiss and Canadian Central Banks decided to fight together against the financial market crisis.
The Monetary Market will receive over a hundred billion dollars through tenders.
In these tenders, banks undermine interest rates by which they are able to lend money.
For example, American Fed will send out $40 billion to tender, and then another $24 billion will be facilitated by the central banks of Europe and Switzerland.
After the attacks of 11 September, it is the first time that central banks of different states agree on this coordinated process to protect and mitigate the consequences of the financial crisis.
"This step should solve the biggest economic problem, i.e. the continuous growth of the free capital shortage that banks could lend," said Bernard Baumohl of the company's Consultant Economic Outlook Group in his report for customers.
"This coordinated action by the central banks probably reduced the recession in the United States from 65 percent to 50 percent," Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already spent $60 billion on unpaid loans, especially in the United States.
Economists are still waiting for billions of losses.
"The central banks must really be afraid of what they expect when they decided to take this step," said ABN Amro's chief economist Kieran Davies.
"It seems that the situation is really bad," he added.
The central banks fear that they have the same problems of access to loans and that they will therefore have to lend more expensive to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and send the US economy to recession with different impacts on the growth of the world economy.
The central banks thus decided, after not being able to reduce the so-called LIBOR tariff, that London interbank tariff is used for the money loan in the interbank market.
This means that banks were constantly afraid to lend money even when the Central Banks of the United States, Canada and Britain reduced their interest rates several times during the fall.
"It will have the same effect as another fall of interest" said to agency Reuters, Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting.
Some economists are not surprised that the step taken by central banks helps to spark the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem of the fall in the US real estate market.
Klaus: The discussions of environmentalists are incredible
Global climate change affects, in particular, developing countries.
President Václav Klaus again expressed himself on the issue of global warming.
Criticism has now emerged with the conclusion of the United Nations International Conference on Climate Change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book Blue, not a green planet, he commented that the discussions of environmentalists are incredible.
According to Klaus, it is unacceptable not only the structure of the conference that creates a strange mix of representatives of government and non-governmental organizations but the fundamental difference between rhetoric used and reality.
"There the debates are only structured, they are artificial fires of words, replacing the solution to the current problems," Klaus said.
The Czech President during the presentation of his book stressed that this topic is very important to him and that is why he is interested.
He also expressed his joy at discovering his book translated into German because, as he said, "sometimes I only encounter the caricature of my ideas."
Interested parties can now be informed of their multifaceted views.
Klaus recalled that he is not a climate scientist but that he has, in his opinion, enough supposed to write a book like this.
It is academic, capable of following and judging a specialized dissertation, has experience with statistics and is also an economist.
At the main moment of the closure, he expressed his view that the climate was constantly changing and that its changes were normal, that there was no agreement between scientists on global warming, that the consequences of the current changes were not so great and serious, or that they represented possible disasters and that attempts to influence climate development were useless, ineffective and cost-inappropriate.
In addition, as an experienced man with totalitarianism, it is unacceptable to impose unproven opinions on others, which feels as a dangerous way to limit the freedom of others.
He repeatedly explained that he was not against "reasonable environmental defenders but against environmental militants who do not consider the cost-benefit relationship".
Klaus spoke on the same subject in Vienna two months ago at Hayes Institute.
600 000 people did not get to change their driver's sheep
Six hundred thousand drivers were passed on the date and were therefore unable to change their old sheep to drive whose validity ends at the end of the year.
Today is the last day when people can ask for change so that officials can spend time with them until the end of the year in issuing the new sheep.
However, the Ministry is not afraid that after the New Year they will find themselves on the roads hundreds of thousands of drivers without the valid sheep.
According to traffic, sheep have not changed mainly those who do not even want to drive.
While peoples announce a rapid decline in the trade of meat, the metropolis offices are full of requests and the interest in the new meat has increased.
The Town Hall calculates about 2,000 customers per day.
The queues wait half an hour.
In Prague, about 140,000 drivers have not yet been drawn.
The release of a new sheep takes twenty days.
However, it is possible to request the issue of the sheep within a shorter period of five days.
But in that case the driver must pay 50 crowns.
Drivers who must change their sheep and do not reach the end of the year, but they will leave the roads without the valid sheep will risk a fine from January.
The offender will pay up to two thousand crowns.
The police can arrange the offence with a warning.
In the event of an administrative offence, the fine will amount to 2,500 kroner.
According to the previous information, a fine could be imposed on that person who is not going anywhere.
They could probably pay up to 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry appealed to the offices to enter moderate fines of a thousand crowns, as a maximum.
According to the spokesperson for the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka, the fines of thousands of crowns do not threaten anyone.
According to him, driving sheep is a document in which people can decide whether they want it or not.
It is not the identity card that each person must have valid.
People who don't want to drive should deliver the driver's sheep.
Just bring it or send it by certificate to the municipal offices.
At the end of the year, meats issued during 1964 and 1993 cease to be valid.
However, drivers should gradually change the other types of sheep.
Persons with the document between 1994 and 2000 have up to three years to change it.
The validity of the sheep issued between 2001 and 2004 ends in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, this is about 2.6 million more documents.
Court reduced the punishment for Berdych's complicit detectives
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Konňarík accused of complicity with the criminal David Berdych will spend between 13 and 10 years in prison.
The Prague Supreme Court decided as a final outcome to reduce penalties, first to one year, and second to two years.
The Department's detectives were being accused of organized crime and were going to fall, in principle, from 14 to 12 years of age.
Against today's decision, it can no longer be invoked, only through the repeal by the High Court.
Berdych is also in this accused case but he is first awaiting the verdict of the Court of First Instance.
Despite this, a total of 16 years has already been sentenced to another trial.
You can't get any more.
In January, the District Court recognized the participation in the recruitment of 19 persons and today the Supreme Court revoked 16 of them.
Most of the charges of the accused were rejected by the investigation for the reasons set out.
According to the Central Bohemian Senate, members of the police, according to Berdych, passed information from police sources to criminals, covered the robbery, and helped members of the criminal group to avoid punishment.
These criminals delivered 30 percent of their theft to Opava and Konjárík.
The charge refers to the criminal acts committed by the group between 1999 and 2001.
With regard to theft, their victims suffered serious health impacts but were also accused of abuse of power as public agents and without the permission of weapons.
In the home register, the police found guns, ammunition with steel core, a laser director and a machine gun.
The group of criminals, according to the charge, stole tens of millions of crowns.
Except for almost twenty men in this trial, the court has already found Berdych and other accused.
Other men related to the Berdych case are still declaring other processes, and in some cases they have not yet appeared.
Tomáš Pöt and Maroš Šuljej, who have for the time being avoided the trial, are in prison in Ireland where they await the final decision on their surrender to the authorities of the Czech Republic.
An account for changing a few children: 12 million
To change a few children in the maternity home, the family attorney, Igor Veleba, wants 12 million more compensation crowns from the Trebič hospital than the costs of the trial.
For each of the mothers, three million, for the parents, two million, and for the children, one million.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 per parent.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ondřej Dostál, is not in principle in line with Veleba's proposal.
"We did not approve this request, it is too high," Dostál said after today's meeting.
"In order for us to come up with an idea of this counter-proposal, we need the report of the specialist that the counterparty ordered to investigate.
We'll see if it has a redeemable value.
We maintain the view that there will be hundreds of thousands for all," Dostál pointed out.
The amount should be between 100,000 and 200,000 crowns for each parent.
At the beginning of the case, Jablonj’s family wanted, every month that they did not raise their biological daughter, a million crowns.
Velaba was used as the basis for negotiating compensation for the expert's report, only it was prepared at the Motol Faculty Hospital in Prague.
The parents of girls according to specialists in psychology and psychiatry suffered from psychological impact and stress of different levels and depth.
The stress situation was better supported by men, although they were struggling with recriminations for the change of girls.
Women carry it worse with the trauma they are currently experiencing and with regard to what happens today, Veleba completed.
Veronica and Nicola were changed by nurses at the Motherhood House in Trêbič last year, December 9.
Last week, the girls returned to their biological parents, Nicola to the Chermákový and Primbyslavic, and Veronica to Libor Brož and Jaroslava Trojanova in Jabloň.
The governor of Vysočina, Miloš Vystrčil, delivered to each family at the end of October 100,000 crowns as compensation for the mistake made at the Trebič hospital that the region administers.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are provided by law as liability for damage.
In case of errors, they must withdraw from the reserve fund and may request assistance from the administrator.
To date, the court has recognized them with relatively low compensation, the amounts calculated according to the tables of hundreds of thousands and an extraordinary amount of one million crowns.
Polivka lost the kingdom of Valaquia
Bolek Polívka lost the argument over the Kingdom of Valaquia brand.
According to the judgement of the Provincial Court of Ostrava, it was the first one to use the Valaquia Kingdom brand but the project was created for many years by Tomáš Harabiš with whom the actor collaborated.
Polivka did not appear today in the oral view.
According to your lawyer, the case is probably not over and your client will resort.
"The argument is that Mr. Harabiš and his team are parasites of the popularity of Bolek Polívka," said after the trial, Polívka's lawyer.
For him, before the words of the Kingdom of Valaquia, everyone sees the image of the actor and comedian.
The same idea also has Harabish.
"We've been following us for about ten years.
Looking for money and invention of activities," he said.
For him, the cause of the dispute is in the money.
"After years I have realized that the project is successful and that it could also receive something.
They want to live as parasites of our work" he added.
A profit-making business
According to the court, the trademark of the Kingdom of Valaquia was first used by Polivka in its television program.
In 1993 he was crowned by the actor Radoslav Brzobohatý.
Then it was not a matter of guiding it towards the creation of a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabiš had to edit the passport of the Kingdom of Valaquia.
From this comedy came a profitable business and business business from which Harabiš later created the Kingdom of Valaquia.
In 1997, Polívka agreed to use her name and sign the passports and even offered her owners discounts to visitors of her farm and visitors to her shows.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge also today determined that Harabiš only used a simple idea that Polívka made public on the stage for its own business benefit.
"It is clear that Bolek Polívka helped the popularity of the Kingdom of Valaquia," the judge said.
He added, however, that in the spirit of the project is Harabiš and his team, who were fully committed to it.
The collaboration, among today's uncommitted parties, continued until the year 2000 when Harabiš organized the official coronation in Vsetin for Polívka.
Since then, conflicts have begun between Polivka and Harabiš, whose culmination has come with the overthrow of the "King Boleslav I, the elected one forever".
The main role in the kingdom, through Harabiš, was derived from the singer Jarmila Šuláková, as a mother queen.
In 2002, Polívka filed an indictment against Harabiš and his society that has been rejected by the court so far.
Something clearly could bring in the fight, the tournament by the throne with its princesses, who is already preparing Harabiš.
The new king should come out of him.
You did not want to disclose any more data or dates.
"We don't have any rush.
It should be something like the king's way to Moravia.
The king would have to be elected on a specific date.
Even Mr. Polívka can present himself," Harabiš added.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: prejudices overcome
To tell you the truth, I've never liked Peugeotu 206 too much.
Their walking characteristics were never special, the quality of the change box, maneuver and also the product could be characterized as below the average.
But now its successor, the Peugeot 207, exists on the market, and this one, is much better.
This Combi called SW is a little bit more advanced and to me, I just have to think about it better.
When I tried the classic Peugeot 207 five doors, I complained, for example, about the head space in the back seat.
But this would be the only complaint because Combi's body means in this sense, that I'm not going to suffer in front of the two meters in length.
Flying around the world
Step through the inside quickly to not repeat it too much.
This is an elegant design where the only defect is the poor central tunnel.
Here you would appreciate the design invention even though the car already looks quite elegant.
The seats are comfortable, there are times when we complained about short seats and backs.
In contrast to model 206, the lateral direction has improved considerably.
And space?, and here you can feel how the measures of the bodywork have grown.
In the Combi disappears the cited lack of space in the head.
Bags to the trunk
But the main thing in this vehicle is your trunk.
This must be valued as very accessible ( thanks to the lower back door) and a well distributed storage.
Dead spaces are equipped with rubber straps that provide an ideal solution.
They don't bother, and they can extend to the point of subjecting heavy objects.
But we stay in the warehouse.
According to the tables, the basic system has a capacity of 428 litres, which, compared to competition, is a mean value.
But not compared to the vehicle of the same type sold in the Czech Republic, the Škoda Fabia Combi.
If we compare 207 SW to the new generation of the Mladá Boleslav model, we will find that the Peugeot remains at the Zaga with its 52 litres.
From vacations abroad or by placing the child's carnet its value is critical.
But if I had to comment on something positive, then I have to quote the floor that's pretty flat after the back of the second line.
120 horses in four moves
Our car test was equipped with a four-valve injection fire with a capacity of 1.6 l and a strength of 88 kW.
And to say the truth, it's like it should look like a 1600 that disrespects the family's five doors.
It's quiet, it consumes little and above all, it has momentum.
If I compare it to the time of the damage from then it seemed as if the escape tube was covered by a trap, I can say that with this I can be impressed.
Prices respond
The car price is not for all pockets.
We must, however, take into account that we have tested an elegantly equipped vehicle and a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with an injection fire of 1400 by 329,900 crowns is still possible.
Our aggregates have put it from 410,900 crowns, which is already too much.
The tested Premium type already reaches another 80,000 crowns.
Only we would still have airbag in our heads, automatic air conditioning, automatic cleaning, automated rear windows...
That is, the car with everything, costs 531,900 crowns.
It's a lot, but it's counting on the Fabi team's plugins and it'll get to a pretty similar number.
Now only one of the two brands remains to be decided.
Slovak students do not join English schools
In English schools, children from countries east of Europe attend, so locals fear more changes in schools.
The integration of Eastern Europeans for now only brings a number of problems.
Even British schools record cases where conflicts between immigrants and native children increase in violence.
The problem of the integration of children from Eastern Europe into British schools is well illustrated in the northern city of Kent where conflicts between natives and Slovak immigrants begin to grow.
Discussions, extortion and bronchosies between students have already reached even the parents themselves.
The situation has come so far that Chatmam police arrested a Slovak woman who was beating a ten-year-old student with a green rod.
In his defense, he said that the girl was insulting her son with racist tone.
The police also had to act after an attack by two younger girls against a Slovak immigrant.
The girls threw him with racist insults and threw stones at him.
"When we went home, a boy approached us at the bus stop and began to spit on us.
When I told him to leave it, he made us a fan of throwing apples and feathers, and then he took off his pants and showed us his back," described another unpleasant incident for The Times, the mother of the Slovak student.
The complaints are from both sides.
One of the natives even designated the conflict with migrants from Eastern Europe as a struggle for survival.
The above cases show us how the environment in English schools starts to be rather tense.
In Britain there are 70,000 Slovaks who came here for work reasons.
About 30,000 Slovak students attend English schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors it is really the island of freedom.
Anything you expect from your vacation can be fulfilled, provided you choose correctly.
Plays sandy and golden, large waves or a calm sea like a pond.
palm trees and all enclosed with chambers offering pizzas on the beach, ice creams or various cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf the roulette.
In the Caribbean Sea Island you can find all this and much more.
Only one island finds much more and that island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of all the islands of the Great Antilles.
In the Spanish era, Cuba became the bastion of the conquest of America.
Colon called her, the most beautiful place the human eye has ever seen.
Havana became a warehouse and cargo port of the treasures that the Spanish brought out of America and brought to Europe.
And then the American era came.
The National Hotel grew in the late 20s.
He ordered it to be built by one of the leaders of the American mob, Lucky Luciano, because everything about crime in the United States (and therefore banned) was welcomed and supported in Cuba as drugs, game and prostitution.
Among their guests were, among others,
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
High buildings emerged in Havana, with wide avenues running the cars that were a symbol of worship in the 50s of the last century.
Ernest Hemingway bought a farm in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Cojimar he had his yacht.
On the walls of the Middle Bodeguita left their signatures the stars of the world of the show and politicians of all America.
And today?
On the walls of the Bodeguita abannen you can also leave your autograph.
At the bar of the expensive National Hotel, the cocktails are mixed according to their wishes.
And these cars are already in service in the 1950s, so far they continue to operate in Havana, because those Lada and Fiat who have arrived for a long time have been oxidized between these wet and salty winds.
Even when La Habana, in particular the old neighborhood, is deteriorating significantly, there are not as many wonderful colonial monuments as there.
Other places are metamorphized in beauty, for example, Trinidad.
Because tourism brings so much needed money, its development is guaranteed.
In the last fifteen years, new hotels have grown not only in Havana but also in Varadero, on the coast of the province of Holguín and in islets such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a curiosity that is in the single world and is highly appreciated by railway lovers.
The sugarcane is transported from huge plantations to sugar factories by narrow lines in steam or electric machines.
Their cars for decades have not been discovered and now they are there, machines that work and whose brotherly models are located in other parts of the world only in museums.
Where are you going?
The most known place for most visitors does not change.
And for this reason, it is no longer necessary to talk about La Habana or Varadero.
Perhaps, just remember that in Hemingway's already mentioned farm there is a museum that for those who are writers' lovers, they should never stop visiting.
The valley of Vignales is the most picturesque corner of Cuba to the west of the island.
Exuberant vegetation that grows on rocky rocks.
Mogots, sandstone pillars and high rocks carved into the valleys, and in their caves acclimate fertile land thanks to which rocks are formed that hide dense vegetation.
The valley is the place where tobacco of the highest quality is probably grown in Cuba.
Visiting some of the pure habanera factories can be found with your final product.
It may seem interesting to someone that the Chilean part of the series, Major Zeman, was surrounded there.
Trinidad
Old Aboriginal town that was founded not long after the Spanish colonized the island.
Slavery and sugar brought her fame and wealth.
The wealth became beautiful with the constructions in the small city.
Spanish colonial architecture, especially influenced by French settlers later, has only changed in four centuries.
Trinidad, between the sea and the Escambray Sierra, is such a distant place that in the 50s of the last century there was no road to join it with the rest of the country.
Such isolation helped her to stay out of the rest.
Nothing new was built and therefore nothing destroyed, for each person was happy to have where to live.
If you have more time to be in Trinidad than one evening, it is worth knowing interesting places in the surrounding areas such as the Beach of Ancón or the valley of sugar factories.
the night belongs to the House of Music, which with its music encourages the silence of the mornings.
Baracoa
Small town in the far west of Cuba, some consider it the most beautiful of the island.
That opinion is certainly already confirmed by the way itself.
The two roads that arrive there from Guantanamo must pass through high and broken mountains, as well as through a nature that only knows the action of man.
This eastern place of Cuba has been registered as the World Heritage Site by UNESCO thanks to its intact nature.
There they make the best chocolate, in their church they have the Cross of Colon (in fact it is a cross that came 100 years later from the landing) and from the hill, where there was the castle and that now there is a hotel with its own name, you can see the mountains and among them the most famous, the Yunque.
Coffee, ron, pure, Sierra Maestra, Bahía de los Cochinos and the island of Pinos, the Tropican Cabaret, the patronage of Cuba, the Virgin of the Charity of Copper, the Santeria, the African religion that practiced the descendants of those slaves, all of which could be filled with many pages.
However, as it is said, it is better to see it sometimes.
The allies are passive in Afghanistan, Americans say
Few soldiers and insufficient equipment are being influenced by the march of the mission in Afghanistan.
NATO, according to US Defence Minister Robert Gates, should design a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mission to Afghanistan is not as it was thought, they coincided in Edinburgh, Scotland, with the representatives of countries with troops in the southern part of the country.
At the same time as conflicts with the Taliban movement grow, today, the eight participating states discuss the plans and coordination of the allies.
While the United States, through its defence minister Robert Gates this week, encouraged NATO forces to become more active, Britain sees as a priority to strengthen the authority of the Afghan government and the allocation of development aid.
"Development in Afghanistan is palpable but armed forces can only be one of the solutions.
The next is to enable the population to start economic and security development only," said Des Browne, the minister of defence, to the BBC station.
Ninety percent
The activity of Afghan rebels according to U.S. military data is greater than in the last five years.
The number of violent actions increased from the last year to 27 per cent, and in Helmand province to 60 per cent.
NATO countries have some 40,000 soldiers in Afghanistan, the fourth of which are in the south of the territory.
However, for the United States, the allies have reached the same limit in terms of unit organization and equipment.
They are exactly asking for more helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan units.
"We will have to think seriously about concrete goals for the future and how we will achieve them," Gates said.
Similarly, NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop spoke today.
"I am not happy to know what we have in the earth and in the sky in Afghanistan.
We have a hundred soldiers and teams that we would need, and that's not enough," De Hoop told agency Reuters at the close of a three-day meeting with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who's passive
Among the assistance countries in recent months is the issue of whether all allies do the highest in Afghanistan.
For example, Germany was criticised for passively.
"Germans have a relative number of replacements in Afghanistan.
But they are in a minimal area of violence and the demands of fighting there are not as high as in our, in the south and east of the country," Gates said.
Sun's sensationalist newspaper, this week called the German soldiers waves.
"The Afghan rebels discover that the Germans are dedicated to playing while our boys are fighting," Sun wrote in a material accompanied by pictures of German soldiers playing table tennis.
German Bild responded to the attack and published a photograph where the British troops were playing a rugby party in southern Afghanistan.
The debt of the State will reach the billion in 2009
For each Czech country, the state owes 84,000 crowns.
The total debt rose to 842,70 billion crowns in September.
This year the government planned to lend 159,200 million crowns.
However, in early December the ministry reduced the plan to $152,80 billion, thanks to the improvement of the state budget economy.
The Czech Republic's state debt grew to SEK 842,70 billion at the end of September.
In nine months this year it increased to 40,200 million crowns.
Since June, however, the crowns have decreased by 13.400 million.
Thus today, the Ministry of Economic Affairs confirmed its data on the debt of the state of the beginning of October.
For each cheque, the debt corresponds to 84,000 crowns.
Over the past year, the state owed more than 111 million crowns.
"For now it seems that thanks to the low deficit of next year we could cross the boundary of the Crown Billion until 2009.
Next year the debt should move between the 90 billion and the crown bill," said iHNed.cz, the economist of Patria Finance, David Marek.
Similarly, the economist of Next Finance, Vladimir Pikora, sees it: "We could pass the billion during 2009.
Exactly when that will depend on the next budget that we do not yet know.
If the situation on the political scene was to change and politicians were able to save, then it could be delayed by 2010.
But I don't see such a change," he added.
Doubt Grows
The debt of the state creates debts in the central government and, above all, arises from the accumulation of the deficit in the state budget.
The debt of the State is paid by means of treasury bonds, state bonds, direct loans or, for example, loans from the European Investment Bank.
The state's internal debt grew from 38,500 million to 719,400 million crowns this year.
External debt for now has grown from SEK 1.7 billion to SEK 123.300 million.
The so-called state negotiable debt at the end of September contained 803,300 million z crowns since June was reduced to 13,700 million crowns.
The average maturity of the state debt increased by 6.5 years.
"The total annual debt of the first to the third quarter created a 13 per cent, which is enormous given how the economy works.
It is interesting that growth is generated mainly from obligations where there is a 20 per cent growth.
It is bad for the debt to grow, but on the other hand it shows that it is going to negotiate until there is a pension reform," said Pikora.
Better Than Expected
From the payment strategy and state debt management for 2007 it is clear that the government planned to pay 159,200 million crowns this year.
In early December, the Ministry reduced the plan by $152,80 billion, thanks to the improvement of the state budget.
The amount consists, in particular, of the deficit in the state budget which this year will be of 76 million crowns instead of the estimated 91,300 million crowns.
The rest consists of maximum resources planned for the Czech Consolidation Agency with approximately 13.300 million crowns, the reserve of 10 billion crowns for pension payment, 43 billion crowns to finance state obligations and 1.8 billion crowns in payments from European Investment Bank loans.
I compared today before a court in Khartoum for giving a name to a bear of fur
The British teacher who was tried in Sudan for insulting Islam was sentenced on Thursday afternoon by a Khartoum court 15 days in prison and to expulsion, his lawyer said.
Britain was accused of having let students 6-7 years of age give Muhammad's name to a skin bear when every representation of the Prophet of Islam is illegal.
He was suffering from a death penalty.
This 54-year-old British school teacher under the United High School of Khartoum in the Sudan has been detained on Sunday in her home and accused of assaulting Islam and sedentary, pursuant to article 125 of the Sudanese Criminal Code, as a result of several complaints from student parents to the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
The story actually goes back to September, when this teacher asks her students, 6/7 years old, to choose a name for the class fur bear.
" Eight names come out of the children ' s mouth, such as Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed " , says the school principal Robert Boulos.
Finally, after a class vote, 20 children out of every 23 have chosen Mohammed as their preferred name.
Mohamed is of course the name of the Muslim prophet, but above all a very common name in Sudan.
Then the children have produced a book for the class with the bear photo with the following legend " My name is Mohamed " .
The bear himself - he carried no label with this name, but the problem is simply the representation of the prophet considered an insult to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons' Muslim colleagues, professor at the same school in the Sudan, stated that he knew her well and that he would never have done anything that might be insulting to a religious faith, " I only feel that he had asked the children to vote for a name " , according to him it was only an " innocent error " .
Opinion divided by numerous students from the school teacher who describe her as " very attentive to her students " and " who never speaks of religion in class " .
Remember that the name Mohamed is also the second most known name in Britain, it is written in English in 14 different ways.
This name often chosen by Muslim families is a way of honoring the prophet (often given to the first child of a family).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this name?
Can we, for example, give it to a toy?
This is, of course, an issue of interpretation.
There was no agreement on the future status of the province on Wednesday during the last negotiating session in Vienna.
In the end, the failure.
The Kosovo Serbs and Albanians have completed a sixth and last session of discussions in Baden in Austria on Wednesday morning without being able to overcome their differences in the future status of the separatist province.
" It is regrettable that the parties have not been able to reach an agreement on the status," European Ombudsman Wolfgang Ischinger said during a press conference in Vienna.
Stressing that peace in the region was " at stake " , his American counterpart, Frank Wisner, urged Belgrade and Pristina to respect their efforts to preserve peace and dialogue beyond the end of the negotiations.
" We do not foresee violence for now but enter a very difficult period " , he added, noting that " obvious tensions exist " .
End of mediation on 10 December
The troika mediators, which brings together the European Union, the United States and Russia, will be in Serbia and Kosovo last Monday.
The future of the 90 per cent Albanian province could become clearer when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko return their relationship to the United Nations Security Council from 10 December to 10 December.
The discussions of Baden, near Vienna, constituted the sixth and final meeting of negotiations since the troika had been tasked with a new UN mediation last August.
The US and Europeans believe that their mediation will end on 10 December.
The Russians, who have already blocked the granting of independence in Kosovo in the Security Council, insist on pursuing negotiations beyond this summit date.
" Russia was and is committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution," Botsane-Khartchenko said.
Declaration of unilateral independence?
After eight years of administration of the UN in Kosovo, the West consider independence under the supervision of the European Union to be the only viable solution.
Pristina is prepared to declare it unilaterally if the Security Council does not resolve in its favour.
Belgrade insists on increased autonomy.
" Unfortunately, no agreement has been found," announced Kosovo's President, Fatmir Sejdiu, at the Baden Hotel where these "last opportunity negotiations" have been held since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former Kosovo rebel commander and future Prime Minister of the province, has been a part of his burdens.
But he added that Belgrade's plan of autonomy "was part of a past that led to murders and deportations".
" Domino effect "
Serbian President Boris Tadic has considered a commitment always feasible, warning the Albanian majority of Kosovo against the consequences of unilateral proclamation of the province's independence.
Belgrade particularly said to fear a " dominant effect " in a region still weakened by the 1990s ' independence wars.
"For Serbia, he said, this does not mean that a commitment is impossible."
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation had insisted that any decision should belong exclusively to the Security Council, in which its Russian ally had a veto.
" The Parliament of Kosovo will have the last word "
" Only one solution within the Security Council is acceptable to Serbia," Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said.
" These negotiations have lasted two years.
They must end as they have begun: in the Security Council. "
To journalists, Fatmir Sedjiu had replied that " the Kosovo Parliament will have the last word on the status " , adding that any unilateral declaration of Albanian independence would be made " in consultation " with the West.
Bush launches an agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
President George Bush announced, during the opening of the international peace conference he himself convened in Annapolis, Maryland, that the Israelis and the Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint declaration.
He stated that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to negotiate immediately in order to find a definitive settlement of the 60-year-old dispute point between their two peoples.
In the presence of both men, Bush promised to do everything to help them complete a "peace treaty" before the end of 2008.
In the meantime, Palestinians must dismantle " terrorist infrastructures " and Israel must put an end to their colonization activities, Bush said, recalling both parties ' obligations with regard to the peace itinerary they accepted in 2003.
The Chief of the White House stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority chaired by Abbas would attempt " to conclude a peace treaty that would resolve all outstanding issues, without exception, including central issues " .
This name covers the three main problems of the fighting point between Israel and the Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of the Arab refugees expelled from their homes during the 1948 conflict.
Speaking after the American President, Abbas insisted that future negotiations be " global and deepened " and referred to in all aspects of a regulation, quoting " Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security, among other things " .
Returning to the court, Olmert committed himself to making the upcoming negotiations "direct and continuous" and to making "an effort to complete them in the course of 2008.
At the end of 2008, Bush set the end of its " two-State vision " of Palestinian and Israeli coexistence.
Saudi Arabia revealed that it had made a commitment in this regard by Bush before deciding to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, is at the beginning of a plan, carried out by all Arab countries, which proposes peace to Israel in exchange for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis marks " a point of confrontation in the history of the Middle East, especially because it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central aspects " , says Prince Saud in his Arabic daily interview with Saudi capital.
For the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened last Sunday?
Just as every time in this kind of event, official versions and rumors are opposed.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first elements of the investigation of the French National Police Inspectorate (IGPN), a police car was operating on Sunday, shortly after the 17th, Louisa-Miguel Street, Villiers-le-Bel.
" I was not in intervention but on patrol, and I was traveling 40-50 km/h, without a rotating lighthouse," a police source explained.
A green bike from the Kawasaki brand, " not approved, or not authorized to circulate on the public road " (read below) and driven by two young people without helmets, circulated " to all gas " .
" He stabbed the police car on the left, after a failure of the front to the right, " the police said.
The control of alcoholism practiced on the occupants of the vehicle was shown to be negative.
The state of the car (the front of the car decomposed, aggrieved paraglided, booted parachutes) testifies to the violence of the shock.
Very quickly, yesterday morning, the prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thérère de Givry, announced that he had entrusted an investigation into " acts of involuntary murder and refusal of aid " to the IGPN, co-coupled with the departmental direction of the public security of Val-d'Oise.
In the afternoon, during a press conference, the prosecutor stated that the investigation of the IGPN at this stage dismissed the responsibility of the police.
According to the judge, three witnesses of the accident, understood on Sunday afternoon, confirmed " the version of the police, namely that this mini-bike arrived relatively quickly on their left " .
Yesterday, a type of slot, undoubtedly caused by the friction of the shoes on the ground, showed that both vehicles had been framed in time for the police car to stop.
Vehicles have been confiscated and will be subject to technical expertise.
The bodies of both victims were autopsied yesterday.
What happened just after?
Yesterday, a rumor circulated rapidly through Villiers-le-Bel, according to which the police would have gone very quickly from the site, thus not providing support to both young people.
The IGPN, being careful, would also separate " any serious lack " from this point.
" It is the most difficult aspect of research, which needs more research, which needs to be very careful," said a police source.
Liberation found an eye witness of these few moments that have followed the accident.
One of your windows that exactly gives the scene.
"We then came down, with my cousin who is a nurse at the hospital, to try to revive them, tells this witness.
There was nothing to do."
Then he saw "a completely disappointed police officer who was barking.
Two others were trying to revive one of the young, the room was talking to the phone."
In the face of the tension that rapidly surrounded the scene, and it seems to be certain that the young people were present in the unexpected situation, the police have been driven by colleagues who had arrived on the site.
According to this witness, the relief arrived " about twenty minutes after the police march " .
They also practiced heart massages in vain.
" I will not allow it to be assumed that police services did not bring assistance to young people.
These young people have been helped.
The bombers arrived soon.
Everything has been done to try to save them," the prosecutor stressed.
The tension rises in Pakistan
The Pakistani police repressed on Monday the first demonstrations since the establishment of the state of emergency two days before General Musharraf.
In the city of Lahore, east of the country, about 2,000 lawyers who protested against the measures taken under the state of emergency have been wounded by tear grenades used by the order forces, according to witnesses.
The latter replicated with stones, wounding the police.
At least 350 lawyers have been interrogated.
Scenes similar to Karachi and Rawalpindi, where policemen charged and injured lawyers.
Many would have been interrogated.
To Islamabad, lawyers of the Supreme Court demanded a general strike and announced demonstrations, as a result of a wave of some 500 arrests during the weekend of opponents, human rights activists and lawyers.
The streets that gave access to the Supreme Court were blocked on Monday morning to prevent the grouping.
Other demonstrations would have taken place in Multan (centre) and Peshawar (norwest).
The lawyer movement gathered on Monday the support of the religious parties regrouped in the powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance, whose president " urged the population to send flowers to the judges who had pronounced against the state of emergency and the losses they had sworn before Musharraf. "
" Musharraf's promise is no longer fulfilled "
The Supreme Court of Pakistan refers directly to the measure of exception proclaimed on Saturday afternoon.
He had to speak in the next few days on the legality of the re-election to the presidential elections, on 6 October, to the indirect suffrage of President Musharraf.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, has been removed and replaced.
" All we attend is illegal, anti-institutional and contrary to the Supreme Court ' s rulings," the judge told The News.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to leave the army's head and become a civilian president " no longer worth " after the establishment of the state of emergency, declared Monday to the Assistant Minister of Information Tariq Azeem.
He was expected to leave his military uniform by 15 November, the end of his first presidential term.
The Assistant Minister of Information also confirmed that the January elections could be moved.
On the other hand, the Pakistani government rejected the country's insistent rumors that President Musharraf would have been assigned to residence by his deputy army chief.
More than a third of pregnancies remain unforeseen
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24 %) as well as misplanned or unforeseen births.
Today, more than one pregnancy of every three (36%) is not planned, reveals a study carried out by the National Institute for Demographic Studies (Ined), forty years after the vote of the Neuwirth Act that liberalized contraception in France.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24 %) as well as misplanned or unforeseen births.
The different methods of contraception such as pill or sterile still present a failure rate of 5 % to 6 %, estimated Ined.
The liberalization of contraception, however, allowed for a better " fertility domain " , according to the Institute that notes that the rate of pill use among women aged between 20 and 44 was from 5 per cent in 1970 to 60 per cent today.
Finally, eight births of each ten would be well planned today.
Even calculated slightly more or less per month for a couple of each five and if possible for the spring, trial season as the most pleasant to have a child.
Spectacular repair on space station
It will take more than seven hours of space work for the astronaut Scott Parazynski and his crew members at the International Space Station (ISS) to perform the spectacular repair of a stripped and essential solar panel for the continuation of the scientific activities of the station.
A risky exit that accumulated the records due to its duration, its distance from the habitable modules, the speed with which it has been imagined, instruments "capuched" by astronauts to perform the repair.
The problem appeared on Tuesday when astronauts had released from the Discovery launcher the Harmony module, a cylindrical thick piece designed to quickly host European and Japanese scientific laboratories (see box).
This module is a type of landing tunnel for laboratory modules.
But you have to be able to supply them with electricity.
The second task of the crew was therefore to move a solar panel production module that weighed 17.5 tons, already present in the ISS, in order to place it in its final position.
After moving it, the crew began reorganizing the solar panels of the module with a size of 76 metres.
And that's where one of the panels, which unfold as accordions, has been damaged in a little over a meter by a cable that touched.
The deployment has been stopped to no longer damage the panel.
Astronauts, who had at first performed an escape control of the Discovery launcher, and then went to repair another solar panel whose rotation system was defective, were forced to dedicate themselves to the damaged panel.
And it's Scott Parazynski who's been chosen to ride to the end of the 30-metre length of the teledirectional arm of the launcher added to the station to perform the repair.
It is one of the best "spacewalker" (space walker) of the Nasa.
High, resistant, very skilled, has very developed torso and long arms.
At the age of 46, this training doctor has been tasked with "operating" the "damaged" solar panel.
After carefully inspecting the damage, he sectioned the fallable cable and installed types of "tablets" in the damaged area.
He had been helped by the second " spacewalker " that had remained close to the air lock and, from within, by other astronauts such as Peggy Whitson, the commander of the crew.
The tool that he used, a hockey minibar wrapped with an insulator to avoid electrocution in the solar panels that produced several hundred volts, has been designed and "capuched" by astronauts on board the station.
Once the operation was completed, Scott Parazynski waited for the panel to be fully deployed before making the inventory of its instruments and returning to the station.
Yesterday afternoon, astronauts took advantage of a midday break before today, seven astronauts return from the Discovery launcher to return to the Earth scheduled for Wednesday.
The title EADS sanctions in Bolsa
The EADS action is currently under way in the Paris Stock Exchange, after the aviation and defence group announced that it would have to spend between EUR 1.2 billion and EUR 1.4 billion to deal with the delays of the A400M.
EADS currently loses 4 % to 21.96 euros in the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group has been obliged to review its forecast of the operational result for 2007 in response to delays due to the slow development of the A400M engine, which condition the aircraft's inaugural flight.
The cost of defraying the delay taken in the delivery of the military transport aircraft, announced in October, is " between EUR 1.2 and 1.4 billion, of which more than 1 billion for Airbus," announced the European construction company's home EADS.
Due to these loads, EADS will be forced to announce new performance targets (EBIT) for 2007 during the presentation of its quarterly results next Thursday, adding no more encryption.
The group also indicates that the estimate of the new charges is consistent with the six-month delay.
It should be recalled that the operating result of EADS failed by 86% in 2006, mainly due to charges linked to the delays of another programme, the very heavy carrier A380.
Initially, the group planned a first delivery of A400M to the French army in October 2009.
The status quo selection
No wonder Sunday, at the exit of the urns: the Russians will choose massively for President Putin's party, Russia united.
Confirming its aspirations for stability, including authoritarianism, after a very limited campaign.
Three days after the legislative elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin sends voters today a television message about public chains, already registered but the content of which is kept secret.
He does this as a leader of the list for united Russia, the pro-Kremlin party whose victory reveals itself devastating.
Yesterday, the President did not allow anything to be transparent in receiving foreign ambassadors, contenting to deliver a new burden against the accused West of interference - its theme of bias during the campaign.
" We know the price of true democracy and we want fair, more transparent and more open elections without incidents," he added.
According to the opposition, we are far from the truth.
He's reporting a press campaign.
Communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says that there is no " never had such dirty elections until the time of Eltsin " .
After the repression of the last weekend demonstrations, visits to the former world chaplain Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal demonstration, are prohibited according to his lawyer.
"The Russians kept the mind of the Soviet man"
Behind these unsurprising legislative elections are two questions that are much more open:
Who will happen to Putin in the presidency?
The official newspaper published yesterday the date of the first round of presidential elections on 2 March 2008; candidates have until 23 December to be made known.
Elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot apply for the third consecutive term.
Then no successor emerges.
What role will Putin play after March?
Prime Minister?
Head of the parliamentary majority and the very powerful united Russian party that would elect the government and the president?
Whatever the case, in the legislative elections as Presidents, the outgoing power will triumph.
It's a tradition.
" The Russians have kept the mind of the Soviet gay man, they don't feel the owners of their destiny," says sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the independent centre of Levada.
The historian Nikolaï Kopossov, from the state university of St. Petersburg, goes further: civil society has been delayed in this Christian country five centuries after Europe; the famous spirit of the community has delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, " Putin restored the model of a paternist state, perfectly accepted by the population, since this new paternism has not been followed by terrorism, but by a certain economic downturn " , she appreciates Maria Lipman, of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today, the Russians " voluntarily renounce the personal responsibility " of those who had recently proved themselves after the collapse of the USSR.
"For what reflect?"
The phenomenon affects all levels of society, including the world of affairs.
And the administrative elite plans to preserve the status quo: 65 governors (of each 85 heads of Russian regions) run the local lists of Russia together.
New freedoms imported from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
The opinion prefers stability.
On behalf of the Russians, neither will they vote for the extremists.
Conclusion of Tamara Tcherednitchenko, 54-year-old professor: "Why reflect?
Those who are in power are not too bad, why change them?"
A Heavy Memory
After more than 60 years of confidentiality, the Nazi archives of Bad Arolsen, which describe the fates of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are in free access.
The 47 million archived documents, stored over 27 km of canteens in Bad Arolsen (Hesse), were not available here only for a "humanitarian" purpose, i.e. individually and nominally, at the request of an old victim or its right-holders.
The eleven States responsible for their management - such as Germany, France, Israel and the United States - agreed in May 2006 to open them to prospectors and historians.
Since the ratification process for this agreement by all States has been completed, the opening process has been effective since yesterday.
Sensitive information
The access of historians to Bad Arolsen will allow search " particularly on the displacement of prisoners, the population of the camps and the health status of forced workers " , explains Reto Meistern, the director of these archives administered by the International Commission of the Red Cross (ICRC).
Until recently, several States, such as Germany, opposed the opening of these nomination documents to the public because of the sensitive nature of certain information.
Like the alleged homosexuality or mental disability of certain victims of deportation.
The records of the concentration camps or detention orders established by the Gestapo had been gathered after war for a practical purpose: to find those deported or subjected to compulsory work and, if necessary, to provide proof of their detention, in order to open the way for compensation.
Still today in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees deal with tens of thousands of individual requests.
However, for a part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is of limited interest.
" There is nothing fundamentally new to expect from these documents," said Professor Wolfgang Benz, Director of the Anti-Semitism Research Centre at the Technical University of Berlin in 2006.
The European Union and India want to reach a free movement agreement in 2008
Currently, the Indo-European bilateral trade is already around EUR 60 billion a year.
The European Union is India's first trading partner and represents 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India hope to sign a free movement agreement in 2008, the European Commissioner pointed out to Trade Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath.
Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the European Union had passed their approval last April to the European Commission to begin negotiations with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) with a view to signing free trade agreements (ALEs).
The European Union is India's first trading partner and represents 18% of its foreign trade.
LEU is also its first foreign investor, but India is only the 9th trading partner of the European Union, according to figures from the European Commission.
" A free trade pact will greatly affect both economies " and " India would improve its entry into a prosperous European market of 450 million "," said Peter Mandelson.
Europe represents the first or second market for each of the top ten products exported by India, said the European Commissioner. The Asian and European giants change annually by " €47 billion " and " €10 billion of services", said Danièle Smadja, head of the European Commission delegation in New Delhi, feeling that bilateral trade "has not yet reached its potential". The European Union and India are on Friday for their eighth diplomatic summit in New Delhi in the presence of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and in the presence of the President of the European Commission José Manuel Durao Barroso.

The Bank of England takes note of concerns by offering 10 billion pounds in five weeks
The Bank of England on Thursday was concerned to alleviate the current return on credit conditions concerns, and announced an offer of 10 billion pounds at the base rate of 5.75 per cent in five weeks, an offer of an unusual duration.
" In order to alleviate the concerns under which the financial market conditions will be particularly tightened at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty in the way in which they will organise their liquidity positions over this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant proportion of its provision of reserves during the maintenance period beginning on 6 December in the form of an open market operation for five weeks, " states in a communication.
The Bank states that 10 billion pounds (14 billion euros) will be placed on the market on 6 December at 12:15 GMT, the basic index and until 10 January.
This is the first time that the British BoE bank appears to place liquids on the market for five weeks in an open market operation.
These are usually done in a week.
The BoE adds in its communication that " it is prepared to take other measures to maintain the index " of interbank loans on-line with its basic index.
The interbank rate per day was 5,829 % on Wednesday.
The rate after three months was set at 6.6 per cent, higher since 18 September.
Since the beginning of the financial crisis in the summer, the amounts placed on the market by the Bank of England have been combined with an important penalty rate that has deterred banks from resorting to it.
According to certain rumors, corroborated by the evolution of the change of the pound in relation to the euro, many had preferred to subscribe to the amounts placed on the market by the European Central Bank, to the most advantageous indices and with a more secure discretion.
The UMP and NC parties reject the review of the PS party's proposals on purchasing power
The UMP and Nouveau Centre group refused on Thursday to discuss articles of the proposed socialist law on purchasing power, which is equivalent to a rejection of the text.
In a socialist "nickie" (session for the initiative of a parliamentary group), the text declined a dozen measures taken on Tuesday by the national office of the PS, including an increase of 50 % of the employment surplus, the restoration of the TIPP (internal rate of oil products) floating, a check-transport or the restrictions on rentals.
Since UMP and NC have voted against the consideration of articles (180 votes to 115), the meeting has been held at the end of the general discussion that led to exchanges, sometimes alive, between the majority and opposition to some hours of Nicolas Sarkozy's television intervention on the purchasing power.
The leader of the PS MPs Jean Marc Airault announced that his group would represent the integrity of his proposals in the form of amendments to the draft amending financial law considered by the Assembly next week.
A new festival comes out of the light
As a result of numerous rumors regarding the creation, by C3 Presents, of a new music festival in Philadelphia, the promoter / producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with the British producer Melvin Benn's Festival Republic.
" For our company, it is an honor to work with a person who inspired, not least, the current movement of festivals in America," Charlie Jones of C3 entrusted Billboard.com.
C3 produces the Lollapalooza festival in Chicago and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, in New Jersey, is a summer destination for the campsite.
The festival would take place from 8 to 10 August in a private farm of 500 acres about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
Another time known under the name of Mean Fiddler, director of the Festival Republic, Melvin Benn, is one of the most respected festival producers in the world.
In 1989, he took the lead at the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts about 80,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio later, in 2006, the Republic Festival created the Latitude Festival of Henham Park in Suffolk.
Since 2002, as co-owner, Melvin Benn has also been responsible for the production, licensing and organizational tasks of the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177 500 people.
Qualifying Glasstonbury as a "most inspiring event" she had never attended, Charlie Jones of C3 says his company and Melvin Benn work in parallel to give the region a European-style festival event.
"We had chosen Philadelphia as the market and worked with Fairmount Parks Commission to create a festival in the center of Philadelphia," says Charlie Jones.
" We were in negotiations with the city and the Commission was motivated and excited about this project.
Unfortunately, we stand in low-level policies because of the current administration, pursues Charlie Jones.
" Fortunately, we were able to discuss with Melvin Benn and prepare to create a magnificent festival in an exceptional place that will last take place in Philadelphia."
C3 Presents resurrected the Lollapalooza festival in 2005 in the Chicago Grant Park, after being unmarked in the festival landscape in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Both events recorded gross income of $9.8M and $11.3M in 2007.
These two festivals take place in the urban environment.
"Melvin Benn's European model is a camp festival, while ours are performed better in urban green areas," says Charlie Jones.
The aim is to merge, in one way or another, both formulas to give a impression of a camp festival in the European and urban way in the American way."
Vineland is about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
" The Vineland community, including the mayor, is eager to support the celebration of this event," says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to reveal the terms of the agreement, but says " that they are interesting enough to allow investment in such an event and host a festival that, we expect, will have a long life."
Charlie Jones says the hotel offer for this festival is "very big", for example, for the 80,000 people at the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says that invitations have been launched to the groups, but that nothing could still be confirmed at the time of press release.
"Vineland will have the taste of rock, but the music will vary there, with the hope of attracting all kinds of spectators," says Charlie Jones.
His fellow C3, who received the Top Independent Promoter Award from the last Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal faces Terminator
It is not easy to attract Hollywood film dishes to Montreal when nothing more than Terminator opposes that...
This seduction mission is part of the functions of the delegate.
A mandate - "politically difficult" because the governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, denounces the "runaway productions " .
Is it hard to compete with the "Governor"?
"Be careful, it's the industry that decides where it goes.
If you find that the conditions in Montreal are favorable, you'll go there.
Our role is to offer those who will judge the best," he says.
The Race for Festivals
At the moment, Denis Turcotte's priority is nevertheless the promotion of the film here.
The career in the Oskares is started.
All the festivals of the West Coast, whether Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, will have to present the Quebec films, give them courage and ensure that the performers make interviews.
The Age of Darkness had a good image at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival, a few weeks ago.
It will be presented to the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil is in the cartel in Santa Monica and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Quebec also presented four long metres and four short metres to the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Will there be a rally at the end of the year in the pocket? The experts, divided by the 'subprime' crisis.
Within five weeks of the closure of the exercise, investors are already shaking their hands hoping that the traditional rally will arrive at the end of the year.
This year, however, experts are not so clear that this is going to happen.
Banif believes that "from a statistical point of view, December in stock exchange usually has a positive behavior.
However, forecasts should not be made solely on the basis of statistics, even more so because in the current context, uncertainty is accepted in the markets, at least in the short term."
Although they are not supporters of the stock exchange in the last weeks of the year, these experts point out that "the stock market is supported by the existence of liquidity, willing to invest in the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially fixed income, affected by the fledgling effect on quality values in both long and short strands".
Therefore, they believe that the bag will have a more lateral behavior, not excluding volatility "mostly because it is not known the impact of the likely decline in the types of the Fed, given the high level of cruelty and the risk of stimulating inflationary tensions".
Javier Barrio, responsible for BPI sales in Spain, agrees that it is not a good time to say that there will be rally.
"It's not the thing for many joys," the expert assures.
Ibex has lost about 4 per cent of the maximum scored on 8 November when the index closed at 15.945.7 points.
Still not all experts have this negative view.
Juan Solana, Intermoney analyst, believes that Ibex 35 could close the year closest to 16,000 points thanks to the restructuring of the portfolios and traditional contributions to pension plans that occur every year on these dates.
However, the expert argues that things will be something different this year because he believes that the rally will proceed to the second week of December, after the constitutional bridge.
The analyst does not consider that volatility will affect market trends.
For his part, Federico Olucha, an analyst at Inversis Banko, values that we are close to technical levels and "so we could see a rebound of the index that could be driven by the news coming from the U.S. regarding the consequences of the crisis on the credit market".
The analyst trusts that these are positive.
Analysts agree on the time to choose the values to be taken to Ibex to new maximum rates.
Solana, from Intermoney, says that "this year it touches the great values".
The expert would include in the portfolio the two large banks and some builders "because when the date comes, the electricity sector will be very expensive".
In the meantime, Federico Olucha, of Inversis Banko, ensures that the climbs will come from the bank and the industrial sector.
Manufacturers may also benefit from this rally if they give up.
"ACS has been recovering positions for several months and we expect other builders like Ferrovial and FCC to follow their own path," the expert explains.
cyclical consumption will be a major factor in the last part of the year due to the increase in sales during the Christmas sales season.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technology will also do very well, although in this case there is not much representation in the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, only two times in December has it been a low month.
The real rally at the end of the year was lived in 2003, an exercise in which the stock markets came out of the crisis caused by the sharpness of the technological bubble.
This year, in which Ibex 35 recovered 28.17 per cent, December recorded a 6.68 per cent return.
It will have to be seen whether 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of profits (Ibex currently rises 8.36% since January) and if it can count on its final year rally.
Popular will open 200 offices 12 hours from Monday to Saturday
Popular has decided to renew most of its offices.
A total of 200 are located in the most commercial areas of Spain.
These branches, which will operate under the Popular Max brand, represent a big change for the bank.
Also for the rest of the Spanish entities, as it is the first group to decide to jump to bet on the uninterrupted opening of their agencies until 20.30 a.m., and open Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 20.30 a.m.
Another group that has also repeated several times that wanted to expand the schedules of its branches, BBVA, has not yet decided to take the step.
Meanwhile, he is about to conclude an agreement with the trade unions to close 75 per cent of his offices on Saturdays instead of opening one afternoon, although not to the public.
The results of Popular experience will be crucial for other entities to point out whether or not this initiative is consistent with trade schedules.
This is precisely the goal that Popular pursues with the project.
Capture the private customers moving around these areas to make their purchases, to the Pymes, autonomouss and shops of the streets selected to open.
The bank wants these 200 offices open all over Spain in about 18 months, as they are not new openings but remodeling existing ones.
To this end, the entity will modernise the branches already in commercial areas, adapting them to the profile of the customers on the different streets.
Thus, the expansion of schedules is accompanied by a different design of the branch space and a new, more current design with brighter colors.
The manager of the commercial bank, Ángel Rivera, ensures that this restructuring does not involve a large investment, although a larger recruitment of staff, since it takes about six employees locally to eight or nine.
The offices, which will even have space for SMEs to meet there, will sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has already tested its initiative in three Madrid offices.
And the experience has been positive, according to Angel Rivero.
The branches of the streets Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Grand Via de Madrid have been elected, and it seems that correctly, according to Rivero.
Popular currently has 2,500 branches.
And 60 others who operate under the brand Mundocredit, specialized in immigrants, also with very wide schedules, which even open Sundays and holidays.
In these PopularMax rooms you will not repeat the BBVA model, where several of your offices have a large range of non-financial products for sale.
'We don't want to compete with our customers,' says Rivero.
At the moment, they have reached an agreement with Telefónica to sell mobiles, with outside staff at the bank.
Telecinco doubles the value for the first time in your rival's bag Antena 3
We did it.
With that phrase, he expressed yesterday his satisfaction Paolo Vasile, a representative of Telecinco, at the closure of the market, when he found that the chain he led doubled the value of his rival, Antena 3.
Just one aspect was their joy: 'It's what hurts me, not because we've grown more, but because we've fallen less', he said.
Still, he stressed that in a weak market, 'we have fallen less'.
Telecinco finished the day yesterday with a 2.54% advance.
That profit is the loss in what we have been year-on-year at 15.66%.
The value of the company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% of the capital) and participated by Vocento (other 13%) thus reaches EUR 4,488.88 million, according to Bloomberg data.
His rival Antena 3, who yesterday surrendered 1.52% and accumulated a decrease of 40.5% since January, costs half, 2,193.46 million.
The value of the other listed communications companies amounts to 3,571 million in the case of Sogecable; 2,518.53 million Prisa (Five Days Editor) and 1.779 million Vocent.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antena 3 is because 'we're talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact is how much we are able to do, in the same market, at what cost and how we make it in terms of hearing.'
Telecinco announced last week that he planned to become the first television channel to exceed the 1,000 million gross advertising revenues, said Giuseppe Tringali, the CEO of Telecinco and Publiespaña, the subsidiary that manages the group's advertising.
If this information were to be made real, the television channel would record this exercise an increase of 3.6% in its advertising billing of 965.4 million in 2006.
For its part, Antena 3's net billing increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the exercise (to reach 734.4 million) while net TV revenues grew by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors that point analysts to the best relative evolution in Telecinco Stock Exchange is the high pay out that has been maintained so far: in 2006, the company chaired by Alejandro Echevarria distributed 100% of the benefit among its shareholders.
Vasile assures that although it is ready to make the decision, this ratio may vary after buying 33% of Endemol in association with its Mediaset matrix.
'We have the official commitment to give at least 50%, although we have always said much more.
This year, I hope that we will be able to leave our shareholders happy, whom we have already valued with 33% of Endemol'.
According to analysts, the market is showing at these times some fatigue.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its profit estimates on Telecinco by 4% in 2008 and 7% in 2009.
It should be explained that the projected income growth has been cut from 10.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
This same signature has reduced Antena's profit forecast 3 to 4.5 per cent in 2008 and 7.5 per cent in 2009.

Congress approves the Mifid transposition, which entered into force on 1 November.
In parallel with its parliamentary procedure, which ended today with the Congress vote on the amendments incorporated into the draft in the Senate, the Government has submitted to the public hearing the rules that will develop the new law, with the aim of both of them entering into force before the end of the year.
The representatives of the different groups agreed to highlight the efforts made by Members and Senators to negotiate and consensus the best rules in order to ensure the protection of investors and to regulate in detail the business of entities for the efficient functioning of markets.
The Mifid, which amends the Securities Market Act, involves the modernisation of financial markets, while strengthening investor protection, improving the supervisory powers of the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and fostering cooperation between the various European Union supervisors.
The new regulation will enable financial advisory services to be provided to both specialized firms and to natural or legal persons and creates a new type of financial services signatures (ESIS), financial advisory companies (FIAs), which are associated with securities companies, securities agencies and portfolio management companies.
In addition, it expands the number of financial instrument operations systems, so that regulated secondary markets are combined with multilateral trading systems and order internalization systems, which will compete with current stock exchange managers.
The Act also obliges investment service companies to disclose information on the key aspects of their business profile, risk exposure and risk management forms on the market and requires them to keep a record of all their operations in order to facilitate supervision by the CNMV.
A number of amendments were incorporated by the Committee on the Economy of Congress in its footsteps, including the fact that the subordinated debt is regarded as a "complex" financial instrument given its high risk to the investor, which has been demonstrated with the United States high-risk mortgage debt (subprime).
In addition, the transposition of the directive was used to legally delimit the functions that could be performed by graduates in Economics and Entrepreneurships 30 years after the real decree delimiting the professional functions reserved for economists was adopted in 1977.
The Senate, for its part, incorporated the creation of new figures in the financial sector, such as that of the mediator, who will work abroad, will not require the authorisation of the CNMV and will be able to provide its product marketing and customer capture services to various investment firms at the same time.
The harmonised IPC increases five tenths in November, up to 4.1 per cent
This indicator, which then serves Eurostat to incorporate it into the calculation of the European Union's inflation rate, provides an advance on how prices have evolved in Spain during November.
Its publication responds to Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) policy to provide data comparable to those produced in the United States in time and quality.
The above indicator is calculated using the same procedure as that used for the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, but using various statistical modelling methods to estimate information that is not yet available at the time of publication.
The INE recalled that the information provided by the advanced indicator is only indicative, so it does not necessarily coincide with the final data, which will be made known on 14 December.
"The IPC will continue at relatively high levels"
The second Vice-President and Minister of Economy Pedro Solbes said that the rise in 4.1% of the IPC in November was a "temporary figure", but at the same time hoped that the price index would continue at " relatively high" levels in the coming months.
In any case, Solbes has pointed out in the steps of the Congress that "though the figure is not good" Spain's inflation differential with respect to monetary union remains "more or less" the same in recent years.
He also explained that in November, "there was less surprise" than in the previous month, when the Government did not have such a high rise.
"We were expecting a figure of around 4%," the Minister of Economy has acknowledged with regard to the data that has been advanced today.
Virgin plans to collect with Northern Rock 42,000 million euros in three years
Northern Rock deposits have dropped by more than 50 per cent to up to 12 billion pounds (16,800 million euros) since it entered a crisis in mid-September and had to resort to an emergency credit from the Bank of England.
At that time, he was stockpiling a record of more than 25 billion pounds, a figure that has gradually fallen in two and a half months because of the distrust of his clients and despite the 100 per cent guarantee of that money offered by the Government and which will remain until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, who would appoint the entity with her financial brand Virgin Money, needs to capture around a quarter of the UK bank's income in the next three years to achieve those 18 billion pounds remaining until the target of 30,000 million.
The group of Magnate Richard Branson, known for its successful advertising campaigns in the United Kingdom, intends to spend 50 million pounds (about 70 million euros) annually in advertising and marketing to achieve its purpose.
Northern Rock named this week the offer of the Virginia consortium, in which three other companies participate, as his favorite to rescue him from the bankruptcy.
Arrested by the mayor of Totana for alleged urban corruption
The Civil Guard has arrested today at first hour of the morning to the current mayor of the Murcia municipality of Totana (the People's Party) for his alleged relationship with the urban corruption plot torn apart this week.
In addition, one of the municipal police secretaries and chief of police have also been arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced Juan Morales last May, the current popular MP, and until then the city director, and that according to sources of the research consulted by the SER chain, could be the 'headpiece' of this plot.
Officers continue to record municipal units and urban advisory services and no further arrests in the coming hours.
In addition, Juan Morales, the chief suspect in the urban corruption plot, was accused at the beginning of this week.
Just as yesterday the SER chain informed the lawyer of the 'popular' MP Juan Morales, so he was arrested from the home of Morales with important documentation related to the plot.
Moreover, the object of the investigation, according to sources of research, is the alleged recovery of morales commissions in exchange for facilitating the signature of an urban agreement with a Galician construction company to reclassify 200 hectares of land.
For the moment, there are eight people arrested.
Mr. Bono agrees to head the PSOE's candidacy for Toledo and preside over the Congress if they win the
The former Minister of Defence José Bono has accepted the offer of the President of the Government and Secretary-General of Socialists, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, to head the list of the PSOE by Toledo for the next general elections and to be the President of Congress in case the Socialists win the general elections.
This was announced by the Secretary of the WHOE Organization, José Blanco, and the Bono itself, after the meeting that he held this afternoon at the federal headquarters of this party with Zapatero.
The Chief Executive has justified the offer to the former minister because "it is important to have the best" in political life and Bono "is among the best".
He also pointed out that "yes" the manchego politician will be the candidate of the Socialist Group to preside over Congress if the Socialists win in the next elections.
Bono would replace Manuel Marín, President of the Congress, who published last November 15th his decision not to present himself to the next general election and to abandon his career in active politics to engage in combating climate change in the university field.
The former minister has recognized that the President of the Government has insisted that he should return to the political vanguard since he left it two years ago.
He also noted that, just as citizens know who will be the vice-president of the economy if the PES wins the elections, his party has wanted to announce who will chair the Congress in a "act of transparency".
If he reaches the post, Bono hopes to turn the House into "the house of respect and not of insult or shouting" and make it "seems more and more to the citizens".
"Sometimes it seems regrettable that the only place in Madrid where one can't speak in peace and quiet is Congress, the President of the Government on one occasion interrupted the Senate 26 times."
He has also had words of praise for his current president, Manuel Marín and "his good deeds" and has no longer wanted to be occupying his position so as not to fall into what, as he has pointed out, his opponents might see as "prepotence".
Weather Forecast
Since the movement against climate change is subject to relentless persecution both to the skeptics of its predictions and to those prioritising other political and social battles, it is obliged to show iron consistency.
And more a leader of the movement who is the president of the government as Zapatero and believes that this fight is more important than that of Islamist terrorism and even proposes to sign a "new contract with the planet".
This approach obliges you to explain why the action, or failure, of your Government has made a decisive contribution to Spain's EU's failure to comply with Kyoto.
Those responsible for the non-compliance, the sectors in which it has occurred and why its Government, the contract with the planet, has not avoided it.
In addition, it requires the Spanish to explain with utmost clarity what measures will be taken to prevent climate change.
What companies will be affected, what citizen habits will have to be changed, what individual and collective energy savings we will be forced to do, what economic consequences it will have.
I mean, who will sacrifice and who will pay to save the planet.
But there has not been nor will there be any such explanations.
Exactly because it's about sacrifice and payment.
Climate change measures, real measures, are unpopular.
Costs, inconveniences and threats to business accounts and individuals.
Up to one hundred of the petrol suggested by the PSOE has seemed so dangerous to Zapatero that it has been rushed to deny it.
That is, it is about saving the planet with nothing, with pure propaganda, with empty slogans of any real consequence.
With impressive sentences, commissions, committees, protocols, new posts.
With contracts with the planet, this gentleman is so useful for electoral campaigns that he neither speaks nor complains nor demands, but decorates the myths and inspires tenderness.
Whenever it is limited to being a purely virtual contracting party and does not intend to move on a bicycle or be refreshed with the abanic.
Arrested by the mayor and local police chief of Totana for alleged urban corruption
The Civil Guard has arrested the mayor of Totana's Murcian locality, the "popular" José Martínez Andreo, the chief of the local police, the City Council Secretary and a host entrepreneur for possible urban crimes, today have reported sources of research.
The building was arrested in its home and has been transferred to the Consistorium, in which it is currently located alongside numerous agents, who have also visited the Urban Council and the municipal management company of the Industrial Land and Housing.
These three arrests are added to the six held last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation related to the revalidation of more than 2 million hectares of rural land in urbanization for the Galaga Nuaria to build 4,000 homes, after the payment of illegal commissions during the past legislature.
In addition, two other persons were not arrested but were charged in the summary, which instructs Judge No. 1 of Totana.
The first six detainees have now been tried.
According to sources, the former director of Totana and today the EP's independent parliamentary, Juan Morales, are being investigated.
In addition, the former woman, the owner of a real estate agency registered today in Totana, has been charged, like the current girlfriend of the former director, who lives in Murcia capital.
The director and owner of the Nuaria Group, the lawyer and entrepreneur Manuel N.A., was arrested in Nigrán (Pontevodra), as well as Pablo José M.G., director of the Immunity Ground, an agency integrated in the mentioned Group, and through which the bribes would have been made.
The investigation is under the responsibility of the Central Operational Unit (UCO) Urban Crimes Unit of the Civil Guard, whose agents, in addition to the arrests, have practised eleven records, most in companies related to detainees and located in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
One person was then arrested in Totana, specifically the owner of a very well-known poultry product company in the region, which could have acted as an intermediary.
The Nuaria Group was responsible for developing what would be the largest residential complex in the Murcian municipality of Totana, which would involve the construction of more than 5,000 homes, a golf course and two hotels with "sppa".
The company acquired 2.2 million square metres of land in Totana and its project would double the population of the municipality, which has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group consists of companies such as Autesa and Inomonar, dedicated to the real estate promotion; Conycase, which manages the real estate parks of the Coruña, Venezuela and the square of Fernando el Católica; Hogartel, dedicated to the direct marketing sector; Recommended, focused on the promotion, sale and installation of construction elements.

Our Finnish correspondent makes this comment yesterday in Finland's most important newspaper (in fact, in the head of the PISA report on education in the world), the Helsingin Sanomat, which refers to what they published on 18 November, the very day on which the criticism of Blackburn's book curiously appeared:
"The content of the signature of Philosophy has jumped to public opinion as a result of the tragedy of the Jokela school.
The culprit of the deaths, a student of the Bachelorate, quoted in his messages the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
The Education Councillor responsible for Philosophy's assignment, Pekka Elo, demanded from the pages of the journal Helsingin Sanomat that teachers adopt a critical attitude towards Plato and stated that studying Nietzsche is not essential in the mandatory basic course of Philosophy in institutions."

A colleague provides information on the introduction into the Criminal Code of Offences on Internet Downloads:
A. Discharge of a song would be punishable by six months to one year.
On the other hand, if you steal from the store disks of a value of less than EUR 400, you are simply considered to be missing (Article 623.1).
B. If you steal up to €1,000 in the store, theft is already a crime, but the penalty is still lower than the duty on the download (Article 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it 40 hours later, the penalty remains lower than that of the download (art. 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a fight than to participate in the exchange of compacts.
Participation in a tumultuous reign is punishable by three months to one year (article 154 of the Penal Code) and exchange would be punishable by six months to two years
(art. 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered less serious than downloading a film on DVD, according to article 184.2 of the Criminal Code.
F. The distribution of copyright-protected and unauthorized films by authors is more punishable than the distribution of pornographic material to minors (art. 186).
Finally, if my colleague is right, someone is going to hand, a very long hand.

My head doctor gives me one of his articles on rare research entitled 'Money produces brain activations, especially if others get less'.
In other words, the feelings that generate the monthly pay of workers depend on what fellow workers earn.
The study has been conducted through tomographic resonances at the University of Bonn, and the results are published in the latest issue of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and director of the Neurocognition Image Group of the Life&Brain Institute, in Germany: "The strongest activation occurred when the participant responded correctly and his partner failed".
Researchers observed that if when they both agreed to receive the same payment, the activation was moderate, but if one received the double, the activation was greater.
I don't know if it took so much science to make this conclusion.
Balkan prosecutor
Carla del Ponte has spent eight years relentlessly persecuting Balkan war criminals from the prosecution of the Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, located in The Hague.
His mandate ends at the end of the year, and Carla will go with a bitter taste, because the main leaders of the Srebrenica massacre - in which 8,000 Muslim Bosnians died - the former General Ratko Mladic and the former Serbian leader Radovan Karadzic are still at large.
Its names are in that list that takes its title from the Swiss author Marcel Schüpbach, 'The Carla List' (2006, not out of print in Spain), who, at the pace of a police thriller, continues the work of the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade to New York to prosecute fugitive criminals and press the governments involved to stretch the line.
What's for sure?
The car insurance, which covers the driver in front of possible sinisters, entails an important cost that will depend on various factors, such as age, sex, age of the sheep, civil status, the type of vehicle to ensure or the use of it, among others.
Having the car is only the beginning.
And it is that, choosing the right car insurance is even more difficult than choosing the vehicle model.
First of all, we must be clear about what we are talking about.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insured person.
This commitment is materialised in an insurance contract, which provides that the company receives the value of the premium agreed in exchange for being liable for the obligation to pay the compensation in the event of sinister.
The premium is the price of the insurance, which is established taking into account various factors, such as age, sex, age of the sheep, civil status, the type of vehicle to ensure or the use of the vehicle, among others.
Insurance companies set their prices according to the statistics, so that they are more likely to suffer from an accident, the highest rate to be paid.
That is why both older than 25 and women have to pay lower premiums, as statistics reflect that they have a lower rate of bias due to their caution.
Also, by throwing out the accounts, companies have come to the conclusion that married people tend to have fewer accidents than single drivers.
The use of the vehicle will influence the frequency, thereby likely to have some kind of percance.
Increased frequency increases the probability.
There are many variables that insurers take into account when setting the price of the premium.
That's why the driver has to study the situation well to choose that car insurance that best fits his profile.
We will present here the most significant variables when choosing one or other type of insurance, so that it, in addition to adapting to the characteristics of the insured, offers you a reasonable price.
Young people under the age of 25 are faced with various disadvantages in hiring insurance at an affordable price, such as the reduced driving experience and the age of the sheep.
Although the ideal for being well insured is a risk-free insurance, there are other more economic options.
The most careful drivers can choose for a whole risk with frankness, so that they get the coverage of a insurance at all risk but at a more affordable price.
This type of convention would require the client to pay part of the sum of the sinister.
"The share of the amount of the sinter that the customer provides will be pre-established according to the value of the premium, which will be the highest as low as the amount is the lowest," says Luis Noguera, top manager in First Europe Spain, online insurance broker.
Another option is an extended third party insurance, so that the customer is assured protection against damage caused to third parties, although not against those caused in his own car.
In addition, it would be covered by theft, fire and vehicle loss.
A piece of advice.
If you are under 25 years of age, try to be careful and avoid sinisters as much as possible, as this will impact on the benefit, reducing the cost of insurance in the future.
A bonus is a reduction on the base rate that the company owns.
On the contrary, criminalisation is a charge on that base rate.
"The benefits and penalties will depend on the company and its benefit.
If the company has had a good year, the benefits may be increased," Noguera explains.
Over the past 25 years, drivers have made it easier to hire insurance, as the rate of miscarriage is reduced by the accumulated experience.
For this reason, the most recommended is to hire a full risk with frankness.
"You can't normally make use of the experience previously acquired when you're in an accident, and even when you're driving," says the director in Spain of the European company, adding that most accidents occur in the second year of driving, once the 'fear of the new man' has passed.
However, if the client is married but still has no children, it is preferable that he negotiates insurance at all risks, whenever his economic situation allows, of course.
For their part, marriages with children are considered by insurers as the public with a lower rate of inflation, so the charges will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be one at all risk free of charge (which could be EUR 300), or, where there is a high level of bonus, one at thirds extended from the third year of life of the vehicle.
"They carry out a more relaxed driving and have a greater purchasing power to allow the luxury of taking on a greater quantity of frankness," Luis Noguera said.
For retirees, it is advisable to provide insurance at any risk free of charge (being EUR 150), or an extended third party when there is a high level of bonus.
It must be said that car insurance is something important, not only because it covers the driver in front of possible sinisters, but also because it represents an important expense, which is why it is essential to properly study the insurance that best suits us according to our personal situation.
The Celtic searches for a point worth the eighths in Milan
Milan and Celtic are measured this Tuesday in San Siro in search of the point that they lack to achieve their respective goals in the closing of the 'Champions' league, because Italians need to be first and Scottish to judge their classification.
The Italians add up ten points and have already certified on the fifth day their pass with a tie in Portugal, while the Celtic has nine points, but still needs another to make sure that the Shakhtar, with six, and receives the Benfica, who has four, does not forward.
These two parties in Group D will be played one week before the end of the sixth day, as Milan has to argue the World Clubs in Japan, where day 13 starts in semi-finals in search of a place for the end of 16.
Thus, this group will be closed before the rest and the empathy at Giuseppe Meazza seems to be the most expected result, although the two teams will try to get out for a victory, since the Italians will not want to speculate at home and the Celtic knows that winning would be first and would ensure a better crossing in the octaves.
Gordon Strachan's entire team could serve even a defeat to classify himself if the Shakhtar doesn't win, but can't be trusted because at nine points the pass is for Ukrainians, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but won (2-0) in the other direct duel.
So, the Milanists will try to make the Scottishs bitter at night, who trust to get into the second round in the re-structured Champions League and consecutively, after they were just defeated in that round the past campaign with a Kaka goal in the extension (1-0) after the 0-0.
Expecting the victory of the 'red-headed' will be the Shakhtar to whom only the triumph is worth, in the event that the Celtic loses, both to get into the eighth and to follow in the UEFA.
And it is that, despite being the last and no choice to follow in the highest European competition, Benfica could achieve the third place with a victory, with which UEFA would play.
20,000 people attend the first concert of the Spice Girls tour in Vancouver
The Spice Girls have started their first tour in Vancouver, Canada, in front of some 20,000 spectators since they dissolved in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) declared shortly before they began their concert at the Vancouver GM Place stadium that the group meeting was "bright".
About 20,000 people had exhausted the tickets to attend the concert that included a video that told the story of the group that made a fuss at the end of 1990.
The reunion and the world tour coincide with the launch of a new album that collects its main successes as well as two new songs, 'Headlines' and 'Voodoo', which in Spain publishes EMI.
The five members of Spice Girls went out on the stage lighting some bracelets that had been given to them by the husband of 'Posh Spice', British footballer David Beckham.
The sportsman was among the public who was concerned about GM Place, even though Victoria's nerves had banned him days earlier.
Previously on the beginning of the show, Victoria Beckham pointed out that the British astrologer "has not seen our dress, for nothing, so I'm nervous about what he's going to think of the show".
'Sporty Spice', whose departure from the group in 1998 "for the differences between us" caused the dissolution of the fiftieth two years later, also expressed his nervousness during a meeting with the press, two hours before the start of the show.
"I was scared.
I was nervous but I saw that the world's feeling has changed, the feeling for the Spice Girls has changed.
And I thought why not, so I'm glad I made the decision," Chisholm said about the group meeting she dissolved nine years ago.
The singer also pointed out that in time, "the things have been settled and we love each other very much".
But many things have changed since the Spice Girl last acted together in 1998.
To begin with, according to CTV, the group arrived in Vancouver on a special Virgin Airlines plane.
When he arrived at the airport, an army of infants was waiting for them.
Among the five are seven children.
Following the Vancouver concert, the group will act in California (USA), San José (December 4th) and Los Angeles (December 5-7th).
They will act in Madrid on 23 December.
New fears about gas between Russia and Ukraine
The growing dispute over the price of gas between Ukraine and Russia increases the risk of affecting the export of fuel to Western Europe by Russia.
Most of the gas exported by Russia to the European Union (EU) is directed through Ukraine, so each rock between the two nations is a source of attention.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow increases the price of gas, Russia will have to pay higher traffic rates.
A previous dispute last year reduced supplies to EU states.
The last dispute between Kiev and Moscow came with the Ukrainian government and the Russian state, the monopoly owner of gas, Gazprom, trying to agree on the amount of money that Ukraine should pay for Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom said it would charge more to Ukraine, as it has committed to paying an extra 50% in 2008 for the gas coming from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say it might be that Ukraine pays 40 per cent more for Gazprom imports.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transits during the talks," Ukrainian Economy Minister Anatoly Kinakh told the Reuters News Agency.
"Changes in gas prices should not relate to our arguments on the levels of transit rates [to Western Europe] via Ukraine."
The last major gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev, Gazprom cut supply to Ukraine in January 2006.
This meant a drop in exports to Western Europe, which quickly increased prices.
Russian gas represents the fourth part of the EU supply.
Russia has the largest gas reserves in the world, but much of it is not yet fully developed.
As a result, Gazprom complements its own supply with Turkmenistan gas and other former Soviet nations in Central Asia.
NHS "should try foreign workers"
The Scottish NHS needs to monitor the criminal record of employees outside Europe, one observer said.
The recommendation of General Auditor Robert Black came after it was found that a foreign doctor was related to the attack at Glasgow Airport in June.
Black also showed concern that the Scottish NHS does not have an accurate understanding of the amount of foreign personnel it has.
However, his report pointed out other controls that were carried out correctly through a sample of five health authorities.
The auditor-general checked the number of foreign personnel hired outside the European economic area, as a result of attacks at Glasgow airport.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was arrested at the airport after hitting a jeep at the doors of the terminal building at the airport.
He was one of the three doctors who acted at the Old Bailey by video conference in October, accused of alleged car bomb attacks in the United Kingdom.
NHS expects to carry out pre-employment checks for candidates to ensure that they meet the qualifications, experience and authorization to work in the United Kingdom.
Although the Scottish Health Board uses "Disclosure Scotland" to carry out criminal background checks, the agency has no jurisdiction to obtain this information outside Britain.
The auditor-general's report recommends, inter alia, that the Boards should be guided by the Criminal Records Bureau, which helps employers with criminal controls in many countries outside Britain.
"Although we find some of the personal records with evidence of these controls, this is not a routine review," says the report.
Black states that the Scottish NHS has a high level of compliance with its own employment policies, but notes that: "Our report highlights areas that can be improved to ensure that the necessary information is available in the number of NHS foreign staff."
The president of BMA Scotland, Dr. Peter Terry said it was "very unlikely" that pre-employment checks could identify potential NHS employees who could commit terrorist acts in the future.
"The report suggests that pre-employment checks work in NHS Scotland but it is not clear what is the added value of the recommendations made," he explained.
The Scottish health authorities declare that they currently have 1,161 foreign persons, most of them doctors and nurses.
But the auditor-general warned that the number could be higher, in part because the boards have problems identifying who the employees are with indefinite residence permits.
The investigation also found that the verification procedures established by the NHS authorities in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian were being carried out extensively.
This includes passport controls, work permit and qualification check.
The Scottish government is currently reviewing the policy and pre-employment guide of foreigners in the NHS.
Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said: "I had a great interest in this work as a result of the terrorist attack at Glasgow Airport.
He added that the Scottish government, together with the Health Boards, could consider the recommendations of the reports and that this would be reflected in the update of the pre-employment control guides for all working groups - including foreigners - which they planned to publish next month.
Joy Division dominates the film awards
Control, the biographical film about the late vocalist of Joy Division, Ian Curtis, has won five awards at the British Independent Film Festival, including the award to the best movie.
The trophies were also given to the protagonist Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse until he was chosen for Curtis' role, for Director Anton Corbijn and co-protogonist Toby Kebbell.
The actress Judi Dench was named the best actress by the thriller "Notes of a scandal".
And Bond's protagonist Daniel Craig won the variety award for putting a British movie on the international stage.
The awards were delivered at a ceremony at the London Roundhouse.
Control follows Curtis's rise to fame with Joy Division, until his suicide in 1980, at the age of 23.
The film - in white and black - with the soundtrack of The Killers, David Bowie and New Order - was produced with only 3,000 pounds of sterling.
But also the Dutch photographer Corbijn, already known for the iconic cover of the U2 Joshua Tree album, won with two prizes – the best director and the best debut director.
The rock music was the center of another award at the ceremony - like Julien Temple's film about the vocalist of The Clash Joe Strummer, won the award for the best documentary.
The award to the best actor was taken by Viggo Mortensen for his role as driver of a head of the Russian mob in London, in the film by David Cronenberg Promises of the East.
Ray Winstone, who has a reputation for playing hard, received the Richard Jarris award for his contribution to the British movie.
The fifth, whose films include Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming Indiana Jones's sequel "The Kingdom of Crystal Claw".
Winstone said he was proud to receive that prize, so appointed in honor of Harris, star of Camelot and Harry Potter, killed in 2002.
"There were people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney who opened doors to people like me," he said.
"I was lucky to meet Richard Harris a few times.
He was a great guy, a great actor of our time, it's really an honor."
Independent cinema awards, known as BIFAS, are selected by a team that includes filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
The supporters of the Bifa festival include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Sial and Michael Winterbottom.
Saudi Arabia Arrests 208 Terrorists
Saudi Arabia reported yesterday that it arrested 208 militants of terrorist cells planning an imminent attack on oil installations, as well as attacks on religious and security forces.
The world's largest oil supplier state television said one of the cells was planning missile smuggling.
Al-Qaeda supporters have launched a campaign against local monarchy, in alliance with the United States, since 2003 after Iraq's invasion.
An eight-military cell made up of foreign residents was planning an attack on an oil plant in the province of the East, reported the television report.
Saudi Arabia created a force of 35,000 troops to protect the facilities of Abqaq, the largest oil plant in the world, after a failed Al-Qaeda attack in 2006.
The report, quoting a statement by the Saudi Interior Minister, said that 18 of the detainees belong to a cell led by a "missile launch expert" who has entered the country.
The minister said that the militants had planned to smuggle eight projectiles into the country.
Other 22 detainees were planning murders of religious leaders and security forces.
The government warned religious leaders that they should be more active in arresting Saudis traveling to Iraq to join as militants in Al-Qaeda to fight against the Allied forces and to support the Muslim Shiita government, which is considered heresy by the most extreme Saudi Suni.
Al-Qaeda militants are looking at many religious people in Saudi Arabia who have been appointed by the authorities to support the policies of the royal family, which dominates the government.
The militants - recruited by the calls of Osama Bin Laden, the leader of Al Qaeda who was born in Saudi Arabia, to attack the pro-western government of the country - had as targets residences of foreigners associated with the government, government buildings and energy facilities.
"This has been a great effort of the security forces, five months ago," said the spokesperson for the minister of the interior to state television.
Arrested also include a "media cell" of 16 people in Medina, whose aim was to promote "the tafiri thought" - the ideology of radical Suni Muslims that supports violence against Muslims considered unfaithful and apostate.
The arrest includes 32 other persons accused of supporting and financial support to militants.
Venus climate can give an idea of the future of Earth
Venus could have once been a suitable place for life, scientists said yesterday.
The data of a European spacecraft in orbit showed the planet more like a gem of the Earth than it had previously observed.
Venus is the closest planet to Earth.
Both planets have similar size and occupy similar orbits, although Venus is slightly closer to the sun.
Millions of years ago, Venus could have had conditions similar to those that made the Earth a habitable planet, scientists now believe.
But the effects of carbon dioxide and the greenhouse effect, atmospheric erosion by solar radiation and slower solar rotation sent Venus to a very different type of development.
Today the planet has no water, the surface temperature is enough to melt lead and is eroded by hurricane winds and lightning storms.
The results of the European Space Agency for Venus Express, which has studied the planet for a year, provide an overview of how the Earth could develop catastrophic climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor, of the University of Oxford Department of Physics and one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, says: "It is being clarified why the climate in Venus is so different from that of Earth, when there are two similar planets.
"Our new data make it possible to build a scene in which Venus began as Earth, possibly with a habitable environment millions of years ago."
Police decommissioned "riched uranium"
A kilo of radioactive material, which they declare to be enriched uranium, was decommissioned yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police spokesman stated that three persons were arrested and the material was examined.
The officer could not confirm whether it was enriched uranium but said it could have been sold for $1 million (480,000 pounds).
Still open
Mitt Romney says it is not worthy that presidential candidates answer the questions of a snow mono.
However, Republican presidential candidates may agree to hold a debate on YouTube, where common voters and currents record video questions and send them to the candidates.
None of the questions presented in the afternoon of Wednesday, 28 November were more ridiculous than that of the snow mono that asked Democrats about climate warming in the debate of the Republican party on YouTube.
But the questions, and the answers, this time reflected much of the state of the Republican party in the elections next year.
It is not known exactly how CNN producers, who co-sponsor the debate, chose YouTube videos to show applicants to supporters.
But the first half-hour of debate, the longest on a single issue, focused on immigration.
The topic is one of the most powerful topics for the Republicans.
CNN asked a group of indecisive voters to raise the dial when they heard ideas that pleased them: the broadcasters noted peaks of approval when the candidates spoke with extreme arguments.
The hardest-word exchanges of the night took place between Rudy Giuliani, the national pioneer, and Mr Romney, who has been a pointer in the critical surveys of Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani is trying to ruin Romney's reputation because he was soft with illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former governor of Massachusetts of hiring illegal immigrants to work in his home.
Both responded aggressively when asked if any candidate could support an "amnesty" (allowing illegals to regularize their situation and give them the opportunity to obtain citizenship).
The minor candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a Californian congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, reached agreement on the subject.
No one has the word to be nominated as a candidate, but they both remain in the race perhaps because they both warned about the issue of immigration before the others.
At least in immigration, and in general terms, candidates share views: increased surveillance at borders, intolerance with illegal immigrants.
This topic, along with the fear of the toxic toys of China and other external concerns, helps Republicans to forget, or minimize, the divisions between liberals and Christian conservatives.
But the debate became uncomfortable when other topics appeared.
Mr. Giuliani was asked why he had supported arms control in the past.
John McCain and Mr. Romney discussed whether immersion in water should be considered torture.
One person asked if the candidates believed in each word of the Bible.
This led Mr. Giuliani to stumble toward the position that although the Bible was his favorite book, he did not literally believe in the history of Jonah and the whale.
Another person asked whether Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - now, against all expectations, first in Iowa's most recent survey, thanks to his long-standing Christian conservativeism - said that the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When he was pressured to answer if Jesus was in favor, he laughed, saying that Jesus was too smart to be candidate in the elections.
The race remains unusually open.
Mr. Huckabee is increasing in Iowa, coincident with the fundraising campaigns of Liberal Ron Paul, and his accelerated statements on Wednesday's debate.
They both came from the bottom, because the two winges of the party did not agree on the most famous and traditional candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate joined the party early and convincingly with a winning message about the greatness of America, satisfying both winges of the party.
This time the party is divided and the result is far from clear.
Labour pain
Gordon Brown has discovered another hole in which he sinks; but also emerges
As political scandals continue in England, this is not particularly interesting.
They do not seem to have sold influences, nor are they exorbitant accounts of hotels in Paris, nor do they suck off extramarital fingers.
But it has been revealed that a rich businessman has disguised contributions to the English Labour Government party of over 650,000 pounds ($1.3 million), for about four years using false names, and that the party did not report it.
Two months ago, when the prime minister failed to call for an election, insulting the British intelligence foolishly stating that the polls did not influence his decision, the hope was that it would provide a strong and efficient government.
But instead, like Vince Calbe, the Liberal Democrat is leading with growing engineering, because the frightened Mr. Brown has become Stalin as Mr. Bean.
Northern Rock's rescue, a bank in trouble, demonstrated regulatory weakness and poor judgment in times of crisis.
Bad proposals to change the tax code have put business groups together against the government.
The tax authority lost 25 million personal data that revealed an unimaginable administrative gap.
A third of retired generals began a riot in the Lores Chamber, protesting against the courts in military expenditure: being ministers of the armed forces is, they claimed, a half-time job.
Now it is the multiple donations of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the Labour Secretary-General (and former colleague) has already resigned.
None of this means that Mr. Brown walks irrevocably towards the exit.
Governments can reach an inflexible point after they are unable to rule.
People don't believe them as politicians, but they usually suspend their unbelief when a new batch takes control.
Once it is clear that the prime minister can't improve things, which he doesn't have much time left, that suspension is too much: public officials are starting to fail; cabinet ministers are exposed; the press is looking for bad news; and the government is putting itself on the defensive and not focusing.
In part, Brown's position is particularly difficult, because unlike other political leaders, it cannot be defended by arguing that it is new.
Although I'd like to deny Tony Blair, he was his senior lieutenant.
The problems of Northern Rock and the registration tax are related to Brown's decisions as chancellor of the era.
And even when it is not directly involved in Blair's contracts - or "effective for partners", the investigation into the funding of political parties - voters can assume that if it is.
However, Mr Brown's situation is not as bad as it seems.
The plates aren't as bad as the Tories want to show.
As in Mr. Bean, no one has died, no one has been robbed directly.
And the remedy, though painful, is to give what the naturally Stalinist tendencies of Mr Brown have always promised: a reliable and brutal government.
The new political scandal of donations is a good example.
Mr. Abrahams, who compares his donations with gifts of charity, says he does not want public recognition for his well-being.
This may be so, but the decision does not take it.
Laws against anonymity for major political contributors are clear and exist for a clear reason: the public has the right to know who is buying access to those who have power.
Mr. Watt, who said that he knew about Mr. Abraham's agreement, and that this was not illegal, would obviously face Jon Mendlesohn, the fundraiser to whom he was asked about donations in October.
But Mr Brown is not involved so far: there is nothing to suggest that he knew about these actions, although the gross payment was made after he took control of the office in June.
So far, the prime minister has done half of the work.
It has been quick to condemn your party for violating the law, but it dilutes itself in the decision-making process by a family case, a committee of inquiry on the matter - conducted, to a good degree, by a judge and a bishop.
In this case, morality is not complicated.
If the law has been violated, it's a police matter.
In addition, there are other things Mr. Brown must do, such as find a permanent and independent leader for the Public Life Standards Commission, as he has not had one for six months, and he must also press for genuine reform of party funding.
This will require a hard cooperative work of the workers with the Tories, and perhaps a waiver of the special financial situation with the unions - bitter measures for a partyist such as Mr Brown.
But he must face some partisan facts.
Conservatives now have a good level of support in the polls; he is two years old to win voters; and the only way he can move to victory is to act with an impeccable probability and a solid competition.
Carded sharks
Is the mortgage crisis undermining the American credit card market?
When there is blood in the water, it is natural that dorsal fins swim around.
Today that the American housing market is in crisis, predators have their eyes placed on the country's credit card market.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs estimate that credit card losses can reach $99 million if the mortgage crisis suppresses other forms of consumer credit.
There are signs of infection already seen.
There is an increase in both card and crime rates, which measures the proportion of balances that have not been amortized or which have more than 30 days of delay respectively.
HSBC announced last month that it has taken over 1.4 million in its financing business to the US consumer, partly because of the weakness of card lenders.
However, it is very early for panic.
Morosity and crime are at low levels.
According to Moody's, a qualification agency, the third quarter the 3.89% crime rate was almost a percentage point below the historical average.
The deterioration in rates can be partly explained by technical factors.
A change in the American People's Breakdown Act (2005) resulted in a sudden fall in bankruptcy applications, which in turn represent a large loss in credit cards; the number of applications (and therefore of morosity) would be growing again, or the conditions for lenders might have been deteriorating.
The industry also reports sound payment rates, which show how much of its debts consumers pay each month.
And trust in credit cards and asset-backed values is quite firm, despite the paralysis in other financial areas.
Dennis Moroney from TowerGroup, a research firm, predicts that the volume of emissions for 2007 will be about 25% higher than last year.
Direct channels of crisis infection between mortgages and the credit card market certainly exist: consumers like to charge debt to credit cards now that credit institutions are running out.
But credit card issuers look more at liquidity flow than active values, so that falling prices do not necessarily change the creditor's credible capacity.
They can even work to take advantage of the broadcasters.
The incentives for consumers to continue amortizing the mortgage decrease if the properties are less worth than the loan value; and as a result, the payment of the card's debt rises in the list of priorities.
Card issuers can also respond quickly and flexibly to the difficult conditions that mortgage lenders, changing interest rates or changing credible balances.
This in theory should reduce the risk of a rapid asset retase.
"We're not going to wake up one day and re-evaluate all the loans," says Gary Perlin, Chief of Finance of Capital One.
If a sudden subprime infection on the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of a sustained decline are much more real.
If home prices are lower and a contraction of credit pushes America to recession, industry is undoubtedly facing a more severe future.
We have to keep watching these dorsal fins.
British bankers declared guilty in case Enron
Three British bankers who were held responsible for fraud with the former head of Enron's financial office, Andrew Fastow, were found guilty this Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew were originally found innocent of seven fraud charges for hanging with Fastow in a secret financial operation in 2000 to enrich themselves at the expense of employees.
They were sent to trial in January.
But during the hearing before Judge Ewing Werlein Jr. of the U.S. District, each was convicted of fraud.
The three former Greenwich Natwest executives, a unit of the Scottish group PLC in the Royal Bank, became a famous cause in Britain by extradition procedures that lasted for two years.
In the United States, his case marked the final flow of a research launched after the collapse of Enron in 2001.
Initially, charges against bankers had to have warned Fastow in 2002 that it was the goal of a government investigation into the fall of Enron.
The charge against the bankers - he doubled the "NatWest Tres" - claims that they came to Houston in 2000 to invent a fraudulent scheme with Fastow and his former superior assistant, Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of an Enron company controlled by Fastow, who was the architect of a myriad of frauds in Enron, who helped his spiral fall into the collapse.
In 2002, the bank valued the interests of the subsidiary in zero, but the three British knew it would value up.
A company under Kopper's control bought the subsidiary's bank interest in $1 million.
Bankers paid Kopper $250,000 for interest in that company.
According to the charge, Fastow faked Enron, as the energy company would pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its part of the subsidiary.
But the 20 million remained in the hands of British bankers, Fastow and others.
Bankers charged 7.3 million, while Fastow, Kopper and others received about 12.3 million, according to the indictment.
In January 2004, Fastow was convicted of two conspiracy charges in Enron's collapse.
The British trio was arrested three months later.
Fastow is serving a 6-year sentence in a Louisiana federal prison.
Kopper is serving a sentence of 3 years and a month in Texarkana.
Each of the three British bankers had to pay $1 million to live in the United States while the trial was being held.
Enron, one of the seven largest companies in the nation, declared bankrupt in December 2001 after years of fraud in accounting, could not hide the debt of millions or make their business seem successful.
The collapse resulted in the loss of thousands of jobs, more than 60 million in market values and more than two million in pension plans.
The founder of Enron, Kenneth Lay and former executive chief, Jeffrey Schilling, were entrusted with the role they played last year in the collapse of the company.
Schilling is serving a sentence of more than 24 years.
Lay's conviction for conspiracy, fraud and other charges was suspended when he died of a heart attack last year.
Not down or out in Moscow
The price of a G550 Gulfstream plane, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and enough fuel capacity to fly directly from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at $54 million.
But this is a small expense for some of the rich Russians.
"He has a capacity of up to 18 passengers," says Dan Firer, Gulfstream representative.
"But no one asks for that model of so many seats because it's for family private flights or presidents of a company."
Mr. Firer was in charge of the Gulfstream cabin last Friday at the Millionary Fair, a four-day-consuming orgy held in a center of events near the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, 200 other luxury suppliers had installed their exhibition stands, hoping to attract the new Russians to all kinds of products, from caoba crafted yachts to diamond-encrusted car trolleys, worth 50 cents.
Mr. Firer carefully looks at a bright orange Porsche in the nearby stand."
"It's a nice car, but it's nickel and calderilla compared to us," he said.
"After the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private aircraft."
Supplyed with fuel by oil growth, the Russian capital looks like Dallas when it was in the apex.
"We lived in the same way in 1890, when some acaudal Americans came to meet in Europe, where they were seen as materialists," says Marshall Goldman, senior professor of the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
"Like the Saudis of the 1970s and the Japanese in the 1990s, the Russians are emerging as the world's largest consumers and consumers."
The most exclusive luxury brands in the world are looking for their part of the cake.
In another place in Moscow, a conference will be held this week on the luxury industry with Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, president of LVMH, to exchange ideas on how to sell luxury goods on markets such as Russia.
(The conference is organized by the International Herald Tribune, owned by New York Times)
Russia has 53 billion dollars that make a total of $282 billion, according to the wealthiest Forbes list.
In addition, the second-grade riches include 103,000 Russian millionaires whose money amounts to $670 billion, according to a study on the evolution of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, written by economists at the Centre for Economic and Financial Research, a local thank you.
(The World Bank says that in 2005, 15.8% of Russians were below the subsistence level.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow - and that's why we're all here," says Nicole Marais, sales and marketing representative of David Morris, London Jewellery.
She attended the fair for the first time with the Russian distributor of the brand, the Soho Jewelry group.
"Women are incredibly prepared and men are very worthy."
Visiting the fair on Sunday night, dressed in the afternoon, two real estate agents, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, described their customers and themselves as millionaires.
"I was looking at the cars and I'm trying to decide between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche," Yumatova said, who reeled off the design suit that he used as a network veteran carpet dissing with Joan Rivers.
The fair aims to attract the new rich, the type of buyers who would be willing to stay several hours in a warehouse that blends brands from Cadillac Escalades, platinum cutaneous plums, Mövenpick ice creams, pool tables, apartments in Dubai and Teddy bears in Gund.
The general public can buy 30 euros ($44.57).
"The Russians are interested in learning what brand is the most expensive and the best," said Mr. Gijrath, who sat patriotically in a stand of the real Dutch porcelain Delft, in front of a reconstruction of the wall size of a painting by Rembrandt, made of hand painted tiles.
"Of course, the Russians are more interested in the "bling-bling".
In fact, the sellers said that the rich Russians of the most trajectory (10-15 years for Russian standards) have changed their tastes from belligerent logos to limited edition brands, which would not be exposed at a trade fair.
However, several thousand people: millionaires in cash, millionaires' or tourists' emissaries, fill the halls every day.
And some of them buy.
On the first night of the fair last Thursday, Roman Ersov, chief of the King Koil beds, said he sold two cot systems of $70,000 each, made of silk, cashmere and cotton covered with gold thread.
Also on the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, a sales manager for A1 Moto, company that equipped high-end cars with ad hoc alarm systems, said the company had sold the bright orange Porsche for $170,000 to a Russian millionaire.
On Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, a company that modifies luxury cars for particular requirements, said that he had sold three car trolleys with chain bracelet, for Rolls Royce Phantom, in $55,000 each.
He showed the reporter a wheel of car, designed for the owner of a Russian casino, with embedded rays of Swarovski-colored crystals, so he looked like a wheel of roulette.
Cost: $22,000 for four wheels.
"The Russian millionaire who wants ostrich leather wheels or a portrait of his wife made of zirconium cubes will not necessarily drive on those wheels," says Mr. Karapetian.
"He's gonna keep the car in his garage, along with 30 or 40 other cars."
Even if many of your Russian customers are rich, Mr. Karapetian makes it clear that the phrase "Russian millionaire" does not mean exclusivity, given the flow of real estate prices.
"If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, it's probably a millionaire, at least in the paper if it's not in cash," he said.
"There are more of them than you think."
Those who were not millionaires could at least pretend to be rich by the support of the Continental Alliance, a Russian asset management firm.
The company made four red phone booths (British style) filled with false billboards of $1 million.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing officer, said his team had printed 500,000 fake tickets for the Millionaire Fair.
Visitors stopped to shake up money piles, asking their friends to take photos with their mobiles while resting on money piles, or taking a couple of millions.
"You see, in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire," says Karryev.
Surgery "chapula" could be the cause of a death in New Jersey
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston looked through the window of the restaurant "A little healthier" and saw how an ambulance came up through White Cape Cod, two doors down on West Scott Avenue.
Suddenly, a police patrol car appeared.
And then another.
"Then I saw the ambulance come up," said Mr. Livingston, the restaurant's supervisor, that Wednesday.
"That's when I knew someone had died."
The authorities assumed that the dead woman was Olga Arroyo, 41 years old, assistant director of the Newark Police Department.
Now researchers are trying to determine whether she died due to a procedure by an unauthorized plastic surgeon, who is not yet identified by the police, but who works in the house of 212 of Av. West Scott.
The authorities still do not determine what caused Mrs. Arroyo's death, but they wait for the toxicological test, although the results will not be available for a few weeks, which will help solve the mysterious death she has barely reached the senior police in Newark.
Ms. Arroyo had been a helper to the police director, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice was familiar to many in the department.
"She was loyal, worker and tenaz," says Mr. McCarthy about Arroyo in a phone interview on Wednesday.
"She was my guardian."
She was protecting me."
Mr. McCarthy said that Arroyo was Jimmy Arroyo's wife, a former NYPD officer who worked for the Alcoholic Drinks Control Commission, and left two children aged 14 and 11, and a window.
Eileen Walsh, spokesperson for the County Union Prosecutor Theodore J. Romankow, said that the detectives are trying to determine whether Mrs. Arroyo died as a result of an unauthorized surgical procedure.
"That's one of the possibilities," Walsh said.
"It's an ongoing investigation."
The authorities said they arrived at the house about 3 P.M.
On 21 November they met Mrs. Arroyo on a sofa.
She was declared dead on the spot.
More than a week has passed, and the authorities have said little about their investigation or the owner of the house, called Flor Margarita Castro.
Mrs Walsh could not say if Mrs Castro had been questioned by the authorities.
Researchers are trying to determine which part of the house was used as medical advice.
On Wednesday, no one answered the door in Mrs. Castro's house, where a rosal marchite is located in the front of the house, and a dalmat thief in the back.
A blue drum labeled "vainillina ethyl" - used as a substitute for vanilla in food and perfumes - was located at the door of the carriage, next to a door leading to the basement.
Two mountain bikes hang hooks on one side.
Mr. McCarthy said that when he arrived in Newark after 25 years in the New York Police Department, Mrs. Arroyo was of invaluable help in getting to know the new island city and its rough political culture.
"She would say, 'you have to watch out for him," she said.
"She was always here when I was, and also when I wasn't.
You're pregnant."
The Federal Reserve is expected to cut the rates to raise the Stock Exchange
The actions jumped on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday after the market expected the Federal Reserve to calm down the credit conditions by cutting interest rates, which increased with the reassuring comments of the US Central Bank Vice President.
The stock exchanges took place in London, New York, and across Europe after Donald Kohn, number two by Ben Bernanke, president of the reserve, declared that policymakers should be "flexible and pragmatic" in responding to the continued tension of financial markets.
In a clear effort to calm the markets in the midst of growing samples of credit exchanges, Mr. Kohn said that the recent turbulence was "partly reversed by market improvement at the end of September and during October".
If the upward trend persists, it would increase the possibility of additional adjustments in the financial conditions for real estate and business, Kohn said.
The comments were taken by investors as a sign that the reservation is ready to inject fresh capital into US markets and to make subsequent cuts of the type of interest, to stabilize the credit conditions.
The comments also helped calm Wall Street in the midst of bad news for the US economy, such as the house sales that reached the lowest record in October.
The consequences of the financial turmoil were accentuated by a notice by Bear Stearns, an investment bank that will cut 650 jobs, equivalent to 4% of its total workforce, in a global cost reduction to compensate for the losses of its investments in US sub-prime mortgages.
Only 20 of those posts are expected to enter London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the industrial average of Dow Jones rose by 331 points, or 2.55%, to 13,289.40, while the broad S&P 500 index rose by 2.65%.
In London, the FTSE 100 index raised 165.5 points, or 2.7%, to 6,306.2, adding more than 39 billion pounds of sterling to the value of UK's first-order companies.
The Dax index in Germany increased by 2.6%, and France's CAC40 was above 2.3%.
Previously, the reappearance of credit tension in the markets after a strong demand for a three-month auction of funds from the European Central Bank, which considered these loans to European commercial banks to be 4.7%, the highest rate since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England to monitor the performance of the Federal Reserve and the ECB and to inject additional funds into the securities markets in London tensed the credit and the three-month loan rates "Libor" between the British banks, meaning the largest rise since September, by 6.59%, after a constant rise since 12 November.
England takes into consideration the demands of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
There are two dilemmas here, each as hard as the other.
Who should hit No. 6 by England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And no one is less important in the first trial against Sri Lanka, who should make the decision?
The second question is relevant because David Graveney, the president of the selection that is loaned—with that particular title at least, is here to help Peter Moores, the coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, to decide; and also because Hugh Morris's desk, director of England, is beginning to fill out bids to become a national selector, and if not, in a part of time.
Whoever doesn't get the sixth battle place will be unhappy, but life is often unfair and sports too.
It is not easy to remove what a man does at the top of his profession, while another never goes beyond the lower level, sometimes by lack of luck more than by capacity.
Not only in cricket the choice is difficult, as judgements are required that always end up being subjective.
Is it the right time for Bopara to get up?
Is it fair for Shah if he does?
The same question could be asked in another aspect if, says John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, two good-grade young executives who know the business well, would have been promoted to the table: there is only room for one of them.
Who should say what a good level for a cricket player, unless they give you the chance to dive or swim to the next chance?
Of course, figures have a great influence on decisions, but they also have opportunities.
Within a team, a cricket player has to take the captain's eye while taking a "wicket" and a drummer to get opportunities to change the order if you want to have an impact as a player someday.
But picking out the eye of the voters is more complicated.
There were many who improved the past season, for example, James Anderson, who probably played in the first test even if Stephen Harmison declared himself to be "fit and bowls" as the wind on the networks.
Anderson took 32 first-class tickets in 33 races for each to win a place.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 on the same average, but both have had their high moments and can expect more of them.
The games of Shah or Bopara in the stadium of Asgiiya can only be a question of opinion.
The option can break or make a man's career, or it can mean a small difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played each test and did it well in the first, with 5 wikis and 40 useful races, but it was Paul Collingwood, struggling to establish at the same time who became an important player, and despite noting a double cent against Australia in Australia, he may still be underestimated.
The probability is that Graveney, Vaughan and Moore, after further discussion at today's session at the Asgirya Stadium, will follow their conservation instincts and favor Shah's greatest experience on the exuberance of young Bopara.
There are arguments for both.
In favor of Shah is his brilliant and valuable debut proof of beginning 88 in Bombay, 32 hundredths of the first class in front of only 6 of Bopara, who, in 22, is seven years younger, and has excellent backgrounds against spin bowling.
But Shah made only ten races in his two shifts in May against the West Indians in the test in Lords, his home as a Middlesex player, and that caused an immediate rejection of the voters when Vaughan claimed his place for the next meeting, it seemed to have taken from his "batting" some wind that was in Bombay.
On the contrary, Essex's team is happy to live in swords.
He is caught by nothing in the cricket field and his attitude was summed up as when he poured his vehicle into an exhibition for the English car sponsor Volkswagen.
He suffered minor injuries and, probably a shock, but the first thing he did was to take out his Vodafone (sponsored, of course) and call Alastair Cook, his remote-looking teammate, to say with excitement: "Did you see that?"
Bopara is the best player, it's including your rebalancing pass to have effects on your games that seem to satisfy it, because it fights with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the best time, another.
Maybe that's the true art of selection.
My inclination would be to give Bopara his chance, which does not mean that Shah does not excel, as the tea sheets suggest, is he who plays here this weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and the fight against Al-Qaeda
The first buses with Iraqi refugees from Syria began arriving in Baghdad yesterday, evicting the exiles who remained inactive, no visa extensions and those who expected the city to return to normal.
Some had even returned to fight the militants who drove them out of their homes.
At the Mansour bus station, even before 800 people arrived from Damascus on an official government convoy consisting of a dozen buses, the terminal was filled with refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned in private transport.
"I decided to go to Syria after killing many doctors in Baghdad," says Sabah al-Qubaisi, Sunni doctor.
"I came back today for what I saw on TV and what I read in the newspapers, about what happened in Baghdad and what is safe now."
"It is said that Mahdi's army stopped killing people," he said, referring to the Shiite militia of religious activist Cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who ordered their troops a momentary stop.
Qasim al Atwani, a 38-year-old Shiite and professor in Amariyah's sunny area, returned with her two children because it was impossible to renew her visa in Syria because the regime does not want Iraqis working in their country.
His Shiite neighbors in Amariyah called him by phone to tell him that an allied force from the United States helped bring Al-Qaeda out of his battalion west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of the recent arrivals of Jordan was the leader of a Sunni and Shiite tribe that had been driven from their home in Sleikh north of Baghdad by a grenade attack, after urging citizens to rise against Al-Qaeda.
He had come to fight.
"Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they had started a militia against Al-Qaeda in Sleikh and that they needed my support and that of my companions."
"That's why I came back today," said 62-year-old Sabaah Alu Obeidi.
Many said they were attracted by the growing calm in the capital since the US troops joined groups of "anxious citizens", armed and working in cooperation with US soldiers to defend their neighbours.
But many said they had returned because of the visa denial and the lack of money in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis had been established in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, 51 years old and father of three children, voiced the common suspicion among the exiles, who Nouri al-Maliki, the first Chinese minister, asked the Syrian government to impose restrictions on refugee visas to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people believe they have fled the country because of the sectarian squares of death.
"We were fine until al-Maliki visited Syria and urged the government to stop granting visas to the Iraqis, to force them to return to Iraq," the Sunni said.
"I can't believe a government that supports criminals who set my house on fire after I left it."
Part of the reason for the cessation of violence is that the sunnits have been expelled from the Shiite and vice versa, relaxing the tension.
There is the fear that a sudden wave of refugees will cause sectarian tensions to arise again and the struggle will begin.
Little Sarre, good education.
The smallest federal state is the first in vocational training and even shines through the international orientation of its higher schools.
As in the whole country, the Sardinians lack only an educational field.
"Yesterday I explained for the 50th time to a non-Sarlander who we are not French" -- that was the ironic bike on itself from the smallest federal state for its 50th.
At the same time, France and Luxembourg have a great role in the education system of Sarre which in a study of the Institute of the German Economy (IW) called "Bildungsmonitor" occupied the fifth place.
In this way, traditional high schools have good relations with neighbouring countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was merged in 1948 by the French.
To this day, students can finish their university course here with two or three degrees.
As a result, the percentage of foreign students is high, 15.6 per cent.
However, the number of students coming from Sarre is higher than the average in higher schools. Many of them do not have a bachelor's degree.
"The system of vocational education is being used in Sarre," says Axel Plünnecke, an educational sector expert at the Institute of the German Economy (IW).
More than every five young people do their bachelor's degree at the Professional School. Thus, it turns out that Sarre is 7 points per cent above the national average.
On the contrary, the variety of possibilities for professional-academic education is very wide.
The offer of double careers, in relation to population, is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical vocational training and growing demand, the number of graduates in Engineering Sciences has dropped one third in recent years.
That is why the Ministry of Education of Sarre forced higher education schools to make more publicity for engineering specialties.
"After the first PISA study, we made some reforms in general education schools," says a spokesperson for the Ministry of Education.
Thus, the government introduced comparative evidence throughout the country.
For children to start studying the last year of the project called "Kita-Jahr", it has no cost. Meanwhile, this model also imitates the other federal states.
Comparison with the next studies will show whether the student's performance has increased.
According to the 2003 PISA report, the number of students lagging behind in school development decreased from 29 to 20 per cent.
But, in general, Sarre didn't improve much like other federal states.
In Bavaria, students can calculate better.
To the dismay of the Sardinians, the PISA report does not compare the knowledge of foreign languages, although in this field they could achieve good results.
Although the Sardinians are not French, the language of the neighbours is a mandatory assignment in the Secondary Education Institutes.
Chavez changes the time.
Nearly in Venezuela there will be another time zone different from the rest of the world.
On 9 December, President Hugo Chávez lets the schedule change in the South American country by delaying the half hour clock.
Chávez is currently staying as a comedian in Spain.
As the Official Bulletin of the Venezuelan State has reported, under the new law, the time will be at least four hours for GMT.
In this way, the South American country will have a timetable that does not exist in any other country of the world.
Among other things, Chávez, as an enemy of the United States, justified his decision by saying that the United States would impose the obligation on the world in its day by changing a full time.
In addition, on Wednesday (local time) Chávez announced the break-up of relations with his neighbor Colombia due to hostage-taking action.
The nationalist on the left said he would not maintain any relationship with the head of state or with the Colombian government until conservative Alvaro Uribe continued to be the president of Colombia.
"My dignity does not allow me to do this," says Chávez, who is pushing a constitutional reform where the citizens of the oil country must decide Sunday in a referendum.
With this reform, its power in the country could be considerably extended.
The reason for the conflict was the decision by Uribe to withdraw Chávez ' s mandate in the negotiations with the Marxist guerrilla in which it was about the release of hostages.
Sunday Chávez said criticizing the decision that Uribe made has offended Venezuela.
Also in Spain there is much talk about Chávez.
A new tone of so-called feeling in the country: "Why don't you shut up?" is the phrase that has already downloaded half a million people.
This phrase was spoken by the King of Spain, who was upset by the continuing interruptions by the leftist populists at the last Ibero-American Summit.
In 2007 the decrease in real wages threatens Germans.
According to a forecast, this year a decrease in real wages threatens the German employees despite a severe setback.
Experts present a large number of reasons for a pessimistic prediction.
According to the calculations of the Hans Böckler Foundation, German employees should have a lower real salary account in 2007 than in the previous year.
"The blame for this is the weak evolution of wages, the increase in value added tax and the sharpness of food and energy prices," reported Gustav Horn newspaper of the Institute of Macroeconomics and Economic Cycles Research.
The new burden of unemployment insurance can also be borne by employees.
Minister of Finance Peter Setinbrück told the newspaper "New Ostanbrücker Zeitung" that given the current situation, the intention to reduce the unemployment insurance burden by 3.3% over a year is fair and reasonable.
Of course, the office does not have to re-enter an unpleasant situation, requesting loans and subsidies to the Federal State, according to the words of a German social-democratic party politician.
Tuesday it was made public that the inflation rate with the explosion of prices in the food sector and the oil derivatives sector reached the highest level for 13 years.
By comparing prices with last year, they are increasing by 3%.
Venus: twin brother of the Earth.
Although its atmosphere is not suitable for life, Venus is the most like planet on Earth, something that has not yet been raised. The European Venus Express probe discovered rays in the atmosphere and remolons in the poles, the same ones that appear in winter on Earth.
For three decades now, researchers suspected that there might be rays in Venus.
But now the European probe has brought new evidence: it has discovered electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere. In Venus the rays warm at a height of 54 kilometers from one cloud and behind another, says Cris Russell from the University of California in Los Angeles to the scientific journal Nature.
According to the famous model of Urey-Miller's life, the rays caused life on Earth: the storms could have caused reactions in the ocean that, for their part, had caused amino acids that were the basic components of life.
In Venus it's not like this: if there was ever life there, that would have to be in one of the first states of evolution," explains Sean Solomon of the Washington Carnegie Institute.
Today, there can be no life on the surface of Venus: atmospheric pressure is almost 100 times greater than on Earth and on the surface it has temperatures of 500°C, oscilulating so that temperatures can be reached below zero.
"Perhaps Venus is a "diabolic" twin from Earth, but still a twin," said Russell.
The main objective of the "Venus Express" mission is to answer the question why Venus, so much like Earth for its mass and size, has had such a different evolution.
Since there were no special missions since the 1990s, only for research on this planet, the launch of "Venus-Express" in November 2005 was a very important step for Venus research.
The latest results of the research that will be presented in many articles of "Nature", according to researchers, not only underline Venus' uniqueness in the Solar System.
"This also shows that neighbouring planets have more common characteristics with the Earth than we had expected," ESA reports.
Despite the already well-known stormy winds in the North Pole, researchers have also discovered in the southern polar region a vertice formed by the clouds that rotate faster.
This phenomenon recalls the wind currents in the high ground atmospheric layers of the poles, as described by a team of researchers by Giuseppe Picconi of the Italian Institute of Special Astrophysics and Space Physics.
The second planet of the Solar System has the mass almost equal to Earth and its equatorial diameter of 12,000 kilometers is almost as large.
This planet also called the star of dawn or the star of evening orbit around the Sun almost 225 days.
But its rotation period is slower: a day in Venus is 243 days on Earth.
Although Venus with its surface temperatures of 460 degrees and its atmospheric pressure of 92 bars is not much like Earth, scientists start from the basis that both planets had been formed under the same conditions.
The two planets had accumulated water that remained on the Earth in the oceans, but in Venus it was dissociated in the universe.
While carbon dioxide had become carbon stones on Earth, Venus formed most of the atmosphere.
Koehler defended Merkel's myth with Dalai Lama.
Koehler, the Federal President, insists on the end of the fight between the parties at the reception of Dalai Lama at the Federal Office.
He indirectly criticised the German Social Democratic Party for its attacks on the Federal Chancellor after the Mitin in September.
Horst Koehler, the Federal President, was concerned about the reputation of Germany and therefore demanded that the great coalition end the fight for the reception of Dalai Lama.
"In this case we should not introduce ourselves as a divided nation," Koehler said to the newspaper "Handelsblatt".
At the same time Koehler showed his understanding of the reception of Dalai Lama by Angela Merkel (Party of the Democratic Christian Union) in September.
"Although I have great respect for the difference between cultures, human rights are absolutely valid for me," Koehler said.
Everyone knows that Germany has to act in a balanced manner in the field of foreign policy, underlines the Federal President, defending Merkel from the reproach she received when making a new policy with China.
"The Federal Chancellor did not take the distance from the traditional course of China's policy.
China also knows," Koehler said.
Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Social-Democrat Party), had indirectly expressed his dissatisfaction with the reception of Dalai Lama and was therefore attacked by members of the Union.
Among other things, Steinmeier criticised the Union for its inoperable foreign policy.
The reception of Dalai Lama at the Federal Office caused great misunderstandings in Chinese-German relations.
Thus, the Chinese government not only withdrew the invitation to Peer Steinbrueck (Social-Democrat Party), the Minister of Finance of Germany, but also, according to information sources from the magazine "Spiegel", frozen the so-called strategic dialogue of the Ministries of Foreign Affairs of both countries.
Wen Jiabao, the head of the Chinese government, demanded the Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel to recognize this reception of Dalai Lama as an error.
Affirming China's position, Wen Jiabao said China would not accept that European politicians would receive the religious leader of Tibetans in their official position.
The actions and words of Dalai Lama showed that they were trying to divide Tibet and the other Tibetan region of China, which now also includes other provinces.
Schaeuble warns that there will be disturbances such as those in France.
Battles with the police in the streets, shootings, car fires: Wolfgang Schaeuble warns that there will be disturbances as was the case in France.
The Federal Minister demands that every effort be made to ensure that social dissatisfaction in Germany is not shifted to the streets.
They were barricaded, the vandals fired at the police: after serious youth-led disturbances in France, Federal Minister of Interior Wolfgang Schaeuble (Democratic Union Party) fears similar trends in Germany.
"We must also ensure that the social problems of our country do not take the violent form."
"That's what we have to take seriously," said New Presse, published in Hanover.
Not all young people are developing in the constant change in social reality.
The Federal State, the federal state and the municipalities are already working with emphasis on solving these problems, Schaeuble said.
This applies not only to the integration of immigrants.
"From the Summit of Integration to the Conference of Islam: all this is already giving its first fruit."
It's still early to give the end of the alarm for a seat.
At the same time, Schaeuble indicated that German suburbs do not have the same edifice and sociological problems as they do in France.
Young people were marked by serious street riots with the police in northern Paris last night.
Car and public buildings were also burned in Toulouse.
Kenan Kolat, President of the Turkish Community in Germany, called for more efforts by the Federal Government to integrate.
Kolat, in view of the disturbances in France, warns of an imitating effect.
It is true that the situation in Germany is not as explosive as in France.
Nevertheless, actions are necessary.
Kolat indicated that the rate of unemployment among young people of foreign origin under 25 years of age is above the average.
There is a need to ensure that there are more vocational training positions.
Kolat stresses: "We have to give a perspective to young people."
The President of the Turkish Community added that in Germany more than in France "there is great social control in families", more than the French country.
Moreover, most young people of foreign origin do not want to destroy what their parents had built here.
Kolat says, "But in spite of everything, we have to be careful."
There is a need "to provide young people with the opportunity to receive a job or vocational training more quickly".
Meanwhile the night in the Parisian suburb Villiers-le-Bel passed peacefully.
Hundreds of policemen took part in the action, a lighted helicopter overrun the territory.
The responsible authorities reported three arrests, as well as trash and burned cars.
Since the previous day, a team of almost 1,000 police officers has been working on security.
After seeing a suburb, Michelle Alliot-Marie, the Minister of Interior, announced that the police are going to take strict measures until necessary.
On the night of Monday at about 80 policemen were injured by disturbances in Villiers-le-Bel.
The disturbances continued the following night in Toulouse.
The disturbance began with a traffic accident Sunday, where two young people died.
According to information provided by the prosecutor, the death of young people was not the result of the police.
In Angela Wolke's kingdom.
The performance very far from the reality of the Federal Chancellor, shows that the coalition in terms of content has reached its final point and that there is nothing more to expect than it.
But in what country does the Chancellor really live?
After her desperate act, indifferent and not much in the general debate of the Lower Chamber, it must be said that she does not live in the country she would have to be governed by.
With regard to the complaint made to him by repeatedly engaged in actions in foreign policy, the Chancellor rejected it with a presumptive sentence.
He said that this would be a provincial way and thus showed that he did not want to understand what the critics were interested in.
In the Lower Chamber, it was made very clear to all that the accusation was appropriate.
There was no minimal interest or any sense of feeling about the country's problems.
But instead, Angela Wolke presented herself in this way: a very high policy that runs in foreign policy and remains there without achieving anything concrete.
One example: the prevention of climate change: it was highly commended for its decisions in Heiligendamm, but it does not say anything about how these climate goals should be achieved here.
In general, this way of praising oneself - for two years the leader of the Democratic Union Party has not been able to afford so much modesty.
So he insists on expressions for people to get a boost.
And in this way it damages your public image by pragmatic conception with which it solves the problems without going through the branches.
But in the kingdom of Angela Wolke, the inner problems are appearances of little value.
Poverty of children and concerns for low-wage workers?
The only thing that is dedicated is to talking about this subject using subordinated prayers.
It is impressive how many times it is wrong to speak when it comes to supplementing children.
And in this case, Merkel needs more than three attempts to formulate a more or less good sentence.
He began to stumble "as if he had been in an unknown territory", when it was more specific information.
The section's attacking.
The two favorites, Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney, made a confrontation in a heated debate of Republican presidential precedents on YouTube and should now fear only one candidate from the outside.
From the outset, tensions between candidates have been noted.
Mitt Romney accused his opponent Rudy Giuliani of turning it into "a place of refuge for illegal immigrants".
This, for his part, answered with serious complaints: "I would like to say that his own house was a "port" for the illegals." Giuliani replies to the former governor of Massachusetts saying he was the one who used illegal immigrants without papers.
Candidates tend to attack: as so far the group of Republicans has no clear preference, the eight presidential precedents take advantage of the debate in the CNN, especially to discredit their opponents.
The small 30-second videos, circulated by Internet users who were sent to Youtube, do not have much content either.
"With this kind of isolation we let Hitler get to power," that was John McCain's complaint to his opponent Ron Paul, the only one of the meeting he insisted on immediately withdrawing Iraq's troops.
Romney also receives many criticisms by war veterans in Vietnam, when he refuses to recognize as torture the "Waterboarding", a method of interrogation, by letting a person drown themselves in simulate his death.
Public reactions in the room in St. Petersburg in Florida show that while the most important topics of the campaign are others, not just the war in Iraq or the debate on torture.
The public always applauded very strongly when they praised the conservative values and denied the increase in taxes.
You can see better where the weaknesses of both favorites are.
"I was wrong at that time," Romney explained and apologized to people and to the television audience for having been the advocate of abortion in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, did not know what to say when asked what he thought about the literal interpretation of the Bible.
For the first time Musharraf ruled without uniform.
One day after his resignation as army chief, the Pakistani president was sworn in as president.
This is how the eight years of military government in Pakistan end.
Thursday Pervez Musharraf, President of Pakistan, took an oath for a second five-year term.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live at the Presidential Palace in the capital of Islamabad.
Musharraf vowed to respect the constitution and act for the welfare of the nation.
On Wednesday, he transferred his army chief's mandate to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani and thus accepted international pressure, especially by the US.
Eight years after power was done with an incredible military blow, the former general ruled the state for the first time as a civilian leader.
With his resignation as Chief of the Armed Forces, Musharraf met the main condition of the opposition and the West.
The other requirement is the end of the state of emergency, which was proclaimed by Musharraf on 3 November.
According to Malik Muhammad Qayyum, the state's general prosecutor, after the Musharraf oath, will soon cancel the state of emergency and meet the second condition of the west.
Since the proclamation of an exceptional status in the Supreme Court, there have been many jurist supporters of Musharraf. Last week the Supreme Court of the country rejected all resources before the controversial new elections of the head of government on 6 October.
In the meantime, in an attack on a convoy of soldiers in the North Watersistan region, five soldiers died and four others were injured.
According to the military spokesman, a bomb exploded on one of the streets on the border with Afghanistan.
The founders of Krautrock are back.
The most famous German band of the 1970s continued its activity: three members of "Harmonia" participated in a concert in Berlin.
A copy of "Live 1974" was made as a reindeer that was written in the best time of the band.
By then they were very famous in foreign countries.
The assistance of these three gentlemen to an official food caused the feeling.
Each of them has his casket, his cables and especially his buttons in front of him.
In the middle is Dieter Moebius who is 63 years old and is dressed in a white shirt.
On his left is 57-year-old Michael Rother, who has his laptop and guitar.
On the right, looking at the auditorium, is Hans-Joachim Rodelius, 73 years old, who is very busy with the control panel.
Each one contributes with his or her sounds, including rhythm.
Sometimes, without any intention, these sounds become a piece of music.
This doesn't seem to bother the gentlemen.
Something very exciting for Krautrock's fans was the fact that the Harmonia band again made music.
What you have to rebel here is this: the exact questions have shown that the name of the band retumbled in people's minds, but it was not as special as that after 32 years the audience would be so surprised.
But why can't the Germans also applaud their 70-year-old living legend?
Above all, because the Krautrock mistake has always been more valuable in England and the United States than in their own country.
When the entertainment industry awarded a "Echo" music award to the members of the Can 2003 band in Cologne for their work of living, the room could see the surprised faces of the German pop artists.
And when Red Hot Chile Peppers thanked the band La Düsseldorf und Neu!, everyone opened their mouth with wonder.
Later Michael Rother spent time on the stage during the concerts of Red Hot Chile Peppers as if he were an old friend (of the band).
Ignorance in your country and recognition abroad are one thing.
It is a problem to remember this band, because the trio only existed for two years and at that time I did not achieve a great impact on the public, but it was subsequently achieved thanks to others.
Already a long time ago, Moebius and Roedelius had performed music with artist Conrad Schnitzler and had a name, Cluster, which was very famous.
At first they played in the basement of Berliner Schaubuehne.
Then, for economic reasons, they worked with a music company in Duesseldorf that was sponsored by a church.
For a while, Rother had a job at Kraftwerk and then worked as a guitarist on the Neu band! He managed to improve the reputation of this German band that was too radical at the time.
In 1973, Rother followed Cluster's musicians in exile to Forst in Weserbergland.
There, in Alten Weserdorf, which is a 17th - century ruin, they lived as refugees of the city.
The way of life was less ideological than in Common I, where Roedelius could complain about his position.
That was rather a life of artist full of surprises.
According to them, one day an association flag appeared about how Harmonia of Ottenstein was in the trash, which turned out to be a good name for art.
There were also disadvantages in using the name Harmony.
The first album was called "Musik von Harmonia" and the second "De Lux".
Although music was quiet and simple, the band had financial problems.
Life as an artist wasn't just to get to know himself.
The "Live 1974" CD was recorded during a concert in Griesem. Someone remembers that almost 50 people participated in this recording.
Then Rother expressed his desire to push Harmony and do it from time to time.
For Roedelius and Moebius this requirement is against customs.
In 1975 the band announced its separation.
Rother ended up on esoteric issues and assured his existence with albums like "Flamende Herzen".
Cluster survived the 1980s and has had more success since then than Harmony had.
The live recording of the album in Griessmer, that must be appreciated by Groenemeyer.
Her music company Greenland was set as a goal to cultivate this German contribution itself to preserve it as live music.
Like the work of Roedelius, also the band Neu! was discovered again.
The presentation of Harmony as a band takes place at the House of World Cultures in Berlin.
The band was subsidized by public measures at the Wordtronics Festival.
There is Julian Cope, the English, the old punk and the author of the "Krautrock Sampler" manual.
There is also Dr. Motte, the inventor of Loveparade.
Thus, all Krautrock influences on the next pop music are present.
Harmony takes the position of a superband, a position that was empty.
Brian Eno's phrase accompanied by special music fills the room: "This music is the only true music, it belongs to the future."
There are photos where Harmony appears with producers in a farm.
The history of the development of the legend is shown in the black and white photo projections, where instruments are seen with cables.
There are three veterans in the background who started improvising again.
They do nothing but fix the microphones to the organ and battery to produce extraordinary tones with the help of the effects apparatus they had built with their own hands.
Now electronic music is as it should have been.
Three people who dig deeper into the technique.
But that doesn't change anything.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, in a musical setting she smiles, sighs, and at a good time of emphasis she sings "Aaaaaaaah!".
Krautrock was always an English term of origin.
But it was never about rock.
The origin of the genre was not sought in the blues, but in the music schools (Can), in technologies (Kraftwerk) or running away from the artistic and social conventions (cluster).
He who yells "68!" here is also right, but now Harmony keeps calm.
There is a very good reflection on what is already obvious on the stage.
Where does it start and where does the music end?
That can break one's nerves or give you quick moments of luck.
Richard Gere just needs more cynicism.
The two films "The Hunting Party" and "Moedersicher Frieden" are once again dedicated to the war in the Balkans.
But they didn't have much conviction.
Either the concepts are much fixed in actions and shootings or the two films are too exciting.
Richard Gere with his "The Hunting Party" can't help in this case either.
At first there was good news: Karadzic and Mladic, war criminals, still hiding in the Balkans mountain, but right there, in the dark interior of the country during the war in Bosnia, the actor Richard Gere was discovered again.
We had finally lost sight of the most beautiful man in the 1980s, because no one wanted to see him after his pleasant roles and little importance in films for women and after many press conferences on Buddhism.
Now, suddenly, Richard Gere is the most important argument to perhaps see the movie "The Hunting Party- when a hunter becomes what he's after" (Why do movie titles have to be so long and shot today?).
The film has a wonderful presentation for the view: at the bottom, its role as a reporter in the war is the presentation of what Richard Gere could do, if the fate and industry of the cinema had not been so merciful to him. He was a man whose best times of life had already passed, who as a monument of the ruin of his decade kept most of his charm so far.
"The Hunting Party", despite this triumph, along with "Moerderischer Frieden" which is German production and will also be presented this week, it turns out to be only a series of unsuccessful films about the war in the Balkans.
The film "Moedersicher Frieden" can be described in a few words: it is two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who want to save a Serb from the Kosovo snipers, one of them acts very quickly and that also leads him to fall in love with her.
The meaning of the film is lost by actions and shootings, although we celebrate that Serbs are not presented again as the only culprits.
The film is like the German series "Alarm for Cobra 11" without a highway, but in a war situation.
In the example of "The Hunting Party" you can investigate, because there was in fact never a good movie about the war in the Balkans.
Another time, with another director and with another writer of script (Richard Shepard in two posts), the story of US war reporters going to detect a war criminal Serb called "Zorro", could probably be a new "Apocalypse Now".
Thus, stories are surprisingly similar: the small teams go twice to the mountain to carry out something that the army cannot do and always results in a crazy journey.
One reason for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is when at first they introduce us to Simon Hunt, to whom they don't just let him be a cynic with heart.
No, the script also foresees a loving adventure with a Muslim Bosnian who will kill later.
Then "The Hunting Party" is very far from reality, especially when in the last five minutes reporters with an impressive speed achieve what NATO, CIA and all the world's headhunters couldn't achieve for five years, which was to capture the war criminal and leave them to the Muslim Bosnians to avenge themselves in a fair way.
It is so bad that they wish to appeal to the international court in The Hague based on crimes against cinematic logic.
However, the purpose of the film is, in fact, a deeply human being.
The film wants to condemn the fact that Karadzić and Mladić are still free, and it highlights that Americans and French are not really concerned about pursuing them, because they have political arrangements between them.
Sometimes the good and the bad are so similar, so one comes to his head a very famous poem from Brecht.
In this poem it is a mask of an Asian demon: "In the great thorns of his face I see, sharing the feelings with him, which is hard to be evil."
In movies like "The Hunting Party" there are also these demons but they prove that it is hard to be good.
The problem is not only the kind of war movies in the Balkans.
Recently in a newspaper, he published that all films about Iraq produced in Hollywood are flaws.
It can also be added that there has never been a good movie about South Africa.
Almost always worth a rule: when a star meets a crisis region or mine fields, then something like "Rangoon" appears with Patricia Arguette, "On the other side of all borders" with Angelina Jolie or "Blood Diamonds" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
Possibly all these conflicts occurred in a short space of time.
They have to spend at least decades until Hollywood rides a good movie on the burnt by, for example, the movie "The Schindler List".
Some films already need more time. Classics such as the works on the war in Vietnam "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" in their times were not celebrated unanimously as the masterpieces.
Today we may know too much about global conflicts, so in our time every massacre (Massenmord) is presented directly on two televisions at home.
And that's because the script writers don't have the least repair (which is necessary to power) to tell good stories.
"To be or not to be" or "The great dictator" turned out to be so good, because Lubitch and Chaplin did not yet know how bad the Nazi regime really was.
Maybe you shouldn't be a good person to film.
Perhaps it should be like the novelist Lawrence Norfolk, with his sarcastic look away from an artist.
When asked about the parallelisms between his historic novel "Lemprière Dictionary" and the war in the Balkans, he replied: "It is only because some things never change."
The great cities will always be in danger, the men will always be brutally murdered and in Yugoslavia will always rule the war.
Von Beust receives the negative criticism of the Olympic Games in response.
The mayor of Hamburg received many criticisms from politics and the economy for not requesting the Summer Olympics.
Many want to continue to fight for competitions in the water sports section.
But Beust remembers that you have to be realistic when you love the possibilities.
Hans-Joerg Schmidt-Trenz, Director General of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, declared this resignation on Wednesday as "not good for the economic location".
In recent times no other project in the big city has encouraged as much motivation as the idea of organizing the Olympic Games.
"Without this objective, political momentum, sports at the same level could not be maintained."
Schmidt-Trenz asked the Senate not to forget this project, but to find a new long-term application "which refers to another time".
On Wednesday, Mayor Ole von Beust maintained his statement that Hamburg's ambitions in organizing the Summer Olympics will not be realized until at least 2028.
"Hamburg does not decide on the application for the Olympic Games, but it is decided by the German Federation of Olympic Sports," von Beust said at WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the decision of the Sports Federation (Sportbund) expected in early December, on Munich's application for the Winter Olympic Games of 2028.
"This preference means to us that in this period of time, which until now we thought we had until 2028, from a realistic point of view, we will have no opportunity."
Nevertheless, this dream did not end forever, said von Beust.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) regrets the statements by von Beut.
This gives the impression that in the next 25 years Hamburg does not want to apply for the Olympic Games.
"It is too soon to leave the opportunity, if the plans are currently ruined," said HSB director Günter Plöß on Wednesday.
A resignation of the application is contrary to the statement by the Senate chief who made at a reception on the basis of the general meeting of the German Federation for the Sport of Higher Schools (adh).
There von Beust named Hamburg's application for universities in 2015 not as "a substitute" for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
Only last week the Federation of Sports of Higher Schools appointed Hamburg as a candidate for the application.
The German Social-Democratic Party Group (SPD-Bürgerschaftsfraktion) blamed the Senate for not taking advantage of the valuable time for the construction of houses in Hamburg.
"For many years the Senate has been lagging behind with the development of the small grassbrook neighborhood, because it was planned for the Olympic Games or the construction of houses," said Carola Veit and Jan Quast, members of the German Social Democratic Party (SPD).
While the SPD always required an integrated planning of Olympia for the small Grassbrook and then the use of the built houses, the CDU stressed the importance of entertainment.
At that time, Hamburg's application for the 2012 Summer Olympics sparked great enthusiasm.
But Hamburg failed because of Leipzig.
It's not the wooden boxes.
Whoever connects the terms Sweden and wooden box, think about Ikea, but don't think about Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
Currently the wooden boxes produced in Sweden are like the shadow that weighs on Warhol's list of works.
Most of the ninety-four "type" brightness boxes on this list are false.
After a few months ago the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" cast doubt on Andy Warhol's Brillo-Boxes authenticity in 1968, the Moderna Museum of Stockholm carried out internal investigations and reached disappointing conclusions: the six "Brillo-Boxes", which the former director of the Pontus Hulténe Museum gave to the Moderna Museum, are false, and almost a hundred of the others of the "Stockholmo" who are in circulation in the international art market, also result.
Prehistory is too complicated with a confusing relationship between artistic and sponsored productions.
In 1964 Warhol created his first "Brillo-Boxes" in New York, painted the boxes of red, blue and white wood, with the same show that they had "Brillo" soap powder cartons.
According to Warhol, in the exhibition of his works in 1968 at the Modern Museum were exposed hundreds of carton-boxes. These were not made by Warhol (due to the expenses), but were brought directly from the "Brillo" cardboard factory.
These were not works of art, but examples (which were only a few objects) of art.
In the same year, 1968, Warhol allowed to produce in Sweden some wooden glasses, but they were not exhibited at the Modern Museum.
Witnesses of those times now speak of almost fifteen boxes, which at that time entered the history of art and auctions as originals of the "Blizzo-Boxes" of the "Stockholm type" authorized by Andy Warhol.
Some of them were purchased for over $100,000 in auctions.
The problem is that after the famous director of the Pontus Hultén Museum made false statements that in 1968 in Sweden almost a hundred wooden boxes were produced and exposed to him by Warhol.
But in fact, 105 boxes were produced in the same year 1990 in Malmö for Hultén and for the exhibition in St. Petersburg.
By this time Warhol had been dead for 3 years.
Lars Byström, the head of the conservatives of the Moderna Museumet Museum, investigated six Bright Boxes owned by the museum and also three of the Swedish private property that were manufactured in 1968 in Stockholm. First they printed and embellished their hard plate and then they painted them to the oil with the brush.
On the contrary, the structure of the 1990 copies shows that the painting was applied with a roll without directly printing the pressed silver. Furthermore, it is not the oil painting, but the acrylic painting.
"These boxes have not been authorized by the artist and should be removed from Andy Warhol's official shine-box list," says Lars Nittve, director of the Moderna Museumet Museum and adds that if the Andy Warhol Art Authentication Commission in New York will not reach any conclusion, the Moderna Museumet Museum will classify these six boxes as copies/exposure objects."
Already in July, the Authentication Commission formally announced that it would accept these "serious accusations" concerning soap dust boxes.
But from that moment on, everything remained absolutely silent.
The rebel soldiers surrender in Manila.
In the Philippines, the rebel soldiers who had trained themselves in a hotel in Manila and demanded the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
The head of Antonio Trillanes, who blames the president, corruption and electoral fraud, told a reporter who could not answer for spilling blood.
Faithful soldiers to the government had raided the hotel using tear gas.
Nearly two hundred soldiers had been entrapped in the building a few hours ago.
Almost half of them, including Trillanes, had a trial Thursday for trying a coup d'état in 2003 that ended with a failure.
He took advantage of the negotiations, so that he could suddenly deposit with about 30 sympathizers.
Clearly, the military police who had to watch him had passed on to his ranks and followed his motive.
They entered the "Peninsula" hotel and demanded the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Government troops blocked the neighborhood around the Noble Hotel.
The President called for an urgent meeting of the Security Office.
Norberto Gonzales, the National Security Councillor, condemned the conduct of the soldiers.
"People are tired," said Trillanes.
"We call people to pass our rows."
General Danilo Lim, who previously led the Scout Reangers elite, said that within a short time the other military troops wanted to follow the march.
The major government critics called on Thursday for a great demonstration against the president.
For months his government has been accused of corruption.
In 2003 the financial district in Manila was a site that drew all attention to the motive that was being tried against Arroyo.
The uprising failed after about 24 hours because the army wanted to participate.
Since 1986 in the Philippines, there have been at least seven attempts at state coups against the democratically elected government.
United Internet will be Versatel's biggest shareholder.
United Internet secured more than 20 percent of the shares of the Versatel telecommunications company.
On Wednesday, the company reported that the average price for an action is EUR 14,46.
It's only 20.05 percent of the social capital.
There were many speculations about the company's absorption.
There are also options for increasing the financial share in Versatel.
United Internet reported that with this step it wants to accelerate the consolidation of the German DSL market (Digital Subscription Line).
On Wednesday they already made assumptions about the entry into business, after the bank Brendenberg increased its participation in the network operator of Duesseldorf by 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
In the financial market, this means that the financial institution maintains the title of participation for a third party.
United Internet already on the previous day involved almost 10 percent in the Drillisch telecommunications company.
Drillisch placed 17.4 million of the new shares worth EUR 106.4 million in the capital increase measure.
United Internet has bought from them 5,15 million shares for 31,4 million euros.
In addition, companies started negotiations on trade cooperation in DSL products.
"We strengthen our collaboration," explained United Internet spokesperson.
The two companies set up an SME joint venture to acquire the Freenet competitor.
Thursday United Internet reported that at first, the two companies want to be happy with the ten percent participation in Freenet and do not exercise their right, i.e. they are participating in 18.49 percent of Freenet.
This meant that both companies maintained all options, especially participation in the anonymous Freenet society.
The negotiations between the United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership ended in mid-November.
This "game" with Freenet will last for many months and is not very understandable is part of the consolidation of the German Telecom market.
At the end of the third quarter, Freenet had 2.9 million customers with a mobile phone contract and 1.27 million with a DSL contract or a full contract.
Up to now the holding of United Internet and Drillisch had directly 6.01 percent of the participation in Freenet.
Then they agreed that Drillisch will achieve the other four percent.
The right to buy 18.49 per cent of Vatas investment society was already agreed in August.
