David O'Shannessy, chief inspector of RSPCA (animal abuse organisation) told ABC that surveillance and inspection of slaughterhouses in Australia should be standard procedures.
"The establishment of monitoring in a determined manner would show animal workers that they are of the highest priority".
The USGS International Earthquake Map did not record any Earthquake earthquakes in Iceland last week.
The Icelandic Meteorological Office has reported that there have been no earthquakes in the Hekla region in the last 48 hours.
The significant seismic activity resulting in the phase change was recorded on 10 March on the north-east side of the highest volcano caldera.
At the foot of the mountain there were dark clouds that did not result from any volcanic activity.
The clouds could have made it difficult for us to see if there actually was an eruption.
Luno carried 120 to 160 meters of six-fired fuel when an accident occurred and strong wind waves combined with waves pushed him to the falochron.
The helicopters saved twelve members of the crew; the only reported injury was a broken nose.

The proposed amendment went through both rooms in 2011.
At this legislative session, the second sentence was first set out by the House of Representatives and then adopted on Monday by the Senate in a similar form.
The lack of a second entry which proposes a ban on single-sex relations may pave the way for the legalisation of partnerships in the future.
Then resolution HJR-3 will be reviewed by the next legislative authority selected in 2015 or 2016 in the context of further proceedings.
In addition to the director for the Vautiera achievement, the hunger strike in 1973 was against what he defined as political censorship.

The team is well-known, although a controversial English teacher who worked at Modern Education and King's Glory schools and claimed that he had 9000 students at the top of his career.
His notes contain the words of some parents who were considered scenic and likewise did not deviate from the Vulgarisms during their lessons.
Modern Education accused him of placing large commercials on buses without permission and of lying about being the chief English teacher.
He was also accused of violating copyright, but he was not charged.
The former student said that he "slaughed in the classes, taught dating skills and was like a fellow student".
China has developed a market economy in the last 30 years, although the official communist body has not undergone transformation.
The first economic reforms were implemented under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping.
Since then, China's economy has grown 90 times.
Last year China was the first to export more cars than Germany, pursuing the United States as the largest market in this industry.
Within two decades, China may exceed the United States GDP.
Danielle's tropical cyclone, the fourth known hurricane season in the Atlantic in 2010, was formed in the eastern Atlantic.
The crazy storm about 3000 miles from Miami in Florida reaches the maximum wind speed of 40 miles per hour (64 km/h).
Scientists from the National Hurricane Centre predict that Danielle will become a hurricane by the middle of the day.
Because the storm is far from the earth, the assessment of its potential impact on the United States or the Caribbean is difficult.
Bobek, who came to the world in Zagreb, the capital of Croatia, became famous thanks to the game at the Partizan Belgrade Club.
He was with them from 1945 to 1958.
When he was on the team, he won 403 goals at 468 meetings.
No one played so many games or shot so many goals for the club as Bobek.
In 1995 he was selected as the best player in Partizana's history.
Celebrations began with a special presentation known worldwide by the Cirque du Soleil group.
The following are from the Istanbul National Symphony Orchestra, the Jančar team and the singer Fatih Erkoç and Müslüm Gürses.

Last week, Naked News issued a statement on the intention to radically extend its scope in several languages to three new audits.
The World Organization, which currently publishes reports in English and Japanese, is already preparing programs for television, the Internet and mobile devices.
Luckily, I didn't get hurt, but I won't forget this macabrian scene when people tried to knock out the windows to get away.
People threw chairs in the drawers, but the windows were made out of a glass that was not shining.
"One of the speeds was finally broken, so people began to walk out the window," said Francisk Kowal.
The stars emit light and heat, using the energy generated in the process of connecting (or melting) hydrogen atoms to form heavier particles.
Scientists are trying to create a reactor that has been able to generate energy in the same way.
However, solving this problem has caused many difficulties and many years have passed before a useful thermonuclear reactor is built.
The steel mirror floats on the surface of the water due to the tension on the surface.
The surface tension occurs because particles of water on its surface are attracted more strongly than particles of water and air above them.
Objects such as needles are able to be mounted on a water table due to the invisible coating that particles create on the surface of the water.
The modern ski deck has two edges separated by a row. Two edges increase the attachment to the ice, even when placed at the angle.
The bottom of the blade is slightly dimed, so when the blade turns on one side, the back of the ice is also bent.
This makes the skier turn, and when the skiers turn to the right, the skier turns to the right, and if the skiers turn to the left, the skier turns to the left.
To return to an earlier level of energy, they must remove the additional energy generated from the light.
They're doing this through the emission of a tiny particle of light called photon.
This process is defined by scientists as 'stimulated radiation', because atoms are stimulated by clear light, which causes light photon to be emitted, and light is the type of radiation.
The next image shows atoms that emit photons. Of course, photons are in fact much smaller than on this image.
The photos are even smaller than the particles that form atoms!
Hundreds of hours of work cause the lamp in the lamp finally turns off and the lamp ceases to light.
Then you need to change the lamp. When you change the lamp, you must be careful.
First, turn off the light or switch off the cable.
This is because the current affecting the fixture in which the metal part of the fixture is located may seriously defeat when touching the interior of the fixture or the metal base of the fixture when it is partly in the fixture.
The primary organ in the circulation system is the heart, pumping blood.
Blood is removed from the heart from the "wires", which are called arteries, and led to the "wires" called veins." The definition of hairy vessels refers to the smallest of such "wires".
The tooth triceratops could crush not only leaves, but also extremely hard branches and roots.
According to some scholars, triceratops was fed by insects, or typical plants for the credit period.
The plant resembles a small palm with a crown made by a sharp, piercing leaf.
Strong mail could have been useful for triceratops when he wanted to break the leaves before he went to eat the tire.
Other scientists claim that these plants are very durable, so it is not possible for dinosaurs to eat them, although today lions and other animals, such as parrots (breeds of dinosaurs) to eat lasting leaves or fruit.
How would the gravitational force operate on me on the moon Io?
A person weighing 200 pounds (90 kg) on Earth will weigh about 36 pounds (16 kg) on the moon Io. The gravity force is, of course, much smaller there.
The sun doesn't have a crust like the Earth on which you can stand. The sun is all gas, fire and plasma.
The gas splits as it moves away from the center of the sun.
The outer ring that we see looking at the Sun is called a photoosphere, which literally means "the sphere of light".
The Venus phase, similar to the moon phase, was observed about three thousand years later (in 1610) Galileo, and used a telescope for this purpose.
The phases are that the light reaches only one side of Venus (or the Moon), the one that is turned to the Sun. The Copernicus theory, according to which the planets orbit around the Sun, had its confirmation in the stages of Venus.
Jeremiah Horrocks, an English astronomer, observed the transit of Venus a few years later, precisely in 1639.
Following the example of Danielaw England, she experienced a long period of peace.
However, in 991 Ethelred had to face the Viking fleet, which could be compared only to the Guthrum fleet a hundred years ago.
The fleet was led by Olaf Trygvasson, Norway, whose ambition was to rid Denmark of domination over his country.
At the beginning, Ethelred did not take part in the battle, but managed to reach an agreement with Olaf, who returned to Norway and tried to regain his kingdom, although with different consequences.
Hangul is the only specially invented alphabet that is in everyday use. It was invented in 1444 for the reign of King Sejonga (1418–1450).
King Sejong has sat on the throne as the fourth ruler of the Joseon dynasty and is still enjoying great recognition.
He will initially define the Hangul alphabet as Hunmin Jeongeum, which means "the proper sounds for teaching people".
There are many theories about how Sanskrit was born, and one of them is talking about the migration of Aryans who brought their language from the west to India.
Sanskrit is an ancient language that is considered to be the eastern equivalent of European Latin.
The first known book in the world was written in Sanskrit. After the development of the Sanskrit hopefuls, Sanskrit simply lost its meaning because of the hierarchy.
Sanskrit is an extremely complex and rich language, which derives from many modern languages used in India, just as the Latin is a source of European languages, such as French and Spanish.
After the victory of the French campaign, Germany moved with preparations for the invasion of the United Kingdom.
The Germans called the Lew Sea Operation an attack. Most of the heavy weapons and resources of the British army were lost while leaving Dunkierka, which is why the army was quite weak.
Despite all this, the British Navy still surpassed the mighty German Navy (Kriegsmarine) and was able to defeat any enemy fleet that would influence the La Manche Channel.
A number of British Navy ships were on potential routes of invasion because they were admirably afraid of being drowned by the Germans ’ attack on the air.
Let's start with an explanation of Italy's plans. Italy was primarily the "younger brother" Germany and Japan.
Their army and the Navy were weaker, although just before the war began, four new ships were built.
The main objectives of Italy were the African countries, which needed military start-up platforms to cross the Mediterranean and attack Africa.
To do this, they had to eliminate the British bases and ships in Egypt. Besides, the Italian warships had no other tasks.
And now it's time for Japan, Japan was an island state, just like the United Kingdom.
Lods are underwater swimmers designed for longer journeys under the surface of the water.
The submarines were used during World War I and World War II, when they were very slow and limited in range.
At the beginning of the war they traveled mainly on the surface of the sea, but along with the development and greater accuracy of the radar, underwater vessels were forced to fall under the water to avoid detection.
German submarines were called U-bots. Germans were perfectly able to navigate and operate submarines.
The Germans were successful in using submarines, so after the war, they did not want to have too many of them.
Yes! King Tutenchamon, sometimes called "King Tut" or "King of Boys", is one of the most famous kings of ancient Egypt.
Interestingly, in ancient times it was not considered important, most of the letters of ancient kings were not included.
However, when his tomb was discovered in 1922, he became a celebratory. Although many ancient tombstones had fallen victim to the robbery, the tombstone was actually intact.
Most of the items buried with Tutenchamon were well preserved, including thousands of artifacts made of precious and rare stones.
As a result of the discovery of sprinting circles, the Assyrian miners were easier, faster, and more effective in the pursuit of warriors and other miners.
They were shot by their killers who were able to break through the weapons of enemy soldiers, and the Assyrians had brought in the first cavalry in less than 1,000 B.C.E.
The cavalry is a military formation made up of armed horsemen. The seat was not yet invented, so the Assyrian cavalrymen had their horses on the armor.
There are many famous Greek politicians, scholars and artists. Probably the most famous figure in this culture is Homer, a legendary invisible poet who created two epic artifacts of Greek literature: Iliad and Odyssey.
Sofokles and Aristovanes are still popular dramatists whose art is seen among the largest works in world literature.
Another famous Greek is Pythagoras, a mathematician, primarily known for his famous statement about the relationship of sides in rectangular triangles.
There are different calculations on the number of people using the Hindi language. It is estimated that it is among the second and fourth most commonly used languages of the world.
Taking into account or excluding closely related dialects has an impact on determining the total number of native language users.
According to estimated language, this is used by 340 million to 500 million people, and up to 800 million are able to understand it.
In Hindi and Urdu, vocabulary is similar, but different letters; in everyday communication, users of both languages can usually understand each other.
Somewhere in the 15th century, northern Estonia was under a very great cultural influence in Germany.
Some of the German monks wanted to draw close to the God of the local population, so they invented a literal Estonian.
It was based on German alphabet, but one sign was added: Õ/õ.
As time went by, many words borrowed from German came together, which was the beginning of enlightenment.
According to the tradition of inheriting the throne after school went straight to the military.
However, Charles went to Trinity College in Cambridge, where he studied anthropology and archaeology, and then his history, winning 2:2 (lower degree of second degree).

The European part of Turkey (including the Eastern Traction or Rumelia in the Balkans) is 3% of the country.
The territory of Turkey is over 1,600 kilometres (1,000 miles) long and 800 kilometres (500 miles) wide, approximately rectangular.
The area of Turkey, including lakes, extends to 783,562 square kilometres (300,948 square miles), of which 755,688 square kilometres (291,773 square miles) lies in the area of South-West Asia and 23,764 square miles (9174 square miles) in Europe.
The area of Turkey is the 37th country of the world, with a size of less metropolitan France and the United Kingdom together.
Turkey has access to the sea on three sides: from the west to the Aegean Sea, from the north to the Black Sea and from the south to the Mediterranean Sea.
Luxembourg has a long history, but independence gained in 1839.
Today, parts of Belgium belonged to Luxembourg in the past, but they became the property of Belgium after the Belgian revolution of the 1930s.
Although Luxembourg always tried to remain neutral, it did not escape German occupation during the first and second world wars.
In 1957, Luxembourg joined the organisation, which is now known as the European Union, as a Member State and as an institution.
Drukgyal Dzong is the ruins of the fortress and the Buddhist monastery in the upper part of the district of Paro (in the village of Phondey).
Likewise in 1649, Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgiel built a fortress to honor his victory over the Tibetan-Mongolian forces.
After the fire of 1951, only a few remains of Drukgyal Dzong, such as the image of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal.
After the fire, the fortress has been preserved and protected and is still one of the most impressive attractions in Bhutan.
In the 18th century, Cambodia was tense between two powerful neighbours: Thailand and Vietnam.

Learning to create interactive media requires standard and traditional skills and tools known during interactive activities (creating scenarios, editing movies and sound recordings, storytelling, etc.).
In order to design interactively, media production assumptions should be reassessed and non-linear thinking taught.
The interactive elements must be connected to each other in the project, but they must also make sense as a separate whole.
The problem with the GHG is that the complexity and number of elements needed to achieve a certain range of focal lengths are much higher than that of the GHG.
This poses a growing problem because the manufacturers of lenses are reaching higher standards in their production.
As a result, the variables can take pictures of the quality comparable to that obtained by permanent fireworks.
Another minus variables is the fact that the maximum width of the lens (speed) is usually lower.
Therefore, cheaper environmental targets make it difficult to light light if no flashlight is used.
One of the most common problems when converting the film to DVD format is adjusting the image size.
Overall customer satisfaction is a key criterion in the production of most televisions.
That's why everything on the TV screen had a cut edge down, up and down.
This should ensure that the image covers the entire screen. This function bears the name of the overscan.
Unfortunately, when creating a DVD, its cover will probably also be cut, and if the recordings are too close to the bottom, they will not be fully displayed.
Tournaments, banquets and knights of the Round Table have long been elements of the imagination inspired by the traditional theme of the medieval castle.
Even standing among the thousands of ruins, sounds and smells of past battles can be easily heard and practically heard by a bunch of copyists on the use, as well as a feeling of fear.
But is this reality a bud of our imagination? Why did they even start building castles? How were they designed and erected?
The default for this period the Kirby Muxloe lock is a more reinforced house than the actual lock.
Large glass windows and shadow walls would not be able to withstand a strong attack for too long.
In the 1980s, when Lord Hastings began his construction, the country was relatively calm, only to be defended against small groups of marine fighters.
The equal force was a system within which European nations sought to maintain national sovereignty of all countries in Europe.
According to this concept, all European nations had to disrupt one nation's access to power and therefore governments have often changed allies to maintain international balance.
The first armed conflict, with a balance of strength, is the war on Spanish success.
This was an important change because the European Powers would no longer have a pretext for the outbreak of religious wars, which is why the Thirty Years' War would be the last war to be called a religious one.
The temple of Artemis in Ephesus was destroyed on July 21, 356 B.C.E., as a result of the burning of fire by Herostratus.
The story says that he was seeking fame at all costs. The angry Ephesians announced that the name Herostrates should be erased from human memory.
Greek historian Strabon then wrote the name, as we know today. The temple was destroyed on the same night that Alexander the Great was born.
Alexander offered as king to cover the cost of rebuilding the temple, but his offer was rejected. Later, after Alexander’s death, the temple was rebuilt in 323 B.C.E.
Make sure that your hand is as relaxed as possible by hitting all the knots correctly – also try not to make unnecessary movements with your fingers.

Mysticism is in pursuit of unity or identity with ultimate reality, divinity, spiritual truth, or God or to gain their full consciousness.
The believer seeks direct experience, intuition, or gaze into the deep of divine reality/gods or gods.
Publishers have a certain lifestyle or are involved in practices that aim to care for this type of experience.
Mysticism differs from other forms of religion and religious worship, which places on personal, direct experience of an exceptional state of consciousness, especially of the mild, deep, gentle, and even ecstatic.
Sikhism is a religion that was born in the Indian subcontinent in the Pendjab region in the 15th century due to a break in Hindu tradition.
The Sikhs do not identify their religion with Hinduism, although they admit that it has Hindu roots and traditions.
Sikhs call their religion Gurmat, which in Punjabi means "the path of the guru". Guru is the foundation of all Indian religions, but in Sikhism it is so important that it is the essence of Sikh beliefs.
He established this religion in the 15th century Guru Nanak (1469–1539), and among his successors are nine more guru.
However, in June 1956, the promise of Kruszczow came into conflict with the residents of Poland when labor demonstrations against food shortages and wage cuts turned into protests in communism as such.

The Indus Valley civilization existed in the era of Brazos in the north-west part of the Indian subcontinent, including most of today's Pakistan, as well as part of the regions in the north-west India and north-east Afghanistan.
Civilization flourished in the rivers of the Indus River, from which its name originated.
Although scientists assume that because this civilization existed in the name of today's famous Saraswati River, it can be equally well called the Indus-Saraswati Civilization, while other researchers use the name "Harappian Civilization", referring to Harappa, the first settlement discovered in the 20th century.
Progress in medicine has contributed to the militaristic character of the Roman Empire.
The first medical recruitment was initiated by the emperor of August and resulted in the creation of the first Roman medical corps serving wounded soldiers in battle.
The surgeons knew a variety of calming measures, including morphine obtained on the basis of extracts from the seeds of the full mace and skopolamine from the seeds of the black lupus.
They took runs in the amputation to protect patients from gangrene, as well as to use pressure bands and blood pressure to inhibit blood flow.
For centuries, the Roman Empire has achieved much in the field of medicine and has influenced the knowledge we have today.
Pureland-type origami is that once allowed there is only one fold, it is not allowed to fold complexes, e.g. lifting and ejection, as well as all folds must have a smooth position.
John Smith developed it in the 1970s, trying to help people with no experience in origami or those with limited mobility.
In children, the awareness of race and racial stereotypes is growing rather early, and these stereotypes affect behaviour.
For example, children who identify themselves with a racial minority who, according to stereotypes, do not do their best at school, usually do not do well when they learn about this stereotype.
MySpace is currently the third most popular website in the United States, covering 54 million profiles.
These websites attract great attention, especially in the educational environment.
These sites have their positive aspects, including easy configuration of a classic site containing blogs, video materials, photos and other elements.
Access to this site can be obtained by using only one Internet address, which makes it easier to remember and write to students who may have problems with writing and writing on the keyboard.
This can be adjusted to make it easier to read, as well as with any or small amount of color.
The observatory group “is a neurological accident, defined by a classic symptom triad: impulse, deconcentration and overpowering or excessive energy”.
It's not a disability, it's a learning disorder that affects "from 3 to 5 per cent of children, maybe even 2 million American children".
Children with ADD have difficulty focusing on science, but they will be able to focus on what makes them happy, such as playing games or watching favorite cartoons or writing sentences without any puns.
These children tend to get into trouble, because they "take up risky behaviors, fight and undermine authority" to stimulate the brain because they can't get that stimulation through normal methods.
ADD has an impact on relationships with peers who may have problems with understanding why someone behaves in this way, why it says so, and why their level of maturity is different.
The ability to acquire knowledge and learning has changed as described above, and the change has also resulted in the pace of learning.
The relationship with information was different. The pressure was no longer in the individual memory, but more important was the ability to bring in the text.
In principle, the renaissance has significantly changed the approach to science and the dissemination of knowledge.
Unlike other primary Hominides, no longer use hands to move, carry loads or move between trees.
The hand and the foot of the chimpanzees have a similar size and length, which shows that the hand is used to carry the weight of the body when they are based on stretched fingers.
The human hand is shorter than the foot and has more simple sticks.
Rocky bones of hands two to three million years ago show how hand specialization has changed from movement to manipulation.
According to some, the occurrence of conscious dreams can lead to exhaustion.
The main reason for this phenomenon is that conscious dreams extend the time between REM stages.
If the sleep phase is less paradoxical at night, the problem becomes a low frequency of the state where you actually sleep and your body is regenerating.
It's as exhausting as waking up every 20 or 30 minutes to watch TV.
The frequency with which the brain tries to dream consciously during the night in question has an impact on the effect.
Practically from the beginning of the Italian case in North Africa, 11 British Hussaria occupied Fort Capuzzo in Libya, a week after Italy's declaration of war on June 10, 1940.

The game is played on grass, which is shorter around the tall and is called green.
Recreational tourism is probably the most common type of tourism, by the majority of people associated with travel.
Then people go to places that are completely different from what surrounds them every day to relax and play.
Beaches, theme parks and bivouac fields are usually the most popular places used by recreational tourists.
Cultural tourism means a type of tourism that is based on the knowledge of the history and culture of the places visited.
Tourists can visit different characteristics of the country or focus only on one area.
The colonists, looking at this activity, also called for meals.
The front-up teams consisted of New Hampshire's 1st and 3rd Colonels, with 200 people, led by Colonels John Stark and James Reed (both of whom were later generals).
The Commandant Stark has set itself along the border of the northern edge of the position occupied by the Colonists.
When the flood opened a free passage along the Mystic river from the north-east side of the peninsula, they quickly extended the construction of a short stone wall from the north edge on the small beach.
Gridley or Stark hit a ring about 100 feet (30 m) away from the fence and ordered not to shoot until the thrusters crossed the line.
The American plan set up coordinated attacks on three different sides.
General John Cadwalder will start a fight against the British garrison in Bordentown to block any support.
General James Ewing was about to cross the river at Trenton Ferry, along with a 700-person post-police movement team, take over the bridge over Assunpink Creek and strike down the escape of enemy armies.
The attack was made up of a unit of 2,400 armed men, who were to cross the river nine miles north of Trenton and separate themselves, creating two units, one under Greene's command, the other under Sullivan's command, to allow the attack to take place before dawn.
When the distance of the race changes from one quarter to a half mile, speed loses its significance and endurance becomes an absolute necessity.
Of course, a half-mile-drive runner that can break two minutes must have an appropriate high speed, but endurance must be taken care of at all costs.
Some winter crossing runs, combined with the training of the upper body parts in the gym, are the best preparations for the running season.
Proper nutrition does not guarantee perfect results, but can have a significant impact on the overall form of young athletes.
Maintaining a healthy energy balance, using effective watering habits and understanding the various aspects of supplementing can help athletes to improve results and increase the pleasure of sport.
The distance runs are relatively low sports, but there are many myths about several essential elements of equipment.
Products can be purchased as needed, but most of them will have a negative or zero impact on efficiency.
The athletes may feel that they prefer the product, although it does not offer any real benefits.
Atoms can be considered one of the fundamental elements of building the whole matter.
It is a very complex unit that, according to the simplified Bohr model, consists of a central core around which electrons are located, something that reminds the planets surrounding the Sun – see figure 1.1.
The nucleus consists of two types of particles: neutrons and protons.
With regard to the electrical charge, protons are positive, electrons are negative, and neutrons have no charge.
To find out what happened to the injured, you must first assess whether the event is not a threat to you.
As you approach the victim, keep an eye on her position, as well as observe the natural warning signs.

The study found that depression, fear, and pessimistic attitude were closely related to the pain and fracture of people suffering from cross pain.
Only the effects of catastrophic thinking were dependent on regular, organized weekly physical exercises, while this was not the case in the case of depression and fear.
People who engage in regular activity need more support when it comes to negative pain perception to distinguish chronic pain and discomfort from normal movement.
Vision, or ability to see, is dependent on the organs of the mind of vision, or eyes.
The structure of the eye can be very different in terms of complexity, which depends on the requirements of the body.
Different systems are characterized by different possibilities, are sensitive to different wavelengths, and vary in intensity of vision, and also require different processes to interpret input data, and an appropriate number of tools to function optimally.
The population is called a collection of organisms of a single species that inhabit a specific geographical area.
All individuals in the population with a specific phenotype are called monomorphic.
When individuals are characterized by several variants of the characteristic, they are polymorphic.
The columns of the military ants massage and lay nests in other phases as well.
In the storm phase, an army of ants masturbates at night and camps during the day.
The colony begins the cognac phase when the amount of food available has decreased. During this phase the colony creates temporary nests that are changed every day.
Every one of these cowardly raids or marches lasts for about 17 days.
What's the cell? The word is derived from the Latin "cell", which means "small room", and was stabbed by a researcher who was involved in observing the structure of the cork under the microscope.
The cell is the primary building block of all living organisms, which must contain at least one cell.
In fact, so fundamental and crucial is the role of cells in the study of life that they are often called "the elements of life".
The nervous system maintains homeostasis by sending nerve impulses to the body so that the flow of blood is not disrupted.
These nerve impulses penetrate the body at such high speeds that they help to protect them from potential danger.
Tornados hit a small area compared to other violent storms, but they can destroy everything on their way.
Tornadas extract trees, rip the boards out of the buildings and throw cars into the air. The most violent two percent of tornados lasts for more than three hours.

For many thousands of years, people have been making and using lenses to watch things grow.
But the first real telescopes were built in Europe in the late 17th century.
These telescopes used a combination of two lenses to approximate and enlarge remote objects.
Greed and selfishness will always accompany us, and the essence of cooperation is that when most benefit, acting selfishly, short-term profits will be greater.
It should be hoped that most people will open their eyes and see that cooperation with others is the best long-term option for them.
Many people dream of a day when they can travel to another star and discover other worlds; some wonder what is there, some believe that other planets inhabit strangers or other forms of life.
But if it ever happens, it's probably not for a long time.
Maybe your lawyers will ever be in a foreign world thinking about their ancient ancestors?
The animals are built from many cells, they eat things and weed them. Most animals can move.
The brain is an organ that we can only find in animals, and yet not all, for example, honeybees don't have a brain.
There's no place on earth where there's no animals, they're floating underground tunnels, they're swimming in the ocean, they're flourishing in the sky.
The cell is the smallest structural and functional unit of living organisms (things).
The root word "cell" is the Latin word "cella" meaning a small space.
Looking at living beings under the microscope, you can see that they are built from small squares or spheres.
Robert Hook, an English biologist, looked at the step below the microscope and saw small squares.
He was the first person to observe dead cells.
The elements and relationships can move from one state to another and do not change.
Nitrogen in the form of gas still has identical properties as liquid nitrogen. In liquid state it is denser, but particles are identical.
Another example is water consisting of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.
The molecular structure is identical for gas, liquids and solid bodies.
Although the state of concentration may be subject to change, the chemical composition remains unchanged.
Time is around us, it affects every action we take, and at the same time it's so hard to understand.
For thousands of years, time has been the subject of research by scholars, philosophers and theologians.
We are experiencing time as events that will pass from the future, through the present, to the past.
Time also serves us to compare the duration of events (their length in time).
You can indicate the impact of time on your own by observing the reverse of a cyclic event, which is characterized by regular repetition.
Today, computers are used to edit photos and videos.
Advanced animations can be created on your computer and are used increasingly for television and cinema.
Music is often recorded using advanced computers that process and mix sounds.
In the 19th and 20th centuries, it was long recognized that the first population of New Zealand were Maori, hunting for giant birds called moa.
According to this theory, the Maori moved the Great Fleet from Polynesia to New Zealand and took it to the people of Moriori, after which they settled as an agricultural community.
However, the latest evidence indicates that the Moriori tribe was a group of continental Maoris who moved from New Zealand to Chatham Island and developed their own peaceful culture.
There was another tribe on the island of Chatham, Maoris, who emigrated from New Zealand.
They called themselves Moriori, came to some old age, and eventually Moriori was smoothed down.
For decades now, those who have given up have made it possible for us to see the value of our blessings and our love, and on the other hand, we have been able to look honestly at the difficulties and failures.
When we heard people who told stories about their personal life, family or work, we got a lot of valuable information about the past and about personalities that had a positive or negative impact on the culture of the organization.
Although understanding its history does not imply understanding of culture, it at least helps us to understand where we are in the history of the organization.
Through the assessment of the success and awareness of the failures of individuals, as well as the entire group of participants, the values, mission and motivation of the organisation are better known.
In this case, people opened up to new changes and new directions for the local church, recalling the entrepreneurial behaviour and its success in the past.
Such stories about the successes have mitigated the concerns about change and have inspired a positive attitude towards future changes.
Methods of solving problems using different concepts or fields to find a solution called convergence thinking patterns.
Such an attitude focuses on speed, logic and accuracy, as well as identification of facts, re-use of available techniques and collection of information.
The most important element of this way of thinking: there is only one correct answer. You take into account only two answers – good and bad.
Such an understanding is linked to a particular science or standard procedures.
People with such thinking can think logically, remember patterns, solve problems and scientific tests.
People are the most capable species of reading in the minds of others.
It turns out that we can effectively predict what others see and intend, what they believe, what they know, and what they want.
The most important of these skills is the understanding of the intentions of others, as this allows for the development of possible uncertainties resulting from the actions taken.
For example, when we see someone speeding up a car, we would probably assume that he's trying to steal someone's car.
He should be judged differently if he lost the keys to the car and tried to break into his vehicle.
The MRI is based on a phenomenon called nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), discovered in the 1930s by Felix Bloch (worker at Stanford University) and Edward Purcella (worker at Harvard).
In this resonance, atoms emit delicate radio signals under the influence of magnetic field and radio waves.
In 1970, a doctor and scientist Raymond Damadian discovered how to use magnetic resonance imaging for medical diagnosis purposes.
Four years later, the patent was the first patent in the world in the field of magnetic resonance.
In 1977, Dr. Damadian completed a scan to rejuvenate the entire body's magnetic body, which he called "the Unbreakable".
Asynchronous communication gives time to think and respond to another person.
This enables students to work at their own pace and control the pace of instruction.
In addition, there are fewer time constraints, with the possibility of working in flexible hours (Bremer, 1998).
The possibility of using the Internet and the Web provides students with access to information at any time.
Students can also report questions to teachers at any time of the day and expect relatively quick answers instead of waiting for the next direct meeting.
The postmodern approach to science gives freedom from absolute truth. There is no good way to learn.
There is, in fact, not one thing that should be learned from science. Learning is a process that takes place within the context of experience in the relationship between the person who is learning and the knowledge that is presented.
This is an example of our current experience with television programs that present information, educate, teach and provide practical advice (“do the same”).
Many of us watch television programs that impart knowledge we never use and show experiences that will never become our share.
We never repair the car, we don't build a fountain in the yard, we don't go to Peru to watch ancient ruins, or we don't rebuild the neighbor's house.
Undersea connections with Europe and broadband satellite services make Greenland a good link and 93% of the population have access to the Internet.
Your hotel or host (in case of accommodation in a guesthouse or private flat) will be available with Wi-Fi or a computer connected to the Internet, and there is an Internet cafe with public Wi-Fi.
As mentioned above, although the word "Eskimos" remains accepted in the United States, people outside the Arctic, especially in Canada, consider it offensive.
Although you hear that word from the natives of Greenland, foreigners should not use it.
Greenlandians call themselves Inuits in Canada and Kalaalleq (mn.Kalaallit), or "Greenlanders" in Greenland.
Crime and evil will towards foreigners are actually unknown in Greenland. Even in cities there are no "dangerous environments".
The cold is probably the only real threat that people are not prepared to face.
If you visit Greenland in colder times of the year (the farther north, the colder).

Bags left unattended fall into the hands of thieves and draw the attention of the fear - inspiring authorities.
You've been in the house the whole time you've been in contact with local infections, so there's a great chance you're already resistant to them.
However, in these parts of the world, where there are bacteria that your body had no contact with before, you are at greater risk of problems.
What is more, when the climate is warmer, bacteria grow faster and are able to survive longer outside the body.
That's why Delhi Belly, the curse of Pharaoh, the revenge of Montuzem and their other allies.
While breathing problems occur in colder climates, in hot climates there are quite often hives, usually very succulent but non-hazardous.
If you travel for the first time to a developing country or to a new part of the world, you can experience a cultural shock.
Many regular, experienced travelers have been overcome by the ignorance of travel to developing countries, where many small cultural differences can be quickly accumulated.
Especially in the first days, it is worth getting crazy and spending money on high-quality Western-style hotels, food and services to make it easier to acclimatise.
Do not sleep on the mattress or on the floor floor in areas where the local fauna is unknown.
If you're going to brisk under the naked sky, take a hunting bed or a hammock to protect yourself from snakes, scorpions and other dangerous animals.

Maybe you'll find some simple drink that you'll prepare during your breakfast before you're exhausted from your daily duties.
If you live in a city with a diverse culture of drinking, visit bars and pubs in areas where you rarely exist.
If someone doesn't know the medical jargon, we'll inform you that "infectious" doesn't mean the same as "infectious".
Infectious disease causes pathogens, such as viruses, bacteria, fungi or other parasites.
The infectious disease is easily transmitted if we stay close to the infected person.
Vaccines for various diseases are often a requirement for governments to apply to persons arriving or leaving the country.
These requirements may often depend on which country has visited or intends to visit the traveller.
One of the great advantages of the city of Charlotte in North Carolina is a large number of high quality attractions for families.
People in other regions often say that the main reason for moving is the family climate, and tourists often think that it is easy to move with children in this city.
Over the past two decades, the number of child-friendly attractions in the city centre has increased considerably.
The families living in Charlotte do not actually use taxis, although in some circumstances this form of transport may prove useful.
More than 2 passengers are subject to a surcharge, so this may be a more expensive option than necessary.
The coolest place on Earth is Antarctica located around the south.
Tourist tours cost a lot, require good physical conditions, are only possible in the summer (from November to February) and are limited mainly to the peninsula, the island and the Ross Sea.
During the summer period, about fifty bases in these areas are inhabited by several thousand workers, but only a small number of them spend the winter here.
Central Antarctica is a densely populated plain covering between 2 and 3 km of ice.
Occasional special air trips take place deep into the ground for mountaineering purposes or to reach the runway where there is a large base.
Travelers on the south (also called motorway) is a 1,600 km-long road from McMurdo Station over the Ross Sea to the raceway.
After this snow has been killed with filled ice seals and marked flags, it can only be moved in special tractors with fuel and propeller sleep.
They are not light and returnable, so the road on the long section of the Transatlantic Mountains and leads to the plain.
The winter is mostly due to accidents on slender roads, corridors and, above all, stairs.
Well, shoes with good soles are the basis, and shoes usually slip on ice and snow in summer, and even some winter shoes may not wear.
The wheel must have properly deep cuts, 5 mm (1/5 inches) or greater, and the material must remain soft at low temperatures.
Some shoes are equipped with a wheel, and in excellent conditions there is a load with wheels suitable for most of the shoes, for wear on the back or the backrest.
The bazaars must be low and wide. The best attraction is to spread sand, sulphur or salt ( calcium chloride) on the roads and paths.
Lavins are not a typical phenomenon; because cattle trees are able to maintain only a limited amount of snow, its excess will be sufficient in the form of a lion.
The problem is that the snow is sticky, so something has to cause it to melt, and the falling snow pulls another mass of it.
Sometimes the original activator is the sun that warms snow, sometimes more snow falls, and sometimes other natural events, often man.
Tornado is a floating air column with very low pressure, attracting air to the inside and up.
They cause strong winds (often 100 to 200 miles an hour) and can carry heavy objects into the air while moving tornado.
They begin as rain clouds falling, and when they touch the earth, they become "tornads".
VPN providers (virtual private network) are an excellent way to bypass the political censorship and commercial filtering of IP addresses according to location.
They are more than mediated servers in a number of ways: they are redirecting the entire Internet traffic, not just http.
Their typical advantages are higher passability and better quality of service. Because they are encrypted, they make spying difficult.
Media companies are lying to each other when they point to "preventing piracy" as a goal.
Thus, the codes of the regions do not in any way influence illegal copying; a copy of all bits on disk will be well played on any equipment on which the original is to be played.
It is actually about more control of these companies over their markets and the generation of large profits.
The conversations are conducted by the Internet, so you do not need to use the telephone operator services located at your place of residence or in your place of travel.
Also, you do not have to get a local number from the community you live in; you can have satellite internet connections in the town of Chicken in Alaska, and choose the number assigned to the sunny Arizona.
It is often necessary to buy a separate global number to be able to receive phone calls from a public switched telephone network (PTSN). The location of the number does not make a difference for phone users.
Applications for real-time text translation – applications that can automatically translate all text segments from one language to another.
They are in this category applications that can translate foreign-language texts placed on signs or other objects in the real world when the user directs their smartphone to them.
Translation programs have improved significantly and now often offer less correct translations (unless text without meaning), but be careful because there is always the possibility of a mistake.
Google Translation is one of the most popular applications of this type and allows you to translate in offline mode after you have downloaded the required language data.
GPS navigation on the smartphone is probably the easiest and most convenient way to move abroad.
Instead of buying new maps to the GPS or the own GPS device, or instead of adding them to the car rental, you can save and purchase your own navigation.
If you do not have a data transmission on your phone or the phone is out of reach, the operation may be limited or unavailable.

Access to these services is often obtained by means of a free telephone number, which can be called free of charge from most phones.
The principles used in standard photography are the same for video recording, perhaps even to a greater extent.
If photography is forbidden, don't even think about filming it.
Before using a drone, check what you can film and what licenses and licenses are required.
Even if the regulations in force in your area do not prohibit this, drone flying in the airspace above an airport or a collection of people is generally not indicated.
Currently, air travel is rarely booked directly on the airlines, instead of first searching and comparing prices.
It seems that the same flight has very different prices depending on the flight search, so it is worth comparing different results and checking the price on the airline site before booking.
Although a short tourist or service visit does not require visas in some countries, if you come as a foreign student, you will probably stay longer.

It may also be a good way to increase the budget and allow longer stay in a place, as many volunteers offer accommodation and food, and some even a small pension.
The Vikings used Russian waterways to reach the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea. Some of these routes can still be used. Check that you do not need special permits that may be difficult to obtain.
The Baltic Sea canal runs from the Arctic Ocean to the Baltic Sea through Lake One, Lake Ladoga and St. Petersburg, using rivers and lakes.
Lake Ona is connected to the Volga Canal, so today it is possible to cross Russia, leaving the Caspian Sea.
You can be sure that once you get to the sea, the situation is pretty clear.
In general, you will hang the ads in which you offer help, walk down the docks, question people who wash their yachts, try to contact sailors in barges etc.
Try to talk to as many people as possible, and soon everyone will know you and tell you who the boats are looking for.
The Frequent Flyer programme should be carefully selected within the framework of the airline alliance.
Although you may feel that you are being influenced by intuition when choosing the airline you fly most often, you should remember that there are often different benefits offered, and points for people flying are often larger in another line of the same group.
Emirates, Etihad Airways, Qatar Airways and Turkish Airlines are airlines that have significantly expanded the offer of flights to Africa, and connections to many of the largest cities on this continent are available at more competitive prices compared to European lines.
Beginning in 2014, Turkish Airlines operates flights to 39 locations in 30 African countries.
If you have extra time to travel, check what the total cost of traveling to Africa is compared to the cost of traveling around the world.
Do not forget to take into account the additional visas, exit taxes, land transport, etc. for all places outside Africa.
If you want to fly around the world only on the southern hemisphere, the choice of flights and destinations is tied due to the lack of transatlantic routes.
No airline alliance covers all three trans-oceanic crossings on the southern hemisphere (SkyTeam does not include any of them).
However, Star Alliance does not only include the eastern part of the South Pacific, from Santiago de Chile to Tahiti, which serves LATAM Oneworld.
If you want to miss the South Pacific and the west coasts of South America, there are several other options available besides this flight (see below).
In 1994, in Azerbaijan, the Upper Carabachu region, Armenian ethnically speaking, declared war on the Azores.
With the support of the Armenian side, a new republic has been established, but no country with an established position, including Armenia, officially does not recognise it.
The diplomatic vassals of the region continue to undermine the relationship between Armenia and Azerbaijan.

Over the ages, shepherds have built houses in unparalleled, treeland, and cliffs from which the sea view extends.
Part of his spell is a lack of visible development. The villages can be reached by trails, trains and boats, but cannot reach them by cars.
The French-speaking people of Belgium and Switzerland use a slightly different language from French, but these differences do not prevent them from being understood effectively.
In particular, the numbering in the French language of Belgium and Switzerland has specific characteristics that are different from those in the French language used in France, and another is the wording of some words.
However, all French-speaking Belgians and Swiss people could learn at a standard French school and understand you if you were to use a standard French numerical system.
In many places in the world, makeup is a friendly gesture, which means "welcome".
However, in Malaysia, at least in its rural areas, this gesture means "come" and reminds us of this used in some Western countries when someone is calling for an indication – it should be used only for this purpose.
Similarly, a British tourist in Spain may mistakenly recognize the hand-to-hand of the person who is making the move (not to the one who is making it) as a gesture of return.
assistive languages are artificial or designed to facilitate communication between people who otherwise have a problem with understanding.
They are something other than the French language, which are natural or organic languages, dominant for various reasons as a means of communication between users of different languages.
During the days of fire, tourists can experience mirrors that look like water (or other things).
It can be dangerous if the traveler follows the mirror, losing valuable energy and the rest of the water.
Even in the hottest deserts in the night can be very cold. Hypothermia is a real risk if there are no warm clothes.
By entering the rain forest, you must be careful of mosquitoes, especially in summertime.
When you drive a car through a subtropical rain forest and open the vehicle door for a few seconds while sitting, the mosquitoes are enough to become your passengers.
Avian influenza (called a pheasant influenza) can cause both birds and mammals to become infected.
A few thousand cases have been observed among humans, but some have proved fatal.
Most of the cases involved poultry workers, but birds are also at risk.
The characteristics of Norway are fiord trees and valleys, which suddenly turn violently into high, fairly flat trees.
These flats are often called "vidde" – this means a wide, endless space without trees.
In Rogaland and Agder, they are usually referred to as "hei", which means woodless deserts, often explained by ravens.
Icebergs are not real estate, they float from the top, and this causes cracks and cracks to arise, which can be covered by snow bridges.
The walls and ceiling of the ice cave may fall, and the locks may fall.
On the edge of the icebergs, large blocks are obliterated, falling and may be moving away from their edges.
The tourist season at the mountain stations usually reaches its peak during the baby's summer.
