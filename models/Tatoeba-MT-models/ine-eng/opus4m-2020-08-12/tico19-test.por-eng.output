Cumulative rate of rapid progressive incidence of coronary disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, 1 January to 15 March 2020
The cumulative incidence of coronary disease (COVID-19) shows similar trends in the countries of the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, confirming that, although it is in a different stage depending on the country, the COVID-19 pandemic is moving rapidly across all countries.
Based on the experience of Italy, countries, hospitals and ICUs should prepare themselves more for an exit of patients with COVID-19 who will need care and, above all, intensive treatment.
On 31 December 2019, a number of cases of unknown etiology pneumonia were reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 9 January 2020, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention of China informed the causing agent as being a new coronavirus, now referred to as coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection has been called coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
The evidence to date is that 80% of people with COVID-19 develop a mild form of the disease, that is, an infection of respiratory treatment with or without pneumonia, and most of them recover.
In about 14% of cases, COVID-19 evolves into a more serious disease, requiring hospitalization, while 6% of remaining cases evolve into a critical disease, requiring intensive treatment.
The mortality of hospitalized patients due to COVID-19 is 4%.
In this study, we evaluated trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in each country of the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and in the United Kingdom and compared them with those of the Province of Hubei, China.
We also compared the current number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom with Italy between 31 January and 15 March 2020.
Cases of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom
After China, the COVID-19 spread geographically, and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world are now following that country.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a pandemic.
On 5 March 2020, Spiteri et al. reported the first cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Europe, in accordance with the WHO case definition.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020 in people returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 15 March 2020, the cases of COVID-19 had already been detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom, and between 31 December 2019 and the date mentioned above 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths had been reported, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths only in Italy.
Obtaining cumulative numbers and cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases
At the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the number of reported cases of COVID-19 in each country of the world, obtained only from official sources, such as the Ministry of Health of the countries, national and regional health authorities and WHO, is updated every day at 8 p.m.
These data were used to assess the trends of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom, and to compare them with those of Italy.
As an approach to the prevalence of active cases of COVID-19, we calculated the cumulative truncated incidence of 14 days of COVID-19 cases, taking into account, therefore, the natural evolution of COVID-19 in each EU/EEA country and the United Kingdom during the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also presented the cumulative number of cases notified by each country by 15 March 2020 at 8 p.m. and compared it with Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Trends in COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom
Trends in the cumulative truncated incidence of 14 days of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom in general followed those of the Province of Hubei, China (Figure 1).
In general, for the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 began to increase around 21 February and then significantly increased around 28 February 2020 (additional material).
This was mainly due to the rapid increase in cases reported in Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom have shown similar increases in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 (additional material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom compared with Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
It notes that, by 15 March at 8h, 15 other EU/EEA and the United Kingdom had already reported a total number of cases equivalent to Italy 3 weeks ago.
Our results indicate that the number of notified cases of COVID-19 is increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom.
The trends observed in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 suggest that the pandemic is progressing at a similar rate in all countries.
This occurs despite the fact that countries are in different stages, variations in the actions of national public health systems and possibly different definitions of cases in countries and different protocols for the selection of patients to be tested for confirmation of COVID-19, including testing for updating.
In early March 2020, doctors in affected regions of Italy described a situation in which 10% of patients with COVID-19 needed intensive treatment, and the media reported that hospitals and intensive treatment units in those regions had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on hospitalization by COVID-19 in a hospital and/or ICU are currently available at EU/EEA level for only 6% and 1% of cases, respectively (data not shown).
However, they should be collected in a systematic way to complement current surveillance data with focus on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
A study conducted between 2010 and 2011 showed a huge variation in the availability of ICU beds and semi-intensive units in Europe, ranging from 29.2 beds in Germany to 4.2 beds in Portugal for every 100,000 people.
This means that countries can have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 beds of ICU and semi-intensive treatment for a population of 100,000 between 2010 and 2011).
Model scenarios related to the saturation of the health system, with estimates for each EU/EEA country and for the United Kingdom of the prevalence of COVID-19 hospitalization cases associated with a risk greater than 90% of the capacity for intensive treatment beds, are provided in the sixth update of the ECDC rapid risk assessment on COVID-19.
In view of the fact that cases have so far been concentrated in certain regions of the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom, and hospitals and intensive treatment units generally serve a defined regional population, information on cases and intensive treatment beds should preferably be made available in the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistical Purposes 2 (NUTS-2).
The example of Italy and trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly progressing in the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom.
Countries, hospitals and ICUs should therefore prepare for a sustained Community transmission scenario of SARS-CoV-2 and for an increase in the number of patients with COVID-19 who will need medical care, mainly intensive treatment, as is the case in the affected regions of Italy.
As highlighted in the rapid risk assessment of ECDC, a quick, proactive and comprehensive approach is essential to delay the spread of SARS-CoV-2, with a change in the retention approach to a mitigation approach, as the rapid increase in the number of cases may not provide sufficient time for decision-makers and hospitals to understand, accept and adapt their actions appropriately, if not implemented in advance.
The rapid risk assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the epidemic.
There is a small window of opportunity during which countries have the opportunity to intensify their control initiatives to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the pressure on the health system.
If these initiatives fail, it is likely that the health systems of other EU/EEA countries will have a range of patients who will need intensive treatment in the coming days or weeks.
The 2019 coronary disease epidemic (COVID-19), caused by the coronary 2 (SARS-CoV-2) disease of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), has already killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 in China and the rest of the world, resulting in a population catastrophe.
Similar to your homologous virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 could also be transmitted from the bites and cause similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has less severity and mortality than SARS, but it is much more communicative, and affects older people than young people, and more men than women.
In response to the rapid increase in the number of publications on the new disease, this article seeks to provide a current and comprehensive evaluation of the research object, which is being developed rapidly.
We will discuss the basic principles of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and disease prevention.
Although many questions still require answers, we hope that this study will help understand and eradicate this hostile disease.
The Spring Festival on 25 January 2020 became a unique and unforgettable memory for all Chinese who were forced to stay confined throughout the holiday and for several weeks thereafter due to the epidemic of a new viral disease.
The virus is very similar to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore it was called SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020, and its disease was called CoV-19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China, and spread rapidly throughout the country and almost 50 other countries around the world.
By 2 March 2020, the virus had resulted in more than 80,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases, with more than 40,000 recovered patients and more than 3,000 dead patients.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is the "public enemy number one", and is potentially more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 articles were published on COVID-19, including its virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, since the first report on 7 January 2020, which determined the sequence of the isolated virus of several patients.
This article seeks to summarize the progress of research in this new area of rapid development.
Whenever relevant, we will compare COVID-19 to SARS and the other disease caused by CoV, the respiratory syndrome of the Middle East (MERS, an epidemic of 2012).
We will also discuss what we have learned so far about the prevention and prognosis of the disease, as well as other urgent issues.
CoVs are traditionally considered non-lethal pathogens to humans, mainly causing about 15% of the common colds.
However, in this century, we found two highly pathogenic human coVs, which are SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, causing an epidemic originating in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and which then spread to several other countries with fearsome morbidity and mortality.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 is the third COV epidemic in the documented history of the human being.
As demonstrated in Fig. Fig. 1.1, a portion of cases of pneumonia with unknown origins was initially reported in Wuhan on 31 December 2019 to the National Health Commission of China.
Seven days later, the sequence of the CoV was published.
On 15 January 2020, Wuhan’s first fatal case was reported.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly to neighboring cities, provinces and countries.
On 20 January, the health professionals' contagion was reported, suggesting that transmission between people was possible.
On 23 January, the city of Wuhan was confined, with all its public transportation interrupted.
On 24 January, the first clinical study on the disease reported that 41 patients with confirmed cases only 21 had direct contact with the Wuhan sea fruit market, which was considered the starting point of the infection by an unknown animal source.
On January 30, WHO declared the epidemic a global health emergency.
Until the time of this report, the disease has already spread through China and almost 50 other countries around the world (Fig. (Fig.2).2).
Since the situation is rapidly worsening, the size and the final severity of the epidemic should still be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a study of several centres with 8,866 patients, including 4,021 patients confirmed with COVID-19, presented a more up-to-date illustration of the epidemic, as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-COV-2 infected people of all ages, mainly in the 30 to 65 age group.
Almost half (47.7%) of the infected were over 50 years of age, some were under 20 years of age, and only 14 were under 10 years of age.
SARS-CoV-2 infected more men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
The COVID-19 spread in groups, mainly in Hubei and its surroundings.
COVID-19 received an average of 5 (2 to 9) days for the diagnosis based on the onset of symptoms.
The mean incubation period was 4.8 (3.0 to 7.2) days.
The mean time of death based on the onset of symptoms was 9.5 (4.8 to 13) days.
The basic number of reproduction (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51 to 4.05) and the adjusted R0 was 2.23 to 4.82.
The number of infected persons increased exponentially before January 23, 2020, corresponding to the mass transport time before the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality rate of patients in confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10% to 1.86%), and the adjusted mortality rate of all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02% to 4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 are gender (male), age (over 60 years) and severe pneumonia.
CoVs are a subfamily of large and encapsulated viruses that contain a single chain of RNA with a certain meaning.
They can be divided into four genres: alpha, beta, gamma and delta, of which it is known that alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses infect human beings.
The glycoprotein spike (S) of the envelope binds to its cell receptors of the angiotensin convertor enzyme 2 (ECA2) and dipeptidel peptidase 4 (DPP4) for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, and subsequently the fusion of membranes occurs.
The viral RNA genome is released in cytoplasm; after the replication of the viral genome, the genomic RNA accompanied by encapsulated glycoproteins and nucleocapside proteins form vesiculars containing viruses, which join the plasma membrane and release the virus.
The first sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 genome was reported on 10 January 2020.
It was discovered that SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of betacoronavirus with more than 99.98% of genetic identity among 10 sequential samples collected from the same original place of exit, the Huaan Sea Fruit Market, in Wuhan.
SARS-COV-2 is genetically more similar to SARS-COV than MERS-COV.
Through the electronic microscope of transmission, the SARS-CoV-2 particles were discovered in ultrafine sections of the human airway epithelium.
It was discovered that human ECA2 is a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, as well as SARS-CoV.
However, SARS-CoV-2 S protein binds to ECA2 human protein in a weaker way than SARS-CoV protein, which coincides with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes a less severe infection in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short protein encoded by orf3b and a secreted protein encoded by orf8.
SARS-CoV-2 orf3b can play a role in viral pathogenicity and inhibit IFNβ expression; however, the orf8 does not contain any known domain or functional reason.
On 18 February 2020 Zhou, et al., reported the cryo-EM structure of the ECA2 of total human length to the resolution of 2.9 Å in a complex with the carrier of amino acids B0AT1.
It was discovered that the complex, which had open and closed compositions, was grouped as a dimer, and the ECA2-B0AT1 complex can combine two S proteins, which provides evidence for recognition and infection by CoV.
B0AT1 can become a therapeutic target for drug screening to eliminate SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The host of origin and the intermediary
It is known that both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated from the bites and were transmitted to human beings by means of civets and camels, respectively.
Through a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, mosquitoes were considered native hosts of SARS-CoV-2, since the new virus is 96% identical to two CoVs of mosquitoes similar to SARS called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, the intermediary host who helped the virus cross the barriers of the species and infect human beings remains unknown, and the transmission route still needs to be discovered.
Ji, et al., suggests that cobras transport the mosquito virus to human beings, which involved a homologous recombination in protein S.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, suggested that pangolins, long-range focin mammals that feed on ants and are frequently used in traditional Chinese medicine are the potential intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2, based on the genetic homology of 99% between a coV discovered in pangolins and SARS-CoV-2.
However, a 1% difference in two genomes is a great difference; therefore, final results for concrete evidence are being expected (Fig. (Fig. 33).
The physical-chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are largely unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days below 20 °C with a moisture of 40% to 50%.
SARS-COV-2 may have similar properties.
SARS-CoV-2 was reported to be sensitive to ultraviolet rays and to the heat of 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, ethanol 75%, disinfectant with chlorine, peracetic acid, chloroformium and other organic solvents, but not chlorhexidine, are effective in deactivation of the virus.
In general, the entire human population has no immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore susceptible to the new virus.
Currently, no detailed study was reported in relation to the immunological response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only consult previous studies on other CoVs, mainly on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig. (Figure 4).
In general, after a virus invades the host, it is first recognized by the host's immune system through standard-recognition receptors (PRRs), including type C lectine receptors, type Toll receptor (TLR), type NOD receptor (NLR) and type RIG-I receptor (RLR).
Through different routes, the virus induces the expression of inflammatory factors, the maturation of dendritic cells and the synthesis of I-type interferons (IFNs), which limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the phagocytosis of macrophages of viral antigens.
However, SARS-CoV protein N may help the virus escape from immune responses.
In a short time, the adaptive immune response joins in the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in defense.
T CD4+ cells stimulate cells B to produce virus-specific antibodies, and T CD8+ cells directly kill cells infected by the virus.
Working T cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines to help defend cells.
However, CoV can inhibit the functions of T cells by inducing the apoptosis of T cells.
Humor immunity, including supplements such as antibodies C3a and C5a, is also essential for combating viral infection.
For example, isolated antibodies from a recovered patient neutralized the MRS-CoV.
On the other hand, an exacerbated reaction of the immune system generates a large number of local free radicals that can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs and, in the worst case scenario, multiple organ failure, and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by the occurrence of symptoms in a group of people, affects the elderly with comorbidities and pregnant women.
It is common that people exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune system is compromised have a greater chance of being infected than other people.
The estimated mean incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1 to 14 days and, most of the time, 3 to 7 days, based on a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study on 1,099 cases shows that the incubation period was 3 days, on average, and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as described above, showed that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0 to 7.2) days, based on the demographic of 8,866 cases.
It is essential that health authorities adjust the effective quarantine time based on the most accurate incubation period, thus preventing infected people who do not have symptoms from transmitting the virus to other people.
As a current practice, individuals exposed to or infected by the virus usually need to remain in quarantine for 14 days.
Should the quarantine period be extended for 24 days?
The fever is usually the initial and main symptom of COVID-19, which may come alone or accompanied by other symptoms, such as dry cough, lack of air, muscle pain, vertigo, headache, throat pain, chorus, chest pain, diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients had dyspnoea and/or hypoxemia one week after the onset of symptoms of the disease.
In severe cases, patients rapidly evolved to acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy.
Patients with respiratory and/or acute symptoms, even without abnormalities in the diagnosis of the lung image, should undergo screening for the virus in order to receive an early diagnosis.
A demographic study at the end of December 2019 showed that the percentage of symptoms was 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for dyspnea and 3% for diarrhoea; 8% of patients needed ventilation support.
Similar results were reported in two recent studies of a family group and a group with transmission of an asymptomatic individual.
In comparison, a demographic study in 2012 showed that patients with MRS-CoV also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and dyspnea (55%) as main symptoms.
However, 80% of the patients needed ventilation support, much more than the patients in COVID-19, which consisted of the highest mortality of COVID-19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and throat pain (21%) were also observed in patients with MERS.
In patients with SARS, it was demonstrated that the fever (99% to 100%), dry cough (29% to 75%), dyspnea (40% to 42%), diarrhoea (20% to 25%) and throat pain (13% to 25%) were the main symptoms, and ventilation support was needed for approximately 14% to 20% of patients.
Until February 14th, the mortality of COVID-19 was 2%, when the confirmed cases in the world reached 66,576.
Comparatively, the mortality of SARS until November 2002 was 10% of the 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MRS, based on a June 2012 demographic study, mortality was 37% of the 2,494 confirmed cases.
One recent study reported that the baseline R0 reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2 was up to 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval (IC), 5.71 to 7.23, while the SARS-CoV R0 ranged from 2 to 4, only.
A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MRS-CoV and SARS-CoV with respect to its symptoms, mortality and R0 is presented in Table 1.1.
The figures above suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a greater propagation capacity than MRS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but is less lethal than those last two.
Therefore, it is a much greater challenge to control the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic than the MRS-CoV and SARS-CoV epidemic.
Symptoms appear in a group of people usually occur in the same family or in the same agglomeration or vehicle, as a cruise ship.
Patients usually have travel history or residency in Wuhan or other affected areas, or contact with individuals or patients infected within two weeks prior to symptoms.
However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus for more than two weeks without symptoms, and the cured patients who have received high blood pressure from hospitals can counter the virus again, which generates an alarm to prolong the quarantine period.
Patients have a normal or reduced number of white blood cells (mainly lymphocytes) in the initial stage.
For example, lymphopenia with white blood cell count below 4 x 109/L including lymphocyte count below 1 x 109/L, and high levels of aminotransferase and viremia aspartate were detected in 1,099 patients with COVID-19.
The levels of enzymes and myoglobins in the muscles and liver were increased in the blood of some patients, and the C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation were increased in the blood of most patients.
In patients with severe cases, the level of dimero-D, a product of blood fibrin degradation, was high, and lymphocyte count presented a progressive reduction.
chest radiographic abnormalities are present in most patients with COVID-19, and present bilateral irregular shadows or dark-glass opacity in the lungs.
Patients generally developed atypical pneumonia, acute lung damage and acute respiratory discomfort syndrome (SDRA).
When SDRA occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation and progressive fibrosis seriously compromise the exchange of gases.
The dysfunction of Type I and Type II pneumonia decreases the surfactant level and increases the surface tension, thus reducing the capacity of the lungs to expand, and increasing the risk of pulmonary collapse.
Therefore, the most serious results of chest radiography generally correspond to the most serious form of the disease.
On 18 February 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 demonstrated the decomposition of pneumatics, the formation of the hyalin membrane, the infiltration of interstitial lymphocytes and sincial cells into the lungs of a patient who died of the disease, which is consistent with the pathology of viral infection and the SDRA, and similar to the pathology of patients with SARS and MRS.
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA through polymerase chain reaction – reverse transcriptase (RT-PCR) was used as the main criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high rate of false negatives, which may accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations began to be used for the diagnosis (which became not derived only from RT-PCR) in China on 13 February 2020.
A similar situation also occurred with the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, a combination of the history of the disease, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and radiological results is essential and essential to an effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, the Feng Zhang group described a protocol of use of the SHERLOCK technique, based on CRISPR, to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detects synthetic fragments of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in 20 x 10-18 mol/L to 200 x 10-18 mol/L (10 to 100 copies per microlitre of input) using a measuring rod in less than one hour, without the need for a complex instrumentation.
We hope that the new technique can dramatically increase sensitivity and convenience, if verified in clinical samples.
Due to the lack of experience with the new CoV, physicians may provide palliative treatment for patients with COVID-19, while trying a variety of therapies that were used or previously proposed for the treatment of other CoVs such as SARS-CoV and MERS-COV and other viral diseases (Table 2).
These therapies include current and potential treatments with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma of cured patients, Chinese medicine and psychological support.
Up to the plasma of patients who recovered was suggested as treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are running against time to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs at the beginning and probably also attacks, to a lesser extent, other organs with ECA2 expression, such as the gastrointestinal system and kidneys.
However, respiratory dysfunction and organ failure are the main threats to patients and the main causes of death.
Therefore, respiratory support is essential to relieve symptoms and save lives, and includes general oxygenation therapy, high flow oxygenation, non-invasive ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need to receive extrabody membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a modified cardiopulmonary alternative technique used to treat severe heart failure or respiratory failure.
In addition, the maintenance of electrolyte balance, the prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shock, and the protection of the functions of vital organs are also essential for patients with SARS-CoV-2.
Cytokine cascade is known to result from an exacerbated immune system reaction in patients with SARS and MERS.
The cytokine cascade is a form of systemic inflammatory response characterized by the release of a series of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce the cells of the immune system to release a large number of free radicals, which are the main cause of SDRA and multiple organ failure.
Immunosuppression is essential in the treatment of cytokine cascades, mainly in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody, are being used to treat cytokine cascade.
Other immunosuppression treatments for cytokine cascade include modulation of the immune response to T cells; IFN-y block, IL-1 and TNF; JAK inhibition, blinatumomab; cytokines 4 suppressor; and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, such as immunosuppressants, were widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, high-dose steroids were not beneficial for severe pulmonary injury in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
They may cause serious side effects, mainly avascular osteonecrosis, affecting the prognosis dramatically.
However, short treatment periods with corticosteroids at low to moderate doses were recommended for careful use in patients with severe COVID-19 patients.
At the time this article is written, no effective antiviral therapy was confirmed.
However, intravenous administration with remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue, was found to be effective in an American patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a new antiviral drug developed by Gilead, originally intended to treat diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg viruses.
Subsequently, remdesivir also demonstrated a possible inhibition of other simple tape RNA viruses, including the MRS and SARS viruses.
Based on this, Gilead has provided the compound for China to perform some tests in individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results are being very expected.
In addition, baricitinib, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin were suggested as potential therapies for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse reactions may occur after combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of these treatments with other drugs used in patients should be closely monitored.
Plasma of cured patients and antibody generation
The blood collection of patients who have been cured of a contagious disease to treat other patients suffering from the same disease, or to protect healthy individuals from contraction of the disease has a long history.
In fact, the treated patients usually have a relatively high level of antibodies in the blood against the pathogen.
Antibodies are an immunoglobulin (lg) produced by B lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other foreign bodies, and they recognize unique molecules in the pathogens and neutralize them directly.
Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients treated with COVID-19 and was injected into 10 patients in severe condition.
Its symptoms improved within 24 hours, with reduced inflammation and viral load, and improved oxygen saturation in the blood.
However, verification and elucidation are necessary in order to propose the wide use of the method before the development of specific therapies.
In addition, given the therapeutic effects, some plasma-related disadvantages should be considered with caution.
For example, antibodies can excessively stimulate immune response and cause cytokines release syndrome, which is potentially fatal toxicity.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and the demand for plasma is great to treat patients in severe condition.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies with sufficient speed to combat a global epidemic.
Therefore, it is more important and practical to isolate cells B of cured patients and identify the genetic codes that encode effective antibodies or make a screening for effective antibodies against essential virus proteins.
In this way, we can quickly increase the production of antibodies.
Traditional Chinese Medicine, MTC, has been used for thousands of years to treat a variety of diseases in China.
However, its effects depend enormously on a combination of multiple components in a formula that varies depending on the diagnosis of a disease based on MTC theories.
Most effective components remain unknown, or are vague, since it is difficult to extract and verify these components or their optimal combinations.
Currently, due to the lack of specific and effective therapies for COVID-19, MTC has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild or moderate symptoms, or for patients who recovered from severe stages of the disease.
For example, it was found that Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules are effective in treating COVID-19.
The best treatment rates for patients with COVID-19 were observed in several provinces in China that used MTC in 87% of patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), while Hubei Province, which used MTC in only about 30% of patients with COVID-19, obtained the lowest treatment rate (13%).
However, this is a difficult comparison, since many impact factors, such as the number of patients and the severity of the disease, should be included in the evaluation.
On 18 February 2020, Boli Zhang and his workmates published a comparative study between the exclusive treatment with Western medicine and the combined treatment of Western medicine with MTC.
It was found that the time needed for the recovery of body temperature, for the disappearance of symptoms and hospitalization were significantly lower in the group treated by Western medicine and the MTC than only in the group treated by Western medicine.
The worst rate of symptoms (from mild to severe) was significantly lower for the group treated by Western medicine and the MTC than for the group treated only by Western medicine (7.4% versus 46.2%), and mortality was lower in the group treated by Western medicine and the MTC than in the group treated only by Western medicine (8.8% versus 39%).
However, the effectiveness and safety of the MTC are still waiting for more properly controlled tests on larger scales and in more centres.
It would also be useful to characterize the mechanisms of action and to explain the effective components of the MTC treatments or their combinations, if possible.
Patients confirmed with COVID-19 or suspected of the disease generally feel a great fear of the highly contagious disease and can be fatal, and people in quarantine also feel understood, lonely and irritated.
In addition, the symptoms of infection, such as fever, hypoxia and cough, as well as adverse effects of treatments, such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids, may increase anxiety and psychological suffering.
In the initial phase of the SARS epidemic, several psychiatric morbidities, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor excitement, symptoms of psychosis, delirium and even suicidal tendencies were reported.
The tracking of contacts and the mandatory quarantine, as part of the public health system's actions against the COVID-19 epidemic, can make people more anxious, and they may feel guilty about the effects of the infection, the quarantine, and the stigma imposed on their families and friends.
Mental health care should therefore be provided to patients with COVID-19, to people suspected of the disease and to people who had contact with them, as well as to the general population, who are in need.
Psychological support should include the establishment of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear communication with regular and accurate updates on the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and treatment plans, and the use of professional devices and applications to avoid direct contact between people.
Effective vaccines are essential to interrupt the transmission chain of animal reservoirs and people infected with susceptible hosts, and they are generally complementary to antiviral treatment in the control of outbreaks caused by emerging viruses.
Initiatives were taken to develop S-based vaccines to generate powerful and durable neutralising antibodies and/or protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
Vaccines were evaluated in animal models for SARS.
However, the in vivo efficacy of these vaccine candidates in older individuals and the models of fatal challenge and their protection against zoonotic virus infection still need to be determined before a clinical study is started.
This is probably due to the fact that SARS has disappeared for 17 years and no new cases have been reported since then.
On the other hand, sporadic cases and focusses of MRS continue to occur in the Middle East and spread to other regions, due to the persistence of zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
Vaccination strategies were developed for MRS using inactive viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and recombinant protein subunits, and some have been evaluated in animal models.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immune individuals is an urgent and essential task for the control of the current epidemic.
However, it is a challenge to overcome the difficulty due to the long period (18 months, on average) necessary for the development of a vaccine and the variations in the dynamics of the CoVs.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has just begun to manifest its complete clinical evolution, reaching thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients recovered gradually without sequelae.
However, in the same way as SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, building a predictive model for the disease is essential for health agencies to prioritise their services, especially in areas with scarce resources.
Based on the clinical studies reported so far, the following factors may affect or be associated with the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 (Table 33):
Age: age was the most important factor for SARS prognosis, which is also valid for COVID-19.
COVID-19 affects mainly people between 30 and 65 years of age, with 47.7% of patients over 50 years of age, in a study of 8,866 cases, as described above.
Patients who needed intensive treatment were more likely to have underlying comorbidities and complications, and were significantly older than patients who did not need intensive treatment (with mean age 66 years versus 51 years), suggesting that age is a prognosis factor for the health outcome of patients with COVID-19.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 infected more men than women (0.31/100,000 men and 0.27/100,000 women), as described above.
Comorbidities and complications: patients with COVID-19 who need intensive treatment are more likely to suffer acute cardiac injury or arrhythmia.
Cardiac episodes were the main cause of death in patients with SARS.
It was reported that SARS-CoV-2 can also join positive ECA2 colangiocytes, which may lead to hepatic dysfunction in patients with COVID-19.
It is important to note that age and underlying diseases have strong correlation and may interfere with each other.
abnormal laboratory results: the level of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or injury in the tissue and was proposed as a potential prognosis factor for the disease, response to therapy and final recovery.
The correlation of the CRP level with the severity and prognosis of COVID-19 was also proposed.
In addition, elevated lactate hydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatine kinase (CK) may also help in predicting the result.
These enzymes are expressly present in several organs, mainly in the heart and liver, and are released during tissue damage.
Thus, they are traditional markers for cardiac or hepatic dysfunction.
Main clinical symptoms: chest radiography and temporary progression of clinical symptoms should be considered together with other issues for predicting the outcomes/complications of COVID-19.
Use of steroids: as described above, steroids are usually immunosuppressants used as adjunct therapy for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Given that a high dose of corticosteroids was widely used in patients with severe SARS, many survivors suffered from avascular osteonecrosis, with permanent incapacitation and low quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used at a low dose and for a short period in patients with COVID-19.
Psychological stress: as described above, during the epidemic of COVID-19, many patients suffer from high stress, as they go through long periods of quarantine and uncertainty, and testify to the death of loved members of the family and other patients.
It is essential to provide psychological advice and lasting support to help these patients recover from stress and restore normal life.
According to demographic studies so far, COVID-19 seems to have different epidemiological characteristics of SARS.
In addition to replication in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can be replicationd efficiently in the upper respiratory tract and does not cause symptoms at the initial stage of infection (or cause only mild symptoms), similar to other coVs that cause common colds.
Therefore, patients infected in the initial phase or incubation period may produce a large amount of the virus during their daily activities, causing a great difficulty in controlling the epidemic.
However, it was considered that the transmission of SARS-CoV occurs when patients are severely ill, with most of the transmissions not occurring in the initial phase.
Therefore, the current epidemic of COVID-19 is much more severe and difficult to control than the SARS epidemic.
Major efforts are currently being made in China, including the limitation of Wuhan and neighboring cities, and the continuing quarantine of almost the entire population, in the hope of interrupting the transmission of SARS-COV-2.
Although these actions have dramatically affected the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new patients is decreasing, indicating the remission of the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimate is that the epidemic ends by March, and the deceleration phase lasts between 3 and 4 months.
However, other specialists are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter, et al., estimated that COVID-19, which appears to be significantly more infectious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., established a model to predict the outcome of the epidemic and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 can infect two thirds of the world's population.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the throat and the mean cornet smear of patients who recovered and received high from the hospital in the previous 2 weeks, indicating that the newly identified virus may become a cyclic episode similar to influenza.
However, promising indications occurred in China on the basis of the decline in the number of new cases, indicating that the current strategies could be working.
Originally, Ebola was expected to cause up to a million cases, with half a million deaths.
However, with the quarantine and rigid isolation, the disease was kept under control, at last.
It is possible that SARS-CoV-2, in the same way as SARS-CoV, can become weaker as regards its infectivity and, at some point, become a less pathogenic virus coexistant with human beings.
A comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with the SARS and the MRS is below (Fig. (Fig.55)).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible by cough and breath and possibly by direct contact with virus contaminated materials.
The virus was also found in faeces, which creates a new possibility: the oral-feecal transmission.
A recent study of 138 cases reported that 41% of cases were possibly caused by nosocomial infections, including 17 patients with underlying diseases and 40 health professionals.
Therefore, greater caution should be taken to protect people, especially health professionals, social workers, family members, workmates and people with direct contact with patients or infected individuals.
The first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is the use of facial masks; the use of surgical masks and N95 breathing masks (series No. 1860s) helps control the spread of the virus.
Surgical facial masks prevent fluid drops of a potentially infected individual from being transported in the air or being attached to the surfaces of the objects, where other people can be infected.
However, only the N95 masks (series No. 1860s) protect against the inhalation of viruses of 10 nm to 80 nm, with only 5% of the viruses being able to penetrate it completely; SARS-COV-2 is similar to SARS-COV in size, and the two have approximately 85 nm.
Since the particles can penetrate up to five surgical masks together, health professionals in direct contact with patients should use the N95 masks (series No. 1860s), but not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health professionals should use insulation clothing to further reduce contact with the virus.
Viruses also infect an individual through the eyes.
On 22 January 2020, a doctor was infected by SARS-CoV-2, although he was using a N95 mask; the virus could have entered his body through his flaming eyes.
Therefore, health professionals should also use transparent facial shields or protective glasses when caring for patients.
For the general public in affected or potentially affected areas, it is highly recommended that all hands wash with disinfectant soap more frequently than normal, try to stay home in isolation and limit contact with potentially infected people.
A meter is considered an appropriate distance to stay away from a patient.
These actions are effective methods to reduce the risk of infection, as well as to prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-COV-2 has emerged as a new virus for human beings, its high homology to SARS-COV, as reported on 7 January 2020, should have caused a great alarm to China, based on its recent history with the SARS epidemic in 2003.
However, on 19 January 2020 only the director of the Wuhan Disease Control Centre calmed the citizens, saying that the new virus has a low rate of infection and limited reproductiveity among humans, and that it was not difficult to prevent and contain the disease.
This message left the most relaxed people, especially when the whole country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and the critical period for the retention of the disease in Wuhan on a minimum scale was lost.
Disease control agencies in China can benefit from this hard lesson and make crucial improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies should: (1) be more cautious when making public statements, since everything they say is absorbed by citizens and can influence their attitudes and decisions; (2) be more sensitive and responsive to unusual information from hospitals rather than waiting for formal communications from doctors and authorities; (3) be more restrictive to contain a potential epidemic in their initial stage, rather than trying to comfort the public; and (4) issue more frequently targeted and effective simulations to increase public awareness of epidemic diseases and test and improve the system of society's response periodically.
The outbreak of COVID-19 caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus began at the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, it spread throughout China and nearly 50 other countries around the world, at the time of writing this text.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV, and the symptoms are also similar between COVID-19 and SARS, the epidemic of COVID-19 generated a feeling of return from SARS.
However, there are significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are essential for the retention of the epidemic and the treatment of patients.
COVID-19 affects the elderly more than the young, and the men more than the women, and the severity and rate of mortality are also higher in the elderly than in the young.
SARS has greater mortality than COVID-19 (10.91% versus 1.44%).
Patients with COVID-19 transmit the virus when they do not have symptoms, while patients with SARS usually transmit it when they are severely ill, which creates a greater difficulty in containing the spread of COVID-19 than of SARS.
This explains, in part, because SARS-CoV-2 spreads much faster and affects more regions than SARS-CoV.
Regular RNA testing for SARS-CoV-2 may be negative in some patients with COVID-19.
On the other hand, cured patients can receive a positive test for the virus again.
These results dramatically increase the risk of virus spread.
Given the rapid progress in the research on COVID-19, a number of crucial issues still need to be resolved, as follows:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although a 96% genetic homologous has been found between SARS-CoV-2 and two coVs of bats similar to SARS, we still cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats.
What animal was the intermediate species that transmitted the virus from the original host, from the bite, let's say, to humans?
Without knowing the answers to questions Nos 1 and 2, we cannot cut the transmission efficiently, and the epidemic can have a recurrence at any time.
Although molecular modelling and biochemical tests have shown that SARS-CoV-2 joins the ECA2, how exactly does the virus enter the respiratory tract cells and cause subsequent pathological changes?
Does the virus also bind to ECA2-expressed cells in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot obtain a rapid and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How is the virus developing genetically during the transmission between humans?
Will it become a global pandemic, will it disappear like SARS or will it have a seasonal recurrence, like flu?
It is essential, but it may take some time to search for answers to the above questions and to so many others.
However, regardless of the effort required, we have no choice but not to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and return to our normal lives.
Zoonotic origins of human coronavirus
The mutation and adaptation boosted the co-evolution of the coronavirus (CoVs) and its hosts, including human beings, for thousands of years.
Before 2003, it was known that two human coVs (HCoVs) caused a mild disease, such as a common cold.
The epidemics of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) changed what was thought of the CoVs and revealed how deadly and devastating HCV infection can be.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China at the end of 2019 again highlighted the CoVS and surprised all with its high transmissibility and reduced pathogenicity compared to its brother SARS-CoV.
HCoV infection is zoonotic, and understanding the zoonotic origins of HCOVs is of enormous benefit.
Most of the HCVs came from bats, in which they are non-pathogenic.
The intermediate reservation hosts of some HCVs are also known.
The identification of animal hosts has direct implications for the prevention of diseases in human beings.
The investigation of the interaction of the host of the COV in animals can also provide important information on the pathogenesis of the COV in human beings.
In this study, we present a general view of the existing information about the seven HCVs, with a focus on the history of their discovery, as well as their zoonotic origins and interspective transmission.
An important analysis is that we make comparison and contrast between different HCVs from a perspective of the evolution of the virus and the recombination of the genome.
The current epidemic of the disease by CoV 2019 (COVID-19) is discussed in this context.
Moreover, the requirements for effective transition between hosts and the implications of the evolution of the virus in the severity of the disease are also highlighted.
Coronavirus (CoVs) belongs to the Coronaviridae family, which includes a group of encapsulated viruses, positive polarity and simple tape RNA.
These viruses that present the largest genome, between 26 and 32 kilobases, between RNA viruses were called "CoVs" due to their crown morphology when observed in electronic microscope.
As for the structure, CoVs have unsegregated genomes that share a similar organization.
Approximately two thirds of the genome contain two oversized open reading structures (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into polyproteins to replicate pp1a and pp1ab.
Polyproteins are transformed again and generate 16 non-structural proteins, called nsp1 to nsp16.
The remaining portion of the genome contains ORFs for structural proteins, including spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
Some specific liner accessories are also encoded by different CoVs lines.
Based on the difference in the protein sequences, the CoVs are classified into four genres (alphaCoV, betaCoV, gammaCoV and deltaCoV), including the betaCoV genre contains most of the HCVs and is divided into four rows (A, B, C and D).
Philogenetic evidence has shown that bats and rodents serve as a genetic source for most alphaCoVs and betaCoVs, while birds are the main reservoir of gammaCoVs and deltaCoVs.
For thousands of years, the CoVs have constantly crossed the barriers of species, and some have become relevant human pathogens.
So far, seven human coVs (HCoVs) are known.
Among them, HCV-229E and HCV-NL63 are alphaCoVs.
The other five betaCoVs include HCV-OC43, HCV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCV-229E, HCV-OC43, HCV-HKU1 and HCV-NL63 viruses usually cause mild symptoms, such as common cold and/or diarrhoea.
On the other hand, SARS-CoV, MRS-CoV and the newly identified SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic and cause severe respiratory infection in a relatively higher number of patients, with a high chance of developing acute respiratory discomfort syndrome (SDRA) and extrapulmonary manifestations.
The first strain of HCoV-229E, B814, was isolated from the corset of patients with common cold in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more knowledge has been accumulated through comprehensive studies on HCV-229E and HCV-OC43, both of which cause autolimiting symptoms.
In fact, the concept that HCV infection is generally harmless was widely accepted until the SARS epidemic.
The SARS epidemic that occurred in 2003 is one of the most devastating of the present and infected more than 8,000 people, with a gross mortality rate related to confirmed cases of approximately 10%.
Ten years later, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) epidemic resulted in a persistent epidemic in the Arab Peninsula, with sporadic spread to the rest of the world.
The new HCV of 2019 (2019-nCoV), which was subsequently renamed SARS-CoV-2, is the cause of the current epidemic of the 2019 coronary disease (COVID-19), which took more than 3.120 lives and infected more than 91,000 people until 3 March 2020.
The alarm is ringing, and the world needs to prepare for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic that is coming.
All seven HCVs have zoonotic origin in bats, mice or domestic animals.
Multiple lines of evidence corroborate the evolutionary origin of all HCVs from bites, where viruses are well adapted and non-pathogenic, but demonstrate great genetic diversity.
The epidemic of COVID-19 presents huge medical, scientific, social and moral challenges to China and the rest of the world.
Tracement of the zoonotic origins of HCVs provides a structure to understand the natural history, the stimulating force and the restrictive factors of virus migration to other species.
This can also guide and facilitate the search for the reserve, intermediate and amplifier hosts of SARS-CoV-2, with important implications for the future prevention of viral migration among species.
In this article, we present a general view of zoonotic origins, interspecies transmission and HCV pathogenesis.
In particular, we highlight and discuss the common theme that the parental viruses of the HCVs are generally non-pathogenic in their natural reservoir hosts, but become pathogens after the interspecies transmission to a new host.
We also review the trend of HCV evolution, in which the increase in transmissibility is usually accompanied by a decrease in pathogenicity.
The outcome of the current SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is also discussed in this context.
Animal CoVs have been known since the end of the 1930s.
Prior to the first isolation of HCV-229E strain B814 from the bark of patients who contracted common cold, different CoVs had been isolated in several infected animals, including Peru, Camundong, Cauca, Pig, Cat and Dog.
In recent decades, seven HCVs have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of HCV discovery in chronological order (Table 1) would be informative and instructive.
The first HPov-229E strain was isolated from respiratory treatment in patients with upper respiratory tract infection in 1966, and was subsequently adapted to growth in lung cell lines WI-38.
Patients infected with HCV-229E had common cold symptoms, including headache, dyspnoea, malaise and throat pain, with fever and cough present in 10% to 20% of cases.
Subsequently, in 1967, the HCV-OC43 was isolated from the organ culture and subsequent serial passage in the brains of infants during lactation.
The clinical characteristics of HCV-OC43 infection appear to be similar to those caused by HCV-229E, which are symptomatically indistinguishable from infection by other respiratory tract pathogens, such as influenza A virus and rhinoviruses.
HCV-229E and HCV-OC43 are distributed globally, and tend to be transmitted predominantly during the winter season in temperate climates.
Generally, the incubation period of these two viruses is less than one week, followed by the disease for approximately 2 weeks.
According to a study with human volunteers, healthy individuals infected by HCV-229E developed a common cold brand.
Only a few immunocompromised patients showed severe infection of the lower respiratory tract.
SARS, also known as "atypical pneumonia", was the first documented pandemic caused by HCV in the history of the human being, and the etiological agent is SARS-CoV, the third discovered HCV.
The first case of SARS dates back to 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.
The SARS epidemic resulted in 8,096 reported cases with 774 deaths, spreading across several countries and continents.
With the exception of the "superconductors", it was estimated that each person infected may contaminate approximately two other persons, with an incubation period of 4 to 7 days, and with the appearance of the peak of the viral load on the tenth day of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially have myalgia, headache, fever, malady and calaphria, followed by subsequent symptoms of dyspnea, cough and respiratory discomfort.
Lympopenia, hepatic dysfunction and high kinase creatinine are the common SARS abnormalities in laboratory tests.
Dissemination of epithelial cells and increase in the number of macrophages are also observed in patients with SARS.
Approximately 20% to 30% of patients need, at some point, intensive treatment and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, several organs, including gastrointestinal treatment, liver and kidneys, can also be affected in these severe cases, usually due to a cytokine cascade, which can be fatal, mainly in immunocompromised patients.
The virus was first isolated in a lung biopsy of a relative of a zero patient traveling from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, huge efforts have been devoted to research on HCV.
The HCV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old baby in the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
Initially it was found that the virus was prevalent in small children, elderly and immunocompromised patients with respiratory diseases.
Symptoms of corse, conjunctivitis, fever and bronchiolitis are common in the disease caused by HCV-NL63.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus from a nasal specimen of an 8-month-old baby suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it has been identified in the Netherlands, it is scattered throughout the world.
It was estimated that HCV-NL63 corresponds to approximately 4.7% of common respiratory diseases, and its peak incidence occurs in winter, spring and early summer.
HCV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also known as crop.
In the same year, HCV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old hospitalized man with pneumonia and bronchiolite in Hong Kong.
In addition to pneumonia and acquired bronchiolite in a Community way, it was reported that HCV-HKU1 was associated with acute asthma exacerbation.
Like HCV-NL63, HCV-229E and HCV-OC43, HCV-HKU1 was found worldwide, causing mild respiratory diseases.
All four HCVs acquired in a Community way have been well adapted to human beings and are generally less likely to undergo mutations and cause highly pathogenic diseases, although accidents have occurred for unknown reasons in the rare case of a more virulent subtype of HCV-NL63, which has recently been reported as a cause of severe respiratory infection in China.
In general, when these HCVs acquire the ability to be transmitted efficiently and to remain continuously in human beings, they also become less virulent and less pathogenic.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lung of a 60-year-old patient who developed acute pneumonia and renal failure in Saudi Arabia.
While most cases confirmed by the laboratory originate in the Middle East, cases imported with occasional secondary spread to close contacts were reported in several European countries and Tunisia.
Another secondary epidemic occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestations of MRS are similar to those of SARS, characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MRS also develop acute renal failure, which is therefore very specific for MRS among the diseases caused by HCV.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhoea and vomiting.
By 14 February 2020, more than 2,500 confirmed cases per laboratory were reported with a high mortality rate related to confirmed cases, of 34.4%, which made MERS-CoV one of the most devastating viruses of human knowledge.
From half to the end of December 2019, groups of patients with pneumonia, which were retrospectively known to be associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, were detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization declared the continuing epidemic of respiratory infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 a Public Health Emergency of International Importance and also appointed COVID-19.
Until March 3, 2020, 90,053 cases were confirmed in the world, with a gross mortality rate related to confirmed cases of 3.4%.
It is noted that mortality related to confirmed cases in Hubei, China, is 4.2%, while mortality outside of that city is 1.2%.
SARS-COV-2 causes severe respiratory infection, just as SARS-COV and MERS-COV, with the presence of fever, cough and dyspnea.
Some patients also have diarrhoea.
Pneumonia is one of the most serious symptoms and can rapidly evolve into acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although SARS-COV and SARS-COV-2 are very similar due to the 82% high homology in the nucleotide sequence, they are grouped into different branches in the phylogenetic tree.
SARS-COV-2 appears to be less pathogenic, but is more transmissible compared to SARS-COV and MERS-COV.
Asymptomatic individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported, and they can contribute to the rapid spread of the virus in the world.
The comparison and contrast of SARS-CoV-2 with the other six HCVs reveal similarities and differences of great importance.
Firstly, the incubation period and the duration of the evolution of HCV disease are very similar.
In this sense, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six HCVs.
Secondly, the severity of the symptoms of COVID-19 is between the severity of SARS-CoV and the severity of the four HCVs acquired in a Community way (HCoV-229E, HCOV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection has characteristics that are most observed during HCV infection acquired in a Community way, including the presence of non-specific symptoms, mild or even the absence of symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subset of serious cases of COVID-19 can also be observed, as in the case of SARS-CoV infection, although the proportion is slightly lower.
Thirdly, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 also shows interesting patterns, both in the EU-acquired HCVs and in the SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of HCVs acquired in the community.
On the other hand, it should be confirmed whether the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 decreases after passing to human beings, as in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, as with other HCVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in faecal samples.
It still needs to be clarified in future studies if the golden-fee transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays an important role, as in the case of SARS-CoV, at least in some circumstances.
It is also of great interest to find out whether SARS-CoV-2 can show seasonality, as in the case of HCVs acquired in a Community manner.
In any event, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including its transmissibility, pathogenicity and sustainable propagation after its transition to human beings, will influence the outcome of the current epidemic of COVID-19.
All HCVs acquired by Community means that cause mild symptoms have been well adapted to human beings.
From another perspective, it can also be true that human beings have adapted well to these four HCVs.
In other words, the two could be survivors of old HCV pandemics.
HCVs that cause serious diseases in humans and people who develop serious HCV diseases have been eliminated.
In order for this to happen, HCVs need to replicate themselves in human beings to a sufficient extent to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations that neutralise the restriction factors.
In this sense, the greater the duration of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, the more people will be infected, and the greater the chance that the virus will adapt to human beings.
If adaptation is appropriate, its transmission to humans would be difficult to control with quarantine or other control measures.
A number of years ago, the four CoVs acquired in a Community way circulate in human populations, causing common cooling in immunocompetent individuals.
These viruses don't need an animal tank.
On the other hand, SARS-CoV and MRS-CoV, highly pathogenic, did not adapt well to human beings, and their transmission between human beings cannot be sustained.
They need to keep and spread in their zootic reservoirs and take advantage of the chance to migrate to susceptible human targets, possibly through one or more intermediate and amplifier hosts.
The SARS-COV-2 has characteristics similar to SARS-COV, MERS-COV and the four HCVs acquired in a Community manner.
It is highly transmissible, in the same way as the HCVs acquired in a Community way, at least until now.
However, it is more pathogenic than HCVs acquired in a Community and less pathogenic manner than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
It still needs to be discovered if it will fully adapt to human beings and circulate between us without a reserve or intermediate animal host.
Before discussing the animal origins of the HCVs, it would be useful to discuss the definitions and characteristics of the evolutionary, natural, reservoirs, intermediates and amplifiers of the HCVs.
An animal serves as the evolutionary host of an HCV if it shelters an ancestral direct relationship, sharing high homology at the level of the nucleotide sequence.
The ancestral virus is generally well adapted and non-pathogenic in this host.
Similarly, a reserve host shelters HCOV in a continuous and lasting manner.
In both cases, the hosts are naturally infected and are the natural hosts of the HCV or its parental virus.
On the other hand, if the HCV is newly introduced to an intermediate host shortly before or near its introduction to human beings, it does not suit the new host, and is generally pathogenic.
This intermediate host can serve as the zoonotic source of the human infection and perform the function of an amplifier host, allowing the virus to replicate in a transient way and then transmitting it to humans and increasing the scale of the human infection.
An HCV may have interrupted infection if it is unable to sustain its transmission to the intermediate host.
On the other hand, HCVs can also adapt to the mid-term host and establish long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes the natural reserve host.
Epidemiological data revealed that the SARS zero patient had a history of contact with hunting animals.
Subsequent studies of seroprevalence indicated that animal traders had a higher prevalence of IgG antiSARS-CoV compared to that of the general population.
Masked palm civetes (Paguma larvae) and a dog-guaxin in live animal markets were initially identified as carriers of viruses similar to SARS-CoV.
The identification was indirectly confirmed by the fact that no other SARS was notified after the slaughter of all civilians on the market.
However, it was reported that wild, unexposed, wild or farmed palm civettes were highly negative for SARS-CoV, suggesting that the masked palm civettes could only be the amplifier intermediate host, but not the natural reservoir of SARS-CoV.
It is noted that 80% of the different animals on the markets in Guangzhou have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies; the possibility that several species of small mammals may serve as mid-range hosts of the SARS-CoV cannot be excluded.
All these animals appear to be terminal hosts of the SARS-CoV.
The subsequent search by the natural animal host of SARS-CoV revealed a close-relational bite coV, named CoV HKU3 of the Rhinolophus bite related to SARS (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which exists in the Chinese bite-ferration.
These bites are positive for antiSARS-CoV antibodies and for the genomic sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
This and other bites CoVs share 88% to 92% homology with SARS-CoV in the nucleotide sequence.
These studies formed the basis for the new concept that mosquitoes are the host of emerging human pathogens.
Several CoVs similar to SARS (SL-CoVs) have also been identified in bats, but no CoV, except designated WIV1, can be isolated as a live virus.
Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ECA2) in humans is known to be the SARS-CoV receptor.
It has been shown that the WIV1 derived from faecal bite samples uses ECA2 of bites, cetaceans and human beings as a receptor for entering cells.
It is intriguing that the serum of SARS-convalescent patients was able to neutralize WIV1.
Up to now, the WIV1 represents the ancestral relative closer to SARS-CoV in bites, sharing 95% of homology in the nucleotide sequence.
Despite the high homology between these two viruses, it is generally believed that the WIV1 is not the immediate parental virus of SARS-CoV, and that mosquitoes are not the immediate reserve hosts of SARS-CoV.
The phylogenetic analysis groupes the MERS-CoV in the same group as the CoV-HKU4 of bites and the CoV-HKU5 of bites.
CoV-HKU4 of bites and MERS-CoV use the same host receptor, dipeptidel-peptidase 4 (DPP4) for the virus entry.
The sequences of RNA polymerase dependent on the MRS-CoV RNA are phylogenetically closer to betaCovs homologues of bites identified in Europe and Africa.
So far, no live MERC-CoV has been found in wild bites.
The MERS-CoV and its closest relative, the CoV-HKU25 of the bites, share only 87% of the homology in the nucleotide sequence.
Therefore, the morgues may not be the immediate reserve host of the MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that seropositive dromedaries are for MERS-CoV-specific neutralization antibodies, in the same way as Middle East camels in several African countries.
The live MRS-CoV, identical to the virus found in human beings, was isolated from nasal smears, increased the evidence that camels serve as the legitimate reserve host of MRS-CoV.
It is also worth noting that generally mild symptoms, however with massive virus transmission, were observed in experimentally infected camels with MERS-CoV.
It is notable that infected camels transmit the viruses not only through the respiratory route, but also through the fecal-oral route, which is also the main route of transmission of viruses into bats.
However, there are still no answers, as many confirmed cases of MRS do not have a history of contact with camels prior to the onset of symptoms, which can be attributed, plausibly, to the transmission between persons or the transmission routes involving unidentified animal species covering the MRS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% of nucleotide homology with a CoV RaTG13 bite, isolated from Rhinolophus affinis bites.
As with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the difference in the sequence between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too large to be attributed to a parental relationship.
In other words, mosquitoes may not be the immediate reserve hosts of SARS-CoV-2 unless CoVs almost identical mosquitoes are discovered in the future.
It is assumed that the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2 should be among wild species sold and slaughtered in the Huaan Sea Fruit Attack Market, to which many of the initial cases of COVID-19 were associated, indicating a likely event of transmission of animals to human beings.
Several recent studies based on metagenomic sequencing suggested that a group of small endangered mammals known as pangolins (Manis javanica) could also shelter betaCoVs ancestral related to SARS-CoV-2.
These new pangolim CoV genomes share 85% to 92% of homology in the nucleotide sequence with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are also, in the same way, directly related to RaTG13, with approximately 90% identity at the nuclear sequence level.
They are grouped into virus sublines similar to SARS-CoV-2 in the phylogenetic tree, one of which shares a domain of connection to the receptor (DLR) with SARS-CoV-2, with 97.4% of the identity following amino acids.
In a huge contrast, SARS-CoV-2 and RatG13 DLRs are more divergent, although they present a high degree of sequential homology throughout the genome.
A recent study on patients with pangolins also reported the detection of viral consent sequences of lung samples, which are closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
This study adopted different methods of manual configuration and healing to generate a partial genetic sequence, corresponding to about 86.3% of the total viral genome.
We cannot rule out the possibility of pangolim being one of the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence to confirm the direct origin of the pangolim SARS-CoV-2 due to the difference in the sequence between the SARS-CoV-2 and the betaCoVs related to the pangolin SARS-CoV-2.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RATG13 is even lower than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and betaCoVs related to the pangoline SARS-CoV-2.
The evolutionary route of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals still needs to be clarified.
While the highest sequential homology was found in the DLRs between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolim, betaCoVs related to SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 share the highest wide genomic sequential homology.
It is highly speculative that the high degree of similarity between the betaCoVs DLRs of pangolins related to SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 derives from the convergence-mediated evolution of selectivity.
A contrary argument is in favour of the recombination between the betaCoV of pangolins related to SARS-CoV-2 and the RaTG13 in the third wild animal species.
As a driving force in evolution, the recombination is quite present in betaCoVs.
The immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 remains under investigation.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCVs, the zoonotic origin of HCV-229E, HCV-OC43, HCV-NL63 and HCV-HKU1 viruses was also studied.
Phylogenetic evidence indicated that both HCV-NL63 and HCV-229E could have originated from Mortgage CoVs, while parental viruses of HCV-OC43 and HCV-HKU1 were discovered in rodents.
It was reported that a COV of bites called ARCoV.2 (Cov of Appalachian Ridge) detected in the North American tricolor bite had a direct relationship with HCV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E was genetically related to another Morcego CoV, called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was detected in Ghana, and there is also a suspicion that the chameleons are their intermediate hosts.
For greater clarity, the current knowledge of the animal origins of known HCVs is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
The phylogenetic analysis provided evidence for HCoVs interspective transmission events throughout history.
When HCV-OC43 crossed the species and infected human beings from domestic animals around 1890, a respiratory infection pandemic was recorded.
The interceptive transmission history of the HCV-229E is less clear.
AlphaCoVs of bites closely related to HCV-229E were discovered.
Among them is an alphaCoV of alpacas.
Several lines of evidence corroborate the direct transmission of mosquito virus to human beings.
First, human beings, but not alpacas, can have contact with mosquitoes in a shared ecological niche.
On the other hand, human beings have direct contact with alpacas.
Second, the alphaCoVs of bats related to HCV-229E are diverse and non-pathogenic in bats, while the alphaCoV of alpacas caused an epidemic of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alpine alphaCOV was not found in wild animals.
Therefore, the possibility cannot be excluded that alpacas obtain from human beings the alphaCoV related to HCV-229E.
In fact, mosquitoes are the direct source of pathogenic viruses for human beings, including the rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
Therefore, it is not surprising that bats transmit HCOV-229E directly to human beings.
As an alternative, while alphaCoVs serve as a genetic pool of HCV-229E, alpacas and dromedarys can serve as intermediate hosts that transmit viruses to human beings, just as in the case of MERS-CoV.
The MERS-CoV serves as an excellent example of interspective transmission of bats to dromedaries and dromedaries to human beings.
The evolutionary origin of MRS-CoV from the bites is known in its initial identification and has been corroborated by subsequent results.
It is obvious that the mosquitoes provide a rich pool of viral species for the exchange of genetic fragments and interpective transmission.
Longevity, high-density colonies, close social interaction and high flight capacity are all favourable conditions for the bites to be the ideal "viral propagator".
On the other hand, the introduction of MERS-CoV into the dromedaries dates back to decades.
He is well adapted to these camels, and migrated from an intermediate host to a natural and stable reserve host.
MERS-CoV is the cause of a very mild disease and sustains a relatively low rate of mutation in these animals.
Their sporadic transmission to human beings is an accident, and human beings remain terminal hosts of the MERS-CoV, since their transmission cannot be sustained.
In contrast to the role of camels in the transmission of the MRS-CoV, the role of the pangolins, if any, in the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2, is different.
Specifically, pangolin betaCoVs are highly pathogenic in pangolins.
They may be a terminal host for betaCoVs related to SARS-CoV-2, similar to the civilians, in the case of SARS-CoV.
Several possibilities for interspective transmission of SARS-CoV-2 animals for human beings need to be confirmed or discarded in future studies.
First, mosquitoes could be the reservoir host of a SARS-CoV-2 virus, almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Human beings could share the ecological niche with mosquitoes by means of abatement or coal mines.
Secondly, the pangolins could be one of the amplifier midwiferies, in which a SARS-CoV-2-related virus had been recently introduced.
Human beings contract the virus through the slaughter and consumption of hunting meat.
Many mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
A research on antibodies produced from domestic and wild animals is necessary.
Thirdly, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 could have occurred in a third species that has been in contact with both bats and pangolins.
The search for animal sources of SARS-CoV-2 is still active.
In addition to the different types of animal hosts, three main factors in the virus are important in facilitating coVs to cross the barriers of species.
First, its relatively high rate of mutation in RNA replication.
Compared to other simple tape RNA viruses, the estimated CoVs mutation rates can be considered "moderate" to "high" with an average replacement rate of approximately 10-4 substitutions per year, depending on the phase of adaptation of CoV to new hosts.
CoVs have exorribonuclease with a review mechanism, whose exclusion results in excessively high and attenuation mutation, or even inviability.
It is interesting that the remdesivir nucleotide analogue suppresses the replication of the coV through inhibition of this exorribonuclease and RNA-dependent polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents tested in clinical trials.
However, CoVs' mutation rates are almost a million times higher than those of their hosts.
Moreover, the rate of mutation is usually high when the CoVs are not well adapted to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV, which has a high mutation rate, the SARS-CoV-2 mutation rate is, apparently, low, suggesting its highest level of adaptation to human beings.
Apparently, he has already adapted to the other host who is in contact with human beings.
In addition to the SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to the MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to the drummers.
In theory, it is unlikely that a genetic change would quickly render vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 ineffective.
Secondly, the large genome of RNA in CoVs exercises an extra plasticity in changing the genome for mutations and recombinations, thereby increasing the likelihood of interspective coexistence, which is beneficial for the emergence of new CoVs when conditions become appropriate.
This is corroborated by the abundance of unique reading frames and encoded protein functions in relation to the last three inches of the end of the genome.
Thirdly, CoVs exchange models randomly and frequently during RNA replication through a single "copy selection" mechanism.
In a host that serves as a mixing container, the exchange of tapes occurs frequently during the transcription of the CoV RNA.
Highly homologous and subgenomic long RNAs can be recombined to generate new CoVs.
Philogenetic evidence of natural recombination was found in both HCV-HKU1 and HCV-OC43, as well as in animal coVs, as well as bite SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9.
Host virus interaction in relation to transmission
In addition to the above three viral factors, the viral interaction with the host receptor is another key factor that influences the interspective transmission.
Here, the recombination of SARS-CoV is taken as a typical example, which also showed evidence of positive selection during interspective transmission events.
Based on the comparative analysis between SARS-CoVs isolates of human beings and civilians, it is believed that SARS-CoV passes through a rapid adaptation in different hosts, mainly with mutations in the DLR of protein S.
In general, the DLR in the S protein of a CoV interacts with the cell receptor and is intensely selected by the host antibody response.
In SARS-CoV, DLR is in the amino acids 318 to 510 in the S1 fragment, which binds to human ECA2 as well as its receptors for viral entry.
SARS-CoV DLR is capable of recognising ECA2 receptors from various animals, including mosquitoes, civilians, mice and guaxin dogs, enabling the interspective transmission of the virus.
In fact, it was observed that only six amino acid wastes were different from human viral isolates and civets in the DLR, and four of them are located on the basis of connection to the receptor for interaction with the ECA2 receptor.
The civet SARS-CoV has K479N and S487T mutations in its DLR, which could increase the affinity of the spice protein interaction with the human ECA2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acids substitutions could be critical for viral adaptation in humans.
It should be noted that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cell receptor with SARS-CoV.
A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 protein unit implies that the affinity of its S protein with human ECA2 could have been altered.
In fact, a study with electronic cryomicroscopics indicates a affinity of 10 to 20 times that of this relationship than between human ECA2 and SARS-CoV-S protein S.
It will also be useful to determine whether any other corrigendum may be necessary for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
It is intriguing that HCV-NL63 also binds to ECA2, but with a different part of protein S.
There are several other HCV receptors, such as aminopeptidase N for HCV-229E and sialic acid 9-O-acetylated for HCV-OC43.
They could also respond to the effective adaptation of these CoVs to human beings after the interspective transmission of their animal hosts.
In addition to cellular receptors, the result of the interspective transmission of HCVs is also governed by other factors of restriction and dependence with the host.
The differentiation of these host proteins between human beings and HCOVs' natural reservoir hosts such as bats, rudders and rodents could constitute a barrier to interspecies transmission.
The HCOVs need to absorb the dependency factors with the host and subvert the host's restriction factors for effective interspective transmission.
In this sense, molecular determinants in this important area of virus-host interaction still need to be identified and characterized.
A non-volatile screening with the extent of the host's dependence genome and restriction factors for SARS-CoV-2 using modern CRISPR technology can produce good results.
New HPoVs: back to the zero stack
The diversity of bites CoVs provides broad possibilities for the emergence of new HCVs.
In this sense, the CoVs of bites serve as a genetic pool of the HCoVs.
In addition, rapid genetic mutation and recombination also stimulate the evolution of HCV and serve as two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein codification genes has the potential to radically modify viral phenotypes.
Among the accessory proteins of SARS-CoV, it is believed that ORF8 is important in its adaptation to human beings, since mosquito viruses related to SARS-CoV have been isolated, but it was found that they encode different ORF8 proteins.
A feature of the exclusion of nucleotide 29 from SARS-CoVs was discovered in isolated strains at the start of the human epidemic.
The exclusion divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and it is believed that it is an adaptive mutation that promotes the alternating of hosts.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a possible recombination history with alphaCoVs and gammaCoVs, where a large number of smaller recombinant regions were identified in RNA-dependent polymerase.
Recombination sites were also identified in nsp9, mostly nsp10 and parts of nsp14.
Similarly, it was demonstrated that the epidemic MERS-CoV passed through recombination events between different lines, which occurred in drummers in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events were also observed in other HCVs, in which HCVs recombinate with other animal coVs in their non-structural genes.
It should also be warned that artificial selection can contribute to unwanted changes in the viral genomes, probably resulting from the relief of the selection pressure on the viruses, such as the host's immune system pressure.
An example of these effects is the loss of a long ORF4 in the HCV-229E prototype strain due to the exclusion of two nucleotides.
While intact ORF4 can be observed in HPOV-229E-related bats and camels, alpaca alfaCOV has a simple insertion of nucleotide, resulting in a change in the picture.
Finally, but no less important, the evolution of new HCVs is also driven by the selection pressure in its reserve hosts.
The absence of symptoms or only mild symptoms were detected in bites when infected with CoVs, indicating the mutual adaptation between CoVs and bites.
The bites are likely to be well adapted to the anatomical and physiological CoVs.
For example, defects in activation of the pro-inflammatory response in the bites effectively reduce the pathology triggered by the CoVs.
In addition, the activity of natural exterminating cells in the bites is eliminated due to the adaptation of the NKG2/CD94 natural exterminating receptor inhibitor and the low degree of expression of Class I molecules of the main histocompatibility complex.
In addition, the high level of reactive oxygen species (EROs) generated from the high metabolic activity of mosquitoes can both suppress the replication of the CoV and affect the review by exorribonuclease, thus providing the selective pressure for the generation of highly pathogenic virus strains when introduced into a new host.
More pathogenic strains of CoV could also evolve by recombination, leading to the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics for the adaptation of the host.
Therefore, it is not the case that three new HCVs have emerged in the last two decades.
CoVs are non-pathogenic, or cause, at most, mild symptoms in their reservoir hosts, such as bites and camels.
They are highly replicated without causing a high immune response from the host.
This document contains explanations of the detection of asymptomatic carriers and the cause of serious cases of human infection.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to the hyperactivation of immune response and cytokine cascade, in which the greater the immune response, the more severe the damage to the lungs.
On the other hand, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response was disconnected from the replication of the CoV.
The same immune response clearance strategy could have beneficial effects on anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
Interferon response is specifically strong in bites.
Therefore, the administration of type I interferon in the initial phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans should be beneficial.
In addition, the activation of the inflammatory NLRP3 in the bites is weak.
Following this reasoning, inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammatory with MCC950 could be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the same principles that led to the emergence of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
While it was discovered that betaCoV of Mortgage shares 95% of the nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV, there is a coV of Mortgage that shares 96% of the nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Although it has been found that civilians and other animals on the markets have identical viruses to SARS-CoV, the intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2 have not been identified.
BetaCoVs of pangolins, with high homology with SARS-CoV-2, were discovered, indicating that pangolins can serve as one of the intermediate hosts, or betaCoVs of pangolins can contribute with genetic fragments to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although the questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is produced by an accidental or intentional man.
The CoVs returned to global attention due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.
The study of CoVs in bats and other animals has radically changed our perception of the importance of the zoonotic origins and animal reservoirs of the HCOVs in the transmission between humans.
Wide dissemination evidence shows that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originate in the bite and are transmitted to people through intermediate hosts.
Since SARS-CoV infection originated from contact between human beings and civilians on the markets, the closure of wet markets and the slaughter of civilians on those markets could have put an end to the SARS epidemic.
Following the same reasoning, pangolins should be removed from wet markets to prevent zoonotic transmission, in view of the discovery of multiple betaCoVs of pangolins closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, it should still be clarified in future studies if SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through pangolins and other mammals, and how this is transmitted.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV has existed in dromedaries for a long time.
These camels serve as an important means of transport, and are an essential source of meat, milk, leather and wool for the local community.
They are widely distributed in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sacrifice all camels for the control of MRS, as was done in the markets of wild animals in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
In order to stop the recurrent epidemics of MERS, a comprehensive approach should be adopted to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV for camels, in combination with other control measures for infection.
Since we have not been able to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes may arise and cause epidemics.
A variety of zoonotic CoVs circulate in nature.
Specifically, the CoVs of bites with zoonotic potential are very different.
There are several possibilities that these zoonotic CoVs evolve and recombinate, resulting in the emergence of new CoVs that are more transmissible and/or lethal to human beings in the future.
The culture of eating wild animals in some places in China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
With the SARS, MERS and COVID-19 crisis, a better response and preparation plan should be adopted.
In fact, many viruses have existed on the planet for a long time.
They remain in their natural reservoirs until there is a chance of migration to another species.
Although mosquitoes have many characteristics that favor the spread of the virus, the chance that people are in contact with mosquitoes and other wild species can be minimized if people are taught to stay away from them.
Continual monitoring in mammals is necessary for a better understanding of the ecology of the CoVs and their natural hosts, which will prove useful in preventing the transmission of animals to human beings and future epidemics.
To conclude, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonoses is for people to stay away from the ecological niches of the natural reservoirs of zoonotic viruses.
Several parts of the heads of the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 are still missing.
First, if the bats transmit an ancestral SARS-CoV-2 virus to the pangolins, it is important to find out under what circumstances the bats and pangolins could share the same ecological niche.
Secondly, if the bats play a more direct role in the transmission to human beings, it should be determined how people come into contact with the bats.
Thirdly, if a third mammal has the role of the true midwife, it needs to be clarified how it interacts with the different species, including human beings, bats and pangolins.
Finally, as several mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both surveillance and experimental infection should be performed.
In case it is a bite, pangolimus or other mammals, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or its parental viruses that are almost identical will be identified in their natural hosts in the future.
Continued research in this area will elucidate the evolutionary route of SARS-COV-2 in animals, with important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
It is necessary to update the diagnostic criteria for "suspected case" and "confirmed case" of COVID-19
On February 6, 2020, our team published a fast guidance guide for the diagnosis and treatment of the infection of the new kronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV). This guide conveys our experience and is a good reference to combating this global pandemic.
However, the 2019 coronary disease (COVID-19) is new. Our understanding and knowledge gradually increase based on the constant findings of research and experience in clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also continuously updated.
In this letter, we respond to a comment on our guide and provide the latest diagnostic criteria for "suspected" and "confirmed" according to the latest CVID-19 Diagnostic and Treatment Guides (seventh version) published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) caused a rash, which is officially now called coronavirus 2019 disease (COVID-19), and the virus is called coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO classified COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In order to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a quick guidance guide published online in Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
He has attracted excellent attention since the publication.
However, note that COVID-19 is a new disease. Our understanding and knowledge gradually increase based on the constant findings of research and experience in clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also continuously updated.
For example, the CVID-19 Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020 have a total of seven editions with substantial changes in some context.
Our guide now received a comment from Zhou et al., who presented a simple score proposal based on his clinical experience.
This work added new evidence to our guide and also makes valuable references to this global pandemic.
We carry on our meaningful work and express our gratitude.
However, their work also needs to be updated according to the latest CVID-19 Diagnostics and Treatment Guides (Seventh trial version) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), in order to confirm the suspected case, it is necessary to combine an element of epidemiological history with two items of clinical manifestations to perform a comprehensive analysis, or it is necessary to complete three items of clinical manifestations if there is no clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiological history: (1) a history of travel or residence in the city of Wuhan and in nearby areas or other communities where cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (2) a history of contact with infectious cases of SARS-CoV-2 (with positive nucleic acid test); (3) a history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms from the city of Wuhan and from nearby areas or other communities where cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (4) a history of contact with a group of confirmed cases (greater or equal to two cases with fever and/or respiratory symptoms occurring within 2 weeks in small spaces, such as home, office, classroom, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) with diagnostic resources for COVID-19 infection; (3) count of total white blood cells exhibiting normal, decreased or reduced lymphocyte count at the initial stage of onset of symptoms.
The diagnosis of the confirmed case should be based on a suspected case with any of the following serological or pathogens: (1) PCR positive for SARS-CoV-2; (2) complete viral genome sequencing exhibiting high homogeneity in relation to the known new coronavirus; (3) positive for IgM and IgG-specific antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 in serum examination; or any alteration of the specific IgG-specific antibody for SARS-CoV-2 negative for positive or increased title greater than or equal to four times in the acute recovery phase above.
We can note that the real-time PCR examination for nucleic acid in blood samples or respiratory treatment was added to the second and third editions (from 18 and 22 January 2020, respectively).
The pathogenic blood sample detection was added to the fourth and fifth editions (27 January 2020 and 8 February 2020 respectively), and the serological evidence was added to the seventh edition.
These changes are based on the continuous work of researchers in the search for an ideal kit of nucleic acid detection for rapid diagnosis and samples of respiratory treatment, including blood sampling, which increased the availability of different specimens and helped to bring the positive result of specific antibodies to the confirmed criteria.
In addition, there is increasing evidence that reminds us to pay attention to symptomatic and atypical asymptomatic patients.
Therefore, the Zhou et al. fluxogram should be updated, since the person without clinical symptoms is classified as "low risk".
The score system also needs to be verified in more clinical studies and practices.
To conclude, we await the emergence of more direct evidence and ask readers to provide their comments.
For the diagnosis of "suspected case" and "confirmed case", we suggest that they check and obey the latest guidelines of their countries of origin.
Our team will also update our guide on time to offer help.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths due to COVID-19, higher daily number
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths due to COVID-19 on the day.
This is the largest number of deaths in one day due to the virus.
On yesterday, the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research in Bangladesh (IEDCR) reported that the number of confirmed cases included 114 active cases and 33 recovered cases remaining at home.
A total of 17 deaths were recorded.
In an online newsletter, the director of the IEDCR, Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora, said that the deaths included four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases were more than 60 years old, two were between 51 and 60 years old, and one was between 41 and 50 years old.
She also said that two of the victims were from Daca.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 pandemic on 11 March.
One hospital agent told Anadolu Agency, a local news agency, that one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bengali Anti-Corruption Commission, which was treated at the Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, in an online video release, the Minister of Road Transport and the Obaidul Quader bridges said that public transport would be paralyzed for more time than originally planned, until next Saturday.
This public transport paralysis began on 26 March and was planned to end on Saturday, 4 April.
The transport of essential products (medical products, fuel and food) was still allowed.
The first incidents of COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh were recorded on 8 March in two people who returned from Italy and also in the wife of one of them.
On 19 March, the three had already recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 exceeds one million infections worldwide
On Thursday, the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 coronation in the world passed by one million, reported data from the University of Johns Hopkins.
At least 52,000 deaths were related to COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.
This framework came the same day that Malawi confirmed its first coronary infections and Zambia had its first virus-related death.
North Korea stated that until Thursday, it was one of the few remaining countries free of coronary infections.
Until yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,05,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases in 24 hours before 10 a.m. at the Central European Time (0800 UTC) on 4 April.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of coronavirus have been reported, associated with at least 5,900 deaths.
CBS News reported, quoting data from the University of Johns Hopkins, that there were more than 1,000 deaths in the United States caused by coronary infections on Wednesday.
Worldwide, countries have announced more stringent measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Moscow mayor Sergei Sobyanin extended the city's total lockdown until May 1.
In the national sphere, President Vladimir Putin stated that the Russians would continue to be paid without appearing at work until 30 April.
The Portuguese Parliament voted to extend the national state of emergency within 15 days, and the vote was adopted by 215 votes in favour, ten abstentions and one against.
Saudi Arabia extended for the whole day the duration of the touch to collect in the sacred cities of Mecca and Medina. Previously, this duration was only from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m.
Thailand plans to implement 22h to 4h pick-up
Ohio governor Mike DeWine announced that the state had extended the order to stay at home until May 1.
Stores in Australia reduce the limits of sanitary paper by transaction
On Saturday night and Sunday, Australia's Woolworths and Coles store networks reduced the purchase restrictions of toilet paper, respectively, for two packages and a package per transaction in all of the country's shops.
On Monday, the ALDI also implemented a package limit.
These limitations were communicated by messages in the boxes and on the Facebook pages of the networks.
Because of COVID-19, buyers were supposedly stockpiling in case there was a need to isolate themselves.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited the purchases of toilet paper with delivery at home for a package on request.
These changes came after the previous restriction of four packages per transaction implemented by Woolworths and Coles on March 4 and 5, respectively.
Coles, in his March 8 press release, reported that, even with the restriction of four packages, "many stores are still running out of stocks within an hour after delivery" and called for "no prior", while ALDI called it "unforeseen" in a Facebook post on Tuesday.
Sales had a "high rise" last week, according to a Woolworths spokesman.
Costco's shop in Camberra also limited the amount allowed for two packages last week.
To further ease the scarcity, Coles ordered larger packages from the suppliers and increased delivery frequency, Woolworths ordered extra stock, while ALDI provided stocks of a planned promotion for Wednesday.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Association of Varajistas, said that varajistas are trying to increase stocks, but that local board restrictions on the frequency of truck delivery make it difficult.
He expects high production costs, as suppliers try to meet demand, and less promotions.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that, after the early release of the stock, some shops will not be able to carry out the Wednesday promotion.
In a report from News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a specialist at the University of Technology of Queensland, said that shops restock the stock every night.
He stressed that the hygienic role is an item with low stock numbers in terms of quantity, and that, when exhausted, leaves many empty spaces in the meadows, increasing the sense of scarcity.
Coles and Woolworths have the opinion [of] that if there was an abundant quantity in the dishes, if products like toilet and antiseptic roles could be [bought] and were there in quantities, you would probably reduce the panic," Russell Zimmerman told ABC News.
The recycled toilet paper manufacturer Who Gives to Crap said on the last Wednesday that they would be out of stock.
Kimberly-Clark, who produces Kleenex's sanitary role, and Solaris Paper, who produces Sorbent, stressed that they were working 24 hours per day 7 days per week to maintain supply, according to News.com.au report.
The real estate site domain.com reported that some real estate vendors were offering free hygienic paper to the first auctioneers of auctions in Melbourne, when fewer auctions were being made with the buyers entering strike at the end of the extended week of the Day of Work.
The edition of NT News on Thursday, a daily printing of Darwin, included an eight-page insert to be cut and used as a toilet paper.
Initially, the shops were reluctant to impose restrictions, according to a report by ABC Australia on 3 March in which they said they had no plans to implement restrictions on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products are also with high demand, such as masks, antiseptics, dry products, hand soaps and flour.
As in Australia, on Sunday night, the British online supermarket Ocado limited the purchases of the sanitary paper Andres for two packs of 12 rolls.
The World Health Organization declares COVID-19 pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that the current outbreak of COVID-19 — the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 — is a pandemic.
Although the word "pandemia" only indicates the extent of the spread of a disease, not how dangerous the specific cases are, WHO stressed the need to encourage governments to act:
All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
If countries are able to detect, test, treat, isolate, track and mobilize the population for a response, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director General of WHO, said.
We are very concerned about the alarming levels of dissemination and gravity and about the alarming levels of lack of action.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it is a "unprecedented" pandemic.
In comments published by CNN in February, he stated that "outside the influenza, no other respiratory virus has been monitored from the emergence to the continuous global spread".
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar position, stating that "we have never seen a pandemic initiated by a coronavirus".
And it went on "and we never saw a pandemic that could be controlled at the same time."
The new pandemic status follows the WHO's January decision to declare a public health emergency of international concern.
The director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in the United States, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said that the outcome, "in sum, will get worse".
On Thursday, the Associated Press reported that there were at least 126,000 COVID-19 cases worldwide, with more than 4,600 deaths.
Coronavir’s 2019–20 pandemic is a continuous pandemic of coronary disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, an international public health emergency of international concern was declared on 30 January 2020 and recognised as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
By 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million COVID-19 cases had been reported in 210 countries and territories, with approximately 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people recovered.
The mortality rate is estimated to be 4% in China, while overall it varies from 13.04% in Algeria to 0.08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and lack of air.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory discomfort syndrome.
The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is approximately five days, but it can vary from two to fourteen days.
There is no known specific antiviral vaccine or treatment.
Primary treatment is symptomatic and supportive. The recommended prevention measures include washing hands, covering the mouth when coughing, keeping people away and monitoring and isolation of people with suspected infection.
The authorities around the world responded with the implementation of travel restrictions, quarantines, collection touches, risk controls at the workplace and closure of establishments.
The pandemic caused a severe global socio-economic interruption, the delay or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events and the widespread shortage of supplies exacerbated by the purchases triggered by panic.
Schools and universities closed at national or local level in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4% of the student population in the world.
The disinformation about the virus has spread online and there have been incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese people, people with the descent and appearance of the East and Southeast Asian and other people in areas with significant cases of the virus.
Due to the reduction of travel and the closures of the heavy industry, there was a decrease in air pollution and carbon emissions.
The health authorities of Wuhan, in China (the capital of the province of Hubei) reported a group of cases of pneumonia because of unknown causes on 31 December 2019 and an investigation was initiated at the beginning of January 2020.
Most cases were linked to the Huanan Sea Fruit Market and therefore it is believed that the virus is of zoonotic origin.
The virus causing the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, a recently discovered virus that has been linked to the coronaviruses of the bite, the pangolimus and the SARS-CoV. The first person with symptoms of having knowledge became sick on December 1, 2019 and did not have visible connections with the later group of the marine fruit market.
From the initial group of cases reported in December 2019, it was found that two thirds were connected to the market.
On 13 March 2020, an unverified report from South China Morning Post suggested that a case was indicated by 17 November 2019, in an individual 55 years in Hubei province, which may have been the first. On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that, as the new cases reported decreased in China, but suddenly increased in Italy, Iran and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China had exceeded the number of new cases from China for the first time.
There may be a significant sub-notification of cases, especially among people with milder symptoms.
Until February 26, relatively few cases had been reported among young people aged 19 or under, accounting for 2.4% of cases worldwide. The main scientific consultant of the United Kingdom, Patrick Vallance, estimated that 60% of the British population would have to be infected until an effective collective immunity could be achieved.
Cases refer to the number of persons who were tested for COVID-19 and whose tests were confirmed positive in accordance with official protocols.
By March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population and several countries adopted official policies not to test people with only mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on 16 March found that 86% of COVID-19 infections were not detected in China until 23 January and that these undocumented infections were the source of infection of 79% of the documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March estimated that the number of people infected in Italy was significantly higher than the reported cases.
The initial estimates of the baseline number of reproduction (R0) for COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that it can be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 recover.
For those who have not recovered, the time from the onset of symptoms to death has been between 6 and 41 days, being 14 days the most common.
By 10 April 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths were attributed to COVID-19.
In China, until 5 February, approximately 80% of deaths occurred in people over 60 years of age and 75% had pre-existing medical conditions, including cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. The official death count for the COVID-19 pandemic usually refers to people who died and who had a positive test for COVID, according to official protocols.
The actual number of deaths by COVID-19 may be much higher, since it may not include people who died without taking the test, for example, who died at home, in homes of rest, etc.
Italy's partial data showed that the additional number of deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official count of deaths by COVID by a factor of 4-5x.
A spokesperson for the U.S. Disease Control and Prevention Centres (CDCs) acknowledged that "we know that [the number of official deaths] is underestimated", a statement corroborated by post-notification episodes in the U.S.. This underestimation often occurs in pandemics, such as the H1N1 swine influenza epidemic in 2009. The first confirmed death occurred in Wuhan on 9 January 2020.
The first death outside China occurred in the Philippines on 1 February, and the first death outside Asia occurred in France on 14 February.
On 28 February, outside China, more than a dozen deaths had already been recorded in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
On 13 March, more than forty countries and territories had reported deaths on all continents except Antarctica. Several measures are commonly used to quantify mortality.
These numbers vary according to the region and over time and are influenced by the volume of tests, quality of the health system, treatment options, time since the start and by the characteristics of the population, such as age, sex and general health. The fatality coefficient represents the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed at a given interval.
Based on statistics from the University of Johns Hopkins, the global fatality coefficient is 6.0% (97.039/1.617.204) until 10 April 2020.
The number varies according to the region.
In China, the mortality rate estimates fell from 17.3% (in people with symptoms beginning from 1 to 10 January 2020) to 0.7% (in people with symptoms beginning after 1 February 2020). Other measures include the mortality rate (CFR), which represents the percentage of people diagnosed who die from a disease, and the rate of mortality of infection (IFR), which represents the percentage of infected (diagnised and not diagnosed) who die from the disease.
These statistics are not static over time and follow a specific population of infection by resolution of the case.
Some academics have tried to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
The Oxford University Evidence Medical Center estimates that the mortality rate for the pandemic is generally between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The upper estimate of this interval is compatible with the results of the first random test for COVID-19 in Germany and with a statistical study that analyzed the impact of the tests on the CFR estimates.
WHO states that the pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and the maximum duration of the exit are uncertain and can change according to the location.
Maciej Boni, from the State University of Pennsylvania, stated that, "without due control, infectious epidemics usually reach their growth and then fall into decline when there are no more hosts available for the disease.
But it is almost impossible to make any proper projections at the moment about when this will happen."
The senior Chinese government medical adviser, Zhong Nanshan, defended that "may end by June" if all countries mobilize to follow the WHO recommendations regarding measures to prevent the spread of the virus.
On 17 March, Adam Kucharski, of the School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine of London, declared that SARS-CoV-2 "probably will continue in circulation for a year or two".
According to the Imperial College study, led by Neil Ferguson, physical distance and other measures will be necessary "until a vaccine is available (potentially within 18 months or more)".
William Schaffner, from Vanderbilt University, stated: "I think it is unlikely that this coronary virus will disappear completely, since it is highly communicable" and "that it will become a seasonal disease, reappearing every year".
The virulence of reappearance will depend on the group immunity and the extent of the mutation.
Symptoms of COVID-19 may be relatively non-specific and infected people may be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, respiratory secretion production (catarro), loss of breath, lack of air, muscle and joint pain, throat pain, headache, headache, vomiting, haemoptosis, diarrhoea or cyanosis. WHO states that approximately one in six people is seriously ill and has difficulty breathing.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDCs) list that emergency symptoms are the difficulty in breathing, pain or pressure in the persistent chest, sudden confusion, difficulty in walking and face or lips with blue coloring. It is advised to seek medical help if these symptoms are present. The disease’s development may cause severe pneumonia, acute respiratory discomfort syndrome, septic shock and death.
Some of the infected people may be asymptomatic, without clinical symptoms, but with the results of the tests confirming the infection, researchers recommend that those who have been in close contact with a confirmed infection should be monitored and examined closely to discard the infection.
Chinese estimates of the asymptomatic ratio vary from some to 44%.
The usual period of incubation (the time between the start of infection and symptoms) varies from one to 14 days, but it is usually five days. As an example of uncertainty, the estimate of the fraction of people with COVID-19 who lost the smelly sensation was initially 30% and then dropped to 15%.
Some details about how the disease spread are still being determined.
It is believed that this disease is spread mainly by close contact and by small drops produced during the act of coughing, breathing or talking, being the next contact considered 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have found that coughing without covering the mouth can make the gout reach 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some people have suggested that the virus can also be transmitted by gouts that remain for longer periods in the air, which may have been generated during a conversation. Respiratory gouts can also be produced during the expiration, including when talking, although the virus is not normally suspended.
The gouts can be put in the mouths and noses of people close to you or may be inhaled by the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can cause the nebulization of respiratory secretions, resulting in air propagation.
Spreading can also happen when someone touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, and then touches the eyes, nose or mouth.
Although there is concern that it can spread through the faeces, it is believed that the risk of this happening is low.
The government of China has denied the possibility of the SARS-CoV-2 gold-fee transmission. The virus is more contagious during the first three days after the onset of the symptoms, although the transmission may be possible before the symptoms appear and in subsequent stages of the disease.
There were positive tests for the disease up to three days before the onset of the symptoms, suggesting that transmission is possible even before the development of significant symptoms.
There are only a few reports of asymptomatic cases confirmed by the laboratory, but the asymptomatic transmission has been identified in some countries during contact tracking investigations.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that although it is not entirely clear the ease with which the disease spreads, a person usually infections from two to three other people.
Specifically, it was found that the virus is detectable for up to three days in plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel 304, for one day in paper and for up to four hours in copper.
This, however, varies according to humidity and temperature. Estimates and other animals have already tested positive for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can pass the virus to humans. However, the British authorities advise to wash their hands after contact with animals, as well as after contact with surfaces that infected people may have touched.
Coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, first isolated from three people with pneumonia connected to a set of acute respiratory disease cases in Wuhan.
All characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are similar to those of coronavirus related in its nature. Outside the human body, the virus dies by home soap, which dissolves its protective envelope. SARS-CoV-2 is intimately associated with the original SARS-CoV.
It's believed to be of zoonotic origin.
The genetic analysis revealed that the coronavirus is genetically associated with the genus Betacoronavirus, subgener Sarbecovirus (lineage B). Two strains of this same line are derived from bites.
It has 96% similarity, across the genome, to other samples of coronavirus coming from bites (BatCoV RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there is only one amino acid of difference in certain parts of the sequences of genome between the pangolin virus and that of humans.
The comparison of the whole genome has so far found, at the maximum, 92% of the genetic material sharing between the pangolim coronavirus and the SARS-CoV-2, which is insufficient to prove that the pangolins are the intermediate host.
Virus infection can be provisionally diagnosed based on symptoms. However, definitive confirmation is due to reverse transcription followed by polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of infected secretions or computerized tomography (TC).
A study conducted in Wuhan, comparing rRT-PCR to TC suggested that TC is significantly more sensitive, although less specific, with many of its image characteristics coincident with other pneumonias and pathological processes.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that "TC is not used for screening or as a front line test for the diagnosis of COVID-19".
WHO published several RNA test protocols for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was published on 17 January.
The test uses reverse transcription followed by reaction and polymerase chain (rRT-PCR) in real time.
The test can be performed in respiratory or blood samples.
The results are usually available from a few hours a day.
Usually, this test is carried out in nasopharyngeal smear, although the throat smear is also used. Several laboratories and companies are developing serological tests, capable of detecting antibodies.
On 6 April 2020, none of them had been shown to be sufficient to be approved for general use.
A serological test developed by Cellex, in the United States, was approved to be used in an emergency character only by certified laboratories.
The particularities of the images of radiographs and computerized tomography (TC) of symptomatic people include asymmetric asymmetry in dark peripheral glass opacitys and the absence of pleural spills.
The Italian Radiological Society is collecting an online international database of image results in confirmed cases.
Due to the overlap with other infections such as adenovirus, images without PCR confirmation are of limited specificity in the identification of COVID-19.
A large study in China compared the results of thoracic CT to PCR and showed that, although the image is less specific for infection, it is faster and more sensitive, suggesting its consideration as a research tool in epidemiological areas.
Convolutional neural networks based on artificial intelligence have been developed to detect the characteristics of virus images with radiography and CT.
Strategies to avoid transmission of the disease include keeping a good personal hygiene in general, washing your hands, avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth without washing your hands, coughing or spitting on a paper sheet and putting this cloth directly into a waste container.
It is advised who has already been infected to use a surgical mask in public.
Physical distance measures are also recommended to avoid transmission. Many governments have restricted or unadvised non-essential journeys from countries and areas affected by the outbound.
However, the virus has reached the stage of Community spread in vast regions of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within communities and that some members of the community do not know where or how it was infected. It is recommended that health professionals take care of individuals who may be infected to use standard precautions, contact precautions and eye protection. Tracking contacts is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of an infection and to prevent subsequent transmission.
The use by local government of data from cell phones for this purpose has raised issues of privacy, with the International Anistia and more than 100 other organizations issuing a statement asking for limits to this kind of surveillance.
Several mobile applications have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use. On April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups are working on privacy friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record the proximity of a user to other mobile phones.
The users then receive a message if they have been in close contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19. Some wrong concepts about how to prevent infection have circulated, such as rubbing the nose and scratching with colutories, which has already proved ineffective.
There is no vaccine against COVID-19. However, several organizations are working for the development of one.
Washing hands is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with water and soap for at least twenty seconds, especially after using the toilet or when hands are visually dirty. You should also wash your hands before eating and after sossing your nose, coughing or spitting.
This is because outside the human body, the virus is killed by domestic soap, which breaks its protective coating.
The CDC also recommends the use of hand hygiene based alcohol with a minimum volume of 60% alcohol, when there is no soap and water readily available.
WHO advises to avoid touching the eyes, nose or mouth without washing your hands.
The surfaces can be decontaminated with various solutions (up to one minute exposure to the disinfectant for a stainless steel surface), including ethanol at 62–71%, isopropyl alcohol at 50–100%, sodium hypochlorite at 0.1%, hydrogen peroxide at 0.5% and iodopovidone at 0.2–7.5%.
Other solutions, such as benzalconium chloride and gluconate chloride, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that, in case of suspicion or confirmation of COVID-19 at a site such as an office or a creek, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, common areas, shared electronic equipment such as tablets, touchscreens, keyboards, remote controls and electronic boxes used by patients should be disinfected.
Health organizations recommend covering the mouth and nose with the folded elbow or with a sheet of paper when coughing or spitting, as well as discarding any canvas immediately.
Surgical masks are recommended for those who may be infected, since using a mask can limit the volume and distance of moving expiratory drops when talking, breathing or coughing.
WHO published instructions on when and how to use masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at Leeds University, "The use of masks can reduce people's propensity to touch their faces, which is one of the greatest sources of infection without the proper hygiene of their hands." The use of masks by caregivers of people who may have the disease has also been recommended.
WHO recommended the use of masks by healthy people only when they are at high risk, such as caregivers of people with COVID-19, although they also recognize that using masks can help people not to touch their own face.
In several countries, the use of masks for the face of the public in general has begun to be encouraged.
In the United States, the CDC recommends the use of non-medical mask for the face made of cloth. China specifically recommended the use of disposable medical masks by healthy people in general, especially when entering close contact with another person (to stay 1 meter or less away).
In Hong Kong, the use of surgical mask is recommended when using public transport or staying in crowded places.
Thailand's health authorities are encouraging people to make facial clothing masks at home and wash them daily.
In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, it is forbidden to go out in public without using a mask or covering the nose and mouth.
On 16 March, the Vietnamese asked everyone to wear a face mask when going out in public areas to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has demanded that everyone entering supermarkets should use a mask for the face.
In Israel, all residents were asked to wear masks for public face.
Taiwan, which has produced ten million masks a day since mid-March, demanded that inter-municipal trains and buses use masks for the face from 1 April.
In Panama, it is mandatory to use a mask for the face when walking out the street. At the same time, it was recommended to produce masks at home for those who could not buy.
Face masks have also been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distance (also known as physical distance) involves infection control actions aimed at slowing down the transmission of the disease by reducing close contact between individuals.
The methods include quarantine, travel restrictions and school closures, workplaces, stadiums, theatres or shopping centers.
Social distance methods can be applied by everyone while staying at home, limiting their journeys, avoiding crowded areas, using uncontacted greetings and keeping away from others.
At the moment, many governments are forcing or recommending social exclusion in regions affected by the epidemic.
The maximum number of people gathered recommended by the US government and health organizations was rapidly reduced by 250 people (if no knowledge of COVID-19 transmission is available in one region) to 50 people and then to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public meetings of more than two people. Older adults and those with underlying diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension and compromised immune systems face greater risk of serious diseases and complications, being advised by the CDC to stay at home in areas of community epidemic. At the end of March 2020, WHO and other health institutions began to replace the use of the term "social distance" by "physical distance", to clarify that the aim is to reduce physical contact by maintaining social connections, either virtually or remotely.
The use of the term "social distance" led to the implications that social isolation was needed entirely instead of encouraging contact by other alternative means. Some authorities published sexual health guidelines during the pandemic.
These recommendations include having sex only with someone you live with, who does not have the virus or symptoms.
Self-insulation at home was recommended for those diagnosed with COVID-19 and for those suspected of being infected.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for adequate self-insulation. Many governments have demanded or recommended self-quantity for entire populations living in affected areas.
The most incisive self-quantin instructions were issued to those in high-risk groups.
Individuals who may have been exposed to others with COVID-19 and who have recently travelled to a country or region with large-scale transmissions that make 14 days of self-quantin since the last possible exposure were advised.
The strategies for controlling an exit are retention or suppression and reduction.
Containment is carried out in the preliminary stages of a outbreak and aims to track and isolate the infected, as well as to present other measures to control the infection and vaccines that prevent the spread of the disease to the rest of the population.
When containing the spread of the disease is no longer possible, efforts are being made to reduce: the measures taken now serve to reduce the rate of spread and to reduce its adverse effects on the health system as well as on the population.
Containment and mitigation measures can be taken at the same time, in combination.
The elimination requires more extreme measures to reverse the pandemic to a basic reproductive rate of less than 1. Management of an outbreak of infectious disease, in part, has to do with trying to reduce the peak of the epidemic.
Thus, the risk of overloading health services is reduced, giving more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.
Interventions other than those with pharmaceuticals and which may administer the outcome include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, the use of masks for face and self-quantin; Community measures aimed at physical distance, such as closing schools and cancelling events leading to agglomerations; Community involvement, so as to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; and environmental measures such as cleaning of contact surfaces. More drastic actions, in order to contain the outcome, were taken in China when the severity of the outcome was clear.
Other countries have taken various measures to ensure that the spread of the virus is limited.
South Korea, for example, presented mass screening and localized quarantine. In addition, the government issued warnings about the movement of infected people.
In Singapore, the infected received financial support when they carried out the self-quantin and, for those who did not do so, severe fines were imposed.
In Taiwan, there was an increase in the production of masks for the face and those who stocked medical supplies were punished. Simulations carried out in the United Kingdom and the United States show that the reduction (the reduction in the rate of infection, without stopping the spread of the epidemic) and the suppression (i.e. the reversal of the growth of the epidemic) present major challenges.
Ideal reduction policies can reduce the peak demand for health services by 2/3 and deaths by half. Still, this would result in hundreds of thousands of deaths, while overloading health systems.
The elimination may be the best alternative, but it needs to be maintained while there is movement of the virus by the human population or even the availability of a vaccine, if this happens before. On the contrary, the transmission happens again as soon as the measures are relaxed.
A long-term intervention to eliminate the pandemic brings with it social and economic costs.
There is no approved antiviral medicine that is specific to COVID-19. However, there are efforts to develop medicines, including the existing drug test.
Using medicines for refrigeration that do not require medical prescription, drinking plenty of liquid and rest can help relieve the symptoms.
Depending on the severity of the case, use of oxygen therapy, intravenous insertion of fluids or respiratory aid may be necessary.
The use of steroids may worsen the condition.
Various compounds previously approved to treat other viral diseases are under investigation to be used in the treatment of COVID-19.
The World Health Organization has also stated that some "casual and traditional" medicines can relieve the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19 virus.
WHO describes capacity-building and the adaptation of health care to the needs brought by COVID-19 as basic measures to combat the outbreak.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, ECDC, and the WHO Office in Europe have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary health care services to move their resources at various levels, including the concentration of laboratory services for the testing of COVID-19, the cancellation of non-compulsory procedures and the separation and isolation of patients with positive testing for COVID-19, as well as the increased capacity for intensive care through staff training and the increase in the number of beds and fans available.
There are several theories about the occurrence of the first case (the so-called zero patient).
The first case known in the new coronavirus date of 1 December 2019, in the city of Wuhan, in the province of Hubei, China.
In one month, the number of cases of coronavirus in the region increased gradually.
These cases were largely linked to the Huanan sea fruit attack market. The market also sold live animals, which led to the theory that the virus came from one of these animals. In other words, it was believed that it had a zoonotic origin. On 26 December, a group of patients were observed and treated by Dr. Zhang Jixian at Hubei's provincial hospital. On the following day, the doctor informed Wuhan Jianghan's Center for Disease Prevention and Control.
On December 30, a group of doctors from Wuhan's Central Hospital warned their colleagues about a "SARS-type coronary virus".
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were arrested by the police for spreading false news. Another doctor, Ai Fen, was accused by his superiors for having given the alarm.
On 31 December, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission made a communication to the population and informed WHO.
Cases of pneumonia of unknown origin had already been reported to Wuhan's health authorities to generate an investigation at the beginning of January. During the first stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled every seven and a half days, approximately.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus was spread by other provinces of China, facilitated by the migration of the new Chinese year and by Wuhan’s fact that it was a transport centre, as well as a major railway point.
On January 20, China reported about 140 new cases in one day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzen.
Later official data show that 6,174 people had already developed symptoms by 20 January 2020. On 26 March, the United States exceeded China and Italy, with the largest number of cases confirmed worldwide. On 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 million cases were reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people died and more than 364,000 recovered.
About 200 countries and territories have already had at least one case.
In view of the pandemic in Europe, many countries that are part of the Schengen Treaty have restricted free movement and established border controls.
The country's reactions included detention measures, such as quarantine (also known as home-containment orders, home-containment orders or lockdown) and pick-up touches. On 2 April, about 300 million people (almost 90% of the population) are somehow bordered in the United States, more than 50 million people are bordered in the Philippines, around 59 million people are bordered in South Africa and 1.3 billion people are bordered in India.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people around the world were already in some form of lockdown, which increased to 2.6 billion people two days later, about a third of the world's population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was registered in Wuhan on 1 December 2019. An unconfirmed report suggests an earlier case on 17 November.
Dr. Zhang Jixian observed a group of patients with pneumonia of unknown causes on December 26th. His hospital informed Wuhan Jianghan's Center for Disease Prevention and Control on December 27th.
Initial genetic tests, on 27 December 2019, in samples withdrawn from patients indicated the presence of a SARS-type coronavirus.
A communication to the population was issued by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission on 31 December.
WHO was informed on the same day.
When these notifications occurred, Wuhan's doctors were warned by the police that they would "blow noises" on the exit.
The National Health Commission of China initially claimed that there is no "clear evidence" of transmission between human beings.
At the end of January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign, later described by the Secretary-General of the Chinese Communist Party, Xi Jinping, as a "war of the people", to contain the spread of the virus.
In what was described as "the greatest quarantine of mankind's history", a health cord was announced on January 23rd to interrupt trips from or back to Wuhan, which was extended by 15 cities in Hubei, reaching about 57 million people in total.
The use of private vehicles was prohibited in the city.
The celebrations of the new Chinese year, on 25 January, were cancelled in various locations.
The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, the Huoshenshan Hospital, which was completed in 10 days.
Another hospital, Leishenshan, was later built to care for more patients.
Along with the newly built hospitals, China has turned 14 other Wuhan establishments into temporary hospitals, such as convention centres and stadiums. On 26 January, the government launched more measures to contain the outbreak of COVID-19, including the issue of health statements for travellers and the extension of the Spring Festival holiday.
Universities and schools in the whole country were also closed.
The Hong Kong and Macau regions have taken various measures, particularly with regard to schools and universities.
Remote work measures have been taken in many regions of the country.
Travel restrictions were carried out in and out of Hubei.
Public transport was modified, and museums throughout China were temporarily closed.
Control of the movement of the public was applied in several cities, and it was estimated that some 760 million people (more than half the population) went through some kind of exit restriction. After entering their global phase, in March, the Chinese authorities took strict measures to avoid the "importation" of viruses from other countries.
Beijing, for example, imposed a mandatory 14-day quarantine for all international travelers arriving in the city. On 23 March, mainland China had only one case of domestic transmission in five days, in which case, through a traveler who returned to Guangzhou from Istanbul.
On 24 March 2020, the Chinese premium, Li Keqiang, reported that the spread of domestic transmission cases had been basically blocked and that the outcome had been controlled in China.
On the same day, travel restrictions were reduced in Hubei, except in Wuhan, two months after the lockdown has been imposed. China's Minister for Foreign Affairs announced on 26 March 2020 that the entry of individuals with visa or residence permit would be suspended from 28 March without specific details of when this policy will be closed.
Anyone wishing to enter China will need to apply for visas in Chinese embassies or consulates.
The Chinese government encouraged companies and factories to reopen on March 30, giving financial incentives packages to companies. The State Council declared a day of mourning, starting with a moment of three minutes of silence throughout the country, on April 4 at 10 a.m., meeting with the Qingming Festival. However, the central government asked families to pay their tribute online, observing the physical distance to avoid a new exit from COVID-19.
On 20 January 2020, the spread of COVID-19 from China to South Korea was confirmed.
The national health agency of the country reported a significant increase in the cases confirmed on February 20, largely attributed to a meeting in Daegu of a new religious movement, known as the Church of Jesus of Shincheonji.
It is suspected that the devotees of Shincheonji who visited Daegu came from Wuhan were the source of the exit.
On 22 February, among the 9,336 church followers, 1,261, or about 13% of them, reported symptoms. South Korea declared maximum alert on 23 February 2020.
More than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported on 28 February, reaching 3,150 on 29 February.
All South Korea military bases were placed in quarantine after tests confirmed that three soldiers were positive for the virus.
The timeline of the airlines was also affected and modified. South Korea presented what was considered the world's largest and most well-organized program in terms of population screening for the virus. The country also isolated infected people and traced and placed in quarantine those who came in contact with them.
The screening methods included the mandatory individual report of symptoms for those arriving from international travel through a mobile application, a drive-thru virus test, with results available the following day, as well as increased testing capacity, allowing up to 20,000 people per day to be tested.
South Korea's program is considered a success in the control of the outbreak, although it has not placed entire cities in quarantine. South Korean society was divided initially as regards the response to the crisis given by President Moon Jae-in.
Many Koreans have signed petitions by requesting Moon's impeachment under the alleged mismanagement of the exit, or by raising their reply.
On 23 March, it was reported that South Korea had the total number of cases lower in four weeks.
On 29 March it was announced that as of 1 April all new arrivals from abroad should enter forty-two weeks.
Through media reports on 1 April, South Korea received requests to help with the virus testing in 121 different countries.
Iran confirmed its first cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection on February 19 in Qom, where, according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education, two people died that day.
Early measures announced by the government included the cancellation of concerts and other cultural events, sporting events, and religious events on Fridays, the closure of universities, higher education institutions, and schools.
Iran has five trillion Rials to fight the virus.
President Hassan Rouhani said on 26 February 2020 that he had no plans for the quarantine areas affected by the south, and only individuals would be placed in quarantine.
Plans to limit travel between the cities were announced in March, although a heavy traffic between the cities before the New Year of Persia Nowruz continued.
Shiite shrines in Qom remained open to pilgrims until 16 March 2020. Iran became the center of the spread of the virus after China during February.
In the midst of allegations of the extension of the outbreak in Iran, more than ten countries tracked their cases related to Iran on 28 February, indicating that the extension of the outbreak could be more serious than the 388 cases reported by the Iranian government until that date.
The Iranian Parliament was closed with 23 of its 290 members with a positive test for the virus on 3 March.
On 12 March, Human Rights Watch strongly urged the Iranian prison authorities to unconditionally release human rights defenders held by peaceful dissidentity, and also to temporarily release all eligible prisoners.
The body stated that there is a greater risk of the spread of the virus in closed institutions as detention centres, which also suffer from the lack of medical care.
On 15 March, the Iranian government reported 100 deaths in one day, the largest number since the beginning of the country's exit.
At least 12 politicians in office or retired and government officials died as a result of the disease until March 17.
By March 23, Iran had 50 new cases per hour and a new death every ten minutes due to the Coronavirus.
According to a representative of WHO, there should be five times more cases in Iran than is being reported.
It is suggested that US sanctions imposed on Iran may be affecting the country's financial ability to respond to the viral pandemic.
The High Commissioner for Human Rights has requested that economic sanctions be alleviated to the nations most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
The exit was confirmed as having spread to Italy on January 31, when two Chinese tourists tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Rome.
Cases began to rise abruptly, which led the Italian government to suspend all flights to and from China and declare emergency.
A group not associated with the cases of COVID-19 was subsequently detected, starting with 16 cases confirmed in Lombardy on 21 February. On 22 February, the Council of Ministers announced a decree to contain the outcome, including the quarantine of more than 50,000 people from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said, "In the escape areas, people's entry and exits are prohibited.
The suspension of work activities and sporting events had already been determined in these areas. "On 4 March, the Italian government requested the total closure of all schools and universities across the country when Italy reached 100 deaths.
All major sports events, including the A Series football matches, had to be held at doors closed by April, but on 9 March, all sports events were suspended completely for at least one month.
On 11 March, Prime Minister Conte requested the closure of almost all commercial activities, except supermarkets and pharmacies. On 6 March, the Italian College of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resurrection and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) published recommendations for medical ethics regarding screening protocols that could be used.
On 19 March, Italy passed to China as the country with the most deaths related to Coronavirus in the world after reporting 3,405 pandemic-related deaths.
On 22 March, it was reported that Russia sent nine military aircraft with medical supplies to Italy.
From 5 April, there were 128,948 confirmed cases, 15,887 deaths and 21,815 recovered in Italy, with most of these cases occurring in the Lombardy region.
A CNN report indicated that the combination of an elderly population in Italy and the inability to test all who had the virus until then may have contributed to a high mortality rate.
The United Kingdom's response to the virus first emerged as one of the most vulnerable countries, and by 18 March 2020, the British government had not imposed any form of social distance or quarantine measures in mass to its citizens.
As a result, the government received criticism of the acknowledged lack of diligence and intensity of its response to the problems faced by the population. On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson made a statement in which he advised the interruption of all non-essential travel and social contact, suggesting that people work at home as much as possible and avoid places such as bars, restaurants and theatres.
On 20 March, the government announced that all leisure establishments, such as pubs and academies, should be closed as soon as possible, and committed to paying 80% of workers' salaries up to a limit of 2,500 pounds per month to avoid unemployment during the crisis. On 23 March, the Prime Minister announced more serious social distance measures, preventing accumulations with more than two people and restricting travel and outdoor activities to the minimum necessary.
Different from the previous measures, these restrictions were reinforced by the police through the issue of fines and the dispersion of agglomerations.
Most of the businesses received orders to close, except for businesses considered "essential", including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, ferries shops, gas stations and car office.

On January 28, 2020, the Center for Disease Control — the leading public health institute of the United States government — announced that they had developed their own test kit.
Despite doing so, the United States had a slow start for the tests, which concealed the true extension of the exit at that time.
The test was marked by failed test kits produced by the federal government in February, a lack of approval of the federal government for test kits that were not from the government (academies, companies and hospitals) until the end of February, and restrictive criteria for people who would be tested before the beginning of March (a medical application was required subsequently).
Until February 27, Washington Post reported that less than 4,000 tests had been carried out in the United States.
Until March 13, The Atlantic reported that fewer than 14,000 tests had been carried out.

On the other hand, China's aid was well received in parts of Latin America and Africa. On 2 April, the World Bank launched emergency support operations for developing countries.
WHO commended the efforts of the Chinese authorities to manage and contain the epidemic.
WHO observed the contrast between the emergence of SARS 2002-2004, where the Chinese authorities were accused of neglecting data that made prevention and detention efforts difficult, and the current crisis, where the central government "provided regular updates to avoid the panic near the festivals in the new month year".
On 23 January, in response to the decision of the main authorities to implement a ban on transport in Wuhan, the representative of WHO Gauden Galea observed that "that was certainly not a recommendation from WHO" and was also "a very important indication of the commitment to contain the epidemic in the area where it was most concentrated". On 30 January, following confirmation of the transmission between humans outside China and the increase in the number of cases in other countries, WHO declared the outbreak as the Emergency of Public Health of International Area (PHEIC), the sixth PHEIC since the measure was first invoked during the 2009 swine flu pandemic.
WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom said that PHEC was invoked because of "the risk of global spread, especially in low- and medium-income countries without robust health systems.
In response to the implementation of travel restrictions, Tedros stated that "there is no reason for measures that have unduly interfered with international travel and trade" and that "the WHO does not recommend limiting trade and displacement."
On 5 February, WHO appealed to the global community for a contribution of $675 million to finance strategic preparation in low- and medium-income countries, emphasizing the urgency to assist these countries that "do not have systems in place to detect people who have contracted the virus, even if it comes out".
Tedros made further statements indicating that "we are as strong as our weakest relationship" and asked the international community "to invest now or they will have to pay later". On February 11, WHO established COVID-19 at a press conference as the name of the disease.
On the same day, Tedros stated that the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Antonio Guterres, had agreed to provide the "power of the whole United Nations system as a response".
The United Nations Crisis Management Team was activated as a result, allowing the coordination of the entire United Nations response, which the WHO states will allow them to "focus on the health response while other agencies can enter with their experience in the social, economic and development implications resulting from the outcome".
On 14 February, a Joint WHO Mission Team with China was empowered to provide domestic management assistance to international experts and WHO on land in China and to assess "the severity and communicability of the disease" through workshops and meetings with the main national institutions and to conduct field visits to assess "the impact of response activities on provincial and municipal levels, including urban and rural panoramas". On 25 February, WHO stated that "the world should do more to prepare for a possible pandemic of Coronavirus", declaring that, although it was too early to declare a pandemic, countries should even establish "a preparatory phase".
In response to a development break in Iran, WHO sent a Joint Mission Team to assess the situation. On 28 February, WHO officials said that the assessment of the global Coronavirus threat would be high from "high" to "very high" is the highest level of alert and risk assessment.
Mike Ryan, executive director of the health emergency program, warned in a statement that "This is a statement of reality for every government on the planet: They agree.
This virus can be on the way and you need to be ready," insisting that the right response measures could help the world avoid "the worst".
Ryan also stated that current data did not allow public health officials to declare a global pandemic, saying that such a statement would mean that "we are essentially accepting that every human on the planet will be exposed to this virus."
On 11 March, WHO declared the outbreak of Coronavirus a pandemic.
The Director General said WHO was "deeply concerned about the alarming levels of spread and severity, and about the alarming levels of inflammation". WHO faced many criticisms as an inadequate management of the pandemic, including the late statement of a public health emergency and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.
The response included a request to the Director General of WHO, Tedros Adhanom to submit his resignation, signed by 733 000 people on 6 April.
On 26 March 2020, dozens of United Nations human rights experts emphasized respect for the rights of each individual during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The expert group stated that everyone has the right to intervene to save life and that the government is responsible.
The group stressed that the lack of resources or health plan should never serve as a justification for discrimination against a specific group.
The experts pointed out that each individual has the right to health, including people with disabilities, minorities, elderly people, people with mental problems, uninhabited people living in extreme poverty, people arrested, as well as refugees and other unspecified groups who need government help.
International government organizations are addressing the economic and social impacts of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has launched a platform to provide timely and comprehensive information on political responses in countries around the world, as well as views and advice.
From policies to strengthen health systems and the global economy to address the effects of bordering and restrictions on travel, the digital centre includes a Country Policy Tracker, which helps countries learn from each other and facilitate a coordinated global response to the Coronavirus challenge.
The Chinese government was criticized by the United States, by the UK Cabinet Minister Michael Gove, and by the son of the president of Brazil Jair Bolsonaro, Eduardo Bolsonaro by the management of the pandemic, which started in the Chinese province of Hubei.
Directors at the provincial level of the Communist Party of China (CPC) were dismissed because of their approach to the quarantine-related efforts in Central China, a sign of discontent with the response of the political establishment to the outbreak in these regions.
Some commentators believe that this action was intended to protect the Secretary-General of the Chinese Communist Party Xi Jinping from public wrath in relation to the outbreak of Coronavirus.
Some Chinese officials, e.g. Zhao Lijian, rejected an early recognition of the outbreak of Coronavirus that started in Wuhan, favoring conspiracy theories about COVID-19 from the USA or Italy.
The administration of the United States of Donald Trump referred to the Coronavirus as the "Chinese Virus" or "Wuhan Virus", saying that China's censorship "oversold a virus that now became a global pandemic", which was, in turn, condemned by some critics such as racism and "a way of diverting the failure in administration to contain the disease".
The Daily Beast achieved from a United States government cable a detailed communication strategy with apparent sources in the National Security Council, with a strategy being quoted as "Everything has to do with China.
It was advised that we should try and get these messages in any way, including press conferences and television shows. "Canals such as Politics, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg indicated that China's efforts to send assistance to countries affected by the virus are part of a campaign for global influence.
European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell warned that there is "a geopolitical component including an influence struggle through a trendy and 'generous' policy.
Borrell also said that "China is aggressively spreading the message that, unlike the United States, it is a responsible and reliable partner."
China also requested the United States to suspend its sanctions to Syria, Venezuela and Iran, while allegedly sending assistance to those countries.
Jack Ma's 100 thousand mask donation to Cuba was blocked by United States sanctions on 3 April.
The United States authorities were also accused of diverting aid from other nations to their own country.
And listens to disputes concerning masks related to other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland; and the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey has confiscated hundreds of fans for Spain.
At the beginning of March, the Italian government criticised the lack of solidarity of the European Union with those affected by the Coronavirus in Italy.
Maurizio Massari, Italian ambassador to the European Union, said "Only China responded bilaterally.
Of course, this is not a good sign of European solidarity."
On 22 March, after a telephone call with Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin prepared the Russian military army to send military doctors, special disinfectants, and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa, quoted an anonymous "high-level political source" that 80 percent of Russia's supplies were "useless or of little use to Italy".
The source accused Russia of embarking on an offensive "geopolitical and diplomatic".
The president of the Lombardy region, Attilio Fontana, and the Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio gave the media reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia has also sent a cargo plane with medical supplies to the United States.
Kremlin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said that "when offering help to American colleagues, [Putin] assumes that when American manufacturers of medical equipment and materials are at a good stage, they would also act reciprocally if necessary."
The planned NATO military exercise "Defender 2020" in Germany, Poland and the Baltic States, NATO's largest military exercise since the end of the Cold War, will be maintained on a reduced scale.
The Secretary-General for the Nuclear Disarmament Campaign, Kate Hudson, criticised the Defender 2020 exercise: "In the current public health crisis, this endangers lives not only of the United States troops and of the various European countries that are participating, but of the inhabitants of the countries in which they operate." The Iranian government was strongly affected by the virus, with about a dozen members of the infected parliament, as well as fifteen political figures in the exercise or ex-political process.
Iran's President Hassan Rouhani wrote a public letter to the world's leaders, asking for help on 14 March 2020, saying that his country is having difficulties fighting the outbreak due to the lack of access to international markets as a result of United States sanctions against Iran. The outbreak led the United States to adopt common social policies in other developed countries, including universal health care, universal child care, paid family leave, and high levels of public health funding.
Political analysts anticipate that this may negatively affect Donald Trump's chances of re-election as president in the 2020 elections. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea have worsened due to the pandemic.
South Korea criticised Japan's ambitious and passive quarantine efforts, after Japan announced that anyone from South Korea would be placed in a forty-two weeks' space designated by the government.
South Korean society was initially polarized about President Moon Jae's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions asking for Moon's impeachment in relation to those they called out inadequate management, or praising their response. The pandemic allowed countries to approve emergency laws as an answer.
Some commentators expressed concerns that this could allow governments to strengthen their control over power.
In Hungary, Parliament voted in such a way as to allow Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to rule by decree indefinitely, to suspend Parliament as well as the elections and to punish those deemed false news about the virus and the management of the crisis by the government.
The outbreak of Coronavirus has been blamed for several cases of shortage of supplies, as a result of the increased use of equipment in a global way to combat the outbreaks, panic-driven purchases, and disruption of operations in factories and logistics.
The Food and Administration of the United States has issued notices on the shortage of medicines and medical equipment due to increased consumption and disruption of the supplier.
Several locals also experienced the event of panic-driven purchases which led to empty dishes of essential products such as food, toilet paper, bottled water, including lack of supplies.
The technology industry in particular has warned about delays in sending electronic products.
According to WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom, the demand for personal protective equipment rose 100 times.
This demand led to an increase in prices of up to twenty times the normal price and also led to delays in supplying medical items for four to six months.
This also caused a shortage of personal protective equipment worldwide, with WHO's warning that this would put workers' health at risk.
In Australia, the pandemic provided a new opportunity for Chinese buyers to sell Australian products in China.
The activity created a shortage of formulas for babies in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian government. Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in northern Italy and in the Wuhan region, and the resulting high demand for food products, both areas were spared acute food shortages.
Measures taken by China and Italy against the illegal storage and trade in essential products have been successful, avoiding the shortage of food that was planned in Europe, as well as in North America.
The North of Italy with its significant agricultural production did not notice a major reduction, but prices may increase according to industry representatives.
Empty dishes were found only temporarily, even in the city of Wuhan, and Chinese government officials released pig meat reserves to ensure sufficient food for the population.
Similar laws exist in Italy, requiring food producers to keep reserves for such emergencies.
A damage to the global economy was significant in China: according to a media report on 16 March, the economy in China was very affected in the first two months of 2020 due to government measures to reduce the spread of the virus, and sales in the market fell by 20.5%.
As Continental China is a large economy and manufacturing center, the viral output was seen as a major threat to the global economy.
Agathe Demarais of The Economist's intelligence unit predicted that markets would remain volatile until a clearer picture emerges on possible results.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic impact of the epidemic on global growth could exceed the outbreak of the SARS 2002-2004.
An estimate by a specialist at the University of Washington in St. Louis indicated an impact of $300 billion on the supply chain of the world that could last up to two years.
The Organization of Oil Exporting Countries (OECO) allegedly "confused" after a sharp decline in oil prices due to low demand from China.
Global stock markets fell on 24 February due to a significant increase in the number of cases of COVID-19 outside Continental China.
On 27 February, due to the growing concerns about the emergence of the Coronavirus, several indices of the US stock exchange including NASDAQ-100, S&P 500, and the average of the Dow Jones industry have shown its most expressive decreases since 2008, with the Dow drop of 1,191 points, the biggest drop in one day since the 2007-08 financial crisis.
All three other indices ended the week with a lower than 10%.
On 28 February, Scope Ratings GmbH confirmed China's sovereign credit rating, but maintained a negative outlook.
The actions fell again on the basis of the concerns with the coronavirus, the biggest fall on 16 March.
Many consider a likely economic recession.
Economist Mohammed El-Erian praised the early emergency measures of the central states and banks.
The central banks are reacting faster than they did to the 2008 financial collapse.
Tourism is one of the most affected sectors due to travel restrictions, closing public places including tourist points, and recommending governments against any travel around the world.
As a result, many airlines cancelled their flights due to low demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines, and Qantas, while the British regional airline Flybe crashed.
The impact on the cruise sector was from a level never seen.
Several train stations and balsa ports were also closed.
The epidemic coincided with Chunyun, a large travel station associated with the New Chinese Year's holiday.
Several events involving large crowds were cancelled by national and regional governments, including the New Year's annual festivals, with private companies also independently closing their tourist shops and attractions such as Disneyland in Hong Kong and Shanghai.
Many events of the New Year Lunar and tourist attractions were closed to avoid mass accumulations, including the Forbidden City in Beijing and traditional temple events.
In 24 of the 31 provinces of China, municipalities and regions, the authorities extended the New Year's holiday to 10 February, instructing most of the workplaces not to reopen until this date.
These regions represented 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong has increased its level of response to infectious disease to the highest level and declared emergency, closing schools until March and canceling its New Year celebrations. The retail sector has been affected globally, with reductions in the schedules of shops or temporary closures.
Visits to sellers in Europe and Latin America fell by 40%.
The North and Middle East salesmen observed a 50-60% drop.
This also resulted in a 33-43% fall in pedestrian traffic to trade centres in March compared to February.
The operators of Shopping Centers around the world have imposed additional measures, such as greater cleaning, the installation of thermal scanners to check the temperature of buyers, and the cancellation of events. According to the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, it is estimated that the recession caused by the pandemic could leave more people in extreme poverty in Latin America than would happen in situations without the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, during the outbreak in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Many of China's 300 million migrant rural workers have been left at home in the provinces of the interior or in the province of Hubei. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and requested government assistance.
The collapse of the Coronavirus could cost 47 million jobs in the United States and the unemployment rate could reach 32%, according to estimates from the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank. The border in India has left tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (which are paid through daily remuneration) unemployed. A survey by the Angus Reid Institute found that 44% of Canadian families have gone through some kind of unemployment. Nearly 900,000 workers have lost their jobs in Spain since the country adopted the border in mid-March 2020.
During the second 50th of March, 4 million French workers applied for unemployment assistance and 1 million British workers applied for a universal credit scheme. Nearly half a million companies in Germany placed their workers under reduced-time work programmes subsidized by the government known as Kurzabeit.
The German reduced-time wage programme was adopted by France and Great Britain.
The sectors of performatic art and cultural heritage were deeply affected by the pandemic, affecting the operations of organizations, as well as people - both employed and independent - worldwide.
The arts and cultural sector organizations have tried to maintain their mission (often publicly funded) to provide access to cultural heritage for the community, to maintain the safety of their employees and the public and to assist artists whenever possible.
In March 2020, by the world and at various levels, museums, libraries, performance sites, and other cultural institutions were permanently closed with their exhibitions, events and performances cancelled or delayed.
In response, intensive efforts were made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent and highly accelerated impact is the cancellation of religious services, major sporting events, and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technological conferences and fashion events.
The film sector also experienced an interruption. The Vatican announced that the rites of the Holy Week in Rome, which would occur during the last week of the Christian Lent period, had been cancelled.
Many dioceses recommended that older Christians stay at home than attend Mass on Sundays; some churches provided the services of the church via radio, live streaming online or by television while others offer cults of drive-in style.
With the Catholic Diocese of Rome closing its churches and chapels and the square of St. Peter empty without Christian pilgrims, other religious bodies also cancelled the services and limited public accumulations in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gardwaras.
The Ministry of Health of Iran announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in areas affected by the outbreak and sanctuaries were subsequently closed, while Saudi Arabia banned the entry of foreign pilgrims, as well as its residents in holy places in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused the most significant interruption in the world sports calendar since World War II.
Most of the major events were cancelled or postponed, including the UEFA Championships League 2019-2020, the 2019-2020 Premier League, the 2019-2020 NBA season, and the 2019-2020 NHL season.
The break interfered in the plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, originally scheduled to start at the end of July; the International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that the event would be "re-designated for a date after 2020, but not after the summer of 2021". Casinos and other venues of games around the world were closed and attendance poker tournaments were also delayed or cancelled.
This led many players to play online, with various online games sites reporting significant increases in their new registration rates. The entertainment industry was also affected, with several music groups suspending or canceling their tournaments.
Many big theaters like Broadway also canceled all the shows.
Some artists have explored ways to continue to produce and share their work on the Internet as an alternative to traditional live presentations, such as live broadcast shows or by creating online "festivals" for artists to present themselves, share and disseminate their work.
On-line, several memes on the Internet about the coronavirus are spread, as many seek humor and entertainment in the middle of uncertainty.
Since the emergence of COVID-19, there has been an increase in prejudice, xenophobia and racism against people of Chinese or East Asia, and against people of the focus areas in Europe, the United States and other countries.
Incidents of fear, mistrust, and hostility have been observed in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America, and the Pacific region.
Results from February (when most cases were still restricted to China) recorded racist feelings expressed in various groups around the world about the Chinese people deserve the virus or are receiving a fair punishment for what they caused.
Some countries in Africa have also identified an increase in anti-Chinese sentiment.
Many Wuhan and Hubei inhabitants reported discrimination based on their regional origin.
This has been supported by Chinese, both online and offline, and is directed to those in the areas affected by the virus.
After the emergence in new countries of focus, the citizens of Italy, the first country in Europe to experience a serious outbreak of COVID-19, could also be subject to mistrust and xenophobia. Citizens of countries including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea initially signed petitions pressuring the Chinese entry ban in their countries in an attempt to contain the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan went to the Trending Topics of Twitter.
The Chinese people, as well as other Asians in the United Kingdom and the United States, reported increasing levels of racist abuse, as well as attacks.
The president of the United States, Donald Trump, was the target of criticism because he referred to the coronavirus as the "Chinese virus", a term considered by critics as racist and anti-Chinese.
Showcases in Ukraine attacked buses carrying Ukrainians and aliens evacuated from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhary.
Students from northeastern India, bordering China, and students in the large cities of India allegedly suffered persecution related to the emergence of coronavirus.
The president of the unit in the state of Bharatiya Janata Party in Western Bengal, Dilip Ghosh, stated that the Chinese destroyed nature and "that is why God turned against them".
The comments were then condemned by the Chinese consulate in Calcutta, who called it "misconstituted". In China, xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese inhabitants were inflamed by the pandemic, with foreigners called "foreign trash" and targets of "waste".
Many newspapers with paid access removed them from some or all coverages about the coronavirus.
Several scientific editors have made available scientific articles related to exit with open access.
Some scientists have chosen to share their conclusions as soon as possible on preprint servers such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory analyses for the respiratory disease of the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and the associated SARS virus - CoV-2 include methods that detect the presence of the virus and those that detect antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of the virus in samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects the coronavir RNA.
This test is specific and developed only to detect the RNA of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infections.
Antibody detection (sorology) can be used for the diagnosis and monitoring of the population.
Antibody tests reveal how many people have had the disease, including those whose symptoms were very mild to be reported or were asymptomatic.
A precise rate of mortality of the disease and the level of immunity of the herd in the population can be determined from the results of this test.
Due to the limited testing, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population in March 2020.
On 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and there were considerable variations in the number of tests carried out in the countries.
This variability is likely to still significantly affect the mortality rates of cases recorded, which can be significantly overestimated in some countries.
Using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), the test can be performed in respiratory samples obtained by various methods, including nasopharyngeal smear or saliva sample.
Results are usually available within a few hours or within 2 days.
The RT-PCR test carried out with fermentation is reliable only in the first week of the disease.
Later, the virus may disappear in the throat as it continues to multiply in the lungs.
For infected people tested in the second week, as an alternative, the sample material may be removed from the bottom of the respiratory pathways by suction catheter or material emitted by anticipation (segregation) may be used.
One of the first PCR tests was developed in Charité, Berlin, in January 2020 using the polymerase chain reaction with reverse transcription in real time (rRT-PCR), and serves as a basis for 250,000 kits for distribution by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The UK also developed a test on 23 January 2020. South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a clinical type, a SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on PCR (PowerCheck Coronavirus) on 28 January 2020.
He is looking for the gene "E" shared by all beta coronaviruses, and the RdRp gene, specific to SARS-CoV-2. In China, the BGI group was one of the first companies to receive the approval for emergency use of the National Medical Administration of China for PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit. In the United States, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is distributing its innovative diagnostic panel for the Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) of RT-PCR in real time for public health laboratories by the International Reagent Resource.
One of the three genetic tests in older versions of test kits generated inconclusive tests based on fail reagents, and an obstacle to CDC testing in Atlanta; this resulted in an average of less than 100 samples per day being successfully processed throughout February 2020.
Tests using two components were not considered reliable until 28 February 2020, and only from then on local and state laboratories were allowed to start the tests.
The test was approved by Food and Drug Administration under an emergency permit. The commercial laboratories started the tests at the beginning of March 2020.
With effect from 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced the national availability of the test for COVID-19 based on RT-PCR.
Quest Diagnostics also made the tests for COVID-19 nationally available from 9 March 2020.
No quantity restriction was announced; sampling and processing should be carried out in accordance with the requirements of the CDC.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the State Research Centre in Virology and Biotechnology, VECTOR.
On 11 February 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Health Service. On 12 March 2020, Mayo Clinic claimed to have developed a test to detect infection by COVID-19. On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received an FDA approval for a test that could be carried out within 3.5 hours on a wide scale, allowing a machine to process approximately 4,128 tests within a 24 hour period.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorisation (USA) for Abbott laboratories for a test in the Abbott m2000 system; the FDA previously issued an authorisation for Hologia, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Cepheid also received an FDA US for a test of approximately 45 minutes.
The FDA approved a test using isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology instead of PCR.
Since it does not require a series of alternate cycles of temperature, this method can generate positive results in only five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 of these machines in the United States and Abbott expects to increase production to provide 50,000 tests per day. A test that uses a monoclonal antibody and the particular binding to the protein of the new coronavirus (protein N) is being developed in Taiwan, with the expectation of providing results in 15-20 minutes such as a rapid flu test.
A literature review in March 2020 concluded that "torax radiographics have a lower diagnosis value in the initial stages, while CT findings, computerized tomography, may be present even before symptoms arise".
Typical features in TC include double-lobular opaques in dark glass with a later, peripheral and asymmetrical distribution.
Subpleural domination, mosaic paving and consolidation evolve according to the progressive disease.
A study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan at the point of origin of the current pandemic suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, with many of its aspects of image matching other pneumonias and pathological processes.
From March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that "TC should not be used for screening or as a first line test to diagnose COVID-19". Since March 2020, the CDC recommends PCR for an initial check.
Part of the immune response to the infection is the production of antibodies including IgM and IgG.
These can be used to detect infection in individuals started 7 days ago or shortly after symptoms arise, to determine immunity, and to monitor the population. The tests can be performed in central laboratories (CLTs) or through remote laboratory tests (PCTs).
Automated high-performance systems in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform these tests, but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
For CLT, a single peripheral blood sample is commonly used, although numerous samples can be used to monitor the immune response.
For PoCT, a single blood sample is usually obtained by skin puncture.
Unlike PCR methods, the collection stage is not necessary before the test. On 26 March 2020, the FDA indicated 29 entities that notified the agency, as required, and are now able to distribute their antibody tests.
From 7 April 2020, only one test was approved by the FDA with an emergency clearance. At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European approvals for their test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies for the virus in blood samples.
The test capacity is several hundred samples per hour and therefore much faster than conventional viral RNA PCR tests.
The antibodies are normally detected 14 days after the start of the infection. At the beginning of April, the United Kingdom considered that none of the antibody test kits acquired were suitable enough to be used.
Hong Kong organized a system in which suspected patients may stay at home, "the emergency department will give a sample tube to the patient", they should expel saliva into the tube, send it back and get a result shortly afterwards. British NHS announced that it is coordinating a system to test the suspected cases at home, which eliminates the risk of a patient to infect others if they are at the hospital or the need to disinfect an ambulance if anything is used. In drive-thru tests for COVID-19 in suspected cases, a health professional collects samples taking appropriate precautions.
Drive-thru centers have helped South Korea perform some of the fastest and most comprehensive tests in one country. In Germany, the National Association of Health Insurance Medical Statutory Health Insurance said on 2 March that it had the capacity for about 12,000 tests per day in outpatient care, while 10,700 had been tested in the previous week.
Costs are charged to health insurance when the test is requested by a doctor.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity for 160 thousand tests per week.
Since 19 March, drive-in tests have been offered in several major cities.
Since 26 March 2020, the total number of tests carried out in Germany remains unknown, since only positive tests are recorded.
The first research laboratory revealed that since the 12th week of 2020 a total of, at least, 483.295 samples were tested until the 12th week of 2020 and 33,491 samples (6.9%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, researchers from the Technion and Rambam hospitals developed and tested a method to test samples of 64 patients simultaneously, collecting samples and performing additional tests only if the combined sample was considered positive. In Wuhan, an improvised 2000 m2 laboratory for emergency detection called "Huo-Yan" (Chinese: ., or "Fire Eye" in English) was opened on February 5, 2020 by BGI, which can process more than 10,000 samples per day.
With the construction supervised by the Founder of BGI, Wang Jian, and taking 5 days, the modeling revealed that cases in Hubei would have been 47% higher and the corresponding cost to deal with the quarantine would have doubled if this testing capacity had not an online access.
Wuhan laboratory was promptly followed by Huo-Yan laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities throughout China.
On 4 March 2020, the total daily income was 50,000 tests per day. Multiple open-source models released by Origami Assays were launched as testing capability up to 1.122 samples of patients for COVID-19, using only 93 tests. These balanced models can be executed in small laboratories without the need for robot handling for liquids.
In March, the shortage or insufficient amount of reagent has become an obstacle to mass testing in the European Union, the United Kingdom and the United States.
This led some authors to study the protocols for the preparation of samples involving the heating of samples at 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release RNA genomes for additional tests. On 31 March, it was announced that the United Arab Emirates is now conducting more tests per capita in its population for Coronavirus than in other countries, and would be about to increase the level of testing and reach most of the population.
This was due to a combination of drive-thru capacity, and the acquisition of a laboratory for mass processing on a population scale of Group 42 and BGI (inspired by its emergency detection laboratories "Huo-Yan" in China).
Built in 14 days, the laboratory is able to conduct tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the world's first to operate outside China.
Different methods of testing for different components of the coronavirus genetic profile were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization adopted Germany's method of manufacturing sent kits for low-income countries that do not have the means to develop their own.
The German method was published on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the United States Disease Control Centre was not available until 28 January, there was a delay in the tests available for the United States and for China and the United States faced problems with the reliability of test kits well at the beginning of the outbreak, and these countries near Australia were unable to provide sufficient kits to meet the demand and recommendations for testing made by health professionals.
On the other hand, experts say that the widespread availability of South Korea for testing helped to reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
The testing capacity, largely in the private sector laboratories, has been consolidated over many years by the Government of South Korea.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization indicated the strengthening of testing programs as the best way to delay the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic. The high demand for tests due to the widespread spread of the virus caused the delay of hundreds of thousands of tests in private laboratories in the United States, and the supply of cotton and chemical reagents was affected.
In March 2020, China reported problems with accuracy in its test kits.
In the United States, the test kits developed by the CDC presented "failures"; the government then removed the bureaucratic barriers that prevented the individual tests. Spain acquired tests kits from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but considered the inaccurate results.
The company explained that incorrect results could be the result of a failure in sampling or incorrect use of the kits.
The Minister of Spain stated that he would cancel the wrong results-generating kits and replace them with a different test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the test kits that the Czech Republic purchased from China produced wrong results. Slovakia acquired 1.2 million Chinese test kits considered inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matovic suggested that they should be discarded in Denmark. Ates Kara of the Ministry of Health of Turkey said that Turkey's test kits purchased from China had a "high error rate" and that they would not "use them". The United Kingdom acquired 3.5 million test kits from China, but in early April 2020 announced that they were not useful.
The test, followed by the quarantine of those who tested positive and the monitoring of those with whom the positive people for SARS-CoV-2 had contact, had positive results.
The researchers who work in the Italian city of Vó, the site of the first death by COVID-19 in Italy, conducted two testing stages of the entire population of approximately 3,400 people, with an interval of about ten days.
About half of the people who tested positive had no symptoms, and all the discovered cases were placed in quarantine.
With the move to the restricted community, this completely eliminated new infections.
With aggressive contact monitoring, travel restrictions to the country, testing and quarantine, the crown virus pandemic in Singapore in 2020 has advanced much slower than in other developed countries, and without radical restrictions such as the mandatory closure of restaurants and sales establishments.
Many events were canceled, and Singapore began to give serious advice to the residents to stay at home on March 28, but the schools reopened within the planned after the holidays on March 23.
Many other countries have also administered the pandemic with aggressive contact monitoring, travel restrictions to the country, testing and quarantine, but with less aggressive lockdowns, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study identified that countries that conducted more tests than the number of deaths had lower mortality rates, probably because these countries are more able to detect those with no or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries that have no testing capacity and have national laboratories with limited experience in COVID-19 send their first five positive samples and the first ten negative samples for one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for confirmatory tests.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following table, the "Possible in % of test" column is influenced by the country testing policy.
A country that tests only hospitalized people will have a higher percentage of positive tests than a country that has tested all citizens, whether they present them or not, the other characteristics are equivalent.
Hand washing (or hand cleaning), also known as hand hygiene, is the act of washing hands with the aim of removing dirt, fat, microorganisms, or other undesirable substances.
The washing of hands with soap constantly in certain "critical moments" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhoea and cholera, which are transmitted by golden-fetal route.
People may also be infected with respiratory diseases such as flu or a common cold, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching the eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucous membranes).
The five crucial moments during the day when washing hands with soap are important include: before and after defecation, after cleaning the baby’s cotton or changing strawberries, before feeding a child, before meals and before and after preparing the food or handling meat, fresh or raw fish.
If water and soap are not available, hands can be treated with ashes. The World Health Organization recommends hand hygiene:
Before, during and after preparing the food.
Before and after taking care of a sick person.
After swapping or cleaning up a child who has used the bathroom.
After the nose is soaked, coughing or sneezing.
After touching animals, ration or animal waste.
The clinical hygiene of the hands refers to hygiene practices related to medical procedures.
Hand washing before administering medicines or medical care may prevent or minimize the spread of diseases.
The main objective of washing hands is to clean the hands of pathogens (bacterials, viruses, or other microorganisms that may cause diseases) and chemicals that may cause damage or diseases.
This is particularly important for people who handle food or work in the medical field, but it is also an important practice for the general public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronation and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhoea; reducing respiratory infections;
and reducing the infant mortality rate in births at home.
A 2013 study revealed that best hand washing practices can cause small improvements in the growth of children under five years of age.
In developed countries, infant mortality rates related to diarrhoea and respiratory diseases can be reduced by simply introducing behavioral changes, such as washing hands with soap.
This simple attitude can reduce the mortality rate of these diseases by almost 50%.
Interventions that promote hand washing can reduce diarrhoea episodes in about one third, which is comparable to providing clean water for areas with no need.
48% of the decreases in diarrhoea episodes may be associated with hand washing with soap. Hand washing with soap is the most effective and economic way to prevent diarrhoea and acute respiratory infections (IRAs), as automatic behavior in homes, schools, and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, the main IRA, is the first cause of mortality among children under five years of age, taking the lives of estimated 1.8 million children per year.
Diarrhoea and combined pneumonia are responsible for nearly 3.5 million deaths of children annually.
According to UNICEF, changing the washing of hands with soap before eating and after using the bathroom as a root habit can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, reducing diarrhoea deaths by almost half and acute respiratory infections in one room.
Hand washing is usually associated with other health interventions as part of the water, sanitation and hygiene programs (WASH).
Hand washing also protects against the impetigo that is transmitted by direct physical contact.
A less significant negative effect of hand washing is that frequent hand washing can cause skin lesions due to skin resuscitation.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing can cause a condition of decommissioning and irritation in the skin known as eczema or hand dermatitis, which is particularly common among health system workers.
The frequent washing of hands is also perceived as one of the symptoms of compulsive obsessive disorder (TOC).
There are five crucial moments during the day when washing hands with soap is important to reduce the fecal-oral transmission of diseases: after using the bathroom (miction, defection), after cleaning a child's cotton (change strawberries), before feeding a child, before eating and before/after preparing a meal or handling meat, fish or ham.
Other situations when the correct technique for hand washing should be practiced in order to prevent transmission of diseases include the first and after treating a cut or injury; after snorting, coughing or snorting the nose; after touching animal waste or dealing with animals; and after touching trash.
In many countries, there is a reduced rate of hand washing with soap.
A study on hand washing in 54 countries in 2015 found that, on average, 38.7% of families had the habit of washing hands with soap. A 2014 study revealed that Saudi Arabia had the highest index with 97%; the United States was close to the average with 77%; and China with the lowest index with 23%. Several methods for behavioral changes are currently in place to increase acceptance of the habit of washing hands with soap in critical periods. Collective hand washing for children in schools in certain periods of the day is an alternative in developing countries to institute hand washing in children’s habits.
The "Basic Health Services Program" implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of a large-scale action to promote children's health and education.
Disparasization twice a year, supplemented by washing hands daily with soap, brushing teeth daily with fluorine, are at the heart of this national program.
It was also successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The removal of skin microorganisms is reinforced by adding soaps and detergents to the water.
The main action of soaps and detergents is to reduce barriers to solution, and increase solubility.
Water alone is an inefficient cleaning agent for the skin, because fats and proteins, organic soil components, are not easily dissolved in water.
Cleaning is, however, facilitated by a reasonable flow of water...
The bar soap, depending on its reusable nature, can retain the accumulated bacteria from previous uses.
A small number of studies that analyzed the bacterial transmission of a contaminated soap concluded that transmission is unlikely as bacteria are encased with foam.
The CDC repeats "liquid soap with automatic dosing commands is preferable".
Antibacterial soaps were widely disseminated to the public conscious in terms of health.
Until now, there is no evidence that the use of recommended antiseptics or disinfectants may lead to the selection of antibodies resistant organisms in nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents, such as triclosan, which has an extensive list of resistant strains of organisms.
Thus, although antibiotics-resistant strains are not selected by antibacterial soaps, they may not be as effective as they are disclosed.
In addition to surfactants and skin protection agents, complex formulas may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as pH regulator, active antimicrobial benzoic acid and other skin hydrants (aloe vera, vitamins, mentol, plant extracts). A comprehensive analysis of the University of Oregon School of Public Health indicated that common soaps are as effective in preventing diseases and removing hand bacteria as antibacterial soaps turned to the final consumer containing triclosan.
Hot water that is comfortable for hand washing is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
The bacteria grow faster at body temperature (37 °C).
However, hot water with soap is more effective than cold water with soap to remove the natural oiliness that holds dirt and bacteria.
Unlike popular belief, however, scientific studies have revealed that using hot water is not effective in reducing microbial load in the hands.
A hand hygienic or antiseptic is a non-aqueous base hand hygienic agent.
At the end of the 1990s and the beginning of the 21st century, non-aqueous basic hand hygiene agents (also known as hand hygiene products based on alcohol, hand hygiene product antiseptic, or hand hygiene) began to gain popularity.
Most are made from isopropyl alcohol or ethanol formulated with a thickening agent, such as carbomer (polymer or acrylic acid), in gel, or a moisturizer, such as glycerine, in liquid, or foam to facilitate the use and reduce the effect of alcohol drying.
The addition of hydrogen peroxide increases antimicrobial activity. Hand hygieneists with a minimum of 60 to 95% of alcohol kill germs efficiently.
Alcohol-based hygienics kill bacteria, multi-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis, and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis) and fungus.
Alcohol-based hygienics containing 70% of alcohol kill 99.97% (a reduction of 3.5 logarithms, similar to a reduction of 35 drops) of bacteria in the hands, 30 seconds after their application and 99.99% to 99.99% (a reduction of 4 to 5 logarithms) of bacteria in the hands 1 minute after their application. Hand hygienics are more effective against bacteria and less effective against some viruses.
Hand salinizers based on alcohol are almost totally ineffective against the norovirus virus (or Norwalk), the most common cause of contagious gastroenteritis. Antiseptics for hands or alcohol-based hygienics can be used to wet or cover both hands well.
The back and palms of the hands, between their fingers and their ends, are fried for approximately 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel is dry.
The fingertips should also be well washed, being rubbed with both palms. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand washing with hand sanitizers, especially when hands are visually dirty.
The increasing use of these agents is based on their ease of use and rapid exterminating action against microorganisms; however, they should not replace the proper washing of hands unless soap and water are available.
The frequent use of hand hygienics based on alcohol may cause skin resuscitation, unless emulsifiers and/or skin hydrants are added to the formula.
The effect of alcohol drying may be reduced or eliminated by the addition of glycerin and/or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, hand hygienics containing emollients caused significantly less irritation and resuscitation in the skin than antimicrobials or detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome or hypersensitivity to alcohol or the additives present in hand-based alcoholic hygiene rarely occur.
The lower tendency to provoke irritative contact dermatitis became an attractive compared to washing hands with water and soap.
Despite its effectiveness, non-aqueous basic agents do not clean the organic hands, just disinfect them.
That is why hand hygienics are not as effective as water and soap to prevent the spread of many pathogens, since pathogens are still in the hands.
The effectiveness of hand-free hand hygienics is extremely dependent on substances and formulation, and historically it has been very acute of alcohol and alcohol-based hygienics.
More recently, formulations using benzalconium chloride revealed to have continuous and cumulative antimicrobial action after application, different from alcohol, which revealed to have reduced efficacy after recurrent use, probably due to increasing adverse reactions in the skin.
Many people in low-income communities cannot afford a soap and instead use ashes or land.
Ash or soil may be more effective than pure water, but may be less effective than you taste.
One concern is that if soil or ashes are contaminated with microorganisms the spread of the disease may increase rather than decrease.
Like soap, ashes are also a disinfectant, since in contact with water it forms an alkaline solution.
WHO recommends ashes and sand as an alternative to soap when there is no soap.
The correct technique for hand washing recommended by the U.S. Disease Control Centre to prevent disease transmission includes the following steps:
Swallow your hands with cold or hot running water.
Current water is recommended as fixed washbasins may be contaminated, while the water temperature does not appear to be relevant.
Squash your hands, frying them with a generous amount of soap, including the back of your hands, the space between your fingers and under your wings.
The soap removes the germs from the skin, and studies reveal that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when using soap instead of pure water.
Squeeze for at least 20 seconds.
The act of rubbing generates friction, which helps to remove the germs from the skin, and rubbing for a longer time removes more germs.
Swallow well with running water.
Washing in a pais can recontaminate your hands.
Dry with a dry towel or let dry in the open air.
Wet hands or wet hands are more easily recontaminated. The most commonly forgotten areas are thumb, pulse, areas between fingers and under legs.
An artificial and left enamel can shelter microorganisms.
Wetting lotion is often recommended to keep hands hydrated; dry skin can cause skin lesions that may increase the risk of transmission of infection.
Several low-cost options can be made to facilitate hand washing where there is no running water and/or soap, for example, to pour water from a gallon or cook with appropriate orifices and/or to use ashes if necessary in developing countries. In situations with limited water supply (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are solutions to store water, such as "improvised towers" and other low-cost options.
An improvised tournament is a simple technology that uses a rope suspended by a rope, and an avalanche operated by the feet to discharge a small amount of water in the hands and a soap bar.
The effective drying of hands is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but there is a discussion about the most effective way for drying in public bathrooms.
A growing volume of research suggests that toilet paper is much more hygienic than hand dryers found in many bathrooms.
In 2008, a study was conducted by the University of Westminster, London, and sponsored by the toal paper industry, European Tissue Symposium, to compare the levels of hygiene presented by the toal paper, hand dryers with heated air and the most modern hand dryers with air jet.
After washing and drying hands with hot air dryer, the total number of bacteria was considered, on average, 194% higher in the palm area near the fingers and 254% higher in the rest of the palm.
Drying with air-jet dryers caused an increase in the total number of bacteria, on average, of 42% in the palm area near the fingers and about 15% in the rest of the palm.
After washing and drying hands with toilet paper, the total number of bacteria was reduced, on average, by up to 76% in the palm area near the fingers and up to 77% in the rest of the palm. Researchers also performed tests to determine whether there was potential cross-contamination between other users and the bathroom environment as a result of each type of drying method.
The air-jet dryer, which projectes air out of the unit at specified speeds of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), managed to expel microorganisms from the hands and the unit by potentially contaminating other users of the bathroom and the environment up to 2 metres away.
The use of hot air hand dryer spreads microorganisms to up to 0.25 meters of the dryer.
The toilet paper did not present a significant spread of microorganisms. In 2005, in a study conducted by TÜV Product and Umwelt, different methods for hand drying were evaluated.
The following changes in bacterial count after hand drying were observed:
There are many different hand dryer manufacturers, and hand dryers were compared to drying with toilet paper.
Hand washing with hand-washed washers is an alternative to the lack of soap and water during trips.
Hand salinizers based on alcohol shall contain at least 60% of alcohol.
The clinical washing of hands became mandatory much after Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) in the prevention of diseases in the hospital environment.
There are electronic devices that provide feedback to remember the hospital team to wash their hands when they forget.
One study found that the rates of infection were reduced with their use.
The clinical washing of the hands is for at least 15 seconds, using generous amounts of soap and water or gel to taste and rub all parts of the hands.
The hands should be rubbed simultaneously with the intertwining of the fingers.
If there are residues under the eggs, a brush can be used to remove them.
As germs can stay in the water in their hands, it is important to sew well and dry with a clean towel.
After drying, the towel paper must be used to close the towel (and open the door, if necessary).
This avoids hand contamination by these surfaces.
The aim of hand washing in the medical care environment is to remove pathogen microorganisms ("germes") and avoid transmission.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the lack of hand washing remains at unacceptable levels in most medical settings, with a large number of doctors and nurses constantly forgetting to wash their hands before touching patients, thus transmitting microorganisms.
One study revealed that proper hand washing and other simple procedures can reduce the rate of blood flow infections related to catheter by 66 percent. The World Health Organization published a bulletin demonstrating the pattern of hand washing and friction in the health system sectors.
The organization's hand hygiene guidance project can also be found on this site for comments.
An applicable review was carried out by Whitby et al.
Commercial devices may measure and validate hand hygiene if required to demonstrate regulatory compliance.
The World Health Organization defines "five moments" for hand washing:
after exposure to body fluids/sanguinos
before an ascetic task; and
the addition of antiseptic chemicals to the soapet (medicines or antimicrobials) gives an exterminating action to a hand washing agent.
Such exterminating action may be desirable before performing surgery or in situations in which antibiotic-resistant organisms are predominant. To "clean" hands for a surgical operation it is necessary to have a tournament that can be opened and closed without touching hands, some antiseptics of chloroxidin or iodine, sterilized towels to dry hands after washing, and a sterilized brush for cleaning and other instruments sterilized for cleaning under the wings.
All jewelry must be removed.
This procedure requires the washing of hands and forearms to the elbows, usually 2-6 minutes.
A very long time of cleaning (10 minutes) is not necessary.
At the time of washing, the water in the forearms should not flow into the hands.
After hand washing is finished, the hands are played with a sterilized towel and the surgical bat is dressed.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is better to wash your hands or use an antiseptic for your hands before and after treating a sick person.
For the control of staphylococcus infections in hospitals, it was found that there was a greater benefit of hand cleaning in the first 20% washing, and an additional little significant benefit was obtained when the cleaning frequency exceeded 35%.
The washing with common soap more than triples the rate of infectious bacterial diseases transmitted for food compared to washing with an antibacterial soapet. Compared the hygiene of hands with an alcohol-based solution with hand washing with an antibacterial soapet for an average time of 30 seconds for each revealed that the hand hygiene to alcohol-based alcohol reduced bacterial contamination by 26% to more than an antibacterial soapet.
However, soap and water are more effective than hand salinizers based on alcohol to reduce influenza A virus, H1N1, and difficult clostridium spores in the hands. Interventions to increase hand hygiene in hospital environments may involve the awareness of the team on hand washing, increased availability of hand salinizers based on alcohol and verbal and written warnings to the team.
There is a need for more research into what interventions are more effective in different health establishments.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is considered an essential economically viable tool for good health and even better nutrition.
However, the absence of reliable water, soap or resources for hand washing in people's homes, schools and workplaces makes this a challenge for the conquest of the universal practice of hand washing.
For example, in most rural Africa, wash-basins near any public or private bathroom are rare, even though there are cheap options for the construction of hand washing stations.
However, low hand washing rates may instead be the result of rooted habits rather than of the absence of soap and water.
The incentive and protection of hands washing with soap can influence political decisions, lead to awareness of the benefits of hand washing and cause a long-term change in behaviour of the population.
For this to work effectively, monitoring and evaluation are necessary.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based approaches are effective for increasing hand washing in low- and medium-income countries, while social marketing campaigns are less efficient. An example for promoting hand washing in schools is UNICEF's "three-star approach" that encourages schools to take simple and cheap steps to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, among other hygiene requirements.
When a minimum level is reached, schools can go from one to the top three stars.
The construction of hand washing stations can be part of the promotional hand washing campaigns carried out to reduce diseases and child mortality.
The world day for hand washing is another example of awareness campaign that tries to achieve a change of habit. As a result of the 2019-2020 coronary pandemic, UNICEF has disseminated the adoption of an emoji for hand washing.
Few studies considered the overall cost/benefit ratio of hand washing in developing countries in relation to the classification in DALY.
However, an analysis suggests that promoting the washing of hands with soap is significantly more profitable than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of hand washing for human health — especially for people in vulnerable circumstances such as mothers who have just given birth or wounded soldiers to hospitals — was initially recognized in the mid-19th century by two precursors of hand hygiene: Hungarian doctor Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, the English "founder of modern nursing".
At that time, people still believed that the infections were caused by unpleasant odors called miasmas.
In the 1980s, outbreaks of food origin and infections associated with health care led the United States Center for Disease Control and Prevention to more actively encourage hand hygiene as an important way to prevent the spread of infections.
The outbreak of swine influenza in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 have raised awareness in many countries about the importance of washing hands with soap to protect themselves from such infectious diseases.
For example, posters with "techniques for the proper washing of hands" were hung close to hands washing in public bathrooms and bathrooms of offices and airports in Germany.
The expression "washing hands" means declaring the repulsiveness in taking responsibility or being compatible with something.
It originated from the Biblical passage in Matthew, where Pontius Pilate washed the hands of the decision to cross Jesus Christ, but became a more general phrase of use in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth begins to wash her hands compulsively in an attempt to clean up an imaginary stain, representing her guilty conscience regarding the crimes she had committed and led her husband to commit.
It was also verified that people tend to wash their hands more often than others, after remembering or witnessing anti-ethical acts, and usually give more importance to hand washing equipment.
In addition, those who can wash their hands after such vision are less likely to perform other "cleaning" compensatory acts, such as volunteering.
Religions prescribe the washing of hands for hygienic and symbolic purposes. The symbolic washing of hands, using water, but not soap, to wash hands is part of a ritual washing of hands characteristic in many religions, including Baha'í faith, Hinduism, tevilah and the netilat yadayim in Judaism, the washing in Christianity, and ablution in Islam. Religions also indicate the hygienic washing of hands, especially after some actions.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam authorize the washing of hands after the use of the bathroom.
And Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism and Islam authorize the washing of hands before and after meals.
Hazard Controls at the workplace for COVID-19
Hazard Controls at Work for COVID-19 are the application of health and safety methodologies at work for risk controls for the prevention of coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19).
The appropriate risk controls at the workplace depend on the workplace and the workplace itself, based on the risk assessment of the sources of exposure, the severity of the disease in the community, and the risk factors of individual workers, which may be vulnerable to the recruitment of COVID-19.
According to the Department of Health and Safety at Work (OSHA), the functions with a lower risk of exposure have minimal occupational contact with the public and other workmates, for which basic measures to prevent infection are recommended, including washing hands, encouraging staff to stay at home if they are ill, maintaining a respiratory label and routine cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
Functions with an average risk of exposure include those requiring frequent or direct contact with persons who are not known to be contaminated or suspected of contamination by COVID-19, but may be infected due to the current Community transmission or because they have travelled abroad.
This includes workers who are in contact with the general public as in schools, high-density working environments, and in the wholesale market of large volumes.
Risk controls for this group, in addition to basic measures to prevent infection, include ventilation using high-efficiency air filters, protective covers and the availability of individual protective equipment if a person is confirmed with COVID-19.
OSHA considers that workers of the health and necroterium system who are exposed to people with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 are at high risk of exposure, which increases the risk of exposure to very high if workers perform procedures in persons with confirmed COVID-19 or suspected generation of aerosols and collect or handle specimens of these persons.
Appropriate hazard controls for these workers include engineering controls such as negative pressure ventilation rooms and individual protection equipment suitable for the work performed.
The epidemic of COVID-19 can have several effects on the workplace.
Workers may be absent from work because they are ill, because they have to care for other people or because of a possible exposure.
Trade patterns may change, both in terms of which products are in demand and in terms of the means of purchasing these products (such as buying out of peak time or by delivery or drive-thru services.
Finally, sending items from areas seriously affected by COVID-19 can be interrupted. A plan of action and preparation for infectious disease can be used to guide protection actions.
The plans address the risk levels associated with the various workplaces and tasks, including exposure sources, risk factors that arise in the home and community, and risk factors of individual workers such as advanced age or chronic medical conditions.
They also define the controls necessary to address these risks, and contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of epidemics.
Action and preparation plans for infectious diseases may be subject to national or regional recommendations.
The objectives for action for an epidemic include reducing the transmission among employees, protecting people who are at greater risk of developing health complications, maintaining business operations and minimising adverse effects on other entities in supply chains.
The severity of the disease in the community, where the company is located, affects the actions taken.
The hierarchy of risk controls is a widely used structure in health and safety of work to group the risk controls by efficiency.
When the risks of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are engineering controls, followed by administrative controls and finally by individual protective equipment.
Engineering controls involve the isolation of workers from work-related hazards, and may be the most economical implementation solution.
Engineering controls are changes in the policies or working procedures that require the worker's or employer's action.
Individual protection equipment (EPI) is considered less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but can help prevent certain exposures.
All types of EPI shall be selected on the basis of the risk to the worker, adjusted as appropriate (respirators, for example), used in an appropriate and continuous manner, regularly inspected, maintained and replaced as necessary, and removed, cleaned and properly stored or discarded to avoid contamination.
According to the Department of Health and Safety at Work of the United States (OSHA), low-risk work has minimal occupational contact with the public and other workmates.
Basic prevention measures recommended for all workplaces include frequent and mediculative washing of hands, incentives for workers to stay at home if they are ill and use the respiratory label, including the cover and cough, preparation of containers for sheets and common garbage, preparation for teleworking or for scaled shifts, if necessary, the disincentive of the use of tools and equipment of other workers and the maintenance of a routine of cleaning and disinfection of the working environment.
The rapid identification and isolation of potentially infected individuals is an essential step in the protection of workers, customers, visitors and other people at the workplace.
The United States Disease Control and Prevention Centre (CDC) recommends that employees who have acute respiratory disease symptoms stay home until they have no more fever, fever signs or any other symptoms for at least 24 hours without using medication to reduce the fever or relief from other symptoms, and also recommends that disease-related leave policies be flexible, allow employees to stay at home to care for a sick member of the family, and that they have knowledge of these policies.
According to OSHA, studies at moderate exposure risk include those who require frequent or direct contact of 6 feet (1.8 m) with people who are not known whether they are confirmed or suspected with COVID-19, but may be infected by SARS-CoV-2 due to the current Community transmission at the place of the company, or because the individual has a recent history of travel abroad, in a country with a high transmission of COVID-19.
These include workers who have contact with the general public as in schools, high-density working environments and some high-volume sales shops. Engineering controls for this group and for higher-risk groups include installation of high-efficiency air filters, increased ventilation, installation of physical barriers, as well as the installation of a device of transparent plastics for customer service. Administrative controls for this group and higher-risk groups include the replacement of existing meetings for virtual communication, the establishment of extended shifts, the cancellation of non-essential travels for local outbreaks, the development of communication plans, including a forum to respond to the concerns of workers, the use of manual training.
Workers in this risk group rarely need breathing.
If a person becomes sick on a plane, appropriate controls to protect workers and other passengers include the isolation of the patient from the other person at a distance of 6 feet, with the appointment of a crew member to serve the patient and offer her a facial mask, or ask the patient to cover the mouth and nose with lenses when coughing or spitting.
The crew should use disposable medical gloves when using a patient or touching potentially contaminated body fluids or surfaces and possibly additional individual protective equipment if the patient has fever, persistent cough or difficulty breathing.
Ships and other waste items should be disposed of in a bag for biological risk residues, and the contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected afterwards. For commercial transport, including cruise ships and other passenger ships, risk controls include delaying the journey by the sick passenger, self-insulation and immediate communication to the medical centre on board if someone presents fever or other symptoms during the journey.
The ideal thing is that there is medical follow-up in the cabin of the isolated person. For schools and childcare centres, the CDC recommends temporary closure for cleaning and disinfection if an infected person was present in the building, regardless of the spread of the virus in the community.
When there is a minimum Community transmission, social distance strategies can be implemented, such as cancellation of field trips, assemblies, and other large groups such as physical or coral education classes, or meals in a lanchonet, increasing the space between the tables, times of arrival and more stringent departure, limiting non-essential visitors and using a separate place of health care for children with flu symptoms.
When there is significant transmission in the local community, in addition to social exclusion strategies, prolonged school exemptions can be considered. For law enforcement authorities carrying out daily activities, the immediate health risk is considered low by the CDC.
It is recommended that police officers who contact individuals suspected of COVID-19 or confirmed disease follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including the use of adequate personal protective equipment.
If the direct contact occurs during the arrest, workers must clean and disinfect their belt and other accessories before using them again using a common household cleaning spray or panel and follow the standard operating procedures for the retention and disposition of used EPI and for the retention and washing of clothes.
OSHA considers certain health and necroterium workers to be in high or very high risk categories.
Functions with high risk of exposure include the supply of medicines, medical care, laboratories and medical transport workers, who are exposed to patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19.
The risk of exposure becomes very high if workers perform aerosol generation procedures in patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19, or collect or handle specimens of these patients.
Aerosol generation procedures include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and examinations or invasive collection of specimens.
Work in high-exposure necroteriums includes workers involved with the preparation of bodies of people with confirmed or suspected disease at the time of their death; the risk of exposure becomes very high if they perform autopsy. Additional engineering controls for these risk groups include isolation rooms for patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19, including when aerosol generator procedures are performed.
Specialized ventilation of negative pressure may be appropriate in some scenarios of necroterios and in the health area.
Specimen should be handled with caution at level 3 of biosafety.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients entering the hospital be separated in two different waiting areas depending on whether they are a suspected case for COVID-19. In addition to other EPIs, OSHA recommends breathing for professionals who work at a distance of 6 feet of patients with confirmation or suspicion of infection by SARS-CoV-2, and for professionals who perform aerosol generation procedures.
In the United States, N95 particle filter facial breathing approved by NIOSH or superior quality breathing should be used in the context of a comprehensive and written respiratory protection program that includes adjustment, training and medical examinations.
Other types of respirators can provide protection and improve the comfort of the worker. WHO does not recommend the use of monkeys, since COVID-19 is a respiratory disease, and is not transmitted by non-respiratory body fluids.
WHO recommends only one surgical mask for screening staff at the point of entry.
For professionals who collect respiratory specimens, treat or transport patients with COVID-19 without aerosol generation procedures, WHO recommends a surgical mask, eyes of protection or facial protection, surgical avental and gloves.
If an aerosol generation procedure is performed, the surgical mask shall be replaced by a breather N95 or FFP2.
Since the overall supply of EPIs is insufficient, WHO recommends minimizing the need for EPIs through telemedicine, physical barriers such as clear windows, allowing only those involved in direct care to patients to enter a commodity with a patient with COVID-19, using only the necessary EPI for the specific task, continuous use of the same breather without removing it while dealing with several patients with the same diagnosis, monitors and coordinates the supply chain of EPI and de-stimulates the use of masks by asymptomatic individuals.

QUESTION: [Covid-19] Attenuation of problems and preparation for the future
DATE/ DAY OF REVISION: 14 March 2020, 00:24 UTC
LICENCE: CC0: No rights reserved
We are in unusual circumstances this month.
The epidemic of COVID-19 is something that makes our global human interface clear and our responsibilities towards the other.
Its challenges have no precedent, but we know that our best actions go together with global empathy, cooperation and the creation of communities, which are the foundations of this organization.
Companheirism and the concern we have seen among all our colleagues through e-mails, links and conversations is a remarkable validation of the amazing human beings with whom we have the privilege of working.
I am extremely grateful and proud to have all of you as workmates.
Last week, someone shared their appreciation for our work with me.
This person made me remember how significant it is for the world to be able to access Wikipedia now, and how powerful a symbol that this essential resource continues online and available to all.
The work of you makes this possible, because you keep the workplaces active, pay our workmates and keep the safety of our communities.
The world needs the information Wikipedia provides, more than ever.
This is a time when not only what we do, but how we do it will have a significant impact on the world.
Given the importance of this mission and its role in it, we will make important adjustments in the way in which we work together, starting next week.
Adjustments to our work and schedules
As Robyn mentioned earlier, team C met last night to discuss our approach and schedules for the coming days and months.
At this meeting, we consider what we think is an appropriate action to which we are experiencing and the best way to keep the organization sustainable during this period.
We want to end the stress and support our long-term mission.
If you need to go away for a while, you have no problem.
For all employees, service providers and contract workers:
our daily work expectations will be 4 hours, or 20 hours a week, until otherwise agreed.
We are not declaring a holiday. If you can work on normal schedule, it can be useful for our mission.
However, the world is unpredictable now, and if you need to care for loved ones, buy maintenance or go to the doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We're not monitoring your schedules.
If you're sick, don't work.
That rule wouldn't have to be expressed, but we decided to declare it.
There is no need to be certified or paid strike. Just inform your manager to help your team review the schedule and schedules to ensure that the key areas of the work are served.
(If you are diagnosed with COVID-19, inform Bryan of the training and certification sector so that its sector can help you and ensure that your situation receives appropriate attention from the management).
The hourly staff will receive the full payment.
We have already said that before, and we are committed to honour our commitment to our employees who work hourly.
They will all receive their salaries on the basis of their normal work record under normal circumstances.
Salaries are independent if you are sick and unable to work.
If you want to work, we give total support to you.
Many people see work as a way to channel stress because of the current situation in the world.
The work we do can be incredibly rewarding, especially in times like these.
Remembering that your well-being is more important.
We only ask you to communicate to your manager, so that we know what to expect and can help the activities properly.
Some functions are considered essential.
There are activities that we must continue to perform.
Teams of Site Reliability Engineering, HR, Reliability and Funding Security (including) carry out essential activities that may require additional support.
We will start a process with all departments to evaluate the current objectives and change our focus to support what is essential to our mission.
There is much to be done for all of us, and we will focus our efforts on the most important projects.
Decelerating now will not harm us in the future.
We don't intend to "work together to recover lost time" after the pandemic is over.
You will not be expected to work extra hours to meet the deadlines that are now impracticable.
We accept that the circumstances have changed, and we will work to define new targets and deadlines, as appropriate.
What will happen to the Annual Planning?
To adjust to our new reality and expectations of working hours per day, we intend to adjust the schedule for the delivery of our annual plan of 2020-2021.
Our intention is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan, which will provide more time for the budget, and that employees prioritize essential work, personal care and care of loved ones, while we accommodate those who need or want to work on a reduced day in the coming weeks.
The extension of the schedule greatly reduces the current planning workload and the pressure throughout the organization.
We will present our proposal to the board next week and update representatives and teams on the next steps as soon as we have confirmation.
We thank the annual Planning team for their leadership in this process.
Office status, exhibition and cleaning
Last week, we learned that one of our workmates in San Francisco may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
In view of this situation, by caution, we use an antiviral cleaning team to disinfect all surfaces in the office of São Francisco.
They used a special antiviral solution for hospitals to disinfect all surfaces, as well as the entrance jacket and all elevators that give access to our floor.
The building is using its own care duty protocol using products that are safe for its participants.
We are relieved that the office will be properly prepared for when we decide to return.
Our Washington office is located in a WeWork, which shared its protocol for the COVID-19 with us and with all Washington officials.
Last week, our Washington office changed to a completely remote configuration, in line with the shared guide with São Francisco.
As some of our colleagues in New York know, we are also discussing the location of an office in Brooklyn.
These discussions continue to take place, but they may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
Our colleagues who have been working remotely for a long time know that this may be an adjustment, and would like to offer some advice:
They shall limit the duration of the meetings to a maximum of one or two hours.
If longer-term sessions are necessary, consider dividing them into several days.
They define the meeting, have a programming and send material for reading in advance.
Use videos as default, with tools such as Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate real-time collaboration and connection.
They have a leader to facilitate meetings, someone who monitors the questions in the chat and the list of participants, and someone to help make notes (or collaborative notes).
Send an e-mail to technical support if you need comfortable earphones.
Use your emergency aid to buy lunches.
Share #remotes channel to talk to your colleagues about remote work
The HR Operations Team is researching ergonomics guides in the context of the webinar to assist in increasing remote work on the Foundation.
Last week, we asked all community beneficiaries to cancel public events funded by Wikimedia, such as the editorial marathons, until WHO declared the end of the pandemic.
We warned them that we understood that our request for cancellation and other restrictions could make it impossible to complete their agreed grant activities, and that no one would be punished for extending or modifying their goals.
In the coming week, we will continue with additional guidance on Wikimania and other regional and thematic conferences for the community.
The general feeling in the world community seems to be of sadness with paralysis, but also of relief with clarity and ability to keep focus on their own communities, Wikimedia and other situations.
The communication resource team is working on creating a page in Meta-Wiki to provide a space for the community to monitor the impact and receive our communications to it.
Keeping up-to-date on issues related to COVID-19
We will send an invitation to your calendars for the following Thursday at 14:00 UTC/ 07:00 PT for a special meeting with the staff.
We will use this time to share additional updates, answer your questions and spend some time connecting with each other.
We're in this together and we'll help with what's needed.
Meanwhile, you can continue to find the information of this email and all other information related to COVID-19 on the company's wiki.
The communication resource team will update these pages and all the information in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular communication with staff living in countries that are currently significantly affected.
If you have any questions about travel, events, a main workflow, or the coverage challenge, or anything else you may need help with, do not stop notifying and working with the communication resource team.
We are here to help provide support and collaboration as necessary.
If you have a confidential or sensitive issue, send an email to Bryan Judah, Director of Global HR Operations.
None of these changes should be seen as abandonment of our work and obligations.
They are, however, a recognition that, at this point, our work and our obligations will probably need to be adapted in a way that we have not adapted in the past.
These are the steps that we believe are needed as support at this time, so that we can continue working, providing our movement with the support they need and providing the world with the service it depends on.
Our planned work will be ours when the time comes.
For the time being, it is time to support each other and create space for the important work that will be done in the weeks, and probably next months.
We need all of you to do this, so we need everyone to take care of yourself and your family so that they are in their best condition when necessary.
Wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, a communications team (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M and Tony S), and the rest of the leadership team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M and Toby N).
Angiotensin converting enzyme of type 2 (ECA2) is an enzyme attached to the outer surface (cellular membranes) of the cells of the lungs, arteries, heart, kidney, and intestines.
ECA2 neutralizes the activity of the angiotensin converting enzyme related (ECA) by reducing the amount of angiotensin II and raising Ang (1-7), becoming a promising medicine directed at the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. ECA2 also acts as an entry point in the cells for some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hECA2.
The type 2 angiotensin converting enzyme is a metaloenzyme containing zinc located on the endothelial surface and other cells.
ECA2 protein contains a Peptide M2 N-terminal domain and a C-terminal domain carrying amino acids and colectrin in the renal system.
ECA2 is a single pass type 1 membrane protein, with its enzymatically active domain exposed to the cell surface in the lungs and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of ECA2 is elevated from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme known as sheddaze, and the resulting soluble protein is released in the blood stream and finally excreted in the urine.
ECA2 is present in many organs: ECA2 is attached to the cell membrane of the major pulmonary alveolar cells of type II, enterocytes of the soft intestine, endothelial and venous cells and smooth blood cells in most organs.
The expression of the ECA2 mRNA is also found in the cortex of the brain, the stranded body, the hypothalamus, and the brain stem.
The main function of ECA2 is to act as a counterweight for ECA.
ECA binds Type I angiotensin hormone in Type II angiotensin causing vasoconstriction.
ECA2, in turn, binds to phenylalanine of carboxyterminal amino acid from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolysis in angiotensin vasodilator (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-Gist-Pro-OH).
ECA2 also clinks several other peptides, including [des-Arg9]- bradykinin, apelin, neurotensin, dinorphine A, and grelin.
ECA2 also regulates the transport by the member of the neutral amino acid carrier SLC6A19 and was involved in Hartnup’s disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ECA2 acts as the main point of entry into the cells for some coronaviruses, including HCV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the SARS virus); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
More specifically, the binding of the spike S1 protein from SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 to the enzyme domain of ECA2 in the cell surface results in endocytosis and transplantation of the virus and enzyme into endosoms located within the cells.
This entry process also requires the preparation of protein S by the serine-protease host TMPRSS2, whose inhibition is under investigation as a potential therapy. This led some to raise the hypothesis that reducing ECA2 levels in cells may help in the fight against infection.
However, several professional companies and regulators recommended continuing with the ECA inhibitor pattern and ARB therapy.
A systematic review and meta-analysis published on 11 July 2012 found that "the use of ECA inhibitors was associated with a significant 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia in relation to controls".
In addition, "pneumonia risk was also reduced in patients treated with ECA inhibitors who had a high risk of developing pneumonia, especially those with AVC and heart failure.
The use of ECA inhibitors was also associated with the reduction of pneumonia-related mortality, although the results were less robust than for the overall risk of pneumonia".
Human recombinant ECA2 (rhACE2) is believed to be a new therapy for acute pulmonary injury, and it appeared to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and oxygen saturation in pigs with an acute respiratory distress syndrome induced by lipopolysaccharide.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is approximately 10 hours and the start of action is 30 minutes after the temporary evolution of the 24 hour effects.
Many findings suggest that rhACE2 can be a promising medicine for those with intolerance to the inhibitors of the classical renin-angiotensin system (RAS inhibitors) or in diseases in which angiotensin II in circulation is high. Infused rhACE2 was evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Apps on COVID-19 are mobile software applications to help monitor the response to coronary pandemic 2019-2020, i.e. the process of identifying people ("contacts") that may have come into contact with infected individuals.
Many applications have been developed or proposed, with official government support in some territories and jurisdictions.
Various structures to create contact monitoring applications have been developed.
Privacy issues were raised, especially on systems based on the tracking of the geographical location of the users of the application.
Less intrusive alternatives include the use of Bluetooth signals to record user proximity to other cell phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they would integrate functionality to support such Bluetooth-based applications directly to their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, along with Alipay, implemented an application that allows citizens to verify whether they were in contact with a person carrying COVID-19.
It is in use in over 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore, an application called TraceTogether is being used.
The application was developed by the local IT community, released as an open source and will be handed over to the government. North Macedonia launched the "StopKorona!", an application based on Bluetooth to track exposure to potentially infected people and provide a quick response to health authorities.
The application was developed by the Ministry of Communication and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
Since April 14, 2020, the application has been awaiting approval by Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the government declared that the contact tracking application was in an advanced development stage and would be available for distribution in weeks. A similar application is intended for Ireland and France ("StopCovid").
Australia and New Zealand provide applications based on the TraceTogether application in Singapore and the BlueTrace protocol. Russia aims to implement a geographical delimitation application for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 living in Moscow, designed to ensure that they do not leave home.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at Cambridge University, listed a number of potential practical problems with application-based systems, including false positives and the potential lack of effectiveness if the application is accepted only to a small part of the population.
In response to concerns about the spread of false or harmful "coronavirus" applications, Apple sets limits for types of organizations that can add coronavirus-related applications to its App Store, limiting them only to "official" or otherwise respected organizations.
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy defenders expressed concern about the implications of mass surveillance using coronavirus applications, especially if the surveillance infrastructure created to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will be dismantled when the threat has passed.
International Anistia and more than 100 other organizations have issued a communication requesting limits for this kind of surveillance.
The organisations declared eight conditions for government projects:
surveillance should be "legal, necessary and proportionate";
extension of monitoring and surveillance should have suspension clauses;
the use of data should be limited for the purposes of COVID-19;
the security and anonymity of the data should be protected and presented as protected on the basis of evidence;
digital surveillance should avoid further discrimination and marginalisation;
any sharing of data with third parties should be provided for by law;
there should be safeguards against abuse and citizens' rights to respond to abuses;
the significant participation of all "relevant stakeholders" would be required, including experts in public health and marginalized groups. The Chaos Computer Club (CCC) of Germany and Reporters without Borders (Reporter without Borders) (RSF) also published checklists.
The plan proposed by Google/Apple aims to deal with the persistent surveillance problem by removing the tracking mechanism of your operating device systems when it is no longer necessary.
Some countries used network-based location tracking instead of applications, eliminating the need to download an application and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network-based tracking was approved.
Network-based solutions that have access to gross location data have significant potential privacy problems.
However, not all systems with central servers need access to personal location data; a series of systems that preserve privacy were created to use central servers only for intercom (see section below).
In South Korea, an application-based system was used to run the contact tracking.
Instead of using an exclusive application, the system collected tracking information from various sources, including data on tracking mobile devices and data on card transactions, combining them to generate text messages to potentially infected individuals.
In addition to using this information to alert potential interlocutors, the government has also made the location information publicly available, which is allowed due to changes in the confidentiality laws of the information after the outbreak of MERS in the country.
This information is available to the public through a number of applications and sites. Countries, including Germany, consider using both the privacy and centralized preservation system.
By 6 April 2020, the details had not yet been disclosed.
The tracking of contact preserving privacy is a well-defined concept, with a significant body of scientific bibliography rising to, at least, 2013. Since 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups have worked on solutions that respect privacy, using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to record the proximity of a user to other mobile devices.
However, the PEPP-PT is a coordination effort covering centralised and decentralised approaches, and is not a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include the Decentralized Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracking (DP-PPT/DP-3T), Temporary Contact Numbers (TCN, fka Contact Event Numbers, CEN) Privacy Sensitive Protocols and Mechanisms for Mobile Contact Tracking (PACT) and others.
In these protocols, identifiable personal data never leave the device, and any combination is made on the device.
The Privacy Group at MIT Media Lab has developed Safe Paths, a platform for the use of privacy conservation techniques during the collection and use of track location or crossing data to track the spread of COVID-19.
It is based on research based on the technical publication "Applications play dirty: keeping privacy in an epidemic" released in March 2020. Another similar effort is the SafeTrace platform of Enigma MPC, a company that develops privacy technologies and originally founded in MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies to allow users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and responsible ones, without compromising the privacy of these data.
On 5 April 2020, the Global Coalition TCN was founded by groups that joined around what was essentially the same approach and largely with protocol overlap, with the aim of reducing fragmentation, and allowing the global interoperability of alert and tracking applications, a key aspect of the conquest of generalized adoption.
On 9 April 2020, the Government of Singapore announced that the BlueTrace protocol, used by the government's official application, had become an open source.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, companies that control Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced an initiative for contact tracking, in which they claimed to preserve privacy, based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy technology and encryption for privacy preservation.
They also published specifications of the main technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system provides for implementation in three stages:
development of tools to enable the government to create official coronavirus tracking applications preserving privacy
integration of this functionality directly into iOS and Android; Google and Apple plan to deal with persistent and assumed surveillance problems by first distributing the system by operating system updates, and later removing it in the same way as the threat ends.
Repositioning of drugs (also known as drug repromotion, reperfiling, re-attribution or therapeutic substitution) is the repromotion of a drug approved for the treatment of a medical condition or disease different from that for which it was originally developed.
This is one of the scientific research lines that are currently being adopted to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other research directions include the development of a plasma transfusion and vaccine for COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 has about 66 drugable proteins, each with multiple binding points.
Analysis of these binding points provides the reasonable development of effective antiviral drug development against COVID-19 proteins.
Among the most important SARS-CoV-2 target proteins are papaine-like protease, RNA polymerase dependent on RNA, helicase, S protein and ADP ribophosphate.
Hussein A. A., et al., studied several candidate compounds which then improved and analyzed their structural similarities with the most approved drugs in order to accelerate the development of a potent drug against SARS-CoV-2 in their preclinical study to be recommended for a clinical study conception.
Chloroquine is a medicine against malaria that is also used against some autoimmune diseases.
On 18 March, WHO announced that related chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine would be among the four drugs studied as part of the Solidarity clinical trial.
The governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo, announced that the tests with chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine of the state of New York would begin on March 24th. On March 28th, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulphate and chloroquine phosphate by means of an Emergency Use Authorisation (AEU).
Treatment was not approved by the FDA clinical trial process and is authorised by the EU only as experimental treatment for emergency use in hospitalized patients who cannot receive treatment in a clinical trial.
The CDC said that "the use, dose or duration of hydroxychloroquine for the prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection" are not yet established.
Doctors said they're using the drug when there's no other option.
In Istanbul, a Turkish research team is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Major studies are underway at Duke University and Oxford University.
The NYU Langone Medical School is conducting a safety and efficacy study on the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen have shown that favipiravir was "clearly effective".
In Shenzhen, 35 patients tested negative within 4 days on average, while the duration of the disease in 45 patients who did not receive it was 11 days.
In a study conducted in Wuhan with 240 patients with pneumonia, half were treated with favipiravir, and half were treated with umifenovir.
The Italian Pharmaceutical Agency reminded the population that the evidence to base the medicine is scarce and preliminary.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would buy Japan's medicine to store it and use the army to deliver it to university hospitals, where it would be used to treat patients with COVID-19.
According to South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has created openings for Trump administration on the purchase of the medicine. The medicine may be less effective in serious cases of the disease when the virus has been multiplied.
Your use may not be safe for pregnant women or women trying to get pregnant.
A study of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of the antivirals lopinavir and ritonavir, concluded that "no benefit has been observed".
Drugs were developed to inhibit the replication of HIV through connection with protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify the drugs to find a compound that binds to SARS-CoV-2 protease. There are criticisms in the scientific community about directing resources to replicate drugs developed specifically for HIV/AIDS.
WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the International Solidarity Test.
Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infections. Gilead Sciences discovered after remdesivir presented antiviral activity in vitro against wire, pneumonia, paramyxus and coronavirus.
One of the problems with antiviral treatment is resistance developed by mutations, which may cause more serious transmissions or diseases.
Some initial pre-test studies suggest that remedesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance. There are several ongoing clinical trials, including two conducted by Cleveland University Hospitals, one for people with moderate disease and one for those with more serious disease.
There are three clinical trials with intravenous vitamin C occurring for hospitalized and severely ill people with COVID-19: two of them are controlled by placebo (in China and Canada), while the other one does not have a control group (Italy).
The state of New York began testing with azithromycin, an antibiotic, on 24 March 2020.
Japan's National Centre for Health and Global Medicine (NCGM) plans a clinical test of Alvesco (cyclosonide), the Teijin company, which is an inhalable corticosteroid for asthma. The aim is to treat pre-symptomic patients infected with the new coronavirus.
Phase II of a study with a type of angiotensin 2 converting enzyme is in progress with 200 patients, to be recruited among the serious cases hospitalized in Denmark, Germany and Austria, to determine the effectiveness of treatment.
Currently, researchers at the Heart Institute in Canada are investigating the function of colchicine in reducing pulmonary complications and inflammations in patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19.
The study, called COLCORONA, is recruiting 6,000 adults over 40 years of age, diagnosed with COVID-19 and with mild symptoms, who did not need to be hospitalized.
Women who are breast-feeding or are not using effective contraceptive methods were not included in the pregnancy tests.
Various anticoagulants are tested in Italy.
Heparin, of low molecular weight, is being widely used in the treatment of patients, which led the Italian Medicines Agency to publish guidelines on use.
A multicentre study, with 300 patients, is analysing the use of sodium enoxaparin in prophylaxis and in therapeutic doses. The study was announced on 14 April in Italy.
Because SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, the attention of the scientific community has been considerable in the sense of giving new purpose to approved and developed antiviral medicines for the treatment of previous outbreaks, such as those of MRS, SARS and the West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: ribavirin was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19, according to the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines
Umifenovir: Umifenovir was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19, according to the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines
Some antibiotics were identified as being able to receive a new purpose for the treatment of patients with COVID-19:
Tocilizumab (anti-IL-6 receptor): approved in China.
There are also tests in Italy and China. See Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
The vaccine for COVID-19 is a hypothetical vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although there is no vaccine with the clinical trials completed, there are several attempts to develop it.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated not to expect a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, a virus causing the disease, available within 18 months.
Five candidates for the vaccine were in phase I of the safety studies in April.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major outbreak spread occurred in 2020, leading to considerable investments and research activities for the development of a vaccine.
Several organisations are using published genomes to develop possible vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
The Epidemic Preparation Innovation Coalition initiative, CEPI, declared in April that the requirements for the development of the vaccine are the speed, manufacturing capacity, large-scale development and global access.
In April, ECPI scientists reported 10 different technology platforms being researched and developing during the beginning of 2020 to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The objectives of the major platforms that have advanced for Phase I safety studies include:
nucleic acid (DNA or RNA) (Developer in Phase I and Vaccine Candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
viral vector (phase I developer and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologicals, adenovirus type 5 vector)
As reported by ECPI scientists in April, a total of 115 vaccine candidates are in the initial stages of development, with 78 of them confirmed as active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute). 37 others were announced, but with little information available to the public (considered to be planned or being designed).
A phase I-II test performs the preliminary safety and immunogenicity test. It is typically randomized, controlled by placebo and multicentre, while determining more accurate and effective doses.
Phase III tests typically involve more participants in a control group. They test the effectiveness of the vaccine in preventing the disease, while monitoring adverse effects on the ideal dose.
Of the 79 candidates for active development vaccines (confirmed at the beginning of April 2020), 74 had not yet been evaluated in humans (continued in preclinical research).
On January 24, 2020, in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it is investigating the potential of a vaccine with a molecular lump, which would genetically modify viral proteins to stimulate an immune reaction.
On January 24, 2020, in Canada, the Center for International Vaccines (VIDO-InterVac) at the University of Saskatchewan, I announced the beginning of work in a vaccine, with the aim of testing in human beings in 2021.

The partners subsequently announced plans for the pre-clinical test and Phase I of clinical studies in July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, the Ministry of Health of India announced that they are working with 11 isolates and, even at an accelerated step, would take at least between one and a half year and two years to develop a vaccine.
On 12 March 2020, Medicago, a company of biotechnology in the city of Quebec, reported the development of a particle similar to the Coronavirus under partial funding from the Canadian Institutes for Health Research.
The vaccine candidate is being researched in the laboratory, with human tests planned for July or August 2020.
At the beginning of that week, The Guardian stated that the President of the United States, Donald Trump, offered CureVac "great sums of money for exclusive access to the Covid-19 vaccine" under protest by the German government.
On 17 March 2020, the pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech to jointly develop a vaccine based on mRNA.
BNT162, a candidate vaccine based on mRNA, currently in pre-clinical testing, with clinical tests expected to start in April 2020.
In Italy on 17 March 2020, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotechnology company announced that it would have results from pre-clinical tests in April 2020 and its candidate for the final vaccine could leave for human tests in the fall.
In France, on 19 March 2020, the Innovation Coalition for Epidemia (CEPI) announced an investment of $4.9 million in a research consortium for the vaccine for COVID-19 involving the Institute of Pasteur, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria), and the University of Pittsburgh, bringing the total investment of CEPI in the development of the vaccine for COVID-19 to 29 million dollars.
The other ECPI investment partners for the development of the vaccine for COVID-19 are Modern, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, University of Hong Kong, Oxford University, and University of Queensland.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health authorities announced that scientists started testing in animals of six different candidates for the vaccine.

At the end of March, the Canadian government announced C$ 275 million in funding for 96 research projects on medical countermeasures against COVID-19, including several candidates for vaccine in Canadian companies and universities, such as Medicago and the initiatives of the University of Saskatchewan.
In almost the same period, the Canadian government announced C$ 192 million specifically to develop the vaccine for COVID-19, with plans to establish a national "vaccination bank" of several new vaccines that could be used if other outbreaks of the Coronavirus occurred.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh Medical School reported the PittCoVacc test, a possible vaccine against COVID-19 in rats, stating that "MNA delivered S1 subunit vaccines from SARS-CoV-2 that produced powerful responses of specific antibodies to antigens [in the mouse] that were evident that started 2 weeks after immunization."
In Canada on 16 April 2020, the University of Waterloo Pharmacy School announced the development of a DNA-based vaccine candidate as possibly a nasal spray.
Using bacterial agents, DNA will be planned to replicate within a human bacteria to produce inoffensive particles similar to the virus, which can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the government, industry and three U.S. universities pooled resources to access IBM supercomputers, in combination with computing in the cloud of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have heterological effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means that they can benefit beyond the disease they prevent.
A later randomized test in Australia is looking to include 4,170 health workers.
Developing vaccines may not be safe or effective.
Initial surveys to assess the effectiveness of the vaccine using animal specimens specific to COVID-19, such as the ACE2-transgenic mouse, other laboratory animals and non-human primates, indicate a need for conservation measures for level 3 biosecurity to handle live viruses, and international coordination to ensure standard safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MRS have already been tested in specimens of non-human animals.
In 2020, there is no cure or vaccine that protects against SARS that has proved safe and effective in humans.
According to research documents published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and medications to treat SARS was a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world. There is also no proven vaccine against MRS.
When the MRS became dominant, it was believed that the existing SARS research could provide a useful model for the development of vaccines and therapeutic treatment against the infection of the MRS-CoV.
As of March 2020, there was a MES vaccine (based on DNA) that concluded phase I of clinical studies in humans, and three others in progress, all of which are virus vectored vaccines, two with adenoviral vector (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one vectored by MVA (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media publications promoted a conspiracy theory claiming that the virus behind the COVID-19 was known and that a vaccine was already available.
Patents quoted by several social media publications indicate existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other strains of Coronavirus such as Coronavirus SARS.
Betacoronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome of Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and difficulty breathing.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhoea, throat pain, loss of smell, and abdominal pain.
The exposure time until the onset of symptoms is about 5 days, but it may vary from two to fourteen days.
Although most cases result in mild symptoms, some develop to a viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases had been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568 thousand people have already been cured. The virus is disseminated among people mainly during direct contact, usually through gouts produced by the cough, spruce or speech.
Although these droplets are produced when they expire, they usually fall to the ground or remain on surfaces rather than remain infective at long distances.
People can also get infected by touching contaminated surfaces and then touch the eyes, nose or mouth.
The virus can survive on surfaces for up to 72 hours.
It is more contagious during the first 3 days after the onset of the symptoms, although the spread may be possible before the symptoms appear and in subsequent stages of the disease. The standard diagnostic method is by reaction in the chain of polymerase of the reverse transcription in real time (rRT-PCR) of a nasopharyngeal Swab.
The use of masks is recommended for people suspected of the virus and for people responsible for their care.
Recommendations for the use of mask by the general population vary, where some authorities recommend non-use, some recommend use and others require use.
There is currently no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been registered in most countries across all six regions of the WHO.
Virus infected people may be asymptomatic or develop symptoms similar to flu, cough, fatigue and difficulty breathing.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, chest pain or persistent pressure, confusion, difficulty keeping awake, face or blue lips.
Uncommon symptoms of upper respiratory tract such as spleen, runny nose or throat pain can be seen.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea were observed in different percentages.
Some cases in China initially presented only open chest and palpitations.
In some cases, the disease may develop into pneumonia, multiple organ failure, and death.
This is the so-called incubation period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually six days, but may vary from two to 14 days.
97.5% of people who develop symptoms will develop them within 11.5 days of infection. Reports indicate that not all infected will develop symptoms.
The function of these asymptomatics in transmission is not yet fully known; however, a preliminary evidence suggests that they can contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of people with no symptoms is currently unknown and is being studied, and the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported that 20% of all confirmed cases remained asymptomatic during their stay in the hospital.
The National Health Commission of China started to include asymptomatic cases in its daily cases on 1 April; of the 166 infections on that day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of testing.
The scarf and saliva can load large viral loads.
Talking high frees more Gothic than talking normally.
A study in Singapore found that coughing without covering your mouth can cause gouts to reach 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is not usually transported by air, the National Academy of Science suggested that bio-aerosol transmission may be possible and air collectors located in corridors outside the people's rooms contain positive samples for a viral RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary revitalization (RCP), can generate respiratory secretions that will be aerosolized and therefore transmitted by air.
Although there is concern that it can be transmitted through the faeces, it is believed that the risk is low. The virus is more contagious when people are symptomatic. Although it is possible to have transmission before the symptoms appear, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that although it is not entirely clear the ease with which the disease is spread, usually one person is infected with one or two.
Specifically, it was found that the virus was detectable for one day in paper, up to three days in plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304) and up to four hours in copper 99%.
That, however, depends on the humidity and temperature.
Sabine and detergent are also effective if they are used correctly. Products with soap degrade the protective lipid envelope of the virus, deactivating it, as well as removing it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalconium chloride and chlorhexidine glyconate (a surgical disinfectant), are less effective. In a study conducted in Hong Kong, saliva samples were collected on average two days after the start of hospitalization.
In five of the six patients, the first sample presented the highest viral load, while the sixth patient presented the highest viral load on the second day tested.
The acute respiratory syndrome coronavir 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new acute respiratory syndrome coronavir that was first isolated in three people with pneumonia who had a relationship to a group of acute respiratory diseases in Wuhan.
All characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus occur in nature, in related coronaviruses.
Outside the human body, the virus dies in contact with domestic soap, which breaks its protective layer. SARS-CoV-2 is closely linked to the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID-19 because the virus accesses host cells through the angiotensin 2 (ACE2) converting enzyme, which is more abundant in the lung type II alveolar cells.
The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called "spicula" (peplomer) to connect to ACE2 and enter the host cell.
Acute cardiac injury was observed in 12% of the infected people who were hospitalized in Wuhan, China, and is more frequent in severe disease.
The rate of cardiovascular symptoms is high due to systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during disease development, but acute myocardial injury may also be related to ACE2 receptors in the heart.
The ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in the heart and are involved in the heart function.
A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) was found in ICU patients with COVID-19 infections and may be related to poor prognosis. Netropsias of people who died due to COVID-19 showed diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and inflammatory infiltrates containing lymphocytes in the lung.
Although SARS-CoV-2 has a tropism for the epithelial cells of the respiratory tract expressing ACE2, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, it was demonstrated that pathogenic T cells secreting GM-CSF have a correlation with the recruitment of IL-6 secretive inflammatory monocytes and severe lung pathology in patients with COVID-19.
Lymphocytic infiltrates have also been reported in necrosis.
WHO published several test protocols for the disease.
The standard test method is the reaction in the polymerase chain via reverse transcription in real time (rRT-PCR).
The test is usually performed in respiratory samples obtained through a nasopharyngeal Swab, however, a nasal Swab or cataract sample may be used.
The results are usually available within a few hours up to two days.
Blood tests can be used, but for this it is necessary to collect two blood samples with two weeks of difference and the results have little immediate value.
Chinese scientists were able to isolate a coronavirus strain and publish their genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world could independently develop polymerase chain reaction tests (PCR) to detect virus infection.
From 4 April 2020, antibody tests (which can detect active infections and if a person has been infected in the past) were under development, but have not yet been widely used.
The Chinese experience with the test showed that their accuracy is 60 to 70%.
The U.S. FDA approved the first remote laboratory test on March 21, 2020, for use at the end of that month. The diagnostic guidelines released by the Zhongnan Hospital at Wuhan University suggest methods to detect infections based on clinical resources and epidemiological risk.
Opacitys in the dark glass bilateral multilobar with peripheral, asymmetrical and posterior distribution are common at the beginning of the infection.
Subpleural domination, mosaic flooring (septs thickened with variable alveolar filling) and consolidation may appear as the disease progresses.
There are few data available on microscopic lesions and COVID-19 physiopathology.
The main pathological findings during autopsies are:
Macroscopy: pleuric, pericarditis, pulmonary consolidation and pulmonary oedema
Four types of severity of viral pneumonia may be observed:
mild pneumonia: pulmonary oedema, pulmonary hyperplasia, large atypical pneumonia, interstitial inflammation with lymphocyte infiltration and formation of multinucleated giant cells
severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudates.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDRA) and severe hypoxia.
treated pneumonia: organization of exudates in alveolar cavities and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis
Blood: disseminated intravascular coagulation (CID); leukoerythroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the chance of infection include staying at home, avoiding places with many people, often washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, practicing good respiratory hygiene and avoiding touching eyes, nose and mouth with hands without washing.
The CDC recommends that the mouth and nose be covered with a brush while coughing or spitting, as well as cover the mouth with the inner side of the elbow if the canvas is not available.
The proper hygiene of the hand after coughing or breathing is encouraged.
The CDC recommended the use of clothing masks in public places, in part to limit transmission by asymptomatic individuals. Social distance strategies aim to reduce contact of people infected with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel and canceling large public meetings.
The distance guidelines also include that people stay at least 1.8 meters (6 feet) away from each other.
Since the vaccine should not be launched before 2021, an effective remedy for the prevention of COVID-19 is not known. A key point for the control of COVID-19 is to try to reduce the peak of the epidemic, also known as "acquiring the curve".
The CDC also recommends that individuals wash their hands frequently using soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom or when the hands are visually dirty, before eating and after rubbing the nose, coughing or spitting.
It also recommends using alcohol-based antiseptic for hands with at least 60% alcohol, but only when soap and water are not readily available. For places where commercial hand antiseptics are not readily available, WHO provides two formulations for local production.
In these formulations, antimicrobial activity is given by means of ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol; it is not "an active substance for hand asepsis".
Glycerol is added as humidifier.
People are treated with palliative care, which may include fluid therapy, oxygen support and support for other affected vital organs.
The CDC recommends that people suspected of being with the virus use a simple facial mask.
The oxygenation of the extrabody membrane (ECMO) was used to treat the problem of respiratory failure, but its benefits are still under analysis.
Personal hygiene and healthy lifestyle and diet are being recommended to improve immunity.
Support treatments can be useful for those with mild symptoms and early stages of infection. WHO and the National Health Commission of China published recommendations for the care of people hospitalized with COVID-19.
U.S. intensifiers and pneumologists gathered recommendations for the treatment of several agencies in a free remedy, the IBCC.
Until April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some health professionals recommend paracetamol (acetaminophene) instead of ibuprofen for first-line use.
Caution should be taken to minimise the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in the health environment, when procedures are being carried out that can generate aerosols, such as intubation and manual ventilation.
For health professionals caring for people with COVID-19, the CDC recommends placing the person in rooms with isolation of air-borne infections (SIIA) in addition to taking standard precautions, contact precautions and air precautions. The CDC summarizes the guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (EPI) during the pandemic.
The recommended equipment is: EPI coat, breather or facial mask, visual protection and medical gloves. When available, it is preferable to use breathers instead of facial masks.
Respirators N95 are approved for industrial environments, but the FDA authorized the masks for use under Emergency Use Authorisation (USA).
They were designed to protect against air particles as dust, but their effectiveness against a specific biological agent is not guaranteed for undescribed uses.
When masks are not available, the CDC recommends the use of facial shields or, as a last resort, home masks.
Most COVID-19 cases are not serious enough to require mechanical or alternative ventilation, but a percentage of cases are.
The type of respiratory support for individuals with respiratory impairment related to COVID-19 is being studied for people in hospitals, with some evidence that intubation can be avoided with a high flow nose or positive airway pressure at two levels.
If either of these leads to the same benefits for people who are seriously ill, it is not known.
Some doctors prefer to stay with invasive mechanical ventilation when it is available because this technique limits the spread of aerosol particles, compared to the high flow nasal cannula. Serious cases are more common in older people (those over 60 years of age and, in particular, over 80 years of age).
Many developing countries do not have per capita hospital beds in sufficient quantity, which limits the capacity of the health system to deal with sudden escalation in the number of severe cases of COVID-19 enough to require hospitalization.
A study in China observed that 5% were admitted to intensive therapy units, 2.3% needed mechanical ventilation support and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30% of people in the hospital with COVID-19 were eventually taken to the ICU.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex as acute respiratory distress syndrome (SDRA) develops in COVID-19 and oxygenation becomes increasingly difficult.
Fans with pressure control mode and high PEEP level are necessary to increase oxygen delivery while minimising the risk of pulmonary and pneumothorax lesions associated with ventilation.
A high level of PEEP may not be available in older fans.
The research for potential treatments began in January 2020 and clinical tests are being carried out with various antiviral drugs.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although new medicines may take up to 2021 to be developed, several of the medicines tested have already been approved for other uses or are in an advanced stage of testing.
Antiviral medicine can be tested in people with various diseases.
WHO recommended that volunteers participate in testing for the effectiveness and safety of potential treatments. The FDA has granted temporary authorisation for plasma use of confirmed persons as treatment in cases where the person's life is serious and immediately threatened.
The clinical studies necessary to demonstrate their safety and effectiveness against the disease have not yet been conducted.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile application to deal with the outbreak of the disease.
It is requested that users report their name and ID number.
The application can detect the "near contact" using monitoring data and thus the potential risk of infection.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the app not only recommends quarantine as well as alert local health authorities. Big data analysis of cell phones, facial recognition technology, mobile telephony tracking and artificial intelligence are being used to track infected people and the people with whom they had contact in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government authorised security agencies to track data on mobile telephones of people who are allegedly with coronavirus.
The measure has been taken to strengthen the quarantine and protect people who can come into contact with infected citizens.
Even in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared aggregate data from telephone location with the German federal government agency Robert Koch Institute to investigate and prevent the transmission of the virus.
Russia has implemented the facial recognition technology to detect who's missing the quarantine.
The Italian Regional Health Commissioner Giulio Gallera said he had been informed by mobile operators that "40% of people continue to circulate anyway".
The German government ran a 48-hour hackaton at the end of the week with over 42,000 participants.
In addition, the President of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, made a global appeal for creative solutions against the spread of the coronavirus.
Individuals may experience difficulties in the quarantine, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment or fear of infection in themselves.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying: "The increase in social isolation, solidarity, medical anxiety, stress and an economic crisis are a perfect storm to harm the mental health and well-being of people."
The disease may have a slight development, with few or no symptoms, which appear to be other common diseases of the upper respiratory tract, such as refrigeration.
Light cases usually recovered within two weeks, while those with serious or critical disease can take from three to six weeks to recover.
Pregnant women may have a higher risk of serious COVID-19 infection, according to data from other similar viruses such as SARS and MERS, but lack data from COVID-19. In some people, COVID-19 can affect the lungs, causing pneumonia.
In those most severely affected, COVID-19 can progress rapidly to adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), causing respiratory failure, septic shock or multiple organ failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, coagulation disorders and damage to the heart, kidneys and liver.
Coagulation disorders, specifically the increase in prothrombin time, were described in 6% of hospitalized patients with COVID-19, while renal failure was seen in 4% of this group.
Approximately 20-30% of people with COVID-19 have high liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the median between the onset of symptoms and death was ten days, with five hospitalization.
However, patients transferred to an ICU had a median of seven days between hospitalization and death.
In a study with early cases, the median of the onset of symptoms until death was 14 days, with a total range of six to 41 days.
In a study by the National Health Commission (NHC) of China, men had a mortality rate of 2.8%, while women had a mortality rate of 1.7%.
Histopathological examinations of post-pulmonary death samples show diffuse alveolar damage with exudated cellular fibromyxoids in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic alterations were observed in the pneumocytes.
The lung image examination appeared to be acute respiratory discomfort syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of the deaths reported by the National Health Commission of China, heart damage was detected due to high levels of troponin or cardiac arrest.
According to March data in the United States, 89% of the hospitalized had pre-existing comorbidities. The availability of medical resources and socio-economic factors in a region may also affect mortality.
Mortality by comorbidity estimates vary due to these regional differences, but also due to methodological difficulties.
Sub-notification of mild cases may result in overestimated mortality rates.
However, the fact that death is the result of cases committed in the past may mean that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to have severe symptoms of COVID-19 and approximately 2.4 times more likely to require intensive treatment or to die, compared with non-smokers.
Hong Kong's hospital authority found a 20% to 30% decrease in lung capacity in some people who recovered from the disease, and pulmonary examinations indicated organ damage.
This can also lead to intensive post-care syndrome after recovery.
Until March 2020, it was not known whether past infections gave effective and lasting immunity to people who recovered from the disease.
Immunity is seen as likely, based on the behavior of other coronaviruses, but cases were reported where the recovery of COVID-19 was followed by positive tests for coronavirus on a later date.
It is believed that these cases are the worst of a prolonged infection rather than a reinfection.
It is believed that the virus is natural and has animal origin by means of transshipment infection.
The real origin is unknown, but from December 2019, the spread of the infection has become almost entirely driven by human transmission to humans.
A study with the 41 first confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, revealed that the earliest date of onset of symptoms was 1 December 2019.
Official WHO publications reported the earliest date of symptoms as of December 8, 2019.
Several measures are commonly used to quantify mortality.
These numbers vary by region and over time and are influenced by the volume of tests, quality of the health system, treatment options, time spent from the start and population characteristics such as age, sex and health in general.
At the end of 2019, WHO assigned emergency CID-10 codes U07.1 for SARS-CoV-2 confirmed in the laboratory and U07.2 for COVID-19 confirmed deaths with clinical or epidemiological diagnosis, without SARS-CoV-2 confirmed in the laboratory. The mortality rate reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed within a given time period.
Based on statistics from the University of Johns Hopkins, the overall mortality rate was 6.9% (153.822/2.240.191) on 17 April 2020.
The number varies by region. Other measures include the rate of mortality per case (CFR), which reflects the percentage of individuals diagnosed to die of a disease, and the rate of mortality per infection (IFR), which reflects the percentage of individuals infected (diagnosed and not diagnosed) who die of a disease.
These statistics are not limited to time and follow a specific population from infection to case resolution.
Although not all infected people develop antibodies, the presence of antibodies may provide information on how many people have been infected.
In the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small population of 4,600, 80 (1.7%) have already died.
In Gangelt, the disease was spread by Carnival festivals and spread among younger people, causing relatively lower mortality, and not all deaths by COVID-19 should have been formally registered as such.
Moreover, the German health system was not overloaded.
In the Netherlands, about 3% may have antibodies, as verified in blood donors.
69 (0.004% of the population) had death by COVID-19 confirmed.
The impact of the pandemic and its mortality rate are different for men and women.
Mortality is greater in men in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The greatest risk for men is in the 50s, with the difference between men and women approaching only at 90.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 per cent for men and 1.7 per cent for women.
The exact reasons for the gender difference are not known, but genetic and behavioral factors may be the reason.
Immunological differences due to sex, lower prevalence of smoking women and development by men of comorbidities as hypertension at a lower age than women may have contributed to greater mortality among men.
In Europe, 57% of infected individuals were men, and 72% of those killed by COVID-19 were men.
By April 2020, the U.S. government was not tracking data on sex-related COVID-19 infections.
Research has shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.
A higher percentage of health workers, mainly nurses, are women, and they are more likely to be exposed to the virus.
On 11 February 2020, the World Health Organization announced that the official name of the disease was "COVID-19".
WHO head Tedros Adhanon Ghebreyesus explained that "CO" is "coron", "VI", "virus", "D", disease, and "19" is from when the outbreak was identified: December 31, 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid references to a specific geographical location (e.g. China), animal species or group of persons, in accordance with international recommendations for nomenclatureing to prevent stigmatizations. The virus caused by COVID-19 was called acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO also uses "COVID-19 virus" and "COVID-19 virus" in public communications.
Both the disease and the virus are commonly called coronavirus.
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and the disease were commonly called "coronavirus" and "coronavirus of Wuhan".
In January 2020, WHO recommended "2019-nCov" and "acute respiratory disease for 2019-nCOV" as interim names for the virus and disease, according to the 2015 orientation against the use of sites in names of diseases and viruses.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were published on 11 February 2020.
Due to capacity limitations in the standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers are printing health material, such as nasopharyngeal zaragotas and breathing parts.
In one example, when an Italian hospital urgently needed a respiratory valve, and the supplier was unable to deliver the necessary time schedule, a local startup did reverse engineering and printed the 100 necessary valves from one day to the other.
After the initial outbreak of COVID-19, there were conspiracy theories, wrong information and misinformation about the origin, dimension, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease, which quickly spread over the Internet.
Apparently, humans are able to transmit the virus to some other animals.
The study failed to find evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks and chickens.
No medicinal product or vaccine has been approved for the treatment of the disease.
International surveys on vaccines and medicines for COVID-19 are taking place in government organizations, academic groups and industry researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization launched the "SOLIDARITY Trial" to assess the effects of treatment with four existing antiviral components with more likely efficacy.
There is no vaccine available, but several agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous work on SARS-CoV is being used because both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use the ACE2 receptor to enter human cells.
There are three vaccination strategies being investigated.
First, researchers intend to develop a vaccine with the integral virus.
The use of this virus, whether it is inactive or dead, aims to cause a rapid immune response from the human body to a new COVID-19 infection.
A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitizes the immune system to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, this study focuses on the specular protein that helps the virus enter the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
A third strategy is that of nuclear acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, a new technique to create vaccines).
Experimental vaccines of any of these strategies should have tested safety and efficacy. On 16 March 2020, the first clinical test of a vaccine started with four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains an harmless genetic code copied from the virus that causes the disease. The antibody-dependent improvement was pointed out as a potential challenge for the development of a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, but this is controversial.
There are more than 300 clinical trials in progress since April 2020.
Seven tests evaluated treatments already approved for malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
The redirection of antiviral drugs consists mostly of Chinese research, with nine clinical trials in phase III of redesivir in several countries due to a report at the end of April.
A dynamic analysis of the clinical development of drug and vaccine candidates for COVID-19 was ongoing in April 2020. Various existing antiviral medicines are being evaluated for treatment of COVID-19, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir combined with interferon beta.
There is an attempt to prove the effectiveness of remedesivir since March 2020.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients treated with remdesivir for compassionate use.
Phase III clinical trials are being conducted in the United States, China and Italy. Chloroquine, already used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020, with preliminary results.
However, there are requests for joint review of the research.
Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, although recommending a daily dose of one gram, warns that the double dose is highly dangerous and can be fatal.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA published an emergency authorisation for the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine as a criterion for doctors treating people with COVID-19. The 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines also includes interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir for use against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are required to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide was recommended to be studied more in vivo after demonstrating a low inhibitory concentration of SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that the protein of the initial mirror in preparation for serum transmembrane protease 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
Studies on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have major limitations that have prevented the medical community from adopting these therapies without further studies. oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known function in the treatment of COVID-19.
The cytokine storm may be a complication in the subsequent stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have anti-cyto-tempestade properties. Tocilzumab was included in the guidelines for treatment by the National Health Commission of China after completion of a small study.
An unrandomized test is taking place at national level 2 in Italy, after having demonstrated positive results in people with severe disease.
Combined with a serum ferritin blood test to identify cytokine storms, it is expected to neutralize these developments, which are considered due to the death of some affected people.
Interleucin-6 receptor antagonist was approved by the FDA based on retrospective case studies on the treatment of refractory cytokines release syndrome to steroids induced by a different cause, CAR T cell therapy in 2017.
So far, there is no controlled and randomized evidence that tocilzumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
The transfer of purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune system of those who recovered from COVID-19 to people who need them is being investigated as a non-vacinal method of passive immunization.
This strategy was tested for SARS, with inconclusive results.
Viral neutralization is the expected mechanism of action by which passive antibody therapy can mediate a defense against SARS-CoV-2.
Other mechanisms, however, such as antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis, may be possible.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy, for example, using monoclonal antibodies manufactured, are developing.
Convalescent serum production, which consists of the liquid portion of the blood of recovered patients and contains specific antibodies to this virus, could be increased for faster implementation.
Coronavirus disease, a group of highly related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital, who later contracted and died of COVID-19 after becoming aware of the spread of the virus.
